From a human child reared in the jungle by animals to a domesticated animal who saves his people, the book brings both joy and understanding.

They are a wonderful read for children and are very useful in helping to expand a child's imagination."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book (Companion Library)","review":"The Kindle Version:The Jungle BookDoes not include illustrations. If you haven't read this book before you will get confused with the setup of the book on the kindle, especially when you go from chapter to chapter, for example: the author starts the second chapter \\"Hunting-Song of the Seeonee Pack\\" with a poem, the title of the chapter is inserted as though it were part of the story in the first chapter and the poem is formatted like a text without commas or dashes to separate lines.The Story: I re-read this book after about 10 years and was pretty disappointed. The story really wasn't that well written. I feel like the story was very jumpy and did not flow from one idea, sentence or chapter very well. It's interesting to read in comparison to the fluffy Disney adaptation but that is really all I found this useful for. I appreciate that the author continually noted man's follies through the book by making Mowgli extremely hard headed and naive through his youth while commenting on the childish nature of humans in general. If this book was intended as a child's tale when it was written I think it is now out of it's era and the disney version is more up to par. This book may be good for a teen but may be too adult for anyone under 10, both linguistically and thematically. I find as a more advanced reader it is just not what I am looking for in a good book."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book (Companion Library)","review":"Its amazing to get many classic stories for free and getting them through amazon and reading them on your kindle is not only easy, its easy to read and the way things are going to go.

It was so much fun to read as I have now seen the DVD a million times, thanks to my daughter."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book (Companion Library)","review":"\\"The Jungle Book\\" is a collection of stories (or fables) and songs/poems by Rudyard Kipling, and was originally published in 1894. The book consists of 7 short stories, separated by seven poems. The first three stories involve Mowgli, but the other four stories are not part of that series, nor do they all take place in the same jungle or any jungle at all. What these stories do have in common is the anthropomorphizing of animals as characters in these stories. As with all fables, these stories impart a moral message to the reader.\\"Mowgli's Brothers\\" is the first story in the book and was originally published in January of 1894 in \\"St. Nicholas Magazine\\". The story is about Mowgli being adopted by the wolf family which then raises him. With Shere Khan hunting in their area of the jungle, the Father Wolf (Akela) and the mother (Raksha) find and take in a human baby. At the wolf council, Baloo speaks for the cub, and Bagheera buys his life with a fresh kill. As time passes, Shere Khan turns most of the wolves against Mowgli, and they plot to overthrow Akela as the leader. Mowgli is then sent away from the wolves, vowing to return with Shere Khan's hide. This story is followed by the \\"Hunting-Song of the Seeonee Pack\\".\\"Kaa's Hunting\\" is a short study from March-April of 1894. It takes place sometime during the period covered in \\"Mowgli's Brothers\\", though it isn't mentioned in that story. It is a story about Mowgli's abduction by monkees, a.k.a the Bandar-log. Baloo and Bagheera, rescue Mowgli with the aid of Kaa. This story is followed by the \\"Road Song of the Bandar-Log\\".\\"Tiger! Tiger!\\" was a short story published in February of 1894 in magazines before being published in this collection. This covers the confrontation between Mowgli and Shere Khan. Mowgli has been kicked out of the jungle and has been adopted by a couple who believe he is Nathoo, the child that they lost. Mowgli tries to fit in, but he alienates himself from the others because he doesn't accept their misconceptions about the jungle. Shere Khan returns and is plotting to kill Mowgli, but he is warned by one of his wolf friends (Grey Brother) whom he goes to visit regularly. Mowgli comes up with a plan to kill Shere Khan, but when successful he gets into an argument with Buldeo, the hunger. Buldeo tries to take Shere Khan's skin, but Mowgli refuses to give it to him, so Buldeo turns the entire village against him and Mowgli finds himself an outcast of both the jungle and the village. This story is followed by \\"Mowgli's Song\\".\\"The White Seal\\" is a short story published in August of 1893. The story is about Kotick, a rare white-furred seal who spends his life searching for a home where seals will not be hunted by humans. He is isolated from the other seals by his goal, but he finally discovers a place that the Sea Cows know which is free from man. This story is followed by \\"Lukannon\\".\\"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi\\" is a story from November of 1893. In this story an English family save a young mongoose (Rikki Tikki) who becomes their pet. Rikki Tikki first saves the families young boy Teddy from a dust brown snakeling. Rikki Tikki takes to patrolling the house while the family sleeps, and it is during this that he is warned by Chuchundra that there are two cobras (Nag and Nagaina) that are planning to kill the family. Rikki Tikki first takes on Nag, waking the father who kills Nag. Nagaina then swears vengeance, but Rikki Tikki gets help from Darzee (a tailor bird) and locates Nagainaj's nest and then uses the eggs to distract Nagaina to save Teddy again. This story is followed by \\"Darzee's Chant\\".\\"Toomai of the Elephants\\" is a short story from the December of 1893. In this story little Toomai is told that he cannot be an elephant handler unless he sees the dance of the elephants. When the great elephant Kala Nag hears the call of the elephant from far off in the jungle, he goes to find the elephants, taking little Toomai with him. This story is followed y \\"Shiv and the Grasshopper\\".\\"Her Majesty's Servants\\" was originally published in March of 1894. This story is about the various animals used to support Her Majesty's armed forces in India. The animals discuss their roles in the army, each taking pride in the function they perform. This is followed by \\"Parade-Song of the Camp Animals\\" which closes out the book.This is a good collection of short stories, though there is a definite variability in the quality, and of course they don't all take place in the jungle. Rudyard Kipling wrote poems, short stories, and novels. Having lived in India, England, and the United States, and also spent a fair amount of time in South Africa. He drew on the rich cultural history that he enjoyed to create some wonderful tales. He remains one of the best known writers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. \\"The Jungle Book\\" is one of his best known works, though most know it through films which do not accurately represent the stories within. It blends his short fiction with some of his poems, but I find it a bit too uneven to give it five-stars."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book (Companion Library)","review":"This is the book to get-- Kipling's original. It's got the Mowgli stories, Rikki Tikki and more. It's light on illustrations but you can find supplementary illustrations online. This edition is small, complete, and highly portable."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book (Companion Library)","review":"I can't begin to count how many times I've read this book from one end to the other--still less the times I've dipped in just to reread a favorite tale over. It may be Kipling's defining juvenile book, in part because it's written for a slightly older audience thanJust So Stories, with more violence and a more mature level of language (the Mowgli stories particularly feature dialogue written in \\"the vernacular,\\" a rather formal kind of speech used by native speakers in India).Most of the 15 stories are set in the Subcontinet, where Kipling was born and to which he returned as a man; the rest (\\"The White Seal,\\" \\"Quiquern\\") take place in the Far North. Eight feature Mowgli (Hindi for \\"frog\\"), a gypsy child whose parents were frightened off by Shere Khan, the lame tiger, leaving him to be rescued and adopted by a pair of wolves. He is raised in the jungle (\\"Mowgli's Brothers,\\" \\"Kaa's Hunting,\\" \\"How Fear Came\\"), learning its laws and speaking the languages of its creatures, until at the age of 10 he is caught up in a sort of palace coup engineered by the tiger and forced to leave his pack. He stays among humans for four months, kills Shere Khan (\\"Tiger! Tiger!\\"), is driven out by the villagers and ultimately pays them back in spades (\\"Letting in the Jungle\\"), then returns to the wolves, has various further adventures (\\"The King's Ankus\\"), and ultimately saves the pack from invading dholes (\\"Red Dog\\") before his human instincts at last him force him back to his own kind (\\"The Spring Running,\\" which invaribaly makes me tear up). (If you want to find out what happened to him afterward, read \\"In the Rukh,\\" which can be found inMany Inventions..) Featuring such creatures as Mother and Father Wolf, Gray Brother (the oldest of their pups), Baghera the Black Panther, Baloo the brown bear, Kaa the Rock Python, Hathi the elephant, Chil the kite, and Akela, the Lone Wolf who leads Mowgli's pack for years, these stories are about as far from the Disney version as anything you can imagine, and to my mind far superior. (I wish some studio would take them up as Harry Potter was, and do them accurately: the animatronics and CGI that gave us such caracters as the ice-bears inThe Golden Compass (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition)and the farm animals inMist: The Tale of a Sheepdog PuppyandBabe (Widescreen Special Edition)would bring them to life as never before.)\\"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi\\" tells the story of a young mongoose taken into a human home and how he fights a pair of cobras in the garden. \\"Toomai of the Elephants\\" features Little Toomai, whose forebears for three generations have been the mahouts of Kala Nag, the great work elephant, and how his friendship with the pachyderm leads him to see \\"the sight that never man saw,\\" the elephants' dance. \\"The Miracle of Purun Baghat\\" is about a high-ranking native official who forsakes position and honors to become a mendicant holy man, and how he saves a tiny hill village from a catastrophic landslide. In \\"The Undertakers,\\" a man-eating crocodile, a jackal, and an adjutant-stork discuss the vagaries of humanity on a sandbar. \\"Her Majesty's Servants,\\" a story particularly suitable for reading in a multicultural society like that of the U.S., eavesdrops on the conversation between a troop-horse, two mules, a baggage-camel, and a pair of gun-bullocks on the night before a great troop review. In \\"The White Seal,\\" Kotick, a fur-seal born snow-white, sets out on a quest to find a place where his kind will be safe from human fur-hunters. \\"Quiquern\\" tells of a young Inuit hunter and how he and his dog save his people in a time of starvation.These stories should probably be read aloud first, since their rather formal language will make them difficult for the younger independent reader to follow, particularly in these days of dumbed-down readers (although the homeschooled may not have as much trouble). Kids of 11 or 12 should be able to read them alone. Despite Kipling's occasional imperialistic chauvinism (hardly unique to him in that time and place), he had a real knowledge of India, its creatures, and its people, and he loved them all, with an intensity that comes through in every tale; and his language, as well as his characters', often approaches the poetic (he was, after all, a noted and prolific poet aswell as a fictioneer). No English-speaking child should reach his teens without coming to know the book."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book (Companion Library)","review":"This is a classic tale of course, the thing I like about this copy is the quality for the price.

Baloo is not a lazy idiot, Kaa is not a bad guy, SherKahn is killed rather then run off, the wolves are not always the noble good guys... this is VERY different then our cotton candy Disney film. And so much more enjoyable for it.Also included are the tales of Rikki Tikki Tavi, the Elephant Dance, and the White Seal. I would have to say that my favorite is Rikki Tikki Tavi, he's just so loveable and wonderful. There is a sense of magic in Kiplings animals, every reader will find themselves dreaming of being raised by wolves and taught the law of the jungle by Baloo.I know that this was written as a children's book - but I have a hard time believing that my 11 year old son would be able to read and enjoy it, the beauty of the language will be lost on many of the younger readers who are used to the forward speaking newer YA books.

The stories are a wonderful length for read alouds. The Jungle Book is, of course, a classic and not in need of a review; however, if your only exposure to the Jungle Book is Disney, please give this a try. I wanted to commend Sterling Publishers on making a quality, affordable edition of this and other classics. The paper quality was nice, not thin or translucent. The font is also pleasant--not to small or cramped. I know this may seem faint praise, but so many classics collections are very poorly executed. The price is also very agreeable--only slightly more than a paperback."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book (Companion Library)","review":"My favorite books from childhood have always been Milne's \\"The World of Pooh\\" and Kipling's \\"The Jungle Book\\". Over the years I have purchased many copies of each as presents. Both can be difficult to find in versions unaltered from the original. I have found this to be particularly true in the case of The Jungle Book. Some folks just don't seem to get that Kipling had a pretty good handle on what he was doing. One does not tamper with a Masterpiece.This version is the real thing. It reads word for word the same as the tattered, 40-year-old copy that I first read when I was eight years old. Add illustrations by Robert Ingpen that faithfully capture the emotion of the story and you have a real winner. For those who appreciate The Jungle Book as it was BEFORE it was adulterated by Mr. Disney and friends, this is a very worthy effort."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book (Companion Library)","review":"I bought this book to read with my 9 year-old son. We have the Disney books and movies at home but since he is an avid reader and I love Rudyard Kipling I thought it was time to find him the real deal and this book is it. I like everything about it, the font type, the illustrations, and the writing is, well... Rudyard Kipling. Beautiful, rich, provocative language that unleashes a child's imagination. My son and I devoured it in a few nights and after we were done it led to a really deep discussion on the differences with the Disney's version. It was a welcomed reminder that we can understimate both our children's capacity to digest the classics and their appeal to them."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book (Companion Library)","review":"This is undoubtedly a beautiful book, but it should definitely be noted that it only contains the first half of Mowgli's story (i.e., through Shere Khan chapter only) - the text seems unabridged that far, but parts of both Jungle Books are missing - which I for one was misled about from other review(s)."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book (Companion Library)","review":"Legends are made from legends. Rudyard Kipling dug deep into the tales of the jungle from his years living in India, and drew from them the kinds of stories that live forever.\\"The Jungle Book\\" is more than how Mowgli, the man cub, learns to live and survive amongst enemies like Shere Khan. The intense mongoose vs cobra \\"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi,\\" also well-known, is here, as are several lesser-known and unrelated adventures.Richly written, with details and contexts unfamiliar to Western readers, \\"The Jungle Book\\" lifts imagination and language beautifully. Poetic, and written in a literary style, it shines above most modern prose.This is the stuff of afternoon stories read to older boys and girls. Young teens will while away rainy evenings, unwilling to part until finished. Sometimes scary and always exciting, Kipling also uses the book to teach lessons much greater than a jungle in India.When chapters were first read to me many years ago, I listened gawk-eyed, listening intently for as long as my mother would read. I read it with different eyes now, but no less a young boy as I worry how Baloo will handle the Bandar-Log monkeys.It isn't perfect. A few scientific details are fudged (wolf pack breeding structure, for example), but nothing that matters in the big picture. Kipling will have you in the palm of his hand, even though it was first published over 100 years ago.May \\"The Jungle Book\\" by Rudyard Kipling be as amazing to you as it has been to me.--Brockeim"},{"Title":"The Jungle Book (Companion Library)","review":"I own several titles in the Calla Editions' series of books, i.e.East of the Sun and West of the Moon: Old Tales from the North (Calla Editions),Tales of Mystery and Imagination (Calla Editions),Stories from Hans Christian Andersen (Calla Editions), andThe Knave of Hearts (Calla Editions). They are all of superior quality in terms of binding, paper, as well as illustrations. The book is larger than a regular hardcover, and this particular title \\"The Jungle Book\\" weighs about two pounds. This 2010 Calla edition is a republication of the edition originally published by Macmillan and Co. in 1908. The paper is of heavy stock, one can literally feel the heft of each page! The color of the paper is ivory (or something close to it), and it is bound in pearl linen. The font used is Kennerley Old Style and Michelangelo, and apart from decorative borders on the pages, the highlight of this book is the 16 color plates, some in two-page spreads by twin brother artists Edward and Maurice Detmold.According to the information provided within the book, these illustrations are \\"reproduced from an extremely scarce, original portfolio of watercolors, and have never before appeared on this scale in book form.\\" I believe it! They are truly beautiful and exquisite, and incredibly detailed, almost life-like. There is one illustration featuring an unclothed Mowgli standing alongside the Lone Wolf, and the rich earthy tones in the picture are brilliantly depicted. There's another illustration (two-page spread) titled The \\"Council Rock\\" which has a magnificent Bagheera and I swear the glint in his eye appears very real!The depiction of Kaa the Python is also stunning.

He did ask me why Mowgli uses thee and thouand wouldst while talking with the animals, butaccepted my explanation without demur.Reminds me of the lines from an Elinor Wylie poem\\"Our mutable tongue is like the seaCurled wave and shattering thunder-fit;Dangle in strings of sand shall heWho smooths the ripples out of it.\\"Say it out loud, and feel what it does to yourmouth and face - that's what Kipling's prosedoes."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book (Companion Library)","review":"This collection is probably the single best starting place for reading Kipling, especially for younger or teen readers (though the very youngest would probably enjoy his _Just So Stories_ more). These stories are great reads, enjoyable by all ages.Fans of the movie will find a more complex work here -- not \\"darker,\\" but more ambiguous; the three stories from this collection that have generally been adapted into other media, and that most readers think of when they think of \\"The Jungle Book\\", focus on outcast human infant, Mowgli, who is abandoned as an infant in the jungle and raised by wolves, and primarily tell the story of his search for a \\"place\\" within the wolf pack, the Jungle, and the human world, and his outsider status in all three realms. Perhaps because they focus almost entirely on the Indian jungle, or perhaps because they're aimed at children, these stories are also largely free of the undertone (overtone?) of imperialism that runs through much of Kipling's work for adults.It has, of course, been massively influential on later writers, from Edgar Rice Burrough's _Tarzan_ to Neil Gaiman's _The Graveyard Book_. The various morals contained within the \\"Mowgli\\" stories were also taken as a motivational book within the Scouting movement (reading this helped me understand why I had to memorize \\"Akela\\" when I was a cub scout).While only three stories in this collection focus on Mowgli, Kipling did write a second collection, \\"The Second Jungle Book,\\" which is almost entirely comprised of Mowgli stories, and which I would highly recommend if you like these tales. If you want to read more of Kipling's work for adults, I'd recommend either \\"The Man Who Would be King\\" or the short story collection \\"Plain Tales from the Hills,\\" both of which should be available for free online.As to formatting of this kindle edition: there are blocks of Kipling's poetry in between the stories, some of which was difficult to read as the formatting had not carried over well to this Kindle edition. Not a critical issue, but Kipling's poetry is excellent and the formatting errors were annoying."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book (Companion Library)","review":"I evaluated three series of abridged/paraphrased classics: Great Illustrated Classics, Stepping Stones, and Classic Starts. I specifically read Treasure Island in all three versions, but also evaluated the Jungle Book and other stories in at least two of the versions.The Classic Starts version of the Jungle Book and other stories is the most complex in language and sentence structure. It's not as easy for a beginning reader to read as Stepping Stones or Great Illustrated Classics, but offers a much better story by virtue of more adjectives, adverbs and clauses in the sentence structure.With these paraphrased versions, there is always the dilemma one faces: whether to wait until the genuine, original story is accessible or risk turning the reader off with a poor paraphrase that lacks the vibrancy of the real thing, but possibly gain the enjoyment of a classic gem much earlier than the original text would afford. In the case of the Jungle Book in particular, you also have the movie. I imagine it would be hard to follow the real story after the movie. I'm glad my kids will have heard Kiplings version before Disney's.Personally, I bought the books intending to read to my kingergarten age children, rather than have them read. We found the Classic Starts to have by far the best versions of the stories, notwithstanding the originals which are just too long for us, in language that is hard to be understood. Since I am reading them aloud, we've forgone the simplest versions which are perhaps a bit too butchered to really stand out as the excellent stories the originals gained a reputation for. I feel that the Classic Starts are rich enough that they easily match original versions of simpler tales like The Little House on the Prarie or Charlotte's Web.So far, with the children, we finished Call of the Wild, are half-way through the Jungle Book, and started Treasure Island. Then we're on to The Odyssey, Moby Dick and Tom Sawyer. Move over Pippi Longstockings and Amelia Bedelia! Previously we've read books like those of Beverly Cleary, the Little House series, Milne's Pooh, and Horrible Harry, besides hundreds of basically picture books (think Virginia Lee Burton, H. A. Rey etc.) The classics have a little bolder story lines, and these abridged series make them more accessible."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book (Companion Library)","review":"Legends are made from legends. Rudyard Kipling dug deep into the tales of the jungle from his years living in India, and drew from them the kinds of stories that live forever.\\"The Jungle Book\\" is more than how Mowgli, the man cub, learns to live and survive amongst enemies like Shere Khan. The intense mongoose vs cobra \\"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi,\\" also well-known, is here, as are several lesser-known and unrelated adventures.Richly written, with details and contexts unfamiliar to Western readers, \\"The Jungle Book\\" lifts imagination and language beautifully. Poetic, and written in a literary style, it shines above most modern prose.This is the stuff of afternoon stories read to older boys and girls. Young teens will while away rainy evenings, unwilling to part until finished. Sometimes scary and always exciting, Kipling also uses the book to teach lessons much greater than a jungle in India.When chapters were first read to me many years ago, I listened gawk-eyed, listening intently for as long as my mother would read. I read it with different eyes now, but no less a young boy as I worry how Baloo will handle the Bandar-Log monkeys.It isn't perfect. A few scientific details are fudged (wolf pack breeding structure, for example), but nothing that matters in the big picture. Kipling will have you in the palm of his hand, even though it was first published over 100 years ago.May \\"The Jungle Book\\" by Rudyard Kipling be as amazing to you as it has been to me.--Brockeim"},{"Title":"The Jungle Book (Companion Library)","review":"The Jungle Book is now one of my all time favorite books. When you read the book it makes you feel like you're there too. I like the way Rudyard Kipling has the animals talk. The main character in the story is a boy named Mowgli. Mowgli was abandoned by his mother and father and raised by wolves. I thinkMowgli is the perfect character for the story because he is brave, smart, and kind.The part I disliked the most in the story is when they keep going to the council rock. I thought it was boring. I liked the excitement in the book and the cliff hangers. Once I picked up the book I couldn't set it down again. I definitely recommend this book to anybody who is in for a challenge!"},{"Title":"The Jungle Book (Companion Library)","review":"kipling is great of course, but part of the story is missing, the chapters run together, and there is no table of contents"},{"Title":"The Jungle Book (Companion Library)","review":"Since he wrote these stories during the several years he spent in Brattleboro, VT, we of the North Country have a particular affinity for Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Books. The most familiar are the Mowgli tales, basis for the very good Disney movie. Mowgli is an Indian infant who is lost in the jungle after Shere Khan (the tiger) kills his family. Bagheera (the black panther) places him with a wolf family that has a newborn litter. Mowgli's new &quot;parents&quot; and Bagheera and Baloo (the brown bear) sponsor him for membership in the Wolf Pack and, much to Shere Khan's chagrin, he is admitted. Mowgli is raised according to Jungle Law, but all the while Shere Khan is plotting his revenge and ingratiating himself with the younger wolves. Eventually, he leads a rebellion against Akela, the pack's aging leader and attacks Mowgli, who beats him away with a burning firebrand. In these and the several other Mowgli stories--there are some prequels--Kipling strikes a nice balance between anthropomorphizing the animals and understanding Mowgli's natural superiority.Also appearing in this collection is a story I've loved since I first saw the Classic Cartoon version--Rikki Tikki Tavi. It tells the story of an intrepid young mongoose and his life or death battle to protect an Indian villa from a couple of particularly unpleasant cobras. Rikki Tikki Tavi has always seemed to me to be one of the great heroes in all of literature.These are great stories for young and old. For folks who worry about Kipling's potentially imperialist, racist or racialist overtones (see review), rest assured, these tales are free of such themes. They offer an excellent opportunity to introduce kids to the work of a true master storyteller.GRADE: A"},{"Title":"The Jungle Book (Companion Library)","review":"I have never seen The Jungle Book movie, I just wanted to understand a bit of what might have captured the imagination of people 100 years ago (and how they might have written stories). The Jungle Book is not a happy story about people bopping around in the jungle, it is about life and death and honour and character and discipline in a pitiless world. Because it is written in a dense style by Rudyard Kipling almost 120 years ago, it is not easy to follow, but it does tell in eight chapters and eight poems interesting tales of the deep jungle. First of all it tells the tale of Mowgli, how he's rescued from Shere Khan the tiger by Mother Wolf, and championed by Akela, and then it goes into his education, his abduction by the lawless monkey tribes, his confrontation with the Jungle council, his re-emergence into human society, and his final revenge on Shere Khan. The story continues on The Jungle Book 2, but we also have non-Mowgli stories: the amazing tale of Riki-Tiki-Tavi (which I saw once on TV as a non-Mowgli Jungle Book animation), as well as a really wonderful story of a white seal trying to save his seal-mates from perpetual exploitation and hunting from the nearby Russian communities.Some of the stories are not so great - I didn't really understand the point of \\"Toomai of the Elephants\\" or \\"Her Majesty's Servants\\", but on the whole it was a great, if somewhat incomprehensible, book."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book (Companion Library)","review":"Free is good but some quality control would have been nice.As it is, chapters and even complete stories flow over in each other without any non-literal clue."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book (Companion Library)","review":"The Jungle Book is a classic we all know, however Robert Ingpen's illustrations bring this book alive.

Kipling is a great author and after doing a report on him and reading some of his other works I recommend those as well, especially A White Man's Burden.

It is a very special addition to anyone's collection."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book (Companion Library)","review":"If your only experience with Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Book is through the Disney version put that completely out of your head. Besides the title of the book and the name and species of the animals the two have almost nothing in common. Disney took the very kernel of the story and then bled the heart and soul out of it. At least they didn't give Mowgli a cute but endearing sidekick.The Jungle Book is the story of a young Indian boy raised from infancy by the animals of the Asian jungle. The concept shares similarities with Tarzan of the Apes but preceded the Edgar Rice Burroughs classic by nearly 20 years. They differ in that Tarzan was fully an adult and not able to hold full conversations with the animals. Mowgli is capable of having sophisticated discussions with his panther friend Bagheera and bear Baloo about the laws of the Jungle. Kipling doesn't shy away from violence as this is the jungle but even the human characters see more than a few deaths. In the one scene in the Disney version that actually semi relates to the book Mowgli is kidnapped by the Bandar-log (monkeys). In the movie he's rescued by Bagheera and Baloo who bop the Monkey's and send them scampering on their way. In the book Bagheera, Baloo and Kaa the python (yes, in the book Mowgli and Kaa are good friends) slaughter the monkeys. At the end of the fight Kaa utilizes his hypnotic powers, influencing the Monkey's into walking straight into his gapping mouth. It's a rather horrifying scene and the only time where he uses this hypnotic talent.The Jungle Books is a classic that lives up to the name classic. Kipling has a wonderful poetic style that seems to be lost on today's writers. Only about half the stories concern Mowgli but almost all feature conversations between animals. These aren't technically talking animals since they cannot communicate with humans other than Mowgli but they can communicate amongst themselves. In one short story that I particularly enjoyed various domesticated animals in the British military discuss their roles, trying to promote their own importance while diminishing others. Some stories take place outside of India including several in the arctic. The Jungle Books also contains the story of Rikki-Tikki-Tavi which was animated by Chuck Jones. Kipling excels at setting moods and creating compelling dialogue. Mowgli's stories both begin and end the collection of short stories and by the end of the book I was saddened to leave his jungle home. The Jungle Books is classified as for young adults but the beauty and sophistication of the writing would keep just about any adult satisfied. Just make sure you get the actual Kipling book and not a watered down adaptation."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book (Companion Library)","review":"Rudyard Kipling's mastery of the English language is wound throughout the pages of this book.

I will."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book (Companion Library)","review":"There were some things I didn't like in the Jungle Book and that was that some people discrimanted at Mowgli because he was a human and not an animal. For example, the big elephants always didn't like Mowgli because he was a human but the little elephant always stayed his friend no matter what. I like the part that the little elephant was his friend but what about the others. His friends see whats on the inside and not what's on the outside.Also we see how the bad guy wants to get the good guy. But it's not only in Jungle Book it's always. This book shows the ignorance of people towards animals. We see how different things show new things in life. For example, you can't be plain and boring all the time, you have to try new things in life to explore. But it's not only about life but also other things.It's sad to notice that sometimes in life, people take advantage of you and in the Jungle Book that is clearly stated. You can see the love between animals and humans and that is what I think is the most important part of the book. The monkeys say thier Mowgli's friend but they aren't there when he needs them only the bear, Baloo is. And I think kids should be read this book becuase, It shows that if you try anything can be overcame. I loved this book, it was one of the most exciting and interesting books I have read in a while."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book (Companion Library)","review":"This book was many short stories in it; most of the stories are about Mowgli and a few of them are about other animals and their adventures. My favorite one was Rikki-Tikki-Tavi.Since this book is mostly about Mowgli, I should say something about it. Mowgli is a boy who was adopted by wolves and grew up to live with them all his life. He can speak their language and they love him. But Mowgli has one enemy, a lame tiger named Shere Kan. The Mother wolf had saved Mowgli from the evil tiger so Shere Kan hates him. Of course, there's a battle at the end. It is a pretty interesting story or, more like, pretty interesting stories.My favorite story, like I said before, was Rikki-Tikki-Tavi. Rikki, the mongoose who is washed out by a heavy rain and is found by a human boy named Teddy. Rikki is cared for and soon becomes healthy and fit again. One day, Rikki goes out to the large and rather uncultivated garden when he hears two birds chirping sadly. Rikki asks what had happened and one of the birds, named Darzee, tells him that one of their eggs had fallen out and was eaten by the black cobra Nag. At that moment, Nag comes out and tries to kill Rikki by making him pay attention to him while Nagfs wife, Nagaina, creeps up on Rikki. At the last moment, Rikki notices that Nagaina is behind him and he runs away.After that incident, Rikki vows to kill the two evil cobras. One day, Rikki overhears Nag and Nagaina discussing on how to kill him. They plan to break into the house, kill the humans with their deadly bite, and then, kill Rikki. Rikki quickly runs back to the house and waits till nightfall. Soon, he hears a drainpipe rattling and sees Nagfs hooded head creeping towards him with Nagaina right behind him. Rikki hides and waits till Nag comes out. When Nag turns his head towards the beds, Rikki pounces and bites Nagfs head. Rikki is nearly killed then, but the master of the house, Teddyfs father, wakes up from all the noise and shoots Nag.Nagaina, seeing all this, slinks back to her nest. While Rikki regains his strength, he finds out that Nagaina has eggs in her nest and starts searching for her with the aid of Darzeefs wife. When Rikki finds her, Darzeefs wife pretends that her wing is broken and hops around Nagaina. Nagaina moves to kill Darzeefs wife when Rikki runs from behind and takes one of the eggs away. Nagaina turns and tries to strike out at Rikki but Rikki breaks all of the eggs but keeps only one egg unbroken. Rikki threatens Nagaina to get away and Nagaina obeys him. As soon as Nagaina moved away, Rikki breaks the last of the eggs. Rikki and Nagaina battle, both finally falling into Nag and Nagainafs hole.Will Rikki win? Will he survive Nagaina's terrible strenght? If Nagaina wins and is still alive, would she marry again with another black cobra and lay eggs? You'll have to read the book to find out.....This story was sooo fun and exciting. That is mainly my reason for liking this story better than the others.

There is also an allusion to something that is dinosaur-like. So much for the dino connection...Nevertheless, I liked the book. I got interested in the characters and the relationships. The plot was interesting. I found the philosophical aspects of the book to be banal, with the typical zen emptiness infatuation, but it was tolerable and not overly annoying. I guess it fit, somewhat, but it seemed shallow and sophomoric. Of course, I may be overstating it...it's just my opinion and others may not have the same reaction.Though I suspect it was unintentional, it is humorously ironic that the web of relationships in the small town elicited a sense of being inbred and incestuous. I guess that may be an almost inevitable consequence of tiny-town life. As Stephen Stills said, love the one you're with.I hoped to see more happen with the Ten Fifteen character. His presence was almost like he was the requisite friendly freak, but it never progressed as I would have liked. He was kind of like a post-it note--there but not really within. I wanted his character to develop, not just observe. He really only experiences one major change in the story, and though funny, it was ultimately minor.I did end up caring about the characters, and the minor short-comings didn't detract from the enjoyable read this story provided. I suspect most folks won't even notice the things I mentioned, they will just appreciate the characterizations and plotting. The book kind of took a stab at a theme I could appreciate, but I found that the story overwhelmed it. I almost wish the philosophical aspect had been more deeply fleshed out, and that the big tension-building subplot had been excised. In my opinion it squelched the potential the novel had to be seminal and timeless, not to mention important. Still, I want to emphasize that the story was quite enjoyable.*** SPOILER ALERT !!!: IF YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE THE WHOLE PLOT PLOPPED ON YOUR PLATE LIKE A SPOONFUL OF MASHED POTATOES, DON'T READ TOM LARSON'S REVIEW BELOW. Larson is one of those self-congatulatory dolts who relish their own comments about a book more than the book itself. Unfortunately, his type are rife on the Amazon site. A bit of advice to such plot ploppers: take a class at the local junior college if you want to wax eloquent on the details of book plot. Just because you like the sound of your own voice doesn't mean that you ought to SPOIL the book for those looking for advice on whether to buy or read a book."},{"Title":"Slow Dancing on Dinosaur Bones","review":"The title grabbed me when I was browsing the bookstore for a good summer read -- what a great surprise this book turned out to be!

It became a real page turner.I do feel that the excitement of the book was over about 25 pages from the true end of the book.

A very enjoyable story."},{"Title":"Slow Dancing on Dinosaur Bones","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. It had terrific potential, but the characters and plot became tediously zany."},{"Title":"Slow Dancing on Dinosaur Bones","review":"One of the more worrisome notions in frenzied America these days is that we have lost the self-sufficiency of the small towns and rural byways of our collective past. Don't tell that to Lana Witt. Her debut novel is an enchanting, often outrageously funny portrait of the old home place as it is now, still miles from the Interstate, still proud of its flashing yellow light. Witt's town is Pick, Kentucky, in the Appalachian hills, population 900, which she has fertilized with an array of uncommonly group-reliant characters, each one as skillfully shaped as the next. The novel opens with the arrival of a disillusioned Tom Jett, a philosophy graduate from Stanford, who is seeking enlightenment. Tom meets Gilman Lee, an impetuous fifty-five-year-old jack-of-all-trades, whose stormy behaviors, especially with women and authority, are legendary. He also meets Gilman's buddy, Ten-Fifteen, so named for his anatomically skewed arms, and Gemma Collet, an unhappy woman with vitiligo, a skin disease that causes her to splotch with hoary white patches. To relieve her misery, Gemma often sits naked in the creek, trying to wash off what has already washed out the pigmentation of her skin. Add to this crew Rosalee Wilson, a one-time resident who left Pick for Florida and the love of a rich man, Frank Denton, who abused her and is pursuing her back to Pick so that he can kill her. The Pick characters protect themselves from what Witt calls the &quot;bad strange&quot; by nourishing the &quot;good strange&quot; in one another, that is, by playing music together, partying religiously on Saturday nights, or ducking work to go fishing whenever the mood descends. Besides Frank, the other &quot;bad strange&quot; is the Conroy Coal Company, which, also as the novel opens, is selling leases to cash-starved locals. Some residents hope that once the drilling tests are done, the locals will strike it rich with coal deposits and Pick will acquire its first McDonald's. Couple this impending sell-out of the bituminous r! emains underground with Rosalee's fate, and the plot is set. The pulse of the story beats in Gilman Lee, a middle-aged mix of Nick Adams and Huck Finn. Gilman has never settled down, never married, and is (somehow) the man those women longing for security admire most. He acts wholly by instinct, whether digging up his friend Zack and placing the skeleton in a special shed where the two can &quot;talk&quot; or plotting to destroy the coal company's inroads into Pick's peaceable kingdom. Most city people define themselves in the light of their professions. Not Pick folk, and certainly not Gilman. He lives in voluntary poverty, believing that what he does is far less important than who he is. As the story develops, Tom and Gemma absorb Gilman's naturalness, emulate his impulses with good and ill consequences. Witt emphasizes Gilman's humor and native intelligence in contrast to the demeaning commerciality of corporate coal. In Gilman's contrariness, she suggests that what we've made of our lives materially, even educationally, is often overrated, at times useless. Gemma Collet is easily the novel's most affecting character. When she finally chooses love over self-consciousness, she goes lustfully crazy, falling for both Tom and Gilman. Few passages in the novel are more exquisite to read than Gemma's first seduction. &quot;Tom inches his face toward Gemma's and rubs his nose against hers Eskimo-style. His lips saunter to the right, find her earlobe, and dally with it like puppies with a lemon drop . . . . Gemma feels as if she's been transplanted into a romance novel of the brand that Marcy reads on her lunch breaks, the kind she wraps in brown paper so no one can see the picture on the front. Words like surrender, melt, pulsate, and throb slither across Gemma's mind. It's been twelve years since she's been receptive to a kiss, and she dissipates like cotton candy left out in the rain.&quot; Lana Witt's storyteller's voice and lyricism is unmistakable. For me, closing this book brought as m! uch sad contentment for the story's end as it did a teeming desire for another Witt novel to begin. Whether the next book stays small town or leaps to the wicked city doesn't matter. I'll take either locale."},{"Title":"Slow Dancing on Dinosaur Bones","review":"Sorry, but I found this on a discount table and decided to give it a try.

You'll buy it for the Philly-centric insights into the way our forefathers lived (and sailed), and you'll keep reading it for the engaging story of honorable men and women playing hardball - by the rules. Skirting the shoals of cynicism, and occasionally succumbing to the siren song of stereotyping, Abraham reminds us that there was once a time when corporations and their employees were in it for the long haul, for better or for worse, and a paycheck wasn't merely a C-note left on the night table.

He grew up in the former Soviet Union (SU) with a French grandmother and became bi-lingual. He sought political asylum in France in 1987. Since 1990, he has written a series of highly-acclaimed novels about the (post-)communist SU.AM is a born storyteller in this and later books, covering many violent and deceitful personal dramas in the history of his birth land. The SU prevailed against the German invasion of 1941 despite great losses: a huge, multiethnic nation, enthralled by and living in fear of leader Stalin and his security organs, suffered 20m war dead and millions of widowed, orphaned, disabled and traumatized survivors.The novel's hero is much-decorated Corporal Ivan, who enlisted in 1941, lying about his age (17). AM describes his near death and rescue by his future wife. The homecoming of returning soldiers is a recurring theme in AM's future novels. The great drought of 1946 is evoked, when no relief was sent to stricken regions. Ivan's baby son dies. The distraught parents move to Borissov, a small town 100 km from Moscow, where Ivan becomes a driver, his handicapped savior/wife (three fingers missing, a piece of shrapnel constantly threatening her heart) a worker in a furniture factory. They have a daughter, Olya.Ivan's wife's sudden death during a scuffle of pushy shoppers is a turning point in his life, or the straw that broke the camel's back: he starts to drink heavily and to dissemble, come apart. More so after he finds out what his beloved Olya does for a living... AM's exposure of the dreams of communism as cruel lies in this highly-recommended debut is a prelude to other, even more powerful and much better plotted tales. Highly recommended as an introduction to a great living writer."},{"Title":"Applause First Folio of Shakespeare in Modern Type: Comedies, Histories & Tragedies (Applause First Folio Editions)","review":"A Crazy Scheme?The Applause First Folio of Shakespeare should not be confused with a facsimile of the 1623 folio published by Applause in the 1990's. In the earlier facsmile, Applause used the images fromthe Norton Facsimile without permission. W. W. Norton sued, and Applause withdrew the facsimile. In 2001 Applause published another edition of the first folio, this one being in moderntype. It's not specifically a facsimile edition, but it does present the Shakespeare's plays in the order they were presented in the 1623 folio. Though this edition is in modern type the spelling and punctuation of the first folio have been for the most part retained.In his acknowlegements Freeman thanks his publisher for persisting with such a crazy scheme. Crazy? Perhaps. Audacious? Certainly. You see, Freeman is an actor, not a textual scholar and he rejects the work of textual scholars. For example, he proposes that the punctuation marks of the folio are rhetorical signals. They are the cues for the actors. This controversial proposition has been roundly criticized by many scholars, but Freeman is undaunted. I applaud his audacity. The great value of this edition is that it retains so much of the spelling and punctuation of the 1623 folio. Finally we have an original spelling edition of most of Shakespeare's plays in print.It is important to note that this is not a complete edition of Shakespeare's writings. The narrative poems, the sonnets, the occasional poems, &quot;Pericles,&quot; and &quot;Two Noble Kinsmen&quot; are not included.It should be stated that this edition does not in every instance reproduce the spelling of the 1623 folio. Freeman's treatment of abbrivations is unsatisfactory. For example it was common practice in the 17th century to represent certain words by a special kind of abbrivation. On page lviii Freeman explains that &quot;y&quot; with an umlaut was usually short hand for &quot;you,&quot; &quot;thee,&quot; &quot;thou,&quot; &quot;thy,&quot; &quot;thine,&quot; or &quot;yours.&quot; The 1623 folio usually spells these abbrivations differently from the way Freeman describes it. The word &quot;thou&quot; could be represented by the letter &quot;y&quot; with the superscript &quot;u&quot; directly on top of it. The word &quot;that&quot; could be written with the letter &quot;y&quot; with the superscript &quot;t&quot; directly over it. The word &quot;the&quot; could be written with the letter &quot;y&quot; with the superscript &quot;e&quot; directly over it and so on. In Freeman's edition all the superscript letters are replaced by umlauts, so there is no way of telling what the superscript letter was, and hence no way of knowing what the word is. So when you come across the line &quot;Thou do'st then wrong me, as (y/with umlaut) slaughterer doth&quot; (page 441, col. 2, line 1) are you supposed to read:&quot;Thou do'st then wrong me, as thou slaughterer doth,&quot; or&quot;Thou do'st then wrong me, as thee slaughterer doth,&quot; or&quot;Thou do'st then wrong me, as that slaughterer doth&quot;?You'll have to go to a facsimile edition to find out that that the third line is the correct reading. It is also interesting to note that the word &quot;that&quot; doesn't appear in Freeman's list of what &quot;y with umlaut&quot; could stand for.The edition should be used with caution."},{"Title":"Applause First Folio of Shakespeare in Modern Type: Comedies, Histories & Tragedies (Applause First Folio Editions)","review":"If you are interested in a simple read of the Bard, any edition will do. But if you want to know what Shakespeare wanted from his actors - how he imagined (I imagine) his lines being spoken - this is the edition for you. The line endings in this edition are different from those in most editions and clearly change the meaning of the text. Captializations and punctuations are clear guides to speech. While this edition is not for everyone, anyone interested in acting Shakespeare, whether on stage or in the privacy of home, must have this edition."},{"Title":"Applause First Folio of Shakespeare in Modern Type: Comedies, Histories & Tragedies (Applause First Folio Editions)","review":"What a breakthrough!The First Folio punctuation, spelling and capitalization offers many hints for the actor, but in trying to work with photographic facsimiles one has to decipher the typography and not confuse f with s.

Period.Shakespeare wrote before spelling and punctuation were standardized. If he wrote &quot;Meee&quot; he wrote it so the actor would say it that way - think musical scores. These words are meant to be spoken out loud, and Neil Freeman brings you the Folio text so you can see Shakespeare instructions on how to speak them. A large percentage of what you see in a normal edition of Shakespeare is actually a product of an editorial decision made by some editor since Shakespeare wrote. In other words: people who think their poetic sensability is better than Shakespeare's. Neil Freeman, a founding member of the acclaimed Shakespeare &amp; Company theater in Massachusetts creates what is in essence a musical score for the actor: he uses the original Shakespeare Folio texts, spelling, punctuation, etc., but in modern typeface (so you don't have trouble reading the f's and s's and things).

Van Dine is an adventurous fictionalized biography about a dynamic twentieth-century artist. Born in 1896 in Jersey City, Peter Hunt reinvented his life and work as he matured through such experiences as serving in World War I, falling in love, and experimenting with numerous different styles and artistic talents. A fresh and vibrantly told narrative story, The Search For Peter Hunt is a very highly recommended and deftly written novel from beginning to end."},{"Title":"The Search for Peter Hunt","review":"\\"Peter Hunt was a terrible--and wonderful--liar,\\" Lynn C. Van Dine writes in The Search for Peter Hunt, the only available biography of the artist. Unfortunately, Van Dine follows Hunt's lead and presents a fictionalized version of his life story. While she is upfront about both the difficulty in documenting the details of Hunt's life, as well as her decision to write a fictionalized biography, her highly speculative approach is exasperating because it is impossible to gauge how much reality lies behind it. Although she spent years conducting research, her book, while clearly a labor of love, only scratches the surface of Hunt's story, leaving the reader hungry for more details about his life, his place within the community of Provincetown artists, and his relationships with well-known figures like the writer W. Somerset Maugham. In addition, the chapters are interleaved with \\"conversations\\" between the author and Peter Hunt's ghost, which further detract from the seriousness of the work. Van Dine is most effective in describing Hunt's method and in documenting how his style grew in popularity during the middle decades of the last century. Her book provides tantalizing hints about Hunt's personal life and his relationships with other artists, writers, and social luminaries, but the historical context is sketchy and ultimately the book merely highlights the lack of serious scholarship on this influential but overlooked artist."},{"Title":"Eight Bullets: One Woman's Story of Surviving Anti-Gay Violence","review":"This book was a heart wrenching read.

Since then I've browsed through it over the years to remember how lucky I am that I was able to read it and live an activist life full of efforts to iradicate this type of violence. It was a quick read in some ways, because I didn't want to put it down; but then in some ways, it took a while to get through because I HAD to put it down. It shook me to tears. It's an emotionally charged piece of writing that is so descriptive, that I lost all concept of space and time once I started reading. I am currently a teacher at the 12th grade level and have included Brenner's story on my course syllabus in an effort to outrage and organize a new generation of peace-mongers.

A quest for justice."},{"Title":"Eight Bullets: One Woman's Story of Surviving Anti-Gay Violence","review":"American society has the rather unfortunate tendency to shun hate crimes legislation on the grounds that it would restrict an individual's right to freedom of expression and trivialize the First Amendment. Both assertions are clearly absurd, but the nasty allegations continue. In the greatest of ironies, the &quot;pro-family&quot; &quot;pro-life&quot; relgious right will oppose this legislation because it supposedly interferes with their political activities.I challenge anybody to read this book and then still believe the lies and distortions popularized by the right wing.Hate crimes are meant to stigmatize both the indiviuals affected and the larger marginalized group of which they are members of. Supporters of hate crimes laws are not well-heeled elitists, they are (quite litterally) the most vunerable members of society who fear for their lives.Brenner describes how she and her lover were enjoying a wonderful day in the mountains when the later was gunned down by a homophobic peeping tom. Although she survived and the physical injuries eventually healed, I could tell that it was still very emotionally hard for her. I applaud her for comming forward and retelling her story in the hopes that future generations of Americans will never have to personally experience the same fate.Not supprisingly, Brenner became an anti-violence activist following this incident and has appeared before Congress urging passage of federal hate crimes measures. While her story did not recceive as much publicity as the later murder of Wyoming's Matthew Shepard, she helped personalize the face of hate crime victims.Although it was her lover who was gunned down, Brenner realized that the day after that it could be somebody else's and the ugly pattern would continue until people of all sexualities started demanding an end to anti-gay violence and taught respect for different groups."},{"Title":"Eight Bullets: One Woman's Story of Surviving Anti-Gay Violence","review":"This book will grab your interest right from the prologue as in Claudia's own words she recounts the camping trip and the horror that followed. Claudia's vernacular \\"chosen family\\" etc. will ring a bell with those in the community. I felt as if I was listening to a friend speak of a terrible tragedy.Claudia's wild trek out of the woods after the shooting, her vivid descriptions of it all made me ache..for her and Rebecca. Even though I knew the outcome I was still hoping that somehow it would be different......I didnt' feel that Claudia was emotionless at all in the telling The very fact that she could speak of it, could put down in words that unbelievable tragedy speaks of her own courage and strength.I found the book easy to read and the small breaks of the third person are actually a welcome respite from the terror.You can breathe a bit more before Claudia comes back to tell her story.This is a page turner, real people that you come to care for and pray for and hope for a different ending.I have never been camping and after reading this......I never will be!Thank you Claudia for the strength to tell your story!

There are baby animals hiding from their parents and playing a game of peek-a-boo & hide and seek. There is a kitten, a baby bear, a baby bunny, baby owl, duckling, puppies, and a baby lamb. In one of the other comments posted here someone mentioned that the new one they had purchased had some pages left out. This is very true!! For sure the kitten and baby bear are both missing from that version (four pages). After reading her comment I made sure I ordered a couple of books from different printing years. DO NOT buy the So Tall Board Book Version or any version printed in 1995 or you will definitely be missing some pages. They must have taken them out to save money (but still charged the same price).

(Collier mystery classics)","review":"I entirely agree with the other reviewers that this is a magnificent mystery. It has long been one of my favorites.I would like to comment on another point, however: the physical book. I bought this edition because my old mass-market paperback was worn. On the last page of the new book it says \\"Made in the USA[;] Lexington, KY[;] 15 January 2010.\\" The date is very close to when I ordered it, so I expect this is a \\"print to order\\" paperback. The printing is very clean and sharp, attractive and pleasing to the eye. Unfortunately, this edition contains a fair number of typos, which leads me to suspect that it was created by scanning an older edition, and that the software did not perfectly recognize the text. Or maybe the typos were in the old printed edition. They are not so frequent as to bother me, though I suppose they might bother others. I briefly kept track of them and found four in fourteen pages, to give an idea of the frequency.It seems to me that the publishers could obtain an improved edition by soliciting corrections from readers. Anyway, it is a very interesting and worthwhile application of technology, making available a printed version of a book that otherwise might well be out of print."},{"Title":"Hamlet, revenge! (Collier mystery classics)","review":"This classical suspense novel, first published in 1937 might be difficult to follow for readers who are not already familiar with Shakespeare&#65533;s &#65533;The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince Denmark.&#65533;However, it is well worth reading, not only for the richly allusive mystery, but also for the characters who create and act out its tragedy. The author engraves his brittle, upper-class English in diamond-point prose. He etches their wit with acid. They are never dull. To misquote the Bard himself, &#65533;Age cannot wither Innes&#65533;s characters, nor murder stale their witty dialogue.&#65533;For the length of the tragedy at least, the reader will inhabit the manor and precincts of Scamnum Court, principal seat of the Duke of Horton---&#65533;It is a big place: two counties away it has a sort of little brother in Blenheim Palace.&#65533;After the second murder of the evening, C.I.D. Inspector John Appleby gives the reader his impression of the place, while searching through its corridors for the Duchess of Horton:&#65533;Moving about Scamnum at night, it seemed to Appleby, was like moving in a dream through some monstrously overgrown issue of &#65533;Country Life.&#65533; Great cubes of space, disconcertingly indeterminate in function--- were they rooms or passages? ---flowed past in the half-darkness with the intermittent coherence of distant music, now composed into order and proportion, now a vague and raw material for the architectonics of the imagination&#65533;He recalled the great palaces --- now for the most part tenantless --- which the eighteenth century had seen rise, all weirdly of a piece, about Europe. Scamnum, he knew, was to be a different pattern; would reveal itself in the morning as being --- however augustly --- the home of an English gentleman and a familiar being. But now it was less a human dwelling than a dream-symbol of centuries of rule, a fantasy created from the tribute of ten thousand cottages long perished from the land.&#65533;Everything in &#65533;Hamlet, Revenge!&#65533; is done on a grand scale. The Duchess of Horton persuades her old friend, the Lord Chancellor of England to act the part of Polonius in her amateur production of &#65533;Hamlet.&#65533; Her husband is cast as Claudius, King of Denmark and she herself plays his Queen. Their daughter, Elizabeth is Ophelia. The greatest Shakespearean actor of the day plays the Melancholy Dane.All of the play&#65533;s characters are put on edge by a series of mysterious messages, culminating in a quotation from &#65533;Macbeth&#65533;, &#65533;&#65533;there shall be done a deed of dreadful note&#65533;&#65533; Then the Lord Chancellor is shot to death at the very instant in the play when his character is supposed to die by Hamlet&#65533;s sword.Appleby is called in to solve a murder that &#65533;was planned, deliberately and at obvious risk, to take place bang in the middle of a private performance of Hamlet.&#65533;The young C.I.D. Inspector is also charged with recovering vital State documents that the second-most important figure in British government had with him when he motored down to Scamnum Court to strut and fret upon the ducal stage. Until the very end of &#65533;Hamlet, Revenge!&#65533; the reader can never be sure if he or she is reading a murder mystery or a spy story.&#65533;Hamlet, Revenge!&#65533; in my opinion is one of the top ten mysteries of the last century, reaching the same rarified heights as Sayers&#65533;s &#65533;The Nine Taylors.&#65533;It is much less known to American readers, possibly because of its author&#65533;s richly allusive style. Innes was a Student of Christ Church, Oxford, from 1949 until his retirement in 1973. He was a Lecturer in English, and he did not talk down to readers of his detective fiction. Either they were familiar with the Bard, or they would miss out on half the enjoyment of &#65533;Hamlet, Revenge!&#65533;"},{"Title":"Hamlet, revenge! (Collier mystery classics)","review":"It is amazing that this book was published in 1937 because as I just finished reading it in the very early stages of 2008, I couldn't believe how complex and intelligent this book is. I think it might be rough going if a reader is not at least a little bit familiar with Shakespeare's Hamlet, but it is still worth the effort. Innes was a remarkable writer, and his Inspector Appleby was marvelous! There are more than enough red herrings and blind alleys that Innes leads you down as you read this book. The murder at the huge manor house of Scanmum is irrevocably tied up with the play Hamlet, and it's up to Appleby to determine what is fact and what is fiction. He must try and find what appears to be an obscure motive, and he is up against a particularly ruthless and intelligent killer. This is an excellent classical mystery from the very early Golden Age, and I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Hamlet, revenge! (Collier mystery classics)","review":"This is the second book in the Appleby series. Giles Gott - who featured in the first book in the series as Appleby's Dr Watson - reappears in this one as a guest of the Duke of Horton at Seammum Court. He is directing an amateur performance of Hamlet which includes the Lord Chancellor as Polonius. When the Lord Chancellor is murdered during the play enemy action is suspected and Appleby is sent with all haste to investigate the crime.With a huge cast of suspects this crime novel threatens to become completely unwieldy but fortunately the author manages to stay just on the right side of the line. This is a complex story with many twists and turns, plenty of clues and an equal number of red herrings. I enjoyed the background of the performance of Hamlet as it was interesting to renew my acquaintance with the play. Appleby as ever is an interesting character who is not afraid to admit when he has made a mistake or jumped to a conclusions.If you enjoy reading crime novels which require a bit more \`input' from the reader - pencil and paper may be necessary to keep track of who was where and when - then this series of well written novels may be for you.

The books in their original form are in fact lovingly produced, and The Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle is one of the best of an excellent lot. The simple text and richly detailed but focused illustrations harmonize beautifully with one another and align perfectly with one another. You don't have to hunt through the book to find the picture that matches the text, it's right there on the facing page. Sadly, this doesn't appear to be true with the current Kindle editions. The free Kindle version has no illustrations at all, though the text appears clean enough, and the version currently listed for $.99 has the full-color illustrations (if your e-reader supports color), which is wonderful, but they are separated from the text so you cannot look at both picture and text at the same time - an important feature for illustrated children's books. Then, too, where print editions of Beatrix Potter tales feature text so carefully laid out on the page it might be mistaken for poetry, the Kindle text (in the illustrated version) appears with all sorts of unexpected line breaks, for example between the letter \\"O\\" and \\"nce\\" in the beginning sentence \\"once upon a time. You can tell what happened - they just took a file of typeset text (with an over-sized initial cap.) and converted it to plain text without bothering to clean it up for the Kindle version. Very sad.

Although I don't want to overly idealize the past---certainly there were no lack of terrible things happening to children back then---this does at least show some of the positives of that time. There is nothing sharp or edgy or overly clever about this book, and that makes it a breath of fresh air.Also, the illustrations are just fantastic---soft and sweet and fun and full of crisp detail.

The story ends with the charming postscript reminding the reader that Lucie did return to the stile with her clean laundry as evidence of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle's existence.This is one of the more fanciful of Potter's books, and since it deals with articles of clothing that are no longer worn in Western society, it is a little harder to follow than some of her stories.

Here's a summary of an old edition:Dr. Chase was a traveling physician who compiled this book of \\"recipes and information for everybody\\" including a wide array of information and home remedies for families. At the time it was published, individual receipes to cure a sick horse or sick child were quite expensive. Dr. Chase's book of 800 recipes for health remedies, drinks, livestock cures, etc. was a bargain and a mainstay in households across the continent.Sections include:Merchant and Grocer DepartmentSaloon DepartmentMedical DepartmentTanner,Shoe, & Harness Maker DepartmentPainter DepartmentBlacksmith DepartmentTinner DepartmentGunsmith DepartmentJeweler DepartmentFarrier DepartmentCabinet-maker DepartmentBarber DepartmentBaker/Cooking DepartmentDomestic DepartmentMiscellaneous DepartmentThe information included is wildly varied and fascinating! Dr. Chase even advocates humane treatment of animals (includes illustrations for saving injured horses), instructs young people in how they can be successful, etc. etc. etc.Just a wonderful book of frontier/19th century wisdom!

It provides just enough historical information to give some insight into the artists' inspiration, but steers clear of unnecessary biographical information and opinionated fluff.Criticism? Well, yes. This book is not as thoroughly researched as the author's biographies of Elizabeth Siddal and Christina Rossetti, nor is it as lush with paintings and photographs as Marsh's &quot;Pre-Raphaelite Women&quot;. It probably a bit too in-depth to be of much interest to those readers with no familiarity with the works of the Pre-Raphaelites.

She has a delightful way of portraying the Wright Brothers' sibling, Katharine as a strong female character in a usually male-dominated milieu. The reader immediately connects with this protagonist and feels pride in the role Katharine plays in her brothers' history-making event.After seeing illustrator Jim Burke's breathtaking illustrations in his first book for young people: POETRY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE - WALT WHITMAN, I was delighted to see his work appear side by side with the great Jane Yolen. Burke has captured emotions brilliantly. His attention to detail serves to transport the reader vicariously to Katharine's neighborhood of 100 years ago. A truly budding genius."},{"Title":"My Brothers' Flying Machine (Wilbur, Orville, and Me)","review":"Such were the words of Orville Wright, the other half of the famous Wright brothers. This book is unique because it is told from the perspective of Katharine Wright, younger sister to both Orville and Wilbur, and it turns out Katharine was quite essential in the Wright brother's success. She provided moral support, managed household chores whilst the brothers toiled at their various inventions, and ran their bicycle store whilst the brothers were trying out their flying machine at Kitty Hawk. This book is a wonderful tribute to an unsung hero - the devoted sister who worked behind the scenes, providing unwavering support to her brilliant brothers.The story of the Wright brothers from Katharine's perspective is lyrically captured by author Jane Yolen in verse. The illustrations are by talented artist Jim Burke, and the paintings are beautifully rendered. The author also explains (at the end) how her work reflects actual research on the subject. It makes for an interesting and enlightening read, and it is also inspiring because it has a strong female role model in the form of Katharine Wright. In a field (aviation) where the most notable female is Amelia Earhart, this makes for a refreshing read. Recommended for ages 4-8."},{"Title":"The Tavern Knight","review":"Set during the English Civil War, this novel lacks the craftsmanship of both Sabatini's first novel and of his mature works. The setup (treachery, revenge, and an unsurprising surprise revelation) has the potential for classic Sabatini treatment, but from that point on the plot collapses. The main dramatic interest from that point on is how Sabatini will get himself out of the corner he's painted himself into. Minor spoiler warning: He doesn't. The ending, driven by coincidence (as is not uncommon in Sabatini) fails to satisfy the reader, and is completely unsatisfactory by Sabatini's later standards."},{"Title":"The Tavern Knight","review":"The Tavern Knight is a classic adventure story well written from the first to the last page.

These works have each been inspiring. However, this series for the Dangerous Old Woman tops even her prior high standards. That's hard to do! Most authors on repeat works struggle to keep up with more fresh material. I am not sure how she does so, but these are ever deeper, more hope-filled, more tuned with what I needed to hear at the deepest levels of my inner life (and perhaps I am at the age when I take them into heart more seriously and easily now too). Besides being deep, they are a delight with generous humor and great word-smithing.More than any other author I have watched, Clarissa Estes's work is definitely worth listening to directly AND reading when the book becomes available. Both media have their own special place. The audio recorded live is impromptu to some extent, woven on the spot from where her soul is connecting with the audience and tayloring the message to even greater relevancy. Having heard her unique artful story-telling coming through the audio has made reading her other written material, including Women Who Run with the Wolves, a much richer experience for me. I can almost \\"hear\\" her now when I read. But...I would not want to do without either the audio works or their companion books when available.Exploring her work yields experiences that are juicy, wise, funny and change my life whether I set out with such a serious intent or not. The value truly exceeds the price tag in my estimation, because they continue to be meaningful, sometimes more so with further repetition. The process is a bit like unsealing something that is vacuum packed -- it starts rapidly expanding in the psyche, radiating outward into several hours of thoughtful chewing beyond the actual time spent listening. When watered with a few tears here and there, it expands again (as if it has been freeze-dried) perculating deeper into my dreams and filling several days with stirring rememberances.There is no waiting around for when she is going to get to a relevant point. From beginning to end, and all points in between she holds my attention. And I must say, for me that is also hard to do, except with music ... I can't think of other spoken audio that succeeds like that for me. I normally am pressing myself to focus, fighting off distractions. Not with her works!"},{"Title":"The Dangerous Old Woman: Myths and Stories of the Wise Old Woman Archetype","review":"Our culture is fast paced.

We agree with this astonishing hypothesis, and we think that by the time you've finished this chapter, you will, too.\\"Chapter 5: All about sex from relevant evolutionary psychology findings to textbook explanations about the menstrual cycle.Chapter 6: The best essay on nutrition you'll ever read - short on elaborate dietary schemes, long on facts, leptins, and concrete science.About perspectives:Chapter 7: You're in Sunday school for a well-done overview on ecology.Chapter 8: \\"The theory of evolution is not in doubt; it is the bedrock upon which all of modern biology is based; the grand unifying theory of life, confirmed again and again by nearly every biological fact that is uncovered...Evolution by natural selection is an elegantly simple solution to the question of why life is as it is, with the added advantage of being right. But please don't look to it for ethical guidance.\\"Chapter 9: Sociobiology (more often called evolutionary psychology)...\\"even the Catholic Church has made its peace with evolution, including human evolution.\\" Barash includes occasional entertaining scientific anecdotes such as this one about the \\"Coolidge Effect.\\" The story goes that President Calvin Coolidge and his wife were separately touring a model farm.

This has been confirmed for nearly all mammals, including humans. Nothing comparable applies to female mammals, including women. More ludicrously said, \\"hogomous higgamous, men are polygamous, higgamous hogomous, girls are monogamous.\\"As Gilbert and Sullivan put it, \\"Darwinian man, though well-behaved, at best is only a monkey shaved.\\" A number of respected, well-recognized authors are listed in \\"recommended readings.\\" Without a doubt, the reader of this book will achieve greater bioliteracy. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Mammal in the Mirror: Understanding Our Place in the Natural World","review":"The Barash team builds bodies. They aren't on an exercise regime. Instead, they reveal the ancient and simple roots upon which our bodies and personalities rest. Their aim is to make you \\"bioliterate\\" - to gain the ability to understand why there is unity in all life, including ourselves. Their technique examines the mechanisms of DNA, the ubiquitous molecule that extends across the living community. The authors show how DNA's working portions, the genes, act to build organisms, from the minuscule not-quite-alive viruses to complex creatures like us. They structure their presentation into three views \\"close up, at midrange and from a distance\\". Each view is dependent on understanding the earlier picture as complexity of the organisms described increases. The Barash father-daughter pair present a highly descriptive and readable account of life's processes and why it's important to us to understand them. They stress that many of the topics reviewed here remain obscure, needing readers to continue the quest they've charted.Opening their account with a detailed examination of DNA's mechanism for making proteins, the basic process of an organism's structure and life operations. They show how understanding genes provides information on a wide variety of subjects. They examine such diverse topics as DNA \\"fingerprinting\\", growth and development and how errant patterns can result in various afflictions - such as \\"mad cow\\" disease. They move to the world of viruses, how they are built and propagate - and how the same molecule that allows virus replication to also mount defenses against them. In their discussion, they raise questions about the body's reaction to viral infection - is sneezing or coughing a mechanism these tiny organisms imparted to us in order to help them spread?From the \\"recipe for life\\" molecule of DNA, the Barashes reveal the world of the cell. Where did it come from? Why are there parts of the cell that seem to lead an almost independent existence, while operating within the cell? The authors show how cells have programmed life cycles of their own. They remind us that the cell is \\"born\\", goes through a series of steps at varying paces, then \\"dies\\". How are cells chosen to build particular parts of the body, giving us individuality while following a basic \\"standard pattern\\".? All members of a species look generally alike, yet each is an individual. These minor differences reflect how evolution has tailored life to adapt to change. They remind us that only one type of cell in the body never replicates itself. Muscle cells can shrink or enlarge, but new ones aren't made.Without doubt, the most informative chapter in the book is on the brain and nervous system. This section emphasises how many of our emotions and other behaviour traits are rooted in the mass of nerve cells within the brain and connecting to the remainder of the body. Unlike the lumpy body cell, the neurons are lengthy whip-like structures designed for rapid interaction with other neurons. Almost like the muscle cell, brain cells rarely replicate. What you attain during the first years of living and developing the brain will remain with you for life. Unlike muscle cells, the brain's neuronal net don't enlarge or contract. Instead, new information may displace or divert older data stored in the neurons. And the brain, of course, is constantly acquiring new information.Still in the \\"middle view\\", the authors examine that great mystery - sex. They explain how the mechanism of reproducing ourselves reaches back to that DNA of the early chapters. \\"Gene shuffling\\" has numerous long-term advantages to any species utilising it. This process of mixing genes from two parents provides unique individual offspring - just what natural selection needs to select from. It also contributes to the body's mechanisms for combating infection. In effect, when an egg is fertilised, part of the on-going process is to reprogramme the immune system almost from scratch. The high speed adaptability of infective agents such as viruses is countered by our individuality. It's more than just brown eyes or blue! Finally, the authors look at how the body acquires and utilises energy to keep these processes functioning. Successful energy conversion provides the framework for successful reproduction.In the final segment, the authors place the human species firmly within the panorama of all Nature. They stress the interconnectedness of all living things. The sharing of DNA is the signal that our role cannot be separated from the remainder of life. The planet runs on an \\"energy budget\\" of which we are a significant part. They describe how \\"food webs\\" are composed of \\"trophic levels\\" - in plain, but undescriptive language - the \\"food chain\\". There is, they remind us, much more to food webs than who consumes what. Energy material must be processed through cyclical steps. Interrupting those processes, such as by modifying gas content of the atmosphere or raising ambient temperatures, is dangerous to our species and others. \\"Everything Touches Everything Else\\", they remind us. The lesson is that if we don't start to understand life, we won't have it to enjoy. \\"Dare to know\\" where you fit in the natural world and understand what roles you may enjoy and which may need to avoid. [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]"},{"Title":"The Mammal in the Mirror: Understanding Our Place in the Natural World","review":"The Barash team has done an outstanding job of expanding on the basic theme put forth by Desmond Morris in his book, \\"The Naked Ape\\" which is a serious anatomical, biological, anthropological and sociological, yet humorous examination of us quirky human beings.With a sizeable quantity of shared insight, humor and wit, the Barash team has gone way beyond the traditional norms of the study of biology. This book is part biology, ecology, health and nutrition, and sociobiology and yet is an easy, flowing read.The book format was intentionally crafted for general audience appeal and does not overwhelm with too much technical jargon and yet, does not skimp on important details of biological importance. Indeed, the Barash's have met their desire to help the reader become \\"bioliterate\\" and it starts with advice on human biology education with such lines as: \\"...if you want to see a perfectly good mammal, look in the mirror\\" and, \\"Like Immanuel Kant, we can all dare to know\\". Hence, the title of this educational and entertaining book: \\"Mammal in the Mirror\\". So look in this \\"mirror\\" and know thyself!Previous reviews have done a fine job of covering the contents chapter by chapter, so I will just point out some of the many gems I found in this fine book:The Barash's proffer for our consideration, the importance of knowing something about our biology in: \\"Anyone inclined to look further, into evolutionary biology--or indeed any area of biology--cannot help being overwhelmed by the truth and beauty of the human interconnectedness to the rest of life\\". (p 280)On our continuing human dilemma of creating problems for ourselves, yet showing how unique we are as a species in our abilities to expand our awareness of biology and life itself by finding causation and answers to problems--such as the discovery of and vaccine for the smallpox disease, there is: \\"In an age of misery--much of it human-caused--the triumph over smallpox is a matter for rejoicing.\\" (p 47).[\\"Descartes is also the author of what is probably the most famous sentence in Western thought--\\"Cognito ergo sum\\": \\"I think, therefore I am\\"--which he proposed as the cornerstone of a philosophy to be founded on incontrovertible truth. (Ambrose Bierce modified this to \\"Cognito cognito ergo cognito sum\\": \\"I think I think, therefore I think I am\\"--adding that this was as close to certainty as philosophy seems likely to get.)]. (p 141-2).On human sexuality: \\"Fortunately, abstinence is not the only way of preventing reproduction. We have already discussed abortion, albeit briefly. Most people--whether pro-life or pro-choice--agree that recourse to abortion is, in a sense, an indication of failure. Far better to prevent unwanted pregnancies in the first place.\\" (p 187-8) Indeed!On matters of ecology, I found this to be a good one: [\\"If you are a poet,\\" writes Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh, \\"you will see that there is a cloud in this sheet of paper. Without a cloud, there will be no rain; without rain the trees cannot grow; and without trees, we cannot make paper.\\"...] and [If you too, can see the cloud in this sheet of paper, then maybe you are also a poet, a Zen master--or an ecologist. The cornerstone ecological concept is easy to grasp although often difficult to act upon. It is also remarkably similar to the fundamental insight of Eastern mysticism: the interconnectedness of all things.\\"](p 239)The last chapter, \\"Evolution: The Road Stretches Out\\", was the most intriguing to me in that it hits upon such matters such as biological and/or evolutionary ethics. References to such luminaries of biology as E. O. Wilson, who has expanded on and promoted sociobiology as a guideline for human relationships with all other life forms, is well covered. Indeed, ethics derived from the biological processes of life itself, seems to be a logical basis on which to found human conduct codes. In consideration of how we humans are environmentally and therefore, biologically, trashing the life-sustaining attributes of our shared ecology, a call for biologically based ethics seems to be in order.I thank and commend the Barash father/daughter team for this outstanding book!"},{"Title":"What's Cooking Soups","review":"120 soup recipes, each illustrated in color with three photos of the steps of preparation, and one large photo of each finished recipe are featured by this latest book by Carole Clements.

I do believe this book is a good resource for those entering into the ministry of being a midwife to those ready to die. I think a main focus is preparing the person for death (releasing fear and earthly issues), creating a time of peace, and encouraging the person to move out of their earthly body and towards eternal piece.

Having labored with Megory on the final edit of this book, I found that it held a very human size and scope in my imagination, and for some reason, I resisted writing a review until I had an opportunity to watch it 'work.' Recommending it to friends who were dealing with painful end-of-life transitions, and seeing the power it wielded for those grieving, I can now speak to its ability to do the 'work' for which it was created.\\"Sacred Dying\\"is not a book to help you 'figure-it-out,' or gain the kind of facile comfort that comes with glib metaphors or promises of other-worldly realms. It is a testament of stories, and ways of being and doing in the presence of those near the end of life. It will make you smile; it will make you cry; but above all, it will make you know that in your love for the dying, you can help create the sacred space that is all about life and human connection.Thomas Moore, in his introduction, remarks,\\"This is one book to keep at hand, because you can be sure that one day you will need it.\\" I can only add that on the day you need it, you can rest assured that it will do its work."},{"Title":"Sacred Dying: Creating Rituals for Embracing the End of Life","review":"Megory seeks to bring meaning to the end of life.

Unfinished business, the need to say thank you and sorry, accounts, the desire to have one chance to improve, take revenge ... The list is endless. And the need to be able to choose one's hour of departure, in the way one would like needs to be acknowledged and addressed. Megory has certainly addressed some of these needs but perhaps her being located in the Western world has left out those who live in another continent but who nevertheless will be leaving one day or another.As the Yaksha asked Yudhistir, the eldest of the five Pandavas of the Mahabharat ( in which the Bhagvadgita is found), &quot;What is the greatest miracle?&quot; The wise Yudhishtir's answer satisfied the Yaksha (but that is another story). The answer was, and is &quot;The fact that all of us are mortal and yet we believe we are immortal and spend all our lives accordingly&quot;.I wish that Megory would address the needs and customs of those who belong to other religius persuasions so that we may accordingly benefit.An excellent book indeed!"},{"Title":"Sacred Dying: Creating Rituals for Embracing the End of Life","review":"SACRED DYING offers guidelines for helping a dying person die peacefully. For example, let the patient (dying person) guide you, rather than imposing your own wishes. Focus on their needs, not your own; put off your own sorrow (you can go through that after they die, and they no longer need you).FOCUS ON THE DYING PERSON, and let it be THEIR special time--their last few days or weeks on earth deserve to be honored, as a kind of celebration of their life; let them be surrounded by love.In fact, one family sang a \\"happy birthday\\" song (even though it wasn't the person's birthday)--since there is no song for dying (and dying is a rebirth into a new life, the realm of the spirit).PEACE--LOVE--LIGHT: key words for end-of-life celebrations/rituals.Since dying is also a letting go, and saying good-bye, having family members present can aid in reconciliation and forgiveness of old grudges.Music, reading aloud from sacred scriptures or poetry the patient likes, cleaning the room and bathing the patient, all help create an atmosphere of sacred specialness. (In fact, in my own life, when I was sitting with a dying women as a Hospice volunteer [excellent preparation for when my own loved ones die, I believe], I recited the 23rd Psalm [\\"The Lord is my shepherd...he makes me lie down in green pastures,\\" etc. after I offered to recite it and the patient was open to hearing it.) Often family members gather around the sick person's bed and say, \\"Thanks for what you did for me...the trip to the ocean...\\" or whatever the two did together. It becomes a thanksgiving to the person, and for their life and what they've done. (It does help to bring in an outsider--a family friend--since the family members are usuallly too full of emotions to think of, or set up, a final celebration/ritual.Another recommendation is sitting overnight with the just-deceased person's body, a spooky, absurd, and alien idea at first to many people--but all who do it end up glad they did. It helps the living adjust to the fact that the loved one really has died. And just as important, the author feels--and I agree--it may be quite helpful and important in aiding the soul of the dead person to move on, leave earth, and go heavenward (\\"towards the Light,\\" as some people say can be helpful...this is my own experience, not necessarily mentioned in SACRED DYING).I cried when I read of the youth in San Francisco with AIDS, alone and abandoned by his family. Many of the stories brought tears to my eyes. I feel they helped me emotionally clear the air, so when a loved one dies, I well be more ready to help them leave in peace and hope, with less fear and more optimism, than otherwise would be possible.I also recommend BEYOND DEATH by Stanislav Grof (worldwide artwork depicting the soul's journey in the afterlife). And for a difficult death where psychedelic therapy (legal, safe) might help, see THE HUMAN ENCOUNTER WITH DEATH, coauthored by Grof.Also I wonder if Kenneth Ring's HEADING TOWARDS OMEGA, as well as Betty Eadie's EMBRACED BY THE LIGHT, and other near-death-experience books might inspire the susrvivors of the deceased...and help the living to better adjust to their recent loss of a loved one, giving them hope to go on living, and facilite their return to a full, abundant, and satisfying life. (Just as the departed soul in presumably enjoying in the afterlife.)Finally, one year or more after a person's death, their living relatives and friends might find Raymond Moody's book REUNIONS of some interest. (It tells of using mirrors to contact the deceased loved one, and since it was while gazing into the mirror while I was shaving that I unintentionally felt my just-deceased Grandmother was saying, \\"How light and warm it is here, compared to where you are!\\" [It was an overcast, chilly December morning in Burlington, Vermont where I was at the time], I conclude Moody's mirror method--used for thousands of years--might prove workable. [Sensing my Grandmother was reassuring...to know she was comfortable, safe, and well in a place filled with light and beauty...I imagine like an open grassy glade at the edge of a forest.])"},{"Title":"The Philosophy of Revelation: The Stone Lectures for 1908-1909 Princeton Theological Seminary","review":"This is undoubtedly one of the best books I have ever read. It contains the Stone Lectures delivered by Dr. Bavinck at Princeton Seminary in 1908 and 1909, ten years after Dr. Kuyper gave his famous \\"Lectures on Calvinism\\". Dr. Bavinck was the Professor of Theology who succeeded Kuyper at the Free University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands, and whose multi-volume \\"Reformed Dogmatics\\" is widely regarded as the premier product of systematic theology in the twentieth century of the orthodox Reformed tradition. It is interesting that his \\"Dogmatics\\" has waited so long to be translated, but thankfully it is done, and perhaps its ready availability in English will generate more interest in some of his lesser known work. I think it is also noteworthy that this book was translated, at least in part, by Dr. Geerhardus Vos of Princeton, and its publication was prepared and supervised by Vos and Warfield in the same year the lectures were finished. These two certainly kept themselves busy with their own studies and writings, so it strikes me as significant that they thought this book was important enough to see it translated and published so quickly after the lectures were delivered.In these lectures, Bavinck discusses the importance of revelation in the major fields of human investigation, including philosophy, nature, history, religion, Christianity, religious experience, culture, and the future. He shows that in each of these areas, people have in various ways attempted to reduce the explanation of the phenomena to one original, universal principle (monism). However, as long as they ignore and deny the reality of God's revelation, they must seek this original, universal principle within the world. In each case Bavinck shows that these attempts end in futility and an inability to explain and understand the diversity of phenomena, which can only be understood intelligibly on the basis of the reality of revelation from God. In this context he considers a vast number of different theories that have been advanced in these fields by various thinkers. It is interesting how often the concept of evolution, which Bavinck notes has \\"become a magic formula\\", was championed in many fields outside of biology as the cornerstone of intelligibility. The chapter on religious experience is also of paramount interest in the context of the contemporary church and its obsession with personal experience, almost always with an (at best) tenuous association with objective revelation. Those who are familiar with Van Til will readily recognize the line of thought in Bavinck leading in that direction, and will happily find this volume much easier to read and understand. I wholeheartedly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Maya in Exile: Guatemalans in Florida","review":"Good book if thats what your wanting to read, I bought this book thinking it had to do with the Caste War in the Yucatan when i was adding a bunch of books to my cart about the war.

Leighton Duff is just a man. However, something must have went wrong because the renowned solicitor is found beaten to death with his son Rhys lying barely alive right next to him. As a frustrated Rhys begins to heal under the care of nurse Hester Latterly, he is unable to speak and with his broken hands unable to write.The police are convinced that Rhys killed his father, but Hester is not. She hires Rhys a barrister, who employs investigator William Monk, Hester's lover, to uncover the truth. As Rhys faces murder charges in a courtroom, William soon finds a connection between Leighton's death, and other murders and rapes, but that does not prove whether Rhys committed patricide or not. William must continue to dig in the slums if he is to uncover the identify of the killer, who still may turn out to be his client's client.The eighth entry in the William Monk darker side of Victoria England is an interesting who-done-it because of the historical perspective that sheds light on what has historically become an age of morality. William remains an intriguing, brooding hero and the support cats is top rate. However, readers of the series may find THE SILENT CRY seem a bit stale as nothing new has been added to what has been a wonderful historical mystery series.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Silent Cry (William Monk Novels)","review":"It's 1860 and there are sections of London that are like a foreign country to the better elements of society. The deep slums are so dangerous that even the cops don't enter alone. But private inquiry agent William Monk never hesitates to go anywhere in pursuit of the truth. This time, the case involves a father and son, both beaten to a bloody pulp in an alley, but the son has survived -- barely. Who did it? There was also a series of violent rapes of part-time prostitutes, which the police don't bother to investigate, because who cares what happens to a prostitute? Are the two connected? London of a century and a half ago is both familiar and very strange, and the author does her usual good job of leading the reader through it. However, Perry has a knack both for constructing interesting mystery plots and for giving away the game, and in this one it's pretty obvious who one of the Bad Guys is almost from the moment the character is introduced. But the details -- of course -- don't come out until the trial, in which Sir Oliver Rathbone succeeds again in astonishing the courtroom.

The mystery is genuinely mysterious, the period color superb, the characters well-developed and fully realized. The nurse Hester Latterly, Monk himself, and the other returning characters are as engaging and realistic as ever, and Perry's dialogue, as always, sounds like real Victorian people having real Victorian conversations. The book is slightly flawed by some minor incononsistencies in the plot, mostly having to do with the injuries to Rhys Duff, but these are not very troubling. The picture Perry paints of Victorian London and the social issues and manners of the time would make the book worth reading even if it weren't an outstanding mystery."},{"Title":"Silent Cry (William Monk Novels)","review":"Anne Perry is one of my favorite authors and this is one of her best books. By now, I am more than ready for her hero, Inspector William Monk, to make his mind up about his feelings for Hester Latterly, an independent, non-conformist, and highly likeable nurse who challenges all of Monk's ideas of what (or whom) constitutes the &quot;perfect&quot; woman. Ms. Perry weaves this problem (for Monk anyway) throughout the story and finally provides us hopeless (hopeful?) romantics with a few sops of encouragement. All of the supporting characters are finely and wonderfully drawn (likeable or not) and the attention to detail of the historical period is unmatched. Well worth anyone's time."},{"Title":"Silent Cry (William Monk Novels)","review":"I had mixed feelings about this book. On the positive side, the Victorian atmosphere and detail are absorbing, the Cockney dialog is well-rendered, if occasionally heavy-handed (\\"D'yer want me ter say 'oo I got, an' wot 'e found?\\"), and the mystery does come to an unexpected and dramatic conclusion.However I found the investigation to be very slow-moving and implausible. A murder has occurred in a dodgy London slum, and several prostitutes have been raped in another. On the surface these crimes appear to be unrelated, but Inspector Monk comes to an \\"inescapable\\" conclusion as to what happened and the motive behind them based on, in my view, the thinnest of circumstantial evidence. I could never accept that a detective of his purported caliber would see this as a closed case. Similarly, when the book moves to the courtroom, the defense attorney -- supposedly a man of unparalleled gifts -- is stymied as to how to refute the iron-clad case against him. I would fire that attorney.Lastly, while the turmoil of Monk's halting romance with Hester and his memory loss may be a satisfying thread for readers of the ongoing series, I didn't think either of these dimensions moved far enough along to engage people who have just read this book alone.I found John M. Gray's \\"The Fiend in Human\\" to be a much more subtle and effective Victorian thriller. This one left me flat."},{"Title":"Silent Cry (William Monk Novels)","review":"The story's topical subject matter adds suspense to the already curious mystery which slowly unfolds.

The fact that I began my introduction to Monk with the eighth book in the series in no way lessened my enjoyment of THE SILENT CRY.The story begins in a cobbled alleyway on the seamier side of Victorian London with the discovery of the brutally beaten bodies of two gentlemen. It is discovered that the victims are father and son, Leighton and Rhys Duff. With the father dead and the son barely clinging to life the question is what were they doing in this seedy section of town known for drugs and prostitution.Multiple storylines abound, with Monk the amnesiac P.I. undertaking an investigation into the rape of several female sweatshop laborers while Detective John Evan delves into the crimes against the Duff men. At the same time Monks friend, nurse Hester Latterly, has been employed by the Duff family to assist Rhys in recovering from his horrific ordeal. She ably confronts the devastating destruction, both physical and mental, that has befallen her patient as she uncovers the guilty secret that has left him mute.Ms. Perry exhorts her readers to join with her characters as they explore the social evils that pervade the seamier side of Victorian London as well as the duplicity of the \\"upper-classes\\" and the application of a double standard of justice, or injustice, dispensed by the courts of the day.If you're looking for a warm nostalgic stroll down memory lane to a time of simple pleasures shared by family and friends, look elsewhere. What THE SILENT CRY gives the reader is a nitty-gritty journey into a bleak and appalling era of British history. 31/2 stars"},{"Title":"Silent Cry (William Monk Novels)","review":"One of the interesting things that Anne Perry does with her Monk novels is examine some of the morally reprehensible aspects of Victorian life that are often ignored when considering the time period in popular culture. In THE SILENT CRY Perry describes how the sexual assault of poor women was considered just another thing that happens, using Monk's disgust and anger as her way to comment on the loathsome behavior of a society that would excuse assault of the poor, but let a rich man be killed and the powers that be will become interested in finding \\"justice.\\" Monk is hired to investigate the assault of a number of factory girls who are brutally raped when trying to make extra money via prostitution. His investigations overlap Hester's nursing of a young man found brutally beaten, alongside his murdered father. Together they find the answer that is not totally surprising, but is still stunning in its resolution. While there are flaws in this mystery, it takes Hester with her experience, far too long to figure out the true nature of the crime and the nature of injuries should not have led to one character's suspicion of committing the crime.(I leave it at this, don't want to spoil anything.)

The bodies turn out to be those of a father and son who definitely do not belong in St. Giles, and one of them - that of the son, Rhys Duff - isn't quite dead, after all. So Crimean veteran nurse Hester Latterly finds herself employed by Rhys Duff's mother to care for him, as the young man's grave injuries slowly heal but his voice refuses to return. Hysterical reaction, the doctors say. But does he remember what happened? Yes, he tells Hester by nodding in the only way he can now communicate thanks to badly broken hands. He remembers. And cannot tell anyone.Former detective William Monk, now engaged in private investigations, has to sort out what happened. Why were the two Duffs in St. Giles, where respectable men go only for purposes they prefer to keep secret? Who killed the father, and tried to kill the son? Or did they fight each other?Like the other Anne Perry books I have read, this one is as much detailed historical novel as engrossing mystery. Its Victorian setting is meticulous, and in Hester Latterly Perry offers readers a heroine who seems completely believable. She also further develops William Monk's characterization in a way that makes this difficult man easier for readers to understand, if not to like.

Curtis Cate's new biography is such a work.Cate chronicles Nietzsche's life and works in \\"quantitative detail,\\" from his birth in Ro(e)cken, Germany, on Oct. 15, 1844, until his mental collapse in Turin, Italy, in Jan. 1889, and his death in Weimar on Aug. 25, 1900. One marvels at how minutely Cate narrates the year-by-year, month-by-month, and week-by-week events in Nietzsche's life.Cate describes Nietzsche's many friendships, from his early school years at Pforta, Wilhelm Pinder and Gustav Krug, and later with Paul Deussen, Carl von Gersdorff, Erwin Rohde, Franz Overbeck, Dr. Paul Ree, Malwida von Meysenbug, Heinrich Romundt, Albert Brenner, Heinrich Koselitz (Nietzsche's loyal disciple, whose musical pseudonym was \\"Peter Gast\\"), and, above all, his relationships with a beautiful and extremely intelligent 21-year-old Russian woman, Lou Salome, and with the Richard Wagner and Wagner's wife, Cosima.Over a period of three years, Nietzsche made 23 visits to Tribschen, the home of Richard and Cosima Wagner near Lucerne, Switzerland. And over the period of seven years, Nietzsche wrote close to eighty letters to Cosima, the daughter of Franz LIszt.Cate points out that Nietzsche's books are a sustained attack on metaphysical and religious beliefs. Nietzsche argued, writes Cate, that \\"the attention focused on otherworld fantasies had kept human beings from dealing in an honest, healthy way with the everyday realities that are of the most immediate concern to their well-being. . . . [His] whole philosophy was aimed at achieving a 'higher and nobler' degree of culture.\\"In a letter to his busybody sister Elisabeth, who so often, during his life and especially after his death, meddled in his affairs, Nietzsche wrote: \\"Do we in our research seek repose, peace, happiness? No, solely the Truth, even if it be exceedingly deterring and ugly. . . . Here men's ways diverge. If you wish to aspire to peace of soul and happiness, then believe; if you wish to be the disciple of the Truth, then search.\\"Against philosophical and religious \\"seriousness,\\" Nietzsche wrote, \\"I would believe only in a god who knew how to dance. Come, [with our laughter] let us kill the spirit of gravity.\\"Cate shows that Nietzsche's philosophy was profoundly personal, rising as it did out of deep existential struggles: \\"Of all that is written I like only that which one has written with one's blood. Write in blood and you will find that blood is spirit. A book that has no fire in it deserves to be burned.\\"Nietzsche argued that, because of the inexorable advances of science, which, he believed, showed the world to be ungottlich, unmoralisch, and unmenschlich (\\"non-divine,\\" \\"non-moral,\\" and \\"non-human\\"), Europe was now plunged into a grave spiritual crisis, the crisis of nihilism.In the opening pages of his posthumously published work, The Will to Power, Nietzsche wrote: \\"Nihilism stands at the door. When comes this uncanniest of all guests? . . . What does nihilism mean? That the highest values devalue themselves. The aim is lacking; 'why?' finds no answer.\\" It is a will to nothingness, in which a hopeless despair adjudicates everything to be valueless and worthless, without goal, meaning, or purpose.Nietzsche's central philosophical project was to \\"live through nihilism\\" to its bitter end and, hopefully, with the creation of new values, emerge on the other side. That he failed in this project seems evident, but never has a philosopher struggled so valiantly and courageously in wrestling with the demon of nihilism, of staring for a long time into the abyss.Cate writes, \\"Nietzsche conceived of his mission as a thinker to be that of the herald of a new 'dawn' in philosophical thinking, the prophet of a new, more honest, less visionary morality, purged and purified of a vast accretion of moral, political, social, and metaphysical prejudices and misconceptions, which had reduced the vast majority of his contemporaries to a collective condition of sheep-like stupidity.\\"Georg Brandes, a Danish professor and one of Nietzsche's early admirers (he delivered a series of lectures on Nietzsche's philosophy at the University of Copenhagen) described the German philosopher's basic stance as being \\"aristocratic radicalism.\\" Nietzsche responded with appreciation and hearty approval, saying that Brandes' _expression \\"aristocratic radicalism\\" was the \\"cleverest word\\" he had ever read about himself.Indeed, Nietzsche's elitism exalted everything that was noble, distinguished, and excelling, and derogated all forms of mediocrity, mendacity, and anti-intellectualism, including anti-Semitism (Nietzsche was an anti-anti-Semite) and the saber-rattling stupidity of a jingoistic German nationalism.At the very heart of Nietzsche's philosophy, writes Cate, is \\"resistentialism.\\" This means that \\"it is not what assists Man that strengthens and ennobles him, but, quite the contrary, what resists his slothful inclinations and prejudices.\\" His philosophy calls us grow up and become men in our thinking, rather than remaining dependent children, to reject the comfort, safety, security, and certainty of the herd and become an \\"free spirit\\" who dares to travel our own paths. \\"This is my way,\\" wrote Nietzsche; \\"where is yours? The way doesn't exist.\\"A key motif of Cate's biography is his chronicling of Nietzsche's illnesses. All of his adult life, Nietzsche was plagued by debilitating migraines that often kept him bedridden for days, by acute negative reactions to metereological changes, causing him to wear dark glasses and become a wanderer throughout Germany, Switzerland, France, and Italy in search of a climate conducive to his health. He suffered frequently from stomach upsets, nausea, fits of vomiting, and acute nervous seizures.Cate's numerous accounts of Nietzsche's struggle with ill health, scattered repeatedly across hundreds of pages, are impressive in their details, impressing on the us the long, hard struggle Nietzsche to lead the semblance of a normal life. And, although Cates only hints at the idea, one wonders if Nietzsche's \\"yea-saying,\\" affirmative philosophy and his embrace of \\"amor fati\\" (love of fate) was not a defense mechanism against the perennial threat of a spirit-crushing pessimism into which he could have fallen because of his prolonged suffering.After five weeks of giving diligent attention to Cate's masterful biography, I conclude that it will take its place alongside Walter Kaufmann's Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist as one of the best--indeed, in some respects, the best--biographies of Nietzsche available in the English language. This is a distinguished volume. I recommend it most highly.Roy E.

And then...vice versa, too much philosophy. I have always been interested in Nietzsche the man, and this book provides the reader with a good rounded view of him. Fortunately there is an extensive amount of correspondence available to provide the biographer with the essential information necessary to construct an informative picture of both Nietzsche and those who figured prominently in his life.No, Nietzsche did not live an \\"exciting\\" life, but that's never a criterion I use in choosing to read a biography. If it's thrills you want may I suggest reading the memoirs of, perhaps, a Navy Seal. When I finished this biography I felt I knew \\"Fritz\\". I became appreciative of the extreme difficulties he faced with perpetual ill health. I found the details of his friendship with the anti-Semitic composer Richard Wagner to be quite fascinating. And yes he did travel about a lot, and maybe, at times, his mobile meanderings aren't much more interesting than reading a railroad timetable. Yet these are facts of his life.Whenever Nietzsche publishes a book Mr. Cate spends five or more pages discussing the philosophy contained in the book. For a book that is not touted as an \\"intellectual\\" biography I found this to be a good balance in acquainting the reader with Nietzsche's thoughts. This smattering of philosophical interpretation helps in understanding how the Nazis distorted his views, and made him a national hero (Hitler visited Nietzsche's sister Elisabeth several times). It also provides some understanding of his falling out with Richard Wagner. I am not an academic, although I have read a trifling amount of philosophy. In my opinion the philosophical sections were presented in a lucid manner, and should pose no challenge to the reader. I am assuming, of course, that anyone picking up a biography of Nietzsche has at least some interest in philosophy. The author does drop some heavy weight words on us occasionally, and these were in the biographical material. I don't think I've ever encountered the word \\"propadeutic\\" before, and this word occurs twice in the text.I enjoyed this book very much, and am grateful for the insight into Nietzsche's life. One reviewer suggests that you read books of his thoughts instead of this biography. Well, I already have those, but they don't tell me much about the man who produced them. While Friedrich Nietzsche didn't live an exciting life he still was an extraordinary man. This biography got that message across to me."},{"Title":"Friedrich Nietzsche","review":"This book is extremely well researched and well written. The reader will come away with a rich understanding of Nietzsche's life and philosophy. Curtis Cate really did his homework on this one.About three-quarters to four-fifths of the content of the book is biographical. The remaining one-fifth to one-fourth, interspersed throughout the biography, is an examination of the primary themes of Nietzsche's philosophy.Again, I want to reiterate that the book is quite readable. The target audience appears to be people who are college educated, but not specialists in Nietzsche's philosophy."},{"Title":"Friedrich Nietzsche","review":"This is a work of great significance. One cannot understand modern and postmodern Western culture without understanding Nietzsche, and this book provides a solid foundation for such an understanding.The biography is fluently written, and although Cate carries a heavy load of exposition his clarity of style makes it easily accessible to the \\"ordinary\\" reader. It is 576 pages long. Actually this is a blessing, as Cate is a pleasure, even a delight, to read. You will want to spend some time with this outstanding book; to return to each sitting with a keen sense of interest and anticipation.Before my reading I was casually familiar with Nietzsche's philosophy, which is at core the proclamation that \\"God is Dead\\" and nihilism is becoming (has now become) the real substance of Western culture. The great cathedrals of the West are \\"museums\\" and the flock of the faithful are just \\"going through the motions.\\" If you read this biography you will confront the life and mind of the greatest narrator and critic of Western culture from the French Revolution to the present time.The daily details, thoughts and actions; the immediate concerns as well as the ultimate concerns of Friedrich Nietzsche's entire life are recorded by Curtis Cate with utmost accuracy. If Cate cannot find verifiable text it is not written here. From other less meticulous sources one may find wild rumors about Nietzsche, many malicious and many salacious. None of this rubbish is even mentioned by Cate.Early on, Nietzsche emerges as a very human and likeable person. He loves nature, walks, and is very studious. He has a goodly number of friends who share his interests in Philology, Philosophy, and classical music. As he progresses through school it becomes clear that his mind is more than just brilliant, but exceptionally brilliant. His memory and intellect are way above average. Nietzcshe may be very human, but he also very much a genius.Throughout the work Cate does a comparative exposition between the ideas of Nietzsche and those of Kant, Spinoza, Hegel, Judaism, Christianity, Aristotle, Descartes, Hume, Leibniz, Marx, Schopenhauer, Darwin, Democritus, Epicurus, Plato and Socrates and the list could go on. Cate shows how Nietzsche's concepts became formulated and differentiated as his great mind encountered the intellectual heritage of the West.In 1868 at the age of 24, \\"Fritz\\" was appointed to the Chair of Classical Philology at Basel (the youngest individual to have held this position). But he was forced to resign in 1879 due to health problems (poor eyesight, headaches, seizures) that plagued him the rest of his life. For the next ten years he was an independent philosopher, living on a small pension and traveling throughout Europe and especially the European Alps, which he loved. In addition to his critique of religion, Nietzsche probed and exposed the individual and social illusions of our age. His aphoristic style and his insights were brilliant and stunning, and are still relevant for 21st Century readers.Cate gives comprehensive coverage of the Nietzsche-Wagner friendship and falling out. This portion of the book is finely drawn, and of special interest to those interested in Wagner; unfortunately it is too complex to cover in this review. The same is true of Nietzsche's encounter with the intellectual femme fatale of the late 19th and early 20th Centuries, Lou Salome.In 1889 Fredrich Nietzsche went insane, living out his remaining years in the care of his mother and sister until his death from a heart attack in 1900. The vivid description of his last days is shocking and saddening. His devious sister collaborated with Hitler in misinterpreting some of his ideas so that they could be incorporated into Fascist ideology.Upon finishing the book one is overcome with a sense of tragic awe and bewilderment.List of Nietzsche's works which are elucidated by Cate:The Birth of Tragedy (1872)On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense (1873)The Untimely Meditations (1876)Human, All Too Human (1878; additions in 1879, 1880)The Dawn (1881)The Gay Science (1882)Thus Spoke Zarathustra (1883-1885)Beyond Good and Evil (1886)On the Genealogy of Morality (1887)The Case of Wagner (1888)Twilight of the Idols (1888)The Antichrist (1888)Ecce Homo (1888)Nietzsche contra Wagner (1888)The Will to Power (unpublished manuscripts edited and put together by his sister)"},{"Title":"Friedrich Nietzsche","review":"Curtis Cate (deceased) has been sometimes compared to Henry James. Born in 1924 in Paris, into a Bostonian upper-class family, he spent much of his life in Europe. A former boarder at Winchester College, he lived by its motto: \\"Manners maketh man\\". His love for the language of Shakespeare was no doubt strengthened by his education in Magdalen College Oxford.Cate writes with a touch of nostalgia for by-gone era, and for his protagonist. In this biography, he knows what to put in and what to leave out, and he has a feel for language -- ever so important when writing about Nietzsche. As an outsider to the suffocating exclusivity of academia, he is free to be honest (e.g. in his treatment of Lou Salom&eacute;). He is also meticulous in his handling of data and therefore compares favourably with Hayman.Little surprise that Julian Young in his recent biography of Nietzsche (2010) has helped himself generously to the paragraphs of Cate's book, not even bothering with quotation marks."},{"Title":"Friedrich Nietzsche","review":"This is a fascinating book on Nietzsche. If you know anything about his philosophy, and want to read something about his life, this book is wonderful.It gives you an insight into the man himself, and a good deal of information about his friendship with Richard Wagner. You can't help but feel a bit sorry for him, what with his headaches, bad eyes, and what seemed to be a host of psychosomatic illnesses, and wonder if he went mad due to his thoughts, venereal disease, or some other mental condition.His work is enjoyable to read even if you don't agree with him. He wrote mostly in nice witty little aphorisims and was quite amusing.I think for the most part, he was taken out of context, and his sister ruined him by connecting him with Nazi propaganda and thoughts.Alas, poor Fritz - all too human."},{"Title":"Friedrich Nietzsche","review":"The world requires no more rhapsodies concerning Nietzsche's importance to the philosophic canon. Even his detractors admit the unindelible influence his thought had on the violent and frightening 20th century. That said, most read about Nietzsche rather than dip into his own often bombastic and sometimes impenetrable works. This is too bad, because direct reading of his own words remains one of the most highly satisfying experiences in alternative and critical thinking, challenging though it is. But where does one start in exploring this now ubiquitous and often romanticized enigma? Curtis Cate's \\"Friedrich Nietzsche\\" would not represent a good starting place. Many introductions that don't carry 600-page commitments exist. In fact, this book even looks intimidating. It would probably sink the Titanic if it struck its spine. As such, this book exists for those who want details; for those who want to dig beneath the numerous surface biographies that litter today's shelves. Dedicated readers of this tome will get to know Nietzsche like never before. His friends, his family, his hopes, his travels, his diseases all come alive via a virtual jungle of 39 chapters, each very readable in a single sitting. Not only that, alongside the details of his life sit summaries of his books and of his philosophy. We discover that he gave Lou Salom&eacute; his \\"Schopenhauer as Educator\\" Untimely Meditation as an exposition of his thought. We also learn about his complicated emotional and intellectual relationship with that younger \\"free spirit.\\" That episode helped to inspire his \\"Zarathurstra.\\" Such delineations of his personal situations surround delineations of his books throughout. This puts his thought in context not only personally but also geographically. The book often reads like Italo Calvino's \\"Invisible Cities\\" in its vivid descriptions, both the author's and Nietzsche's, of the numerous cities that spawned thoughts that did eventually split the history of philosophy in two. In fact, one gets a sense that Nietzsche never had a real home, but lived largely as a vagabound (due largely to his health). Mountainous Sils-Maria figures prominently as does Turin, Genoa, Naumberg, Leipzig and Pforta. Cities and landscapes penetrate Nietzsche's work and knowledge of them adds a further dimension to his thought. All of his loved and hated cities are here as is his delicate constitution. Headaches, vomiting, dizziness and other unimaginable symptoms reoccurred sometimes daily. No one has explained these, but the theory that many were psychosomatic, particularly when he was waiting for proofs from his publisher, receives analysis here. Syphillis, the other theory behind his ailments, only appears a few times in this volume. And of course his relationship with the ultra-romantic composer Richard Wagner appears here with rich detail. Tribschen comes alive. Their eventual and inevitable fallout doesn't seem as dramatic here as in other sources. Perhaps it's often overstated? His also unexplained descent into madness gets a more cursory than detailed exposition. The final ten years of his life are compacted into the final chapter and the epilogue. But what's there remains a sad testimony to how far and completely he fell. His sister Elisabeth is the target of much editorial comment by the author (as are a few others throughout). Not to say she doesn't deserve it, but some passages don't allow the reader to draw their own conclusions. Cate simply lets us know exactly how he feels. Also, Cate at times appropriates Nietzsche's own bombastic style. Though none of this detracts from this very readable biography, they do provide for a few disorienting moments. All in all, those looking for some nitty gritty details about the life of an extremely influential philospher will have their wills sated in this boat anchor of a book. Make sure to set aside plenty of time."},{"Title":"Friedrich Nietzsche","review":"Nietzsche was perhaps the most important thinker in modern times. He understood that Western Mankind labored under a terrible burden, a burden forged by idealistic philosophy and biblical religion which substituted a world of timeless ideals for the reality in which men and women really exist. This burden had once been a boon of sorts but with the decline of religious faith and the growth of mass society it became heavier and more inhuman. Nietzsche's own experiences, his own difficult life, especically his German ethniciity, all these contributed to his unique sensibility and genius. But Curtis Cate's decision to explain Nietzsche's unsystematic philosophy through his life is a tedious mistake and failure. In almost 600 pages we suffer every physical, emotional, spiritual, and psychological onslaught faced by Nietzsche, all in the narrow and narrowminded world of German academia and Wagnerian romanticism, yet this exposure does not really do as much for our understanding as fifty pages of clear exposition of his thought would have done. Granted that Nietzsche's thought is necessarily untidy and contradictory, since it is anti-systematic and untraditional, but to expect the reader to understand it by reliving Nietzsche's life puts far too much of a burden on a writer's life. And Nietzsche's life is not really all that interesting when compared to his thought. Biography has it place -- but perhaps not so well in the discussion of a provincial professor like Nietzsche. His brain was far better than his feeble body, and his thought rose far above the petty events and puny individuals with whom he came into contact. Except for the saintly historian Jakob Burckhardt and the mystigogue of music and culture Richard Wagner, most of the people Nietzsche was condemned to know and deal with were not worth the dust on his sandalstraps. In this biography one necessarily therefore spends a lot of time with people one could well do without, like Lou Salome for example. No, biography is not the road to understanding Nietzsche."},{"Title":"Friedrich Nietzsche","review":"This is a truly boring treatment of Nietzsche but I can't really blame the author; Cate has an obvious mastery of the material and writes well. The bottom line is: Nietzsche's life was not very interesting and thus makes for a dull biography. Nietzsche's accomplishments were in his ideas. As a result, the biography resorts to dwelling on minute details of N's travels and correspondence.There is some value in the book as it helps to make connections between his personal life and the evolution of his ideas but these rewards are just not worth the effort of plowing through the book. Plus, it is not as accessible to the non-academic as the author claims it to be. The Nietzsche-neophyte will quickly become lost in the digressions into various philosophical issues.Ultimately, the fault with this book lies with its subject matter and not the author. If you're looking for context to understand N's ideas, there are better books out there. If you're interested in his philosophy, then read his actual works (and yes, I have read them all so don't go there). Biographies of boring people seem somewhat pointless...Not recommended."},{"Title":"Take Part Art","review":"This book is totally unique. It combines collaborative games, art and academic learning.

It was published by a self-publishing company, but the author is listed elsewhere on the net as an editor. If so, she didn't edit her own book.One website printed her intentions that this book not be so identifiable with lesbian writing. However, her mechanism of avoiding the main character's partner's gender by always using her name was artificial and pointed glaringly at what she was trying to hide.If you want to read this author's books, please give her feedback that she needs to be more craftsmanlike.

Spelling, punctuation, logistics, you name it- it was wrong. Every single page had errors. Even the title character Lynne went back and forth from Lynne to Lynn. Sloppy and lazy editing made it way too difficult to concentrate on anything resembling a plot.

Lynne is newly retired from the Army's Criminal Investigation Division and has survived her partner's untimelydeath. Caught between the pain of the past and an uncertainty of the future, Lynne moves to Leadville, Colorado, with the intents of open a bookstore and write travel books. Unfortunately for Lynne, the otherwise quiet town of Leadville, nestled in the clouds of the Rockies has been the site of gruesome murders. Unable to tame her curiosity and at the urging of two old town cronies, Lynne searches for clues to the killers' identity.As a frequent visitor to Colorado in general and Leadville, in particular I have attempted to fairly portray the climate, landscape and possibilities of mystery represented in the area. The story unfolds in the chill of early spring of the mountains and winds its way through the opening of high summer in the Rockies. The characters, central and supportive are drawn full-bodied lending depth and tautness to the unfolding story. Police procedure, process, and practical or problematical issues are lucidly presented lending both a sense of realism and frustration faced by investigators. In this fast paced thriller, the hunter becomes the prey and the circle narrows in a desperate game of cat and mouse.Murder in Cloud City is the first of the Lynne Fhaolain mystery series. Lynne will continue to make her home and homebase in Leadville, Colorado while she travels the West and Northwest in search of interesting vacation lands.

I have an ancestor in the 19th Texas Cavalry and I found this work to be complete and accurate. Well, either it is accurate, or the Confederate Research Center is accurate, but that's another story... Anyhow, this fine work covers the early Civil War days in Texas, the wild skirmishes in Arkansas, the raid into Missouri, the Red River Campaign (where the Texans, outnumbered 5 to 1, inflicted such punishment on the Yankee cavalry, infantry, artillery, and ironclads that they retreated across the Mississippi, never to return).

The author used primary sources such as military records of battles, letters to and from officers, letters written by soldiers to their families. I felt I knew these men and understood what they were going through. Some of the men, such as Parsons's were better trained than others; that could be due to wealthy or influencial men become officers without real military training - think of that happening today!

The result, however, is a detailed acount of some of the important events of the Second World War. As is often the case, individual magazine articles are very focused on specific subjects. Stand-alone essays are independent of the need to insert unnecessary verbiage and superfluous transition paragraphs to introduce other chapters. The WORLD WAR II READER is no exception. In book form this work is like a fine cable television special without commercial interruption.

This book, and the companion volume, are gold mines of theory and application. Anyone who has learned the Yang style long form for health will be amazed at the almost infinite number of techniques, both apparent and hidden, revealed in these volumes. The four aspects of Yang Taiji, and indeed of all Chinese martial arts (punching, kicking, wrestling, and chin-na)are explored in depth, as well as the more fundamental ideas of the nature and generation of chi and the various jings. I have personally attended a number of Dr. Yang's seminars at his YMAA in Boston and have found them to be excellent. Dr. Yang, with a PH.D in engineering, is very well grounded in the Western concept of scientific proof. His writings are not only the result of his research into the ancient classics, which is extensive, but also his own practice, pondering and above all practical discrimination. I would add that Dr. Yang always cheerfully and humbly invites people to disagree with his theories and to offer alternatives. However, you might find it quite difficult to debate a subject with someone who has studied it perserveringly for 35 years. On a final note, it should be stressed that in these books, as well as in others by the author, the concept of personal morality, ethics, and the cultivation of the spirit are not just footnotes, but are central to the art."},{"Title":"Tai Chi Theory and Martial Power: Advanced Yang Style Tai Chi Chaun (Martial Arts-Internal)","review":"This book is not perfect and it does have shortcomings. I am a beginner in Martial Arts, and some of the criticism which states that this book is not as advanced as it claims to be may have some merit. However, as far as I could tell, this book has excellent content for both novice and advanced students of Tai Chi.This book has some very clearly written content and outlines a large number of important movements. Most notably, the pictures are clear and contain all the necessary markings and arrows to help a beginner reinforce what he or she learns through instruction. Just for this aspect of the book alone, I believe it is first rate!Where I feel the book does fall short is in publication quality. The paper stock was clearly very poor, and the binding quality was also poor. This contributed to bunching in the center of the book. However, for small lot publishing of niche products such as this one, such shortcomings are unfortunately the norm.Overall, the book is comprehensive and covers a lot of ground. Perhaps for the very advanced this book may not help them get to the deeper meanings of some of the movements. Then again, perhaps the very advanced shouldn't be looking for such meaning in a book. Nevertheless, as a practical guide this book is a cut above the rest."},{"Title":"Tai Chi Theory and Martial Power: Advanced Yang Style Tai Chi Chaun (Martial Arts-Internal)","review":"Like Dr. Yang's other books this is a gold mine of good information. I find the few negative reviews puzzling, since there is plenty of quality information here. No book is perfect, especially on tai chi, but this is an excellent book. I suspect these people have never tried to read the real tai chi classics, which give far less. They are very difficult to understand in that they speak much more in metaphors and vague descriptions that are far more general and less specific than Dr. Yang's book.Yes, the back leg needs to be bent springlike, as one person says, but Dr. Yang mentions that, and anyway, that's a very basic concept that almost everyone knows anyway. Dr. Yang's book goes beyond the basic principles and gives quite specific instructions on the more advanced ones. As far as good, practical, and detailed advice on many aspects of tai chi energy, power, speed, posture and body mechanics, form practice, martial applications, and so on, this is probably the best I've seen.As far as actually how to generate fa-jing, or explosive chi power goes, I've never seen a book that does that, ever. Apparently the only way to get it is to either have that secret personally passed on to you or else to learn it from many years of diligent practice of the tai chi form. I suspect that most people who criticize books like this are looking for shortcuts and \\"secrets\\" and probably don't have the discipline and diligence to practice the form enough to get even the basic understanding and skills anyway, let alone the more advanced ones. The reality is that there are some things in tai chi that can't really be explained that well in words and simply have to be learned by practicing the form over a period of many years.I had one specific comment, which is that I found the long section on the many different types and applications of jin energy very practical and useful. I had learned many of these from my teachers and had figured out others on my own from doing the form, but I learned somemore from this chapter.So overall, another fine book from Dr. Yang that gives far more than any other volume on the subject I've seen up to this time. If there is a better one that lays so much material out so clearly on the subject of tai chi, I'd like to know what it is."},{"Title":"Tai Chi Theory and Martial Power: Advanced Yang Style Tai Chi Chaun (Martial Arts-Internal)","review":"I would like to thank Dr Yang for always sharing the martial aspects of Tai Ji Quan. The materials are not common even in China. His videos and books are easy to understand and follow. I would strongly recommend this book plus another one in the series (Tai Chi Chuan Martial Applications: Advanced Yang Style Tai Chi Chaun (Martial Arts-Internal Series)."},{"Title":"Tai Chi Theory and Martial Power: Advanced Yang Style Tai Chi Chaun (Martial Arts-Internal)","review":"I disagree with the earlier reviewer who gave the book only one star. While the book is complicated for the beginner, it is a very thorough and systematic presentation of classical taiji theory and application that the advanced student and teacher will find useful. While it doesn't present absolutely everything, the book nonetheless will serve as a useful reference."},{"Title":"Tai Chi Theory and Martial Power: Advanced Yang Style Tai Chi Chaun (Martial Arts-Internal)","review":"It's a great book for somebody who has done taiji for a while and needs to expand his knowledge on the theory. The conditions of the book were nice and the shipping super fast."},{"Title":"Tai Chi Theory and Martial Power: Advanced Yang Style Tai Chi Chaun (Martial Arts-Internal)","review":"Dr. Yang has again written a book in keeping with his usual high standards. For students wishing to go beyond the basic Taijiquan form, and learn more advanced levels and techniques of qi flow, the different types of jin, and how to generate them, this book is indispensable. One caveat : as its title suggests, this book is for more advanced students, and assumes that the reader has a foundation in Taijiquan, at least the basics of the form and some basic qigong."},{"Title":"Tai Chi Theory and Martial Power: Advanced Yang Style Tai Chi Chaun (Martial Arts-Internal)","review":"excellent guide for the beginner and beyond. background information and detailed descriptions and photos for internal energy work and tai chi."},{"Title":"Tai Chi Theory and Martial Power: Advanced Yang Style Tai Chi Chaun (Martial Arts-Internal)","review":"To me, YMAA is one fo the best martial arts publishers around...but don't lure yourself, youwi ll never attain a deep level in internal arts with only a book, even if it is the best one. However this book is definitely a good buy, clear, full of insights, with as usual for YMAA a load of theory (and that's a good point). The pictures are numerous, good, but still you'll need to get involved to catch all he subtleties of the demonstrated points. Dr Yang is definitely a genuine master (I personally experienced what he is worth) and even though he tries to pass down all his knowledge, there are lots of areas you will need to endeavour and discover yourself. To finish, I would like to say that doubting Dr Yang's knowledge about Tai Chi is like disputing with Stephen Hawkings on his last book about quantum physics. This book will definitely be helpful to you and whatever your level is, you'll be able to grab and grow one of the many seeds in this solid work."},{"Title":"Tai Chi Theory and Martial Power: Advanced Yang Style Tai Chi Chaun (Martial Arts-Internal)","review":"Even though this book looks like an advanced Tai Chi book in reality it tells you about nothing. Nothing about the back spine management on how to generate energy while you are pushing (or whatever you are doing in tai chi work). There is something on accumulating energy in the position that's absolutely not useful. Even the younger beginner understands the back leg needs to work like a spring without buying this \\"advanced\\" book. But the question is not on how the back leg should work, what it is exspected from a book like this is to get tips and training methods on the \\"back spine and waist /hips work\\" that's the real point on generating martial power in Tai Chi and Internal Martial Art. The level of this book is so lower that is absolutely not comparable with other Dr Yang's books I've read and reviewed."},{"Title":"Tai Chi Theory and Martial Power: Advanced Yang Style Tai Chi Chaun (Martial Arts-Internal)","review":"The author purportedly wanted to explore the martial applications of tai chi chuan; however, his understanding of the subject matter appears to be inadequate. In the most crucial areas, his explanations are often obscure, and worse, incorrect. This is a good book if you want to pick up some rudimentary ideas about the vocabulary of higher levels of tai chi, but it does not get to the true essence of the well guarded secrets of tai chi as a powerful martial art."},{"Title":"Industrial Society and Social Welfare","review":"The reading is dry, but it is a great picture of what things were like in the 60s and how our struggles have repeated themselves. A unique perspective of social services coming from economists."},{"Title":"Treading in the Past: Sandals of the Anasazi","review":"From the cover: From approximately AD 1 to 1300, the people we now refer to as Anasazi inhabited parts of Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico. Their impressive and enigmatic rock art and architectural ruins are well known, but the arid Four Corners climate has also preserved such artifacts as loomed clothes, intricate baskets, and sandals. This book is the most comprehensive volume on Anasazi sandals and weaving technique. Three hundred twelve examples from the extensive holdings at the Utah Museum of Natural History demonstrate the Anasazi genius as skilled textile artists. These examples incorporate colorful geometric patterns and reveal elaborate manipulations of warp and weft. Within the relatively rigid requirements of size, shape, and function, the ancient sandal weavers created almost as many decorative expressions as there are recorded specimens. The impact of the sandals as a group is emotionally and aesthetically powerful - a tribute to the Anasazi sandal weavers. [The color photos are amazing and detailed.]"},{"Title":"The Watch","review":"The first story I ever read by Mr. Bass was &quot;Fires&quot;, published in &quot;The Quarterly&quot;, a now-defunct publication. Since then I've bought every published work he has put out. &quot;The Watch&quot; is a superb example of Mr. Bass' haunting and near-mythical prose about the lives of everyday people. His characters are larger than life and imbued with a strength of personality. &quot;In Ruth's Country&quot; is a beautiful, poignant story of modern-day star-crossed lovers. &quot;Choteau&quot; is a fine example of Bass' ability to create heroic figures out of ordinary people. &quot;Mexico&quot; grips one with such a strong sense of place that you can imagine yourself in any of the character's shoes. &quot;Juggernaut&quot; allowed me to return home to a simpler place and time that I'd almost forgotten over the years. Every story in this collection is as fine as any writer today is producing. Each character is true, and the prose is full of desperation and longing. If you liked this book, you will probably appreciate short story collections by Richard Ford (&quot;Rock Springs&quot; and &quot;Wildlife&quot;) and &quot;Borrowed Hearts&quot; by Rick DeMarinis."},{"Title":"The Watch","review":"One of my favorite short story collections. The language is beautiful. The characters, settings, and actions are all so persuasive, and complement each other so well. Finally, the stories are MOVING--not just witty or clever or inventive. Bass' stories have it all!"},{"Title":"The Watch","review":"i came to rick bass through the many stories he's had anthologized in the best american series, and each of those are more than memorable. the watch, his first collection, is simply amazing. lots of emotion and depth, and a structure that is often seeming-to-be loose, until it reaches a point where everything comes together. highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Watch","review":"There is something very unusual and interesting going on in these short stories. On the surface the stories are accessible, entertaining, amusing, and even (forgive me for using the word) poignant. Underneath something is going on that I've never encountered before, that I can't quite get my arms around, and that reminds me of Faulkner.I've read some of these stories five or six times and I've bought the book for numerous friends. &quot;In Ruth's Country&quot; is particularly good."},{"Title":"The Watch","review":"The stories in The Watch are both youthful and wise. Rick Bass is a master of the short story form and this collection is a wonderful representation of his earlier works of fiction. Highly recommended for someone looking to get into contemporary literary fiction. Back in '92, the book captured me."},{"Title":"The Watch","review":"THERE ARE TEN SHORT STORIES HERE. I REALLY ENJOYEDEIGHT OF THE TEN----THE OTHER TWO I THOUGHT WERE ATAD ON THE BEEEZARRR SIDE, I COULDN'T FIND \\"\\"THEPOINT\\"\\". ONE OF THE TWO REMINDED ME OF THE SEINFELDEPISODES ABOUT THE SITCOM ABOUT \\"\\"NOTHING\\"\\".THAT SAID---THE OTHER STORIES WERE VERY, VERY WELLWRITTEN AND ENJOYABLE---GOOD JOB!!"},{"Title":"The Watch","review":"The Watch was suggested to me by a friend who is a big Tom Franklin nutswinger, who in turn is a big Rick Bass nutswinger. After reading Franklin's collection of stories (Poachers) and loving it, I cracked open The Watch to find where Tommy got it from. I discovered similar themes and styles, and the influence of Bass on Franklin is obvious. However, the differences here are major.While both writers set their stories in nature, Bass tends to create his stories around the overarching beauty and honesty of nature, making them inseparable, whereas Franklin makes nature a mere setting with a focus on the dark side. Bass possesses a real Southern charm as opposed to the more gritty style of story found in Poachers. Proof of that is found in a story like \\"Mexico\\" or \\"Redfish\\" and their slightly absurd characters and situations that aren't cheap quirks to make a character stand out, but, rather, defining traits of a real person and their life.I got to the end of the story \\"Juggernaut\\" and realized that Rick Bass is a tricky guy. Like every other story in this collection, \\"Juggernaut\\" was written in a laid-back tone that managed to be both detailed and poetic without being too much of either. Also, like the other stories in this collection, \\"Juggernaut\\" felt like I was sort of going along for the ride, falling back on the prose and the beauty of the language, the charm and not the story.But I got to the end and said \\"Holy s***, Rick Bass was telling the story the whole time, even when he wasn't. Aren't we all like the Juggernauts, both a real juggernaut and a member of the hockey team? Aren't we all just scrambling, trying to crush everything, fighting for glory and against reality, trying to make the glory and the fight the reality?\\"The stories here aren't barebones or minimalistic at all. What these stories manage to do is contain description that is both relevant AND plentiful. This isn't \\"A Clean, Well Lighted Place\\" or anything from What We Talk About When We Talk About Love: short, bleak stories that contain just enough to crush. Rick Bass can give us a grand long-form short story like \\"The Watch\\" and cram it full of detail and intertwined stories. A small thing like Jessie dumping out less and less of his Coke before drinking more and more mirror his obsession, but it also plays into Hollingsworth's tiny shop representing his obsession with his father, his obsession with loneliness and emptiness. They converge to bring back Buzbee, Hollingsworth's father, an old man who ran away for the sake of freedom, leaving Hollingsworth alone and worthless. Everyone's so obsessed in that story, yet we're not left to determine that by what isn't said.The other stories in here range from the heartbreaking \\"In Ruth's Country\\" and \\"Wild Horses\\" to the uplifting \\"Redfish\\". Most of the time, however, Bass prefers to wander around in different stages of questioning, ending his stories with characters saying \\"What next?\\" not unlike the stories in Carver's Cathedral. The main difference, and one of Bass's greatest strengths, is that he doesn't imply or even hint at an upward hook of hope at the end of his stories. Rather, he leaves his characters wondering and underlining the questions with a smile on their face for some reason they might not even know."},{"Title":"The Watch","review":"\\"The Watch\\" is a long story placed third in the collection. It is a tale of loneliness. A man and an older man, his father, have a store that has almost no customers. An exception to the general trend is Jesse, a cyclist, who stops for cokes and comes to be an expected presence in the life of the younger man. Jesse is aware of the fact that he is expected and begins dimly to resent the fact. The older man runs off to the fever camps and the younger man and Jesse pursue him and finally manage to carry him home. Jesse feels guilty when the older man ends up being chained to the store to keep him from running off again.A gallery of characters are featured in the stories. Along with the diverse characters, out of the way geographical places are described. Mostly the places are extremely to the south or to the north. There is the unpublished writer and teacher from Jackson State who feels annoyed with someone who attended Millsaps. The geometry teacher who teaches in a sort of frustration in Houston and tells stories of WallaWalla Washington is portrayed. The teacher drives a corvette. When he appears all bruised, he tells the students he fell out of his car and his wife drove away in it. Kirby, the narator, and Trish appear in several of the stories. Kirby and the narrator met in college. The style is laconic, indirect, artful."},{"Title":"Outdoor Decor : Decorative Projects for the Porch, Patio & Yard (Arts & Crafts for Home Decorating Series)","review":"This book has some wonderful (and beautiful) ideas for your yard and patio.

I am 14 (the same age as Ponyboy) and by reading it in one day it gave me an over dose of what it must of felt like. The book portrays the absolute love needed by Pony's brothers to survive. The book does not glorify evil like my teacher seems to think, however it shows the pain and agony felt by the greasers. The book begins with an up beat, intense, and irresistable intro. However I was almost brought to tears in the end. I was there spurring Ponyboy on all the way. This is a definite must read for all young adults"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"First of all,I would like to say I live in a neighborhood like ponyboy.You can say it's ghetto,I'm Latino and no hoodlum just pretty much like ponyboy.

The book showed good freindship and bravery, for Ponyboy, the main character of the book, had many freinds and many acts of showing his little sense of courage. This book has many seens that are not realistic but you must learn to look beyond that and see the true value of each scene. Do you want to read a sad, happy kind of book? If you do read The Outsiders it is filled with sarcasism and sad emotions."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I never used to read all that much. That is until I discovered S.E Hinton books. I love all of her books that I've read, but without a doubt,my favorite of all time was The Outsiders. A short time after I finished reading the book, I saw the movie. To me, the book was MUCH better than the movie,Seeing that I liked the characters better as I imagined them, than as how they were portrayed. I would recommend this book to anybody,but especialy people around my age. Although I think anybody would enjoy this book just as much as I did."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I thought that it was a very good book, and I would recommend it to every one. This book doses a good job telling the other side of the story. The Outsiders is very descriptive book, S.E. Hinton dose a good job giving you all the kids backgrounds. One of my favorite parts of the book is when the greasers fight the soc'es and they finely prove to them that they are just as important as anyone else. This book dose a good job of putting things into your eyes. Jonny finely found the meaning of it is rough all over. This book also is good at pointing out the good and the bad on both sides of town. Pointing out the boys many different personality is another one of my favorite parts of the book. I really like this book and I would urge everyone to read it."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders was one of the best books I have ever read in my life. It was written very well and you could picture in your head what you are reading. The story about the Greasers and the Socials was a good idea because that is close to the truth in the real world. When the writer wrote about Johnny being jumped that was a good idea on her part because it to was close to the real world in some places. I would have to say that my favorite part of the book would have to be the rumble at the end because it had a lot of drama and it made you picture the rumble in your head as you were reading along. I think that the writer should have made the socials put up more of a fight than they did.This book has everything that you would want to read about, violence and close to real live situations. I recommend this book to anyone who likes to read or even don't like to read, it is a very good book."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I read this book a couple of weeks ago and immediately knew I had to see the movie. My english teacher gave it to my class as an assignment novel. I didn't think much of it. I just wanted to read it and get it over with. My teacher had told my class that once we picked the book up there was no way we'd be able to put it down. I thought she was bluffing, but after I started reading it I realized she wasn't! This book is heart warming and one of the best books I have ever read! It is definately my favorite book so far! I always said if a book made me cry...even once it was a good book. Well, this book made me cry about 3 times in two days. The main character and narrator, Ponyboy went through life altering moments! He was a greaser and proud of it! See, there were two types of people in town...the greasers, from the east side of town-the poor kids and the socs &lt;&lt;short for socials&gt;&gt; who were from the west side-the rich kids. Greasers and Socs did NOT get along and always ended up in fights- known as rumbles. The rumbles were always safe and never ended in anything drastic. Until one night, when Johnny &lt;&lt;one of the boys in the gang&gt;&gt; stabbed a soc and killed him. After that, they were on the run. Dally told them a good place to hide and so they went there. One day, the church they were hiding in burned down. Little kids were trapped in and Johnny and Ponyboy risked their lives to save them. Ponyboy came out alright, but Johnny wasn't so lucky. He broke his back and was going to be crippled for life, IF he made it. Dallas Winston &lt;&lt;Dally&gt;&gt; never loved anything, but after the BIG rumble that they beat the Socs in, Johnny died and Ponyboy finally realized that Dally did love something...Johnny. Afterward, Dally robbed a liquor store and was shot down by the cops and he instantly died. This story is heart warming, because it's not only about a rivalry or murder or violence, it's also about a boy trying to find a place where he could feel he belonged and wouldn't have to get pushed around. S.E. Hinton wrote this classical novel when she was sixteen and I guess that's why she captured the trials and tribulations of life as a teenager so well. At the end of this book, I don't know if anyone else who read it felt the same, but I felt like I knew the characters... personally. As if they were part of my gang and were all my friends! I recommend this book to anyone. Anyone who likes a story about hard times, friendships, loyalty and triumph...this book is a must-read!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book is very reality based,and it couldn't have been better written. We were assigned to read it in school. Usually, no one really reads the book, but everyone is reading it whenever they can, it even has the book haters reading! If you know someone who says they don't like to read, give them this book, it WILL change their mind! This is the second time I've read this, and I love it even more! The story of Ponyboy, who lives with his two brothers (Sodapop and Darry) after his parents die in a car wreck. There is an ongoing conflict between his social group (The Greasers) and the upper class group (The Socs, pronounced soshas). The story of choosing what's right, and the basic theme is: no matter how different we are, we all look at the same sunset. We all have some problems, everyone. You need to read this book, it is one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book is about gangs. The West - Side gang are the Socs. The East - Side gangs are called greasers. The greaser telling the story is Ponyboy Curtis. The other greasers in Ponyboy's gang are Sodapop Curtis, Darry Curtis, Steve Randle, Two-Bit Mathews, Dallas Winston, and Johnny Cade. Most of the time the greasers were jumped by the Socs. One time Ponyboy ran away with Johnny to hide in Windrixville all because of Darry who hit Ponyboy. They didn't go back for a week. And when they did, they were in the hospital from a burning church. Ponyboy was out for a rumble against the Socs. They won and when Ponyboy went to the hospital to visit Johnny, Johnny died. A few days after that, Ponyboy went to Juvenile Court for a hearing. If you want to hear more about the story, then read it and see how fun it is!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"As an avid fan of track and field, I like things that are fast. In this case, I like books that are quick to get to the point. Never have I read a book so packed with action in only the first chapters of reading. Miss Hinton at the tender age of sixteen did a very good job keeping readers who hate slow plots very interested in the book. Pony is a very nice charter, who is sort of a mild thug. I say \\"mild thug,\\" because of his associates, the greasers; a group of people who Pony admits are often involved with stealing. Although Pony in involved with them, he is a very good student, and is a lot more articulate than his brethren. Pony boy, who is suppose to be part of a tuff gang of guys, enjoys getting up early to watch the sunset, and confesses to going to movies alone so he can analyze the plot and critique the acting without the worry of having to socialize with his friends. There was not a chapter that went by that did not leave me in suspense. Even the last chapter left me wanting more, I personally wish that S.E. Hinton would make sequel. This book has drama; it has murders, fires, and love. The best part of the whole book is the big brawl between the greasers and the socs, or \\"socials,\\" the greasers rival gang. It was while I was reading about the preparation of the rumble that I learned that \\"bringing heat\\", meant bringing guns. I recommend this book to anyone who likes lots of action in a well-plotted plot.Just for the record, my favorite character is Randy, a soc, and a very reasonable kid. After the death of his friend Bob, he tells pony that he is sick of the whole gang business, and people just need to live to enjoy life. I wish people just lived to enjoy life, or watch the sun set. He he."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This was a book I had to read in High School. Though I wan't anavid reader, I loved it!

There's Johnny Cade, whose family life isinsufferable. There's Dallas Winston, mean and gruff (but has a softspot for Johnny). And then there are the Soc's, the spoiled kids wholike to pick on the greasers for fun... And let's not forget CherryValence, who though dating a Soc has a heart and a mind all herown. ...go read the story! You won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I'm a 7th grader and my teacher read the Outsiders outloud to our class and I really liked it a lot. My favorite character was Dallas because he liked to carry a gun and a knife with him. But I didn't like it when he shot himself at the end. We also watched the movie in clas too and I liked the movie because it should everything that was said in the book. And I liked it because in the movie you could see what went on in the book even better."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The late mythologist Joseph Campbell was once asked what happens when parents fail to pas on their mythology to their children...where do children today get their myth?Campbell's response: &quot;They make it up themselves. This is why we have graffiti all over the city. These kids have their own gangs and their own initiations and their own morality, and they are doing the best they can. But they are dangerous because their own laws are not those of the city.&quot;In The Outsiders, S.E. Hinton explores this theme of adolescents left alone without the guidance of adult role models and the tragic results that can ensue. The adolescents in this novel have fashioned a mythology of their own and modeled it after the gang leaders, who get druck, lift hubcaps and blow off steam in gang fights. As one might expect, when conflict arises the characters resolve thier conflicts, as some adolescents do, with violence; with little or no thought for the consequences of their actions.Through Ponyboy's eyes we see the growing resentment between Greasers and Socs that escalates into two conflicts between the gangs...both with tragic results. Ponyboy learns that Socs are no different than the Greasers, they are equally ignored by their parents.An excellent companion to Romeo &amp; Juliet and even West Side Story...all three are compelling works that can and should be used as springboards for teens to discuss their emerging independence, their beliefs and behavior."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This is my favorite book because is a great reminder of how life, as I see it, is. I enjoy this book because it doesn't try to be anything its not. Hinton's novel is about tension and strife at any level. S.E. Hinton's plot is extremely easy to understand and to relate to if you don't have problems with the reality that people smoke, use grease in their hair, are violent sometimes, and listen to Elvis. These habits may not be common place where you live or have lived but they happen and have happened.I also love this book because it is timeless to me. I can read it anywhere at anytime and enjoy it. Thank You."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is a good book in my view. It was about a gang of kids who depended on each other for their lively hood. Ponyboy Curtis, the main character, is a small, but feisty fourteen-year-old. He's got two older brothers named Sodapop and Darry, who look after him because his parents were killed in a car crash. The \\"greasers\\" as they are called, are rivals with the \\"Socs\\" the upper class people. They are always getting in fights with each other. And when the big \\"rumble\\" comes, they must learn to fight beside each other and to always \\"Stay Gold\\"."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I like the story because it is very exciting. The brothers try to keep out of the Soch's hangout, but they catch up with the Soch's everytime. The Soch's leader is killed by Johnny, one of the Greasers. He is known as the gang &quot;pet&quot; because he was beat up by one car full of Soch's that the group hated. The Greasers have smoked or are smoking, have criminal records, and are all a big major group of brothers as they call them selves. My summary for the book is that I kind of am two sided on it. I mean that I like some of it and I don't like some of it. But, I know one thing, that I think kids shouldn't run from there fears but face them like grown up's. So, if you think about getting the book for your kids, get it for them when they get older. That is what I think about the book The Outsiders."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It can really make you think of the things we take for granted, family, friends, even food. These boys live off of what they have. And it is a very emotional and moving book."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This is a classic \\"coming of age\\" tale of a boy who grows up on the \\"wrong side of town\\". Today, the \\"social groups\\" presented in the story 'socs' and 'greasers' are dated. However, they can easily be mapped to other competing groups that may exist today. The true strength of the story is the evolution of the relationship between the lead character and his \\"family\\". At times the events seem to be a little far-fetched, however, the strength of the character development helps to overshadow those.The lead character lives in a bleak world, where kids come from broken home, not knowing a world where everyone doesn't smoke, drink and fight violently. In spite of (or because of ) this, the \\"kids\\" have strong relations with each other. Even growing in this world, the lead character is smart, ahead in school, and would appear to have a bright future. However, he appears convinced that he will grow up to just be like the 'losers' around him. The events in the book are strong enough to help convince him to re-examine his views. The evolution in the book is convincing, without excessively trying to prove points."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The story was written more than 40 years ago. The author was but 16 years old at the time. But this story is still the quintessential adolescent coming-of-age novel, a story that essentially introduced the genre as we know it today.And it still holds its place at the top of the genre. A worthy read for adolescents and those parents that might need a refresher on the workings of the adolescent mind - maybe a quick view back into their perspective on the world. (Although the parents of today's adolescent generation probably read this book when they were adolescents.)Anyone who hasn't read this book has missed out on a classic, and those who have read it would do well to reacquaint themselves. Quick read and worth the time."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I bought this book for my 8th grade English class to read. It is an amazing story of hope and courage, and the kids were really able to identify with many of the characters. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is on my list of great reads. I always feel like an outsider at school so it's easy to care about Ponyboy Curtis.

His experiences with his friends feel so true you'd swear you were right there with him. The scenes happen quickly and leave you anxious to read more."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"After all these years of loving the movie, I finally decided to buy the book! What years I've wasted..From page one I got lost in S.E. Hinton's world of greasers and socs and how despite all the years that have passed and with the evolution of technology and science, this novel still applies to kids today. The names and name-calling may be different but the struggle has remained the same. The Outsiders truly is a classic in American literature. This isn't just recommended reading for schools, but for everyone. That's what a classic means - timeless and ageless. Enjoy!!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I read this book as a classroom assignment at school, and I have to say that it was really interesting!! I was impressed of how good it was and the plot was amazing. Its a story of a misunderstood boy caught up in the world of gangs and the world of daydreams. But after things get too far between the Soc gang, and the Greaser gang(which the main character is part of), his world just starts crashing down. You'll laugh,and cry reading this novel and I highly recommend it to someone whos doing a book project, or if you just need a good book to read, the outsiders is for you."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Wow! Reading The Outsiders was the best thing I have done. I actualy picked The Outsiders book because of the way tha cover of the book was. I liked The Outsiders because of the way the author kept expressing himself he used so many old language like tuff ment cool in the old days. well I also liked the way the two gangs were fighting. Everytime the two gangs faught the Greasers always lost. Onece the rich kids wich were the socs found two greasers at the park, then they started an argument. That cause a big problem if you want to know what it was maybe you should read the book your self."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I remember my 7th grade English teacher handing me this book for the first time for an assignment. we were instructed to go home and read chapter one. I finished the entire book in one sitting.This book is a powerful story about prejudice and rivalry, and a young boy realizing that pain, no matter your class or friends, is the same for all of us.I have a 13 year old son now, and I can't wait for my copy so he can enjoy the experience as much as I did."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I credit Susan Eloise Hinton with writing the book (THE OUTSIDERS) which really began the modern YA novel. Amazingly still, she penned it at age 16. The fact that the 1967 book still sells like johnnycakes (inside joke) today is testament to the book's merit. What's more, it appeals equally to boys and girls. The book focuses on boys' gangs (Greasers vs. Socs), so boys identify with it, yet it also demonstrates a degree of sensitivity and love between the boys (both between the Curtis brothers and the Greaser gangs) that girls find rewarding.At the heart of the novel is Robert Frost's poem, \\"Nothing Gold Can Stay,\\" which gives the book its signature line: \\"Stay gold, Ponyboy.\\" Ironically, Johnny's advice to Ponyboy goes against Frost's message, yet readers buy in totally as, by that time, they are as caught up in sunrises as Pony and Johnny.The very best of S.E. Hinton's works, THE OUTSIDERS will be around for a long time. By tapping into a problem that will never go away (youths and their feuding cliques), Hinton has given us a small-scale masterpiece and a YA classic."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I just picked up this book that way I looked like I was reading, but when I read what it was about I decided to give it a shot. After reading the frist chapter I was really hooked into it. This is a book you can really relate to. This book is about liven on the streets. It tells the story of a boy growing up in a a town apart by two gangs. I don\`t want to spoil the book for you so that is all I can tell you. This book is full of surpises. I really suggest everyone read it."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"You will be heart will be touched touched by this book.

I kept thinking about it, wondering what happenened to the characters. About six months later I saw it at a yard sale, bought it for 50 cents, and read it cover to cover without stopping. It turned out to be one of the greatest books I've ever read. I cried lots, which I rarely do when reading books. It made me think a lot about how I treat people- I'm one of the rich, spoiled kids who would be a Soc if they were still around today, and I don't think I've always been incredibly kind to gang members and kids who aren't as incredibly lucky as I am. After reading this book I changed a lot, and I think I'm a better person now. Read this book!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book gave a description of the social barrier like no other I have ever seen. The book, told from the point of veiw of a teenage boy, tells a heart wrenching story of life, death, and courageousness under fire. Any person experiencing social segregation should read this book. Thank you S.E. Hinton for such a wonderful story that expresses so accuratly the oppression that children in this position most often feel. Thank you for the experience and thank you for the inspiraton."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is a book that will give you the sensation that your living in the storie. And the thing wich I probably liked the most about S.E. Hinton's book is the realism of the story.

I highly recommend this book to anyone, even the people that don't like to read. Including me!!!!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book is a story about the problems in the world, such as smoking, drugs, drinking, and the social races."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book is the best and I would never have thaught it was this book.

I'ld recamend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Well, this is, hands down, one of the most touching books I've ever had the pleasure of reading. Hinton had a wonderful way of showing you the real people behind all of those masks that they put up to protect themselves for getting hurt, and all the masks society puts up as well. It gave you insight about how bad it is all around, and opened your heart to people that you probably would not usually relate to. People that you can't usually relate to, but who are regular kids. Soda and Two-Bit, the fun loving guys that'll never grow up. Darry, the one who grew up too fast, too much trouble put on his shoulders at one time. Johnny, caught between two abusive parents and the need to be loved, everyone's little brother. Ponyboy, trying to figure out where he's going in life. Where all of them will be going. Ponyboy who watches the sunset and reads poetry. And finally, Dallas, the hood. Dallas the one who didn't know how to love, and the one thing that he did love was ripped away from him. Dallas who didn't care what people though, and who didn't even remember what it was like to cry. All these characters give you a taste of what it's like on the other side of town, but not to farfetching to be unbelievable. The Outsiders is a truely touching tale of friendships, and hardships, and the fight to be understood. It's about loosing the fight, and winning it as well. But mainly it's about life."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"A glimpse in the life of a young man growing up tough in a world few of us ever know.

It was a really action-packed book. There was sadness also when Ponyboy's two friends die. The book gives a good idea of gang life. I especially liked it because my teacher gave me this information sheet about S.E. Hinton, and it said that there really were Socs (Socials) and Greasers in Tulsa, Oklahoma where the story takes place, and where S.E. Hinton lived when she wrote the book at the age of 16, and where she lives now. Hope this information about S.E. Hinton and information about the book really encourages YOU to buy this book. It is one of my favorite books, which I am actually glad we read in class and wrote a book report on."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book is about a boy named ponyboy who lives with his brothers and basically the rest of the gang that he's in.

I started the book, and just coudn't put it down. It was irresistable, it made me laugh, cry, and want to be there with the characters. It was a wonderful book and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a place to let go of all of their emotions. Wonderful!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is the best book I've ever read. I've read it eight times and seen the movie twenty-three times. It is a very emotional book. I feel sorry for the greasers because they are good people but everyone looks on the outside and judges them. The characters portray that it is very hard to live on that side of the tracks.

I THINK EVERYONE SHOULD READ THIS BOOK AT LEAST ONE TIME, AND IM SURE THEY WILL WANT TO READ IT AGAIN AND AGAIN!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I'd just like to say something to all of the people who said they hated this book. Many of you complain that it is childish. I don't know if you know this or not, but S.E. Hinton wrote this book when she was 16. I'd like to see you write something this good at 16. Also, you said it was unrealistic. I've never read a book more realistic than this. If you think that killing and gangs are unrealistic then you certainly live in a sheltered world."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"S.E. Hinton The Outsiders is a must read book for boy or girls that like action and loves their families.The main characters is Pony Boy, his brother Soda Pop and Darry. Also members of the greasers like Johnny, Two-Bit also Dally. There all just like family they all love to fight. They also always protect each other. Darry is very protective over Pony Boy because there parents died when Pony Boy was young.A conflict in the book is when Pony Boy and Darry get in to a fight and Pony Boy runs away with Johnny to the park. There some soc's try to pick a fight with Pony Boy and Johnny. That's when some soc's grabs Pony Boy and tried to kill him in a fountain. So Johnny pulls out a knife and kills the soc. Then they run away to a old church and have some good times and a lot more bad times.In the book a big rumble happens. It's between the greasers and the soc's. But since the greasers didn't have a lot of people the brumly boys A.K.A Shepard's gang jump in to help the greasers. The rumble starts between Darry and Paul. Paul was a old football friend of Darry, but Darry hated him so bad that he was ready to beat the mess out of him. Which he did.The book by S.E. Hinton The Outsiders is very good. So I think you should read the book because it really is a good book."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I think that this novel is stunning, particularly as the author wrote it at 16 years old. It has many morals to it - it's about the social differences living in a society split in two - in this case, split into the Socs and the greasers - because of wealth or looks. It discusses the way some people find themselves superior and serious situations that arise.The book is written in the eyes of Ponyboy Curtis, a greaser who lives with his two elder brothers, Sodapop and Darry, who's in a gang. A lot happens in the story in little time, but it does portray real life situations, however uncomfortable they might be.The characters are all different, and my favourites are probably all the three main characters: Dally, Johnny and Ponyboy. This was the first book to make me cry in a long time - I'm quite apathetic - but it managed to do it because I related with the characters so much and understood the situation.In short, this is a stunning novel with good moral and social value."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book gave me shivers all up and down my back; it was just and it taught me how to be happy with what I have.This is about two gangs named the Greasers, who are poor, and the Socs who are preps and rich. Ponyboy is a Greaser. He murdered someone so he runs away with his friend Johnny to a place that nobody sees him. Also Ponyboy never gets along with Darry his older brother. For example that night Darry smacked Ponyboy on his face because he was late to come home. Anyway, they go live at an old church for a while and then Dally shows up and gives Ponyboy a note from Soda his middle brother. Dally invites both of them to Dairy Queen. While they were gone the church caught on fire because they forgot to turn of the flame after they were done smocking and when they returned there were children that were in the church. So Dally, Johnny, and Ponyboy save them and get badly burnt. Johnny later on dies because of all his bad burns bad so does Dally but before Johnny died he wanted Ponyboy to read his favorite poem,\\"Natures first green is gold,Her hardest hue to hold.Her early leaf is a flower;But only so an hour.Then leaf is a flower;Then leaf subsides to leaf.So Eden sank to grief,So dawn goes down to day,Nothing gold can stay.\\"This poem is so good and so is the book. It is terrific and it meant a lot to me."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"My class of eighth grade students just finished this book. I enjoyed teaching it, and for the most part, I believe my students felt the characters jump to life from the pages of this novel. For some students this was the first time a connection with a piece of literature has ever happened. The issues addressed in the book: group dynamics, gang violence, high school attrition, domestic violence, juvenile delinquency, friendship, family unity and many more are just as timely today as when the novel was written. While I think most older teens will enjoy the novel, I think it is best experienced and discussed in a group setting with an adult who can field questions and facilitate discussions that naturally arise from reading this book.Experiencing tough life lessons through the safe distance of a book can be an awesome thing. This is a great novel for young people who are beginning to see the real world past the walls of their homes and communities. The novel provokes examination of life, living, and human nature and encourages students to develop their own ideas about how things \\"should be\\" in contrast to how they perceive things truly are. It is a high interest level novel that lower level students are willing to invest time and interest into reading. The best part is that the book is relatively short enough to be finished with plenty of time to extend the novel into learning activities."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The outsiders\\"I reckon it never occurred to you that your brothers might be worrying their heads off and afraid too call the police because something like that could get you two thrown in a boy's home so quickly it'd make your head spin.

You haven't even got a coat on.\\"Ponyboy and Johnnycake are two main characters that are also best friends in this fiction book The Outsiders. They are part of a gang called the \\"Greasers\\". Everyone in the gang are all friends. There has always been this rivalry between the Greasers and the \\"Socs\\". The Socs are upper class teenagers that have everything, but there is still something missing in their lives. They love to beat up Greasers for the fun of it, until one day one of the Greasers takes it too far.The Outsiders is by S.E Hinton I would recommend this book to both females and males from ages 12 and up. Anyone younger will not understand the book; there is also foul language. I would have to rate this book a five out of five stars. I think that The Outsiders was the best book I have ever read! I thought that because I could relate to the book and what they were feeling. It also gave me a different outlook on people in general, and a different point of view on life.~Brooke Riley"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This has to be one of my all time favorite books.

If your into stories where it's like a team at first, and they stick together from beginning to the end, this book is for you!The beginning starts out as Ponyboy Curtis is walking out of the movie theater, and gets jumped by the rich snobs called \\"Socs\\". Ponyboy gets saved by his older brother Darry, and all is well. Or is it?At one point, Ponyboy sleeps at Johnny's house for a while, and Darry get's real mad at him. He hits Pony, and Pony runs to Johnnys house, and runs away with him. It suddenly turns into a jumble of events with the Socs, such as a rumble, a girl, a fire, and even a murder."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is a miracle, in that this realistically raw story is the creation of a person's imagination; and this person was only 16 years old. Yes, S.E.Hinton was 16 years old when she wrote this book.Anyway, to make it short and to-the-point: the beginning of 'The Outsiders' is intriguing, the middle heartbreaking, the ending satisfying.To find out how so, read the book."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"THE OUTSIDERS IS AN AWESOME BOOK! One of my teachers read it to me and the other girls in my class last fall. All 16 of us LOVED it!

Today, in the teenage world, sooo many people are excluded and have to learn how to deal with life problems on their own because sometimes they don't have anyone to go to that they can trust.

Hintons first novel, The Outsiders, is one of the most heart touching books I have ever laid my eyes on. It explores the life of Ponyboy, a young Greaser that grew up on the wrong side of the tracks. The book also explores the true meaning of Brother hood back in the 60's. S.E. Hinton described the life of these people very accuratly because she herself grew up during the 60's and was a Greaser. The ending will rip your heart out and really make you think about what you have. If you like &quot;Tear Jerker&quot; books than you will love this one. I recomend that if you want your kids to read it when they get old enough to keep it in good condition. There is some profanity and and quite a lot of violence in the book, but not enough to make it bad. It just tells the truth of life in that day."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"i thought that this was a great book. the author describes the characters really well and you feel as if you are there, experiencing what they are going through. this book is a real page-turner. i recommend it for anyone who likes action and excitement."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book is great!

If you figure it out, you will realize what a valuable lesson it is. This is a very great book! But don't take my opinion, read it yourself! ( P.S.

However, all that effort to not like it was to was to no avail- when all is said and done, I really enjoyed this book and it's safe to say that it completely exceeded my expectations.After finishing this book the two elements which stick out to me most are the emotions and the relationships. In reading YA over the years I have grown so accustomed to the male characters being \\"bad boys\\"- cocky arrogant, and charming to the nth degree, however, despite all of that they have nothing on these boys. I've come to realize that those \\"bad boys\\" are fooling themselves, their \\"badness\\" (and all of the emotions surrounding it) is such a facade and superficial. These boys, from Soda, with a larger-than-life personality and who brings a smile to everyone's face, not unlike the beverage he derives his name from does, to Darry, stuck in a \\"between\\" state, due to putting his brothers before himself, to Dally, who isn't near as jaded as he lets himself come off of as, to Johnny, who, out of his death, inspires new life, to Ponyboy, a young man truly trying to find where he fits in the crazy world that he was born into, experience real and raw emotions- while they certainly have swagger, they aren't afraid to cry whenever need be (it was refreshing and I think that authors of the twenty-first century could certainly learn a thing or two from this author of the mid-twentieth-century). As for the relationship element, I can't remember the last time I read of such a strong family unit, despite many of these boys not being related by blood. These boys could always count on one another, even during those times when they may not deserve it.All in all, while I did enjoy this book I don't believe that it's the \\"best\\" and \\"most popular young adult novel of all time\\" as the cover boasts (though it is one of the best novels that I have been required to read for school, both high school and university)- but I am entirely thankful for it as it truly paved the way for all future YA."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Great book, good plot line and awesome characters overall an a++ @$&@$&@$&&$@&$@&$@ &$@ &$@ @$& &$@ $$&@ &$@ @$& &$@"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The book was bought for my daughter for an assignment in school.

Ponyboy considered himself to have been lucky enough to only get a slash across the cheek, compared to his best friend Johnny who had been severely mugged four months earlier.Soon after words Ponyboy, Johnny, and Darry, a friend of theirs, went and broke into a drive-in movie theater even though they could have easily paid for the 25 cent entrance fee. There they meet two Socs: Cherry, and Marcia, and Two-bit Mathews, another friend. After taking the girls up to their neighborhood and leaving Two-bit Mathews, Ponyboy and Johnny went to the \\"lot\\" and lie down to look at the stars. A few hours later they started to head on home only to realize a group of Socs trailing them in a car. They drunkenly got out of their car and chased Ponyboy and Johnny down for giving \\"their\\" girls a ride. When they were caught they started drowning Ponyboy, when all of a sudden Johnny comes and kills a Soc named Bob.Now on the run from the law, Ponyboy and Johnny head to Blue Jay Mountain, which was suggested by Dally as a hiding spot. There they spend the next five days surviving on bologna sandwiches and pride taking disguise. When Dally comes to check on them he learns that they have decided to turn themselves in. On their way back they noticed a group of people around their hideout and they stop and they stop and see a fire. After a swift rescue of the kids that were trapped inside and nearly getting killed, Ponyboy, Johnny, and Dally were swiftly led to the hospital where a horrible event happens that changes everyone's life.This seemingly fictional, but amazing true story will keep everyone who reads this, hopefully, on the edge of his or her seat."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"All I can say is that it brought tears to my eyes. A must read for everyone..."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"&quot;The Outsiders&quot; is a book for all ages. It tells the life of Ponyboy Curtis, who is a Greaser,and focuses on the conflict shared between the Socs and the Greasers, two neighbourhood gangs. The Socs are very rich, and the Greasers are mostly hoods - apart from Ponyboy, his best friend Johnny, and Pony's two elder brothers, Darry and Sodapop. Pony's parents were killed in a car-crash when he was young. Darry,20, got a job so Soda and Pony wouldn't go into a boy's home. Soda and Pony have always got along well, but Darry is always shouting at Pony, telling him to use his head. One night, Darry hits him, so Pony runs away with Johnny. 5 Socs gang up on the two life-long friends, and almost kill Ponyboy. Johnny accidently ends up killing Bob, the leader of the gang, and boyfreind to a girl Soc called Cherry Valence. Dallas Winston tells them to hide out in an abandoned church in Windrixville, but it catches fire. Johnny, Pony and Dally manage to get some school kids out of the fire, but Jonhhy is hit by a falling beam and ends up with a broken back. The greasers try to avenge Johnny's near-death by having a rumble with the Socs. Johnny dies in hospital, his last words being &quot;Stay gold Pony, stay Gold...&quot;. Dally then manages to get himself killed by the cops under a streetlight, and everyone is grieving the death of two good friends. The only happy point in the story is the fact that Darry and Pony start to get along fine. Whenever they have a fight now, Soda agets really broken up, so they stop. This book isn't one bit depressing, it's really good fun.I thouroughly enjoyed this book, and became a typical soppy girl when Johnny and Dally died. My class also saw it on video, and all the girls cried their eyes out! I hope you enjoy yourselves like us!!!!!!! SE Hinton really went into the depth and feeling of the events in this book, and managed to include so much description that you could connect with the characters. I'd buy the video as well, that really brings it to life. It really opens your eyes to how bad things really are in most parts of the world. It also contains humor, which will keep you going the the sad times! Good reading all over!At the end of term, we had to write the whole book from Johnny's point of view, instead of Pony's. I enjoyed the depth of the feeling in the book so much, that I ended up getting an A*! Thanks SE Hinton!!!!!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I loved this book, I'm in Jr. High, and this book was listed on our summer reading list. To tell you the truth I didn't really expect much from this short book, but was I ever wrong! I loved this book and finished it in a day. It was very sweet. I laughed, I cried, but it was a book with many different moods. It's a real page tuner. And it's amazing!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders was the best book I've ever read. I read it for a school report, and I thought it would suck, but I read it 6 times since I got it 3 weeks ago. I cried everytime I read it, and it gives you an incredible sense of what it's like to be a kid from the wrong side of town. I can't get over how much I loved the book. No matter who you are, or where you come from, I think you should read this book. And if it doesn't leave you wanting to know more about Ponyboy and his gang, then I feel sorry for you, because I find myself wishing that there was more stories about all of them."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Who know those kinds of books that can take you farther out somewhere than who've ever imagined, whether it's to an exotic and historic place or just to a far out land filled with joy, sadness, or even pain? Well &quot;The Outsiders&quot; is deffiantly one of them. It just captures you and takes you into the life of Ponyboy Curtis, the main character and narrater of this amazing tale. And while reading you just feel everything Ponyboy and his family and friends go through. The Author, S.E. Hinton, really makes this book so worthy to read by her well planed out plot line and charcter personalities. With her creativity she writes a book like no other, and makes you unable to put the book down from the first page opened to the last page closed. So I highly recommend this book for anyone who will enjoy a well thought out book with endless enjoyment."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders Book Review\\"A book that shows all people are different, yet they are all the same.\\"In the eyes of a Greaser there are two groups; you are either a Soc or you are a Greaser. The greasers are almost like hoods. They steel things, drive banged up cars, smoke, and get into gang fights once in a while. The socs were the \\"west coat rich kids\\", who for fun jumped greasers and threw beer-blasts.Ponyboy Curtis, a greaser, a bookworm and movie fanatic is also wrapped up into the two-grouped world. He and a fellow greaser, Johnny, are on the run. Johnny has done something no one, especially the socs, will ever forget.During the book, The Outsiders, the reader experiences movies, fire, trains, and the ever famous rumble. The Greasers, as well as the Socs, learn there is more to some people than what is on the surface or how \\"tuff\\" they are.I think the book was phenomenal. It goes into so much depth and truly touches everyone who reads it. I think it puts people into a right state of mind by seeing how truly luck we are. I give it an A+ with fifty gold stars."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Hi readers, my name is Jack Zeringue and I go to Stuart Hall School. I am 13. We read The Outsiders as one of our books this year for Seventh Grade. It was one of the only books I actualy liked that we read in Middle School, besides The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle.The Outsiders was very well written. I really liked how readers got the opportunity to step into Ponyboy Curtis' shoes and see what he thinks about all of the events that happen to him and his pal Johnny.I have a warning for readers: Do not watch the movie before reading the book, it has different parts to it than the book. Read the book then watch the movie, you will like the movie just as well as the book.I have to give S.E. Hinton her props on this because she was only 16 when she wrote it. I don't think I'll be able to write that good of a book at that age.I recomend this book to everyone that likes to read about other types of lifestyles and the problems that are caused because of that."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The outsiders is still an excellent book for todays teenagers.

I have never read such a heart warming story in all my life. I cried so hard, and laughed, every emotion imaginable was shown on my face while reading this book. My father recommended this book to me, and i was reluctant at first, but i read it and i never put it down.This story is about Ponyboy Curtis, a greaser, who can rely only on his buddies for support. The socs are always there to bring a knife to their necks, and will. He and his buddy, Johnny cake, are sleeping in the park, when a bunch of socs come to get them. And just for self defense, Johnny kills one of them. Then they are on the run.I am not going to tell anymore, that would take away the fun of reading it.

They were drowning you, Pony. They might have killed you.Wow, if that didn't make you want to read this book then this might.The Outsiders is a book about two gangs, the Greasers and the Socs. It is also about a few boys' friendship between each other. In the beginning you feel like you could take on any Soc in the business, but later in the book you come to realize that those stuck up Socs are not the group to get stuck in the mix of. Before the book ends some of our characters may come to a fiery end.The Outsiders is a great blend of real-life activity and realistic fiction. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes realistic fiction.-Stephen Brandow"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I had to read this for my English class. I wasn't too excited about it at first because it didn't look like my type of book. I thought I'd hate it. Man, was I wrong! Five stars doesn't do this book justice. I don't even think a million stars would. The main character, Ponyboy, and all his friends are greasers. When the word \\"greaser\\" comes to mind, I think of someone who smokes and does all these wild things and is to be avoided at all costs. That's what everyone else thinks of Pony and all his friends. It's not true at all. They're wonderful guys-they just haven't been given the chance to prove it. They can't walk down the street without worrying if they're going to get jumped or not. People spit at them and call them \\"white trash\\" (or worse), or they run from them because they're afraid it'll hurt their reputation-when all they want is to belong. I'll be the first to admit, this is a sad book. An extremely sad book. But it really makes you look at things differently. Pony's parents are dead. He lives with his older brothers, Darry and Soda. He's one of the lucky ones. His friends either have no parents, or they have parents who don't care. Most of them are more cheerful than me! They've tried their best to enjoy their lives, but there really isn't much they can do to make their lives better. Most of them, especially Johnny, Pony's best friend, feel like they have nothing to live for. That's not true. They're all very, very special guys (for those of you who've read this, yeah, even Dally)-they just don't realize it.This is an amazing book-one that I could read again and again. I've never read a book more than once, but I could sit down with this one and read it from start to finish and enjoy every minute of it-time and time again."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"A reader's first impression of The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton is a story full of overwhelming violence and unwise actions. You will soon find out that its much more than that. It is a story about a group of boys who are trying to find their inner self and where they belong in the twisted world in which they live. They have to pretend to be people they really aren't. Throughout the story they are in a never-ending battle of rivalry.In a small beat up town in Eastern, Oklahoma a group of young teenage boys who all belong to a group called \\"Greasers.\\" The Greasers consists of Ponyboy, Dally, Darry, Sodapop, Two-bit, and Steve. They call themselves the \\"Greasers\\" as a trademark of where they live and who they are. They are in a constant battle with a group of rich teens from the other side of town. The group is known as the \\"Socs.\\" The Soc's consists of Bob, Randy, Cherry, Marcia, and the rest of the rich teens. The Soc and Greasers all live in a world of hatred and violence towards one another.One night things were taken too far and because of that Johnny and Ponyboy come to the conclusion that they must run away. Trying not to get caught, they sneak onto a train heading for Windrexville in the dark of the night. They reach Windrexville and hide out in an old abandoned church until things at home can settle down. Along the way the boys are faced with many difficult decisions. They decide to cut their hair to disguise themselves and because they are on such a low budget they have to buy supplies that will last a long time.After things settled down, Darry came to get Ponyboy and Johnny and bring them both home. While on the road they happened to see a church that was on fire. They rushed over to the church, jumped in the window and tried to save the children stuck inside. The next day Johnny and Darry find themselves lying in a hospital bed trying to recover from what happened. Then the worse thing happened!In my opinion this was a well-written story that everyone will find interesting and fun to read. The story helps you understand the difficult decisions life brings upon us and how you should be yourself. This is a book that everyone should read.

S.E. Hinton wrote a good book and you should try it out."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I first read _The Outsiders_ 19 years ago (the year that the film version was released). Hinton was all the rage to read in my high school and I was seriously attached to Ponyboy and Sodapop and the rest. Like many another teenage girl smitten by Ralph Macchio, I memorized the Robert Frost poem and cried buckets at the end of the book.It's funny to me to hear recent reviewers discussing the book in terms of its relationship to gangs, because I don't see it as being about rival factions. Instead, I see it more as a meditation on the price of having an inside and an outside to any given social context. At the time the book was written, it was the socs and the greasers. At my high school it was the Jocks and the Beegs. It's about people being judged by their clothes and their family rather than their abilities and their desires.Hinton's book stands up well to time-- I'm a lot more cynical than I was as a child and I couldn't summon tears anymore for the characters, but reading it I could still revisit the concerns that I had at the time and the world that this book represented.A good gift for young teenagers."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This was a book I had to read in High School. Though I wan't an avid reader, I loved it! Probably because it reminded me of the rivalry between the &quot;jocks&quot; and the &quot;freaks&quot; in my own High School.The narrator is Ponyboy, sensitive with a tough exterior. Since his parents are deceased, he and his laid-back older brother Soda are taken care of Darrel the eldest, who's a bossy perfectionist (really only worried that he might lose his baby brothers). There's Johnny Cade, whose family life is insufferable. There's Dallas Winston, mean and gruff (but has a soft spot for Johnny). And then there are the Soc's, the spoiled kids who like to pick on the greasers for fun (the &quot;fun&quot; runs out when their buddy is killed). And let's not forget Cherry Valence, who though dating a Soc has a heart and a mind all her own.While Pony and Johnny hide out after the murder, with Dallas coming to their aid and rescue, the 3 &quot;greasers&quot; temporarily clean the slate of all stereotypes and somehow wind up as heroes! If you're wondering how these events occur, go read the story! You won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book, which was written in the 1960's, may have well been written today. It describes the many conflicts between gangs, social groups, family violence, and friends. I was made to read this book twice when I was in middle-school, but even so I enjoyed it. Many emotions and thoughts surround the patrogonist, Ponyboy, who describes ganglife in the city. The book goes into many depths to develop the personality and emotions of every single character, and even from the view of the main character, you know the intellects of every little character. Every emotion is very sicere and well portrayed and not a detail is left out. You get a good view of human nature, feelings, and life. The story has a very moving plot that deals with family conflicts, murder, robbery, gang fights, friendship, social status, and loss. It does well at alerting the reader of the seriousness of gang warfare. Even though it expresses the many sad parts of life in the city, it gives a message that there can be hope and there is hope for those who have not lost the fight yet. This is an incredible book and definately worth getting. A must read!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I read THE OUTSIDERS for the first time when I was a teen myself, just a little bit younger than Ponyboy and Johnny. This book had a huge impact on me at that age. I fell so deeply in love with Hinton's simple, vivid writing style. Never had teenagers like me felt so real and present on the page. I couldn't stop telling my mom about it and how good it was and why. I'm sure she still remembers those nights. It is an oft-challenged book, unfortunately, and thinking about it now, I would have been devastated if someone had told me I couldn't read it or had come and taken it out of my library. I can't imagine not having read it then and I have read it so many times since. It's truly a classic and deserves the praise it's gotten over the years.Ponyboy Curtis is a Greaser. He lives on the wrong side of town. He acts tough, dresses tough, and lets his hair grow long to look tough. He lives with his two older brothers, Darry and Sodapop, and they barely make ends meet. Darry and Soda work hard to support themselves and let Ponyboy stay in school so that at least one person in the family can graduate high school. Pony's best friend is a sad boy named Johnny Cade who's been beaten around one too many times and spends a lot of time looking over his shoulder, anticipating the next blow. The only family these boys have are each other. Pony, his brothers, and their motley group of Greaser friends watch each other's backs and defend each other when necessary. Particularly when the Socs (rich kids from the other side of town) come looking for trouble. Dangerous Dally, funny Two-bit, somber Steve. Through Ponyboy's eyes we catch a brief, eloquent glimpse into the life of a group of teenagers the world seems to have forgotten, who take life's knocks on the chin and somehow keep going.I picked a small, worn copy of THE OUTSIDERS up off the shelf of a tiny used bookstore in Texas and took it home with me because I felt like the kids on the cover might be worth knowing. How right I was. This story of small-town prejudice and class warfare set in the 1960s has never really aged. The first time I cracked it open I was immediately enchanted by the magical language these kids seemed to speak, a language full of \\"greasers\\" and \\"Socs,\\" \\"savvys\\" and \\"tuffs.\\" I couldn't tear my eyes away. It is a coming of age story and a commentary on the dangers of going through life with blinders on, of judging people who are different from you before you know them. Of not wanting or caring to know them. Every character in this story is backed up against the wall, struggling to survive, and I cried more than once at the injustice of it all. And yet, when you come to the end, you feel the indomitableness of hope, the possibility of change, and the beauty of the human spirit. THE OUTSIDERS has been challenged several times on the grounds that it includes rough language, violence, references to cigarettes, alcohol, and for depicting broken families. And we would never want young adults to know that such things exist or, heaven forbid, that they may encounter them in their own lives. *eye roll* I get so angry when I hear hogwash like that. Never mind that it's beautiful, and real, and good. That it will teach its readers about how to treat their fellow human beings, how hatred and fear do nothing but destroy, and how the sunset looks the same no matter which side of the tracks you're from. That's the kind of book I want to read. That's the kind of book I want my children to read. And no one is allowed to tell me no."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"When I had to read THE OUTSIDERS in seventh grade, at first I was just like whatever because I thought it was going to be another boring book we had to read and why can't we ever get good books to read? But from the first chapter, that was it. I fell so hard I still haven't gotten up.This book was my inspiration for writing my own teen novels. It's one of those books that has characters you're so into you wish they were your friends. Well, first you wish they were real. And then you wish they were your friends and you could call them any time you wanted and be like, \\"Hey, Ponyboy, what's good? Can you meet up at Chat 'n Chew for some grilled cheese and backgammon?\\" That's what hooks you in from the beginning...the way this story feels so real. The intense energy of the dialogue and the fast pacing of the plot make it impossible to put this book down. And when you do put it down because you have to go to school or sleep or whatnot, you can't stop thinking about it, you can't stop wondering what's going to happen next. It's like you don't even know how you can get through the day without finding out.So I want you to be as hooked as I was and read this so many times that page 73 is falling out. Because this book makes you feel alive. And that's an amazing feeling."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This is MAX REVIEW with GriffenI am writing a book review on The Outsiders. This book is exciting, fast-paced, and a very enjoyable read. If you like action and suspense, then this is the book for you.The book begins in an Oklahoma neighborhood. Ponyboy, a parentless child, is going fine. Him and his gang are staying out of trouble, but still getting the usual gang fight between two groups; the Socs and the Greasers. The Socs are the rich, snobby people who drive around in their expensive cars. Then the Greasers, well, are pretty much the opposite. So anyway, Ponyboy is getting good grades in school, and everything is going great. Well, so he thought.The trouble begins when Ponyboy and the gang sneak into a drive-in theater. They meet Cherry, and her drunken boyfriends who don&#65533;t take kindly to strangers picking up their girls, and to make things sound worse, they are part of the Soc gang. Ponyboy and his gang get the drunken boyfriends to buzz off, and they walk the girls&#65533; home. The socs were gone for now, but their minds were set on revenge.After all that, Ponyboy and his friend Johnny are getting sick of things, so they decide to run away. But running away doesn&#65533;t turn out to be as pleasant as they expected. Leaving the house means vulnerable in fights, and they are the Socs main course. With saying this, you can expect that Ponyboy and Johnny are in a tight situation. So for that, they go to the one man who can help them escape, Dally. Of course, Dally isn&#65533;t pleased with lending them 50 dollars and a loaded gun, but he agrees. He sends them on their way on a train to a town called windrixville, which is almost the exact opposite of what their town is like. They stay at an old church at the top of a hill where nobody usually goes.After a few days of hideout and a few days of eating bologna they decide that hideout is not only hurting them, but other people too. An incident with them accidentally setting the church on fire puts not only them, but a group of kids on a picnic&#65533;s life in danger.So, what exactly is the fate of the kids in the burning church? Who will dominate the city, Socs or Greasers? Will Ponyboys life go back to normal? All this and more is in the book, The Outsiders, a book about understanding, decisions, and looking out for each other."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders was a fascinating novel depicting the life of a boy struggling to survive in poverty without parents. Having only two brothers to look up to, Ponyboy had to often fend for himself. While trying to stay out of trouble with the Socs, boys from the wealthier side of town, Ponyboy learned to depend on himself and keep his eyes close on his goals even with the many distractions he faced. Many times during this story, Ponyboy got into situations that ended up in fights. While being either strangled, threatened with a knife, or plainly just beaten up, Ponyboy learned to live a hard life. He was rescued in the nick of time, by his brothers, many times. Being the smartest and most focused Greaser of the gang, he set his sights beyond what the average Greaser could imagine. His goal was not to be the best street fighter in the gang but to get an education. He imagined a life free of the hatred between the Greasers and Socs, a life without fear and violence. Many Greasers could not live like that, but Ponyboy could. Ponyboy was different. This story takes us though the winding journey of conflict and heartache in not only Ponyboy's life, but in the lives of those closest to him.I recommend this book to people who would like to know what life in an inner city environment is like. This book will be exciting for all young adults for it addresses topics interesting for this age group. The action and fast paced tempo in the fights, hideaways, and rescues will bring excitement to any reader. This novel will teach any of its readers to be grateful for what they have and due to the many suspenseful moments throughout this novel, it will captivate the reader. I give this book an A+."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"In the city where Ponyboy has grown up, there are two major groups of teens--the greasers and the socs. Ponyboy is a greaser. He comes from a lower-class family and he wears his hair long and greased. His parents both died in a car accident, but he lives with his two older brothers, Darry and Soda, and the rest of the greasers in the neighborhood are like family.The socs live on the other side of town, and they seem to have everything going for them. They are rich and have their own cars. They have nice clothes and nice girlfriends, and their parents give them everything they could ever want. Those kids seem to take special pleasure in harassing or beating up the greasers. The two groups are constantly feuding, and the socs usually win.One night Ponyboy is out with another member of his gang, Johnny, and they are attacked by a group of drunk socs. One of them holds Ponyboy's head in a fountain and would have drowned him, but Johnny stabs him to make him stop. The boy dies, and Johnny and Ponyboy go on the run to avoid being tried for murder.I like the ways Ponyboy analyzes his world, trying to figure out why things are the way they are. I like that he doesn't just accept his environment. I also like the complex relationships in Ponyboy's family, especially his relationship with Darry. However, the rest of this book was a bit simplistic. Most of the characters don't seem three-dimensional, and their motivations for the way they act often aren't explained."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is about three brothers who must try to stick together in a rough neighborhood. The youngest brother is trying to find his identity and role in society while going through many ordeals such as trouble with the police and fights between the \\"Socials\\" and the \\"Greasers.\\" I believe that this book conveys many important values along with scenes common in our society today. There are disputes between different social classes as well as acts of heroism shown by Ponyboy at the burning church. The book starts out introducing the main characters and a little background on their place in society. The narrator, Ponyboy, is one of three brothers who lost their parents in a car accident. The oldest brother takes care of them and teaches them many values, which brought the brothers into a respectable life. Many events bring Ponyboy closer to realizing how other people think and where exactly he belongs.The American Library Association lists The Outsiders as one of the top 100 challenged books of 2000-2001 around the country. They reported it being banned for its violence, profanity, and drinking. I found absolutely no profanity in the book, although it does contain some violence and drinking. But the narrator in the book even criticizes drinking and prefers to avoid fights. One surprising point was that although the \\"greasers\\" carried around knives, they never use them to fight with. If they were going to fight, they used their fists instead of deadly weapons. This book should not have been banned because it critiques objectionable behaviors and certainly does not promote any of them."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The outsiders is a book about two gangs and their rivalry. It presents the friendship and love of the people in the gang. It's unique because it changed the teen books about crushes, prom queens, and cat fights into a truer, darker side of the world."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"i loved this book it showed commpassion and feeling. it a book that you may have to go back and read to understand. i read this book 12 times no lie. maybe cause it appled to me or i could just relate to it so well. its funny how this was from long ago but the difference in status figures still live in our towns. im only 12. but the book is about a gang of 7 ponyboy,sodapop,darry (the brothers)steve,two-bit,johnny,and dally. they are pretty much family. pony learns that if u are soc or a grease u both have fellings,a heart,mind even if it does not feel like it u do. pony has a hard life but lives it to the fulled each day. he also must learn that even if his oldest brother darry does not seem to care he loves him and can count on him. but he does not find that out till later on in the book even if soda,steve,johnny,and two-bit drill it into his head.i can not give any more away i tell you now to buy it. if they say its bad its not see johnny dies a hero bob the soc dies on self defence and dally goes crazy when johnny dies and is shot by the cops."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I thought The Outsiders was a great book. It's a real page turner and really relates to real life. The part I really liked was it was written by a teenager, S.E. Hinton. The author wrote it so people my age could relate to it and we could read it easier since it was written on our point of view.The Outsiders is about life. How you can live on either the bad or good side of the tracks which determines whether your a greaser or a soc. The greasers are regular people only they dress differently and aren't great off money wise. The socs are high class kids with a lot of money and too much freedom. The socs and greasers have always been enemies and are always getting into fights with each other. One great thing about the greasers is they are like one big family. For example, Johnny and Ponyboy get into a bad fight and a soc ends up being killed. A friend of theirs helps them escape police and hide out until things cool down. That just goes to show how tight they are with each other. They risk their lives and freedom for each other.I definitely recommend this book to all teenagers. Even if you don't like to read you'll love this book. It really touched me and I wish more people knew how things aren't always how they seem. To let them realize they shouldn't take everything for granted. I know I do now that I've read this book. I really hope hope teenagers all over will read this book and like it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Like many other people, I had to read The Outsiders by S.E Hinton for my English Class. I loved it. The narrator, observant but quiet Ponyboy Curtis, tells us that he loves to read books, and often compares things in his life to things he has read about. At the beginning of the novel, Ponyboy has a very shallow perception of the rich West-Side Socs on the other side of town. But as the story progresses he gains more and more perspective on friendship, brotherhood, and life in general. I've seen this concept of growing up so much in many other novels, but never has it been portrayed so uniquely and poignantly as in The Outsiders. As the dust of the storm finally settles, Ponyboy is able to remember the past fourteen days without pain and decides to tell others about it to prevent them from making the same mistakes. This was my favorite part of the story. The literary character of Ponyboy Curtis has inspired me to read more, but none will ever be as good as The Outsiders."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I saw the movie when it first came out years ago. I became &quot;fascinated&quot; by the lives of those boys. Ponyboy, Soda Pop, Two Bit, Darry, Johnny and others. I read the book, as if to continue my longing to understand them more in depth. After reading the book, I was even more entranced. Written from the view point of a 16 yr. old made it easier to relate to. To see these boys grow, living the consequences for their actions and literally grow from them, represents all of us in our pre teen and teenage years. They capture your heart, take you to a time where everything is different. Yet, is still familiar to us. I recommend this novel to anyone, young or old, who likes to read about trials, triumphs, understanding and friendships. The memory of this book and it's characters will remain with you forever. I can testify to that. I read the book in the 1980's and here, almost 20 years later, I'm writing a review on it. So please, give yourself or someone that you love, a chance to become wrapped up in the world of &quot;The Outsiders&quot;.... a classic that taught us that &quot;Nothing Gold Can Stay&quot;."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"\\"The Outsiders\\" was written in 1967 by S. E. Hinton andis a story about the life of greasers, people who live in the projects and generally have long greasy hair, in the 1950's and 60's. It is written as a first person narrative by a 14 year old greaser who lives with his two older brothers. Ms. Hinton wrote the book to illustrate prejudice in society and the fact that it is an unfounded bigotry. The book has some interesting and truthful underlying themes woven into it. It shows the different views of people from the stereotyped worlds of the greasers and the Socs, longtime enemies. The Socs are generally characterized as the rich kids who have everything, and the greasers are the indigent thugs with long greasy hair. We see how society favors the one and shuns the other due to the social standing which they have obtained from their money and looks. The Socs are loved by the people because of their appearance and seeming innocence, and if they do something wrong the incident is glossed over or blamed on somebody else. We see this when it is said \\"...Socs... get editorials in the paper for being a public disgrace one day and an asset to society the next.\\" (pp. 3). The greasers, however, hate the Socs because the Socs attack them just because of their hair or even just for fun. The greasers are looked down upon because they don't have nice houses or because their hair is longer, and society immediately looks to put the blame on them when something goes wrong, not caring whether or not the criticism is earned. Also shown is the fact that not everyone is like the few that the stereotype is based upon. Johnny is a kind, thoughtful teenager who is mugged by Socs just because he isn't clean-cut like them. There is also Ponyboy, who is a handsome boy who does very well in school, would probably fit in perfectly with the Socs, but is poor, and is therefore looked upon as scum. Cherry is a Soc who Pony meets at the movies. In his discussions with her he sees that the Socs can be caring and nice, and aren't all mean rich boys who beat up greasers for fun. Cherry even says \\"...if I see you in the hall at school or someplace and don't say hi, well, it's not personal or anything, but...\\" (pp. 45). Pony and Cherry love many of the same things, but can't be friends in public because Cherry would be scorned and ridiculed for hanging out with him, and Pony would be beat up for even trying to be friends with someone of such high \\"status.\\" \\"The Outsiders\\" brings to the front the problems of social prejudice and categorization that are evident in society, even today. The book shows readers not to discriminate against other people, and the consequences of such an action. Not only is it stupid to ignore and shun people because of social status or appearance, but also many great opportunities for friendships and relationships are passed up. S. E. Hinton did a magnificent job in portraying these truths, and in the process wrote a wonderful story."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I am now a freshman in high school and read &quot;The Outsiders&quot; back in 7th grade because it was required reading for middle school. At first, it just didn't intrigue me. I don't really like to read to begin with, but later I realized this was a great book! After reading it, and then seeing the movie...it made me want to read the book again. That's when I got all the details that I didn't catch the first time when reading it. &quot;The Outsiders&quot; is my all time fav book and the only book that I can read over and over without getting tired of it. --That's pretty good for someone that doesn't enjoy reading, right? hehe. I recommend this book for EVERYONE! A must read people, if you didn't get to read it in middle school! hehe =)"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Do you like story's with supense, action and feeling? Or maybe a story wich gives you the feeling that your living in it. Well if you do, the Outsiders is the book for you. I mean, if your a teenager, you'll like this book simply because of the way its written and if your an adult well you will want to be young again. S.E Hinton describes so well this book with feeling, hatred, love, friendship, loyalty and much more. When I finished reading this book, I hoped that I could've been in that period of that time and watch all of those events happen. I just finished seeing the movie today wich includes Tom Cruise as Steve, Matt Dilon as Dally, Patrick Swayzie as Darrie, Rob Lowe as Sodapop and a unknow actor for Ponyboy. The movie is exactly like the book execpt some differences like, in the book they talk about East and West side but in the movie they say North and South. Also in the book they say Socs but in the movie they talk about Socias. But in general it's very good. I suggest you read the book first and then see the movie. Anyways I give this book TWO THUMBS UP!!!!!!!! And I suggest it for any reader."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I have read this book 9 times. I can resite it word for word, but yet I still read it. I will never get sick of it. This book changed my perspective of life. This book is full of lessons just waiting to be learned.A few of these lessons are:To be prepared for anything that comes up. Expect the unexpected. Things can change so fast you won't relise in time to get prepared. Make the most of life. Life can end just as suddenly and unexpectidly as it began. One minute you have friends, and then the next you're alone. If you truly put your mind to something you can acheive anything. You shouldn't dodge your problems, or lie to yourself to make them go away, because they will just get you into more trouble. If you lie to yourself you may belive what you say, and then when you find out it's true it will hurt even more. And last, that having 1 or 2 really good friends is better then having a bunch of school friends,&quot;because thats what they are school friends not buddies.&quot; A book which truley deserved the Marget A. Edwards award, an award given to authors who open a window through which young adults can veiw their world and which will help them grow and understand themselves and their role in society.

I'm now pushing 34 and recently read it for the second time. What astounded me the most was that a 16-year-old female (Hinton) wrote a story from a 14-year-old male's point-of-view. Quite an impressive feat! It is a classic, heartwarming story of three brothers (and their friends) fending for themselves as well as against a wicked gang of &quot;high-society&quot; Socs. Of course, the protagonist's story goes deeper than that. My personal favorite part of the entire book was Robert Frost's classic poem, &quot;Nothing Gold Can Stay,&quot; because it has a personal touch, one I can relate to. I give it a four-and-a-half-star rating out of five stars. Highly recommended for all ages."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I first read this book in junior high for an English class of all classes. At this period of my life, I was going through a lot of teenage angst and emotions. When I started to read this book, it profoundly effected my life. The main character, Ponyboy Curtis represented how I felt when I was in junior high. I could empathize with the emotional turmoil that character was going through. I loved this book and till this day, love it. I highly recommend this book not only because it is thoroughly enjoyable, it also dealt with the emotions that teenagers go through whether they are a greaser or a social."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"In the past semester, we read an amazing book named \\"The Outsiders.\\" This is one of the best books that I had ever read. This is one of the books that had really made me think of many things; things from the past, problems in economy, and different people's point of view. Few days ago, we finished seeing the movie of \\"The Outsiders.\\" The movie was also great! With this movie I could feel the different point of view of the characters. If I could rate this movie form 1 to 5 I think I could give it a 5. This movie really caught my attention. I think that the movie was almost the same as the book because the characters almost always said the same think as the movie. The characters in the movie really made me feel their own feelings. The character that I liked the most in the movie was Johnny. He really acted really well. Also, the settings in the movie were really good; they were as I would imagine it. I really recommend you to read the book and then watch the movie, because if you see only the movie I think you won't understand it as well as if you would read the book.Maria Patron! 8A"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Last months we read the outsiders by S.E. Hinton, so I was able to share feelings with the characters and I could really feel I was in the book. Later, we had the great opportunity to watch the movie and this way, we could compare the characters, setting, and actually see what was happening. If I could grade this movie from 1 to 5, I would give it a 3. Maybe it's because I already knew everything that was going to happen. Also because it is kind of old and sincerely, some of the events were too fake. But the theme and lines of the movie are great and touching. I really like better the book, because it's more descriptive and touching. It is also longer and gives you an image that you can create however you want. The role of the characters was great. Soda was as described and so was everyone else, except Bob, I imagined him stronger and bigger, the same for Two-Bite. But Soda was handsome as described, Darry was strong, Johnny was small and so on. Also the fact that the dialogue was almost the same as the book, and mostly nothing was left out. The movie was similar to what I imagined it will be, though like always the image in your imagination is bigger than what can really be made."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"At first my language arts teacher handed us the book and all i thought was \\"Oh no, not another boring school book!!\\" But then we started reading it...

Even though the two groups fight it is nothing really serious until all that changes, but by the end of the book things start to get better. there are many themes to this book but two that really stuck out were: stay gold and stay loyal to your friends. this book is interesting, memorable, entertaining, and a classic that has taught me many lessons about life."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"In my opinion i found this book to be pretty good even though it isnt normally the type of book i read.

This book does include important Qotes and idvise for your future. It does not matter if you have fancy stuff to be happy.

Hinton from 1967, is a quality piece of fiction for people who want to read about real life and not so much \\"happy ending\\" and everything working out perfectly in the end. Its theme is about respecting others who are different and about the importance of family and friends in our everyday life. To summarize the book, it begins with Pony walking home from a movie theater alone, but he finds that the Socs, a group of rich west-side kids, are following him and are about to beat him, a greaser, up until his brothers show up. But this is a normal thing to the poorer greasers. Later, after he went to the movies again and met two nice Socs, then driving them home, Pony falls asleep in the car and comes home late. His brother Darry, his guardian, yells at him for this and ends up smacking him. Then Pony runs off and meets up with his buddy Johnny to go down to the park to cool himself off by the fountian. He thought it would be a good spot to cool down...until the Socs showed up. Then, well, I'll let you read the rest. The book is entertaining and memorable because it taught me that friendship is one of the most important things in a human's life in a series of dramatic scenes that keep me engaged and teach me values. So, if you want a book that is real-life, keeps you engaged, and has many good morals, look no further. Read The Outsiders!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is a gerat book about greasers and socs. they get into fights and big rumbles. the socs are rich and preppy. the greasers are handsom and poor. the socs fight the greasers when there is only 1 or 2 of them. this is a gerat book filled with excitement. it is by far my favorite book and i can almost garuntee it will be yours.

The main characters in the book are: Ponyboy, Sodapop, Dally, Cherry, Johnny, and Dallas.

It is a great heroic story that I think everyone will really enjoy. It is a really interesting story too, as Ponyboy and Sodapop run away. What made me also enjoy the book was how S.E. Hinton made up very interesting names in the story, and the book had a great plot. \\"I was wishing I looked like Paul Newman-he looks tough and I don't.\\" \\"But I guess my own looks aren't so bad.\\" These quotes are from the story, and they are really funny.I dislike some parts of the book, such as the names of the characters in the story, like Cherry, Sodapop, and Ponyboy., but the story was good.My favorite parts in the story is when Ponyboy said that he wished he was like Paul Newman, because it was really funny.

I wanted to dig my eyes out with a spoon every time I read the name Pony Boy or Soda Pop.Seriously a book about the inner city gangsters of Oklahoma written by a sixteen year old white girl? It sucked rocks. To this day thinking about this book makes my skin crawl.I was way ahead of my grade level at the time this compulsory read came down and it wasn't just the regression from what I was used to that bothered me.It amazed me how many of my peers liked the book. I also realized something about that tidbit, I was the guy who always had my nose buried in a book, this compulsory read was one of the few books many I went to school with has ever read, and they loved it. I was thirteen at the time, I readThe Stand By Stephen Kingthe same year, I readThe Wolf's HourandThe Chronicles of Narnia (Box Set)two years earlier, plus a slew of other stuff in between. On the same note I readThe Gunslinger (The Dark Tower, Book 1)that same year and soon followed with the other two books released at the time and began the eager decade plus wait for the series to continue. Perhaps my dislike of this book is tied to having read more adult oriented and classic books?I've got respect for S.E. Hinton as an individual. Really, writing this book in defense of the under class perspective is one of the reasons I respect her as an individual, but seriously the book itself makes my head hurt, I would rather go get a few teeth drilled than have this book put in front of me again.I'm getting a lot of bad ratings on my review. I'm not changing my stance or deleting it. I am honest and I respect honesty, I occasionally give people thumbs up for making statements I disagree with as long as I think they're being educated and honest.

There is plenty of exciment in this though for you adventure seekers, but I like mysteries soyou guys may rate this very well, howerver for my review I do not like this book"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I rated it 1/5 stars in the count of it keep dragging on and didn't hold my interest during my whole time readying the book.This book was boring. I had to read it for school for my sophomore year. I felt the plot was mixed up and all over the place and sometimes I found my self zoning out because I was lost and bored.This book is about two fighting gangs one is a poorer gang and one is a rich gang. Also this book has a lot of violence, and killing. The author should have made this book to be more detailed and graphic so some of the members who read it would pay more attentionI don't recommend this book if you don't like bloody and violent books. Also if you have a lot of patients and can stick to the book."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. I was forced to read it in my English class and I hope I never have to again. S.E. Hinton does a quite shabby job of portraying the boys in this novel, whose abominable grammar is irritating and difficult to understand. The plot is ridiculous and the dialogue is poor; I found myself laughing in the most serious parts of the book. The characters are interminably dumb, and their actions are equally foolish. Hinton adds an obnoxious air of melodrama and sappiness to the story in so many parts. Ponyboy's inept attempts to be poetic and deep annoyed me especially. The characters also set horrible examples for today's youth with their inexcusable and absurd behavior. I advise you all not to read this book unless you are prepared to undergo extreme boredness for a good laugh at mediocre writing."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders was a really unrealistic book to read in this age...teenagers may not be able to relate or connect to the characters, nevertheless try to understand why these fellows in the book turn out the way they are at the end.

On the other hand, the \\"Socs\\" like to jump the people they fight and have an unfair amount of people. There is alot of action throughout the book, even in the first chapter.

Everyone comes to realize how deep and serious their divide is. This is a magnifcent story you can visualize the words that it looks so real in your mind because the auther describes the words so perfect.

Hinton's \\"The Outsiders\\" is an excellent book. The narrator, which is also the main character, gives a good view of all the problems in that time.The book is about the rivalry of two gangs. The Greasers and the Socs. The Greasers are considered ruffians but on the inside they are really actually good kids. The Socs (in latent terms) are over privileged snobs. They have everything they could every want. They look down on the Greasers because they are a lower class than them and also because they put grease in their hair (that's one way they got their name Greasers).This book has a lot of lessons in it but the main lesson Hinton is trying to teach is to just accept each other's differences and to just be a good kid. This book is excellent for kids 6th grade to 10th grade.The Outsiders has a good story line and good characters. They all have their own problems and they also have a way of working threw each others problems. The book moved at a fairly slow pace but if it moved any faster I think it might have lost some of its luster. If you like books that are based on the old days when gangers were scarce but dangerous then this book might be a good one for you. For me it was.Kiyoshi"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The outsiders by SE. Hinton was a really great book. This is the most interesting book I have ever read. It shows true relationships between children in their teen years. The book shows how the world has problems with fighting in gangs. The main charactor in the book is Ponyboy. He lives with his brothers, Sodapop and Darry. He is one of a gang called the Greasers, he acts tough but really he is unlike all of the others. He is more sensitive and looks at the world differently, thats why he is my favorite person in the story.This book is very exciting, I defenently recommend it to the readers who enjoy danger and real life drama. The exciting violence in the book was great! You should deffenently read this book if you want to really feel involved in what you are reading.I really liked the book because it showed the good and the bad in people. It showed that your friends have your back. And people really are'nt all that different from eachother on the inside. I usually really dislike to read, but form even the first chapter in this book I was hooked and I could'nt put it down. This is the best book I have ever read and I will always remember it."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"When I first began this novel I was expecting very much not to like it. I was completely wrong. The book was one that I was not able to put down. The endless twists and turns kept the book interesting, and the conflict between the \\"Socs\\" and the \\"Greasers\\" was well developed.The book gave a good background on how gang life could be, as well as showing life from the eyes of a child who has lost his mother and father. Life at home was tough for Ponyboy having to deal his overprotective brother Darry. When it got real bad he ran away, or at least tried to before those \\"Socs\\" almost killed him. Ponyboy learned a lot about life and seemed to grow wiser as the novel went on.The two gangs were completely opposite in the novel. This is what caused the endless conflict between them. Every little disagreement ended in violence and at some points, death. In many scenes I had the urge to step into the book and stop everything because it was getting out of hand. It was ridiculous what these groups would do to each other, and they never held back. Although I disagreed greatly as to how they handled these conflicts, the outcomes were well written and believable.The book taught me a lot about how life might have been for kids my age at an earlier time period. I have heard a lot about how gangs were very preeminent in the past. The book showed a lot about friendship and how to stick up for each other. These kids did whatever it took to protect their fellow gang member, even if it meant getting in a whole lot of trouble. The book also made me think about what it would be like if there were gangs like this at my school. How tough life would be on everybody. Sure my school is very cliquey but it never really results in a rivalry between groups.I would recommend this book to anyone who is in for excitement and anyone wanting to learn about true friendship. The book keeps you guessing till the end, but amdist the rivalry there is one boy learning about life on his own the tough way."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"After you read the book The Outsiders you will find out that there is a lot more to life than being rich like the socials. Money don't run the world like the socials think. How would you like it if sum one shot your best friend over a stupid reason. There is a lot of lesson's to learn in this book.Bob and his gang beat up the greaser's because they are less fortunate and they get in a big fight over it the rumble. These guys where not playing .Later in the story two of the Greasers runaway because of what they did to one of the socials they return a week or to later.Poney and daily can't push what they did away. So just like with it you can try to fix it but you can't fix everything know mater how hard you try.Poney loved to go to the moves by himself of course every time he went walking home he had to watch his back. he let the life he had effect what he did. But should he have.Both of the gangs should had left each other alone and no one would had got hurt."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"My story is about The Outsiders. It is a very good book that has knives, guns, and fast cars in it. They are called The Outsiders because they are not really poor, but they are not rich either. They do not have the best cars in the world, but they are theirs. They like them. So, that is all that matters. Every time that there is a fight or a rumble the cops take them to jail, and not the soc's. They carry around knives, well all except for one. He is named Pony Boy. All of them do not like the sunset, but Pony does. He met a girl that liked him and liked sunsets. She had class. Well she was not like what he and the guys were used to.Johnny and Pony were walking the girls home from the movie. They saw the girls boyfriends and their friends. They said to get in the car to the girls and she started saying that he was drunk and she didn't want to. The girls got in the car to not get Johnny and Pony guys in trouble. They drove away. Johnny was still shaking because he saw those heavy rings that were Bob's prized possessions. They saw them later in the park that night. They started to fight and Johnny saw that Pony was getting drowned by Bob. So he stabbed Bob in the back. They ran over to Bucks to get Dally to help them. Buck's house always had a party going on. Buck said that Dally was in the bedroom. So Pony and Johnny thought that they knew what was going on, but Dally got punched in the ribs and broke some of them. Once they got on the train they both went to sleep. They got off of the train and then they saw that there was a farmer walking down the road. Johnny said to Pony to go and ask where the hill was. They had to go to that hill because it had a water spicate around the back of the abandoned church. I believe that they should have just said that it was just self defense instead of running away. I believe that they should not have gone in the burning building to save those children just because they started that fire.I believe that they should have just stayed in town and wait for the people to find them instead of panic and run away to that old church. They should not have went there because there will not always be an abandoned church to run to. I believe that in heart Pony does not like to be in all of the rumbles. I believe that when Pony thought that Darry did not love him I thought that it would have burned his heart out if he did not better. I believe that Soda likes to be in the gang just so he can have something to do. I believe that Darry would have told Pony if he would have known that he felt that way. I believe that they would quit the gang if they thought that they would die."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The book was about three brothers with without a Father or a mother, there names are Ponyboy, Soda, and Darry.

One day one of the Greasers kills a Soc with a knife. Everybody thought that Ponyboy did it but it wasn't. The person that did it was a hero and a murderer. He was a here because he saved all the children in a burning Church. But, then he get hospitalized because a big burning stick jabbed right into his back and made him paralyzed from his back to his legs. He dies a few days later of internal bleeding.I liked the book because it was very realistic. It was also scary, too, in some places. But most of all I liked it because it was a suspense book. It was realistic because it showed how the character acts and thinks. And another thing was when I read the book I couldn't stop reading it. I just kept on reading it.I chose the book because I found it on the shelf and I heard that it is a good book. Plus my teacher told me that it is good. I usually look at the back of the book before I read it and check if it is well written or whether it is not.

The reason that I chose this book was that not one person said that it was a bad book, and i agree with them. The book is about two rival neighborhood gangs, the greasers and socials, who always get into fights. The greasers are low class kids with long greasy hair, are dirty and walk everywhere. The socs, which is short for socials, are higher class kids that wear kahki pants, white tee shirts, and drive around in expensive cars like corvettes. They always get into fights after johnny killed a social when he and ponyboy were attacked at the play ground. Read on to find out what happens in the rest of the novel. I would recommend this book to anyone over 12 because of tobacco usage, alcohol, and violence."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I read this a few months ago. I loved it right from the moment I had it described to me. It just sounded like it'd be full of conflict and emotion, the two things that--in my eyes--make a book good. And it was. Every part of it just draws you in, and it makes you think. It also teaches a good life lesson, which is something rare in books today. The only thing that sort of got on my nerves was that each conflict kept right on coming after another. It should've been spread out more, easier to take in. The book can be really intense, but I really recommend it."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is a great book which deals with important issues: poverty, death, and gangs. Ponyboy Curtis is a 'greaser' (someone who is poor and lives on the east side of town) and is constantly at war with the soc's (the rich people who live on the west side of town). Ponyboy lives with his two older brothers, Darry and Soda, and they watch out for little Ponyboy. The only other people Ponyboy can count on, are his gang/buddies. One night Ponyboy and Johnny commit murder and leave the town and go into the country. From this point in the book on, tragedy happens to people all around Ponyboy.The Outsiders shows the difficulties one can go through when someone a person loves dies. The book also shows the hardships people who live in poverty and bad neighborhoods can go through.I recommend this book to all teenagers. There are many points in the book where I could not put the book down. If you are looking for a book full of suspense and action, then The Outsiders is for you!HAPPY READING!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is a great book based in the day's of the Greasers. In the day's of when either you were rich and had it all in life, or you were from the other side of the tracks and were looked down upon. The book mainly focuses on the two gangs the Socs (the rich kids) and the Greasers (the poor kids). Booth of these gangs have to struggle to see who is better. This is a great book because it talks about how life was realy like back in those days. It wasn't all moon light and roses. I think everyone can relate to at least one thing in this book, there is something in it for everyone. I recomend it to everyone young and old."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"There's a struggle between the two gangs, the greasers and the socs in this city.

Ponyboy and Johnny were part of the smallest of the gang and are best friends.One night, a few socs comes up to them in a park, and starts drowning Ponyboy, so Johnny pulls out his blade, and kills a soc, and the others run away. After that, they have to protect eachother, and find help from the gang because they couldnt get away with it.

She absolutely loved it and was trhough it in no time."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The title of my book is \\"The Outsiders\\". I think \\"The Outsiders\\" is a good book because it has to be a good book for me to stay interested in something that long. What drew me to the book was that the first time I met my moms dad he told me about how he was a greaser and my mom was telling me to read that book \\"the outsiders\\" because it explains a little of what he went through so I read it. The genre was science fiction. The setting was back in the day when \\"greasers\\" and \\"socs\\" existed. The Protagonist was Ponyboy and his friends and the antagonist were the \\"socs\\". The conflict was when one night Johnny and Ponyboy were going to run away after Darry had hit Ponyboy because he had stuck up for Soda pop when Darry was yelling at him. When they got to the park \\"socs\\" had come looking for a fight with them because they were talking to their girlfriends. So when the \\"socs\\" attacked Ponyboy Johnny got his switchblade out and stabbed, and killed the \\"soc\\" that was drowning Ponyboy after that they ran to Dallas hang out and he helped them get away. Poor Johnny would have to have that guilt all his life the guilt of someone having lost their life because of him. The theme of the story is life is to short don't live it in evil and lies don't do bad things live a good, happy life without trouble, and drama. I recommend this book to people who can sit and read about peoples sadness, and bad mistakes."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Xavier TorrezEnglish 9/75/20/12Mr. ReedIf you were to say the phrase \\" Stay Golden Ponyboy, Stay Golden \\" amongst a group of friends they would all know what you were talking about. The characters in this book are one of a kind, they aren't your typical gangsters. Outsiders is one of the most thrilling, exciting and ageless novels that has ever been written. It will keep you hooked until you finish reading all one hundred and eighty pages of it is a brilliantly written story about a group called The Greasers and all the hardship they must face because they are hood. I am not a big fan of reading books at all but after I read this book it restored my faith that books could be fun to read and interesting so overall, I think this book was amazing and it totally kept me hooked the entire time!The outsiders is about a group of Greasers and the Greasers are considered hood and thugs. They are all close in a way whether it be because some of them are family members or are just friends. The greasers all have a group of mutual enemies. These other teenagers know as the Socs pretty much look down upon the greasers and think they are a waste of life. The Socs are a gang also but unlike the Greasers they are all rich white boys who drive mustangs and get the pretty preppy girls. The story is about two young Greasers and the hardships and discrimination they must face simply because they are hood and are from a different side of town. In the story, one extremely difficult event the Greasers will have to deal with is the death of a fellow Greaser who was loved by all and \\"was a like a kid brother\\" to the gang. Also, two of the younger Greaser boys will have to endure being away from their friends, family, being fugitives because they end up being wanted for murder.The main characters of this story consist of Jonhny, Ponyboy Curtis, Two Bit, Dallas Winston (Dally), Soda Pop Curtis, Darrel Curtis, and Cherry Valance. Johnny is a sixteen year old Greaser and even though he is not good at school he approaches things with a steady concentration. Jonhnny is the son of alcholic, abusive parents. He is sensitive and shy and since his parents do not care for him he sees the greasers as his true family. In turn the older boys, particulary Dally, are all protective of him. Ponyboy is the gangs fourteen year old narrator of the story and he is also the main character. Ponyboy's interests in books and academic accomplishments make him different from the rest of his gang. Because his parents have died in a car accident, Ponyboy has to live with his brothers Darry and Sodapop. Ponyboy struggles with his differences compared to the other greasers as well as the social class division with the Socs, violence, innocence, and familial love. He matures over the course of the novel, eventually realizing the importance of strength in the face of discrimination. Two Bit is the joker of the Greasers. Two Bit is a wisecracking Greaser who regularly shoplifts. He prizes his sleek black-handled switchblade. He instigates the hostilities between the Socs and the Greasers by flirting with Marcia, the girlfriend of a Soc. Dallas Winston, A.K.A Dally is the toughest and most hood out of all the Greasers. Dally is a hardened thug who used to hang out with gangs in New York City. Dally's violent actions make him one of the more dangerous Greasers of the group. He takes pride in his criminal record and is very protective of Johnny. Sodapop Curtis is Ponyboy's \\"happy go lucky\\" handsome brother. Sodapop is the middle Curtis boy. Ponyboy envies Sodapop's good looks and charm. Darrel Curtis is the oldest of the Curtis boys and the guardian of them all. Everbody calls him Darry and he is a twenty year old Greaser who is raising Ponyboy and Sodapop because their parents died in a car crash. Cherry Valance plays a important role in this story as a Soc cheerleader.The authors name who wrote the magnificient novel ,The Outsiders is S. E. Hinton who was born and raised in Tulsa, Okalahoma. She was an avid reader as a child and started writing by the time she turned ten. Her early stories were about cowboys and horses and she preferred plots with rough riding and gunfights. When Hinton reached her teenage years she was not interested in reading because she could not find any books that were interesting to her. At that the time adult literature was too advanced. The types of books written for teens at that time were all very sweet and innocent. To satisfy her own tastes she decided that she wanted to write her own novel. One that consisted of violence and really depicted a realistic story about being a teens life. She created a character called Ponyboy and she wanted to record some events of her high school experiences. She took things that happened to her and people she knew in her life and used them as inspiration to create a story of two differnent groups of teens who butted heads constantly because of their differences. After working on the novel for a year and a half, she let a friend's mother read it. The mother liked it enough to refer her to an agent named Marilyn Marlow of the Curtis Brown Agency. A contract offering publication arrived during Hinton's high-school graduation ceremonies and the wanted to sign her. The Outsiders was published in 1967 when she was only 17 years old. Later on long after her novel The Outsiders was published she was presented with the first Margaret Edwards Young Adult Author Achievement Award.After reading the book The Outsiders I would definitely give it a 8 out of 10. I would give it such a outstanding score because it is a very realistic look into the lives of these teenagers and there is a little bit of somethign in the story that we can all relate to. It's a great story that will keep you hooked the entire time you are reading. I think it is a good book for all ages but most especially for teens. Teen life can be tough and the book gives you the perspective of the struggling, yet caring Greasers. This books emotional events whether good or bad have the ability to get you hooked on reading and wanting to keep reading to know what happens. Like I said, I am not much of a reader but I really like this book. I especially think this is a great book because it is unique from other types of teen novels. For example the current teen novel series, Twilight is not realistic because in real life, struggling relationships don't all end up in a happy \\"guys gets the girl\\" type of ending. As most teenage relationships go we all know that doesn't happen in real life! The Outsiders is also unique because it is more reaslistic in todays society and the struggles of teenagers, the different social classes and kids have to grow up at a young age due to crises an losses of loved ones in their lives. If you are not from the hood or a struggling teen this book gave you a realistic emotional look into the lives of others and makes you feeling like you should be more understanding and caring for the struggles we all endure. The storyline was unique to anything I have ever read and it kept me on a roller coaster of emotions because I could relate to some things. It will also have you laughing your butt off one moment then the next moment you're grinding your teeth angry wondering what the dirty Soc's will do next. So overall I think that this book was great and you should go out and read it. You will NOT regret it.And remember ............\\"Stay Golden Ponyboy, Stay Golden\\"!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Ok, this book was required for schol. The teacher gave us a quiz after every chapter which totally ruined it in my opinion. If the stupid teacher hadn't ruined it, it would have been really good. So thats why I gave it 4 stars. I liked Ponboy, Sodapop, and I hated Darrel until he started crying when he saw Ponyboy at the hospital. Overall it was super sweet and taught a good lesson. Buy and enjoy:)"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"My child had to read this book in junior high. He found it predictable and boring. Under the current curriculum of his school, the teacher spent a lot of time reading the book aloud to try to get even the kids who couldn't read well to appreciate it. Having to listen to a lot of the book made him dislike it even more. This may not be a good book for kids who read a lot. Teachers should assign Catcher in the Rye, East of Eden, and/or The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn instead and perhaps break the class into smaller reading groups so not everyone is forced to go through this book. After discussing The Outsiders with my son, I can state with certainty that he didn't get anything edifying out of this book.To be fair to the author, the reading teachers I've met seem to very much like this book and enjoy reading it aloud. I give the author a lot of credit for writing this book as a very young woman. School assignments should have a purpose, however, and I'm not sure what students are supposed to achieve by reading The Outsiders or having it read to them."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Even Though The Book Is 8.00 I Think The Book Is Worth It.

See if you like it?"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Want to read a good book that will change your life? Well then grab the The Outsiders. This book taught me many lessons in life. It shows that people should solve their problems by talking to each other instead of fighting. You'll meet the main character named Ponyboy who is the youngest in the group. He is a strong thinker. He does not think it is right for people to kill each other, but all of his friends seem to want to solve problems that way.Ponyboy is part of a gang called the Greasers. They are always fighting with the Socs. It seems they have always been enemies. The first death is Bob from the Socs. Ponyboy's friend Johnny kills him in a jumping because Ponyboy was being harassed. Ponyboy felt horrible. Johnny and Ponyboy ran away to a church. Without giving away the rest of the book, you won't believe how the Socs and the Greasers end their war with each other.When my teacher first assigned the book, I felt overwhelmed. I felt like I was going to die because it was too much! But then after a while, I really got into the book and it was so realistic. The author wrote the book with such detail, that I felt like I was one of the characters. I really related to Ponyboy because I agreed with him. I liked his decisions. He always cared about his friends."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I thought the book was pretty good, cause it is a very exciting book. The book was about two gangs that never liked each other and they were always getting into fights and arguments. My favorite character was Ponyboy, cause he would stick up for his friends and he looked out for everybody. My favorite part of the book was when Ponyboy and Johnny were running away because Johnny had killed a boy that was trying to kill Ponyboy. I would want other people to read this book, because I think that it was a very good book, and people who like adventures would like it.READ THIS BOOK VERY GOOD!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I think that the most important thing that the author wants the reader to know is how we are really like this in real life. There are really social classes.She wants you to take a step back from your life and ask yourself,where do I belong? Am I the stuck up snob? Do I judge others who are different from me? Or maybe am I the \\"outsider\\"?Why this is important is because this is all to real. We treat those who are different than us less than we treat those who are just like us. If we were all the same the word unique would hold no value.I think that S.E. Hinton does an outstanding job recreating everyday life."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The OutsidersWritten By S.E Hinton...Period 3The Outsiders is one of the most exciting books I have ever read.It is full of danger, which kept me eager to read on to the nextpage. The Book is mainly about hierarchy. There is one group called the Socs, and another group called the Greasers. The Greasers were of the lower class, refering to being the less fortunate. The Socs were of the higher class, refering to being very wealthy. Between both classes they shared the same atitude. Which left anger and hate between each class.The Socs were as tolerant as Hitler was to the Jews, same as to the Greasers. Though the difference between the Greasers and the Socs in this book is that they the Socs would go out looking for trouble to make with the Greasers, and the Greasers were more than terrified to face these Socs. It is common in many movies that I've seen that the Greasers would always dominate over the wealthy crowd, such movies as Cry Baby and Grease. In this case the wealthier class dominated over the Greasers, which made them the Outsiders.This Novel had seriously changed my overall prospect of what I thought about life back in the 50's. The writer made me confused because the Greasers were terrified of the Socs. I always thought socs were just rich squares, as the Greasers would put in Cry Baby. This situation kept me reading on. Not only that but alot of action and danger kept me reading on. It would take me at least to the fourth chapter to get to the exciting parts, though it only took me to the second page and I was already leaping for the next page eagerly to know what would come next. The book was very interesting because the excitment took place before the rising action, and the climax. Thats one of the reasons why I like this book.\\"Johnny was one of the smaller guys in the gang, we kind of felt sorry for him because he got torn up by the socs, he was even pulled to his head with a gun, and the socs left him on a street, blood all over his body, the socs had given him a haircut\\"As Pony(one of the Greasers)described.\\"I had started to run though it wasn't untill I was grabbed that I noticed that they were the socs.They had threaten me, that they were going to give me a haircut, I reached for my pocketknife in my boot though it was too late.\\"If you are one of those people who hate reading till the next chapter to see if something exciting happens, read The Outsiders, it will have you leaping out of your chair in excitment. The Outsiders is action packed, with street fights, conflicts between classes, and even homicide. I liked this book because of the climax."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Well, I first saw the movie The Outsider's in my English class. I REALLY liked it and decided to read the book.

In The Outsiders your either a Soc or a Greaser. A Soc is a rich kid, Socs have fancy cars and nice homes. While Greasers have live in poor environments, beat up cars and don't make much money. The story about The Outsiders is mainly about Ponyboy and the previous events before a great big rumble that takes place between the Socs and the Greasers. The book and the movie both have the same plot, but some of the events are left out or have been changed.Some points in the movie were shot very accurate to the book. Like the Robert Sheldon murder (or you could call it when they whacked off poor Bob) That part was almost exactly like I imagined it in the book. The actor that played Dally performed him very well. Dally was the same cocky, tough, young, handsome and reckless greaser that was described in the book. When Dally was running across the lot away from the police, I thought that Coppola did that part beautifully. Again it was as though I was reading the book. Same exact pictures, it was so close to what I imagined it was scary.There are some things in the movie that I thought were different in the book. Like they left out Ponyboy being jumped in the beginning, the court hearing, Ponyboy and Johnny jumping off the train, they changed the part where Randy and Ponyboy talk and they also left out the teacher giving Ponyboy the school report. There was one more thing that really bothered me, all of the Greasers and Soc's looked like they were in their mid/ late twenties. I mean the book described everyone as high school aged kids and early twenties.I thought that movie and the book were both well done, and of course the book is better than the movie. The movie could be edited so that it is more like the book, only by adding in parts. I would also change some of the actors so they don't look like old people I mean god. It would be better if they were young kids, and looked like young reckless kids. Other than that the movie was a good version of the story."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The book I read was the \\"Outsiders,\\" by S.E. Hinton. This story takes place in a small city where there are gangs. One gang is labeled \\"Socs,\\" and they are basically the punks of the city who live with their parents. They are more on the wealthy side. The other gang, the Greasers, are more of the poor, less fortunate, and tough kids who grease their hair back. The narrator \\"Ponyboy,\\" lives with two other guys named Darry and Sodapop. Ponyboy's parents died in an automobile accident and now he is allowed to live with the two people he calls his brothers. He can only live with them if he stays out of trouble and keeps his grades up in school. The Socs go around and beat the lives out of the Greasers until they are unconscious or their faces are rearranged. One day all of that turns around thanks to Ponyboy and his best Johnny. They are on the run when Johnny did something not even he thought he would do. When they hop a train and reach their destination they realize what happened and it wasn't their fault and they turn around to go to the police after two days. On the way back they save kids from a burning building and their doing of a good deed pays off. I really enjoyed this book a lot. It taught me really good lessons in life. It also goes to show that if you get into trouble how to take the best path away from it. The last thing it shows to me is that your best friends can end up saving your life one day; and always hang on to what you have. I highly recommend this book preferably to male teens for better understanding. The reason why is because it has to do with fighting and more to do with male issues that females might not enjoy. This is an awesome book so read it."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I recommend that people read the Outsiders .It is one of my personal favorites .It is heart warming and full of action, drama , and feelings.

I oringinally thought it was a book about baseball, because the name was similar to the outfielders, and i didn't want to read it. But soon i picked it up, and i surely thank my father for reccomending me the best book ever!It is a story about Ponyboy and his friends-Soda Pop, Darry, Jonny, Dally, Steve, and Two Bit-they are the greasers. The greasers are a group of people who wear a lot of grease in their hair and don't have very much money to buy clothes, so they are placed at the bottom.The Socs, who are rich compared to the greasers are known for jumping the greasers-this is where the story starts. It is a wonderful story of truth, belonging, friendship, and hope. The characters make you feel for them-you angry, sad, adn all the other feelings they feel.Please, pick this book up and read it. You won't regret it.Love the #1 fan Ashly"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Im in 8th grade and \\"the Outsiders\\" was asigned to me to read in school.

I feel like i know each character personally and i love them so much. Im not exactly a greaser myself, but whatever, im close to it. This book was sooo exciting that i really wished it was real. im surprised we're reading it in school. The teens are constanly fighting,10 yr olds are smoking cigarettes and most of them are shoptlifters...its awesome! This book is especially exciting for young adults who prefer the wild side and love action. Anyone can read it and enjoy it though, its my english teacher's fav. book and she certaintly doesnt live a wild life....if you havent read it yet you really should! This book it one of my most prized possesions and will forever be in my heart."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The novel, The Outsiders, written by S.E. Hinton was a very intriguing book. This novel shows the differences of two gangs, the Socs and the Greasers. It is also a story about three brothers who lost their parents in a car accident. All the characters in this book will have to go through very interesting challenges and obstacles in this book.The main character in this book is Ponyboy Curtis. Ponyboy is the younger brother of Sodapop and Darry. Sodapop is the middle sibling of the Curtis family. When Ponyboy's parents died, Darry, the older sibling, takes care of Ponyboy and Sodapop. Ponyboy is very academic and is a star on the school track team. Ever since Ponyboy's parents have died in a car crash, he became very rebellious to Darry. Ponyboy and Darry fight very often. Throughout the novel Ponyboy will realize that Darry is not that bad as a parent figure and he will learn to live with him. Sodapop is a high school dropout and is the happy-go-lucky sibling of the family. Every character in the book shows great respect for Sodapop because most of the time, he kids around but when he is serious, people listen to him and take his advice. Sodapop always listens to problems that Ponyboy is having. He also makes sure that Darry is not too hard on Ponyboy. Throughout the novel Sodapop became more serious and did not kid around as much. Darry had to drop out of school and work two jobs ever since his parents died so he can take care of Pony and Soda. Darry gave up his dream of attending college so he can be the father of the family. At first, Darry was not a good parent because he was letting Pony and Soda eat chocolate cake for dinner and stay out for as long as they wanted but later on in the novel, Darry will learn how to become a caring parent. When Ponyboy is sick, Darry will bring him soup and sleep with him to make sure he is okay. Ponyboy's best friend is Johnny and Johnny is part of the Greasers. Johnny's parents do not care for him as much as Darry cares for Sodapop and Ponyboy. Johnny really did not know much about the world until he read the book Gone With the Wind. Johnny started realizing the good parts of life through nature. Dally is probably the most troubled Greasers of them all. Dally does not care for anything but he does feel guilty for other people's mistakes. Two-Bit is also part of the Greasers and he is the joker of the group.The chapters of The Outsiders were broken down very well. I would say that the turning point of the novel happened in chapter 4. In chapter 4, the Socs were drowning Ponyboy in a fountain but Johnny did something extreme to help save Ponyboy's life. In another chapter, Ponyboy and Johnny saved a bunch of kids from a burning church. This really showed how brave and caring Ponyboy and Johnny really are. Even though Johnny was brutally injured in the fire, he said it was all worth it saving those kids. When Johnny was recovering from his injury, all the Greasers went to his hospital room and made sure that Johnny had every thing he wanted. In another chapter, the Greasers and the Socs wanted to settle everything for the last time with a big rumble. This was a very exciting part of the book because it finally solved all the problems between the Socs and the Greasers. At the end of the book, the Curtis family realized that when times are tough, that they should stick together.A major theme in this novel is loyalty. Johnny showed how loyal he was by saving Ponyboy when he was drowning in fountain. Another example of loyalty is when the Greasers helped Johnny recover from his injury by getting him anything he wanted. Another theme in this novel is leadership. Johnny showed a great deal of leadership when he saved the kids from the burning church. Darry is also a leader because he helps take care of Ponyboy and Sodapop. The last theme in this novel is the separation of social classes between the Greasers and the Socs. The Greasers are the lower class and the gang that lives on the east side. The Socs are the higher class that lives on the west side of town. Throughout the novel, you will learn that even though the Socs and the Greasers look like two completely different gangs but the main character Ponyboy will learn that everyone has problems and people are not always different on the inside.The Outsiders really shows the importance of friendship and how friends are always there for you. I liked everything in this book except that there are too many characters in this book to remember. I would still recommend this book and I think it is a must-read."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"40 or 50 years ago this might have seemed like a topical, edgy story. Today though, it seems irretrievably dated: the slang, the bifurcated social world, the emphasis on petty crime and \\"hoods\\". The character's evolution through the story's traumas has some mild interest, but now much of it comes across as trite. Again, perhaps a book for its time, but for a time that has passed. For ESL and English students, there is not much that gives insight into modern life, and it is plain wrong to give them misspellings, bad grammar, and ancient slang as content worthy of language study. For ESL purposes, especially. Older readers might enjoy this trip down an old, old path."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"stay gold ponyboy stay gold... Those were on of the last words that pony heard from on of his close friends. The outsiders is a very powerful and stunning novel.

They are at a constant struggle with one another, then something tragic happens to one of the socs a greaser killed one of them. As soon as the soc fell the war began and a tragic list of events unfolded. This is a great book for people who dont like reading as well as people who love to read! 5/5"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I hate when people treat you like an \\"outsider\\" like you dont belong there,like there better than you but, you are because nobody is better than you.Thats why i love this book ,because it explain that.so if you ever have the chance to read this book DO It, you will not regreat it."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders, written by S.E. Hinton, took place in the life of 14 year old Ponyboy Michael Curtis, who was part of the gang known as The Greasers. The Greasers were from the East Part of Tulsa, Oklahoma, and were generally surrounded by poverty. The nickname, The Greasers, was given to them from the one thing they took pride in, their hair! The boys' had long hair that was slicked back with hair grease. The Greasers had one enemy, a rival group called The Socs; a shortened form of the word Socials. The Socs were from the West Part of Tulsa, Oklahoma, and were rich and popular. The Socs were raised in good neighborhoods and were known to have fancy cars and beer blasts for no reason.Ponyboy's life was great until a car accident occurred killing both of his parents. Ponyboy had to live with his two brothers, 20 year old Darrel (Darry) Shaynne Curtis, and 16 year old Sodapop Patrick Curtis. Pony was the youngest of the brothers and the protagonist of the book. Pony was smart and unlike the other Greasers, he liked school. Pony was good at school and didn't like to cause trouble in his classes. Ponyboy liked sunsets, and wanted to live in the country where there was no labels; just people. Pony was very close to his brother Soda and thought his oldest brother Darry hated him and wanted Pony to be in a boys home away from him. Darry was Pony's oldest brother who was very strict and cared for Pony's well being. Darry was tall broad-shouldered and muscular. Darry wanted to go to college but because the accident he was forced to work and take care of his brothers. Darry was an athlete at school and his name was commonly known throughout school. Darry kept his hair unlike any other Greaser; which was short. Pony knew Darry didn't belong with the Greasers and he could be a Soc, the only thing holding him back was his loyalty to his brothers. Sodapop was the middle brother of the Curtis family he had \\"Movie-Star good looks.\\" Soda was happy-go-lucky, and was very carefree. Soda had a girlfriend named Sandy, who later moves away to Florida. Soda loved Sandy and thought she could be his one true love until she moved.The rest of The Greasers included Johnny Cade 16, Dallas Winston-17, Keith (Two-Bit) Matthews-18, Steve Randle-17, and Tim Shepard who was 18. \\"If you can picture a little dark puppy that has been kicked too many times and is lost in a crowd of strangers, you'll have Johnny,\\" says Ponyboy. Johnny was raised in a home with no love, just anger and violence. Johnny was often beat by his parents and stayed with the Curtis family a lot. Johnny had black fearful eyes, which become even more fearful when he was jumped by a Soc and severely beaten by someone with rings. Johnny's face has scars from the beating. Johnny never walked alone and carried around a six-inch switchblade in his back pocket from then on forward. Johnny is considered everyone's kid brother whom they all protect and love. Dallas Winston who was fondly referred to as Dally, not to be confused to with Darry. Dally is considered very dangerous and very tough. Dally robbed stores, jumped little kids, and hit on girls frequently. Dally is rude and tough to everyone but Johnny. Two-Bit is the joker of the gang. He always had a smile on his face and lived for action, just like Soda. He loved fighting, his switchblade, and blondes.The Greasers and Socs were rivals but Pony made friends with two Soc girls whose names are Sherri (Cherry) Valance and Marcia. Bob Sheldon, one of the Socs is dating Cherry and often jumps Greasers.The story was mainly about the struggles in the lives of the Greasers and the mischief they get into. When Pony and Johnny committed a crime killing someone, to save Pony's life, they go to Dally for help. Dally told the boys to go to an abandoned church. The boys go to the church and stay there undercover for a while. They needed to stay away from the cops. The boys cut and bleached their hair to hide their identities so they will not be caught by the police. While at the church, the boys became heroes as they saved a few children's lives. Johnny became hurt doing this good deed and ended up in the hospital. Pony was caught and had to go to court for the crime he committed. The penalty was being put into a boys home.No matter what, the Greasers stayed loyal to each other. Over the course of the whole book loyalty became one of the main themes. The only thing that kept The Greasers together was the loyalty that they had for each other. When Johnny committed the crime, Pony didn't leave him. Instead Pony went to the church with Johnny and tried to take the blame for him.Another theme in the book was friendship. In court Darry and Soda are asked how their friendship with Dally is, because he had a criminal record. Both boys didn't deny being friends with Dally instead they said they were like brothers. This proved that they did not care what people thought of their friends because that was one of the only things they had left.Social groups was another theme in this novel. The two groups The Greasers and The Socs both have their share fair of problems. In the beginning of the novel Pony tells you how The Socs have the perfect lives; and have no worries. Throughout the story you realize that The Socs have just as many problems as The Greasers. Bob Sheldon, being one of The Socs is spoiled rotten and is never disciplined. Through the story you find out that all Bob wanted was some discipline but never got it, his parents always blamed themselves for what ever he did wrong.I definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes to read. The book was fast reading and easy to understand. Even though the book is old, the emotions and the over all feel of the book are still relatable to this day. The plot of the story makes you want to laugh, cry, and jump all at the same time. The characters were fun and rebellious; making the book hard to even put down. I read this book in a ninth grade English class where we read each day chapter by chapter. I can honestly say I finished this book before the class did because I wanted to know what happened next."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The OutsidersS.E. HintonGreasers, always getting into trouble. Socs, always getting all the praise. Ponyboy is a real smart kid with nice brothers and great friends that he can really count on. Where Ponyboy lives, there are two sides, the Socs, and the Greasers. The Socs are stuck up rich kids who have beer blasts and go around wrecking houses and jumping the Greasers, and Greasers are the more less fortunate that steal things, drive old, beat up cars, and have a couple gang fights here and there. Ponyboy, is a greaser, along with all his brothers and friends. His parents died in an auto-wreck when he was younger, and ever since, he has to be on his best behavior or else him and Sodapop will be put in a boys home. When Ponyboy and Darry get in a fight, Ponyboy runs off into the dark night with his best friend, Johnny. They go to the lot so Ponyboy can cool off, when a group of Socs show up, and jump Ponyboy and Johnny. While Bob, one of the Socs, is drowning Ponyboy, Johnny takes out his six-inch switchblade and kills Bob. Now, Johnny and Ponyboy go to Windrixville to lay low for a while until things aren't as crazy back at home. Ponyboy and Johnny stay there for a week or so, then Dally comes and takes them out to eat for a while, but when they go back to the church, it's on fire! Johnny, Ponyboy, and Dally go in to save the kids that were playing inside, and when they get them all out, one of the beams fall on Johnny, and all you hear is Johnny's terrified scream. Now Johnny is in the hospital with a rumble coming up, so the whole gang knows Johnny won't be in it this time. Ponyboy goes to see Johnny as much as he can, until the night of the rumble comes. They go to the lot and have an all out war with the Socs, until they see them run away. They won! Then Dally and Ponyboy race to the hospital as fast as they can. They got to Johnny, but he was still dying. It shocked them, and hit them hard, but they never gave up. They tried their hardest to keep him alive, but it didn't work. He still died. Later, they got a call from Dally. He just robbed a store, and was on th run from the cops. The gang rushed to the lot, but when they got there, Dally was holding up a gun, it wasn't loaded, but it still didn't stop the police. They shot right through Dally, and he was dead before he hit the ground. It was harder to take now then before, two of Ponyboys friend's were dead. In the end, Ponyboy decided he could tell people about his experience he had, starting with the English assignment. So, he wrote what happened, and he told people.This book was really interesting and I couldn't stop reading. For example, when the rumble came around, I wanted to know what happened next, and if they won or lost. Also, when Ponyboy and Johnny got jumped, and had to run away for a while, I wanted to see if they got caught and put in jail, or would just be forgotten to where they wouldn't get in any trouble. Another thing is when the church caught fire, it made me want to know if the kids died, or if they would become heroes.This book was also very old-fashioned. For example, the cars and all the clothes they wore, like jean and checked jackets, and mustangs and madras. Also, the way they talked. I don't think I hear people going around and saying \\"bopper\\" or \\"golly\\" anymore. Even the way the girls dressed, it was very old-fashioned. They wore neckties, had really curly hair, and wore sweaters wrapped around their shoulders.Most of all, this book was a tear jerker. When Johnny got caught in that fire at the church, and all you could hear is his terrified scream, I thought he was going to die right then and there. Also, when I read at the beginning, that Johnny had been jumped by a group of Socs, and he had big gashes in the side of his head because he was hit by rings, I was shocked. And at the end when Dally and Johnny died, I cried really hard, because Ponyboy just lost his two best friends, and I don't think I could handle that like he did.I recommend this book to a person who loves a tearjerker and old-fashioned book about a guy who lives his life as best as he can. I really enjoyed this book, and it kept me reading for hours on end. So, hopefully, someone else will love it as much as I do.W.Wilburn"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Outsiders is a book about a 14 year old named Pony Boy and his friend Johnny. Pony Boy lives with his two older brothers in a town with two rival gangs. Pony Boy and his brothers are in a gang called the \\"Greasers\\". The Greasers are the poor gang who live in the ghetto part of town. The other gang is called the \\"Socs\\" who are the rich gang and live in nice part of town. Pony Boy and his friend Johnny got in a big fight with the other gang and killed one Soc. They left town to hide from the Socs and the Police.My favorite part in this book is when Johnny and Pony Boy saved the kids in a burning house. This is my favorite part because they are just boys who didn't have much and they went into a fire to save children. They sacrificed their own safety to save kids in the burning house. Johnny got stuck in the house and was saved by another Greaser. Johnny was burnt so badly he died.I would recommend this book only to certain people because if someone is not interested in the struggles of gangs and killing then they wouldn't like it. If you like a story with suspense and struggle this is a very good book. It is interesting to know what Pony Boy does with is life and see the problems that he has to face everyday as a poor 14 year old without a mom or dad and in a gang. This is also a very interesting book because it is not just about gangs and killing it is also on how Pony Boy helps his friends and other people around him."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is an awsome book, its my favorite. It is about gangstas like me and fagget socs like the preps. Johnycakes is just like me, he stabed a soc in the back when he was drowning one of my boys and ran away to an abandon church which ended up on fire. Also, theres this kid dallas winston that stole a magazing from a store and got shot down under a street light, hes just like me too. So i recomend this book to anyone whos almost as gangsta as me, even though none of you are even close. Iight peaceeee.word"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I loved this book because you never know what is going to happen. Plus I think it's wierd that people would go into gangs.

I would recommend this book to people who are ages 11 and up and people who love reading about life so, in other words everyone should read this book. The book is about two very different kinds of teenagers and there nightmare of violence. In this book two boys named Ponyboy and Johnny who get into some trouble some bad trouble like killing someone not just anyone but a soc-Bob. Soon a riot begins between the greasers-a rough, tough gang with long greasy haired boys from the wrong side of the tracks, and the soc's- the rich kids with all the breaks. I think this book will make a difference to anyone that reads it. You can relate to the characters which is great and it shows that no-matter how different people may seem they really are simular and can be going through the samethings. This book is exciting, suspenseful, sad, adventurouse, and educational, I highly recomend reading it."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"'The Outsiders' by S.E. Hinton was the best book i ever read. Our teacher also read some of it to us. It has good, bad, sad ,and glad times in it. This book should definatley have a sequl. S.E. Hinton should make one. If she ever reads this.... MAKE A SEQUL!!!!!!!! This book was soooo good. I cant really relate to the book but it still was the best book i think i ever read. i recommend this book to girls and boys over 13. You need to be a little older to understand some things that go on in this book. i gave this book 5 stars becuz i think it was really good. ive now read it 4 times in a row and i still want to read more. Ponyboy in a way is like me. Not knowing what to do with yourself that you really need to search for your inner self. Everyone should read this book. My fav charcter was Dally.

A gang called the Soc's a cold-hearted bunch of rich kids is against you, your friends and your family. What Pony Boy does when he finds out that the (fuzz) cop's want him to go to jail, and his brothers and friends are in danger?This book is a great thriller. I like this book because it makes me feel like I am there watching every thing happening. The Outsiders showed me that people aren't different because of how rich they are or the color of their skin. It showed me that a lot of different people want the same thing from life. If you ever need a book to read, read The Outsiders. The author, S.E. Hinton, was only 16 years old when she wrote this book.I think people from age 10 and up would love this book. If you like adventure, drama and action books this would be a good book for you. Boys and girls would both like this book. The Outsiders is a great book and I found a lot of meaning in the story.The Outsiders is my favorite book ever and I think everybody should read this book.

It was fun to read and educational at the same time, imagine that, a book that is educational but fun. wow... its the end of the world. The book is told from Ponyboy Curtis's point of view. His parents have died and he lives with his brothers Sody and Darry. These three and their many friends (Dally, Johnny, Two-Bit, and Steve) make up the Greasers, who are a gang in a constant 'war' with the Socs. They battle the Socs, parents, society, other people, amongst themselves, and other teens and young adults. The book is an accurate look on the affects of the life of a teens problems in modern society. It is a well written book and S. E. Hinton really knows how to catch your attention. If you don't have money to buy this book, I suggest you go out and get it from a library. Thanks for taking the time to read this. :-D"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"In the book \\"The Outsiders\\", by S.E. Hinton, many of lifes problems are symbolized through the actions of two groups of teenagers; one the Greasers and the other, the Sacs. The story is told by Pony Boy Curtis who belongs to the Greasers , who are placed further down on the pyramid of society. Pony boy reveals to the reader how tough life can get for everyone, and how it truly isn't fair. I am positive that all who read this book will definetly biuld a relationship with its realistic adventures. We have all shared a time when stealing and cheating felt like the only way out and in this book your are brought into the life of those who live this way day to day.It demonstrates the importance of character no matter who you are or where you live. Mainly this book shows the collision of both these groups and how among the many things they argue about there both really going through the same thing. Both sides demonstrate brotherhood and the ability to survive under harsh conditions. This book will attract all ages because not only does it symbolize the hardships we go through in our lives and how we all need to give up so much to get so little back. However, we learn how to be strong and most importantly how to win. For example Pony Boy Curtis tells the reader to \\"stay gold.\\" these two words show that no matter were we stand or what we beleive , we still share the same sunrise and sunset."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I enjoyed reading 'The Outsiders'. It's a fun book to read and informative aswell. I am not the book type of person, but I read this book like there was no tomarrow (even though i knew there was). The main charicter Ponyboy Curtis lives with his two brothers Soda and Darry. Darry is a tough, dad-like brother while Soda took up the caring mom-like position. The three have good and hard times even though both their parents have died. These three are also part of a gang called the 'Greasers' who are in an ongoing battle with the 'Socs'. Other members of the 'Greasers' are Dally, Two-Bit, and Johnny. This book contains realistic views of the life of teens and how they go through conflicts in school and at home. The book also contains the sort of relationships teens are involved in with friends, enemies, girls or guys, brothers or sisters, and parents. I highly recomend this book to anyone looking for a good one. Thanks for taking the time to read this."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I would recommend this book to any one young and old.

We had to read it for school (7th grade) and by the summary on the back it sounded pretty stupid.But by the first chapter I couldn't put it down. While reading this book I felt as if I was part of the gang. I could picture every little detail about the town they lived in to the way they talked. I could see the pain and sadness in Johnny's eyes when he remembered getting jumped by the socs. I gained a frendship with Ponyboy and it seemed as though he was my best friend and that I had know him all my life. I could imagine how the greasers slicked their hair back and how the socs road around in their tuff cars.And by the end of the book I knew what &quot;stay gold&quot; ment. Ponyboy,Johnny, Dally, and all the others, they were gold. They all were different in their own way but they were all the same. They just fit together like a pieces of a puzzle and when Johny and Dally died the puzzle would never be quite complete. It woulad always be missing those two pieces. I think that S.E.

That's all I have to say"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This is definitely the best book that I have ever read. I was totally absorbed in it.

I don't think I've ever read anything this good, and this is one of those special books I look forward to reading again and again. The Outsiders portrayed life as it is, and it's expertly written by someone who knows. When our teacher told us it was written 30 years ago by a 16 year old girl, I knew I HAD to read it. Read it yourself--you'll be doing yourself a BIG favor!!! :)"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I had to read this book in my eighth grade English class and I really didn't enjoy it at first. I was bored and decided to read ahead. I soon found myself drawn into the book. All of the characters are so extensive and real. I was amazed that S.E. Hilton was able to write this book at the age of 16. By the end of the book, I had to fight back tears. The casual language and potent imagery portrayed by Hilton made me feel like I was there with the Greasers. I felt a special tenderness for the family relationship that existed between Pony, Soda, and Darry. I am the oldest and I know if anything happened to my parents, I would feel that same need that Darry felt to protect and provide for my two younger sisters.The Outsiders is an excellent book and S.E.

What makes this book all the more special, is that it was written by a teenager, who was experiencing frustration. A must read for teenagers, and even adults. I recommend."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I read The Outsiders in junior high school back in the late 70's, and still like it; I finished it again, just today. I could sorta tell that S.E. Hinton is a female given some of the observations the main character, Ponyboy, made of people in his life during the story. It's a cool 'guy' story, but at the same time is rivited with human emotion across the spectrum, manifesting itself in the usual places, life's circumstances and human relationships, usually betraying an inner suffering. It's a bummer that orphaned adolescents raise themselves on chocolate cake, cigarettes, beer, and pepsi, but by the end of the story, the main characters have shown promising growth through life's circumstances that the reader is left with a certain optomistic outlook that there could be something in the future for them.

I loved reading this book, everything that the movie left out. You read this through the eyes of Ponyboy Curtis, and you learn what it is like to live life on the other side of the tracks, as greasers. You also feel a contempt for the socs, but also somewhat of a self pity for them as well. You read this and you understand his life, along with his brothers, Darrell and Soda-pop. This book also gave a more accurate description of Dallas Winston, and Two-bit than what the movie portrayed. You cherish the way Johnny is viewed in this book by the others in the gang.It is probably easy for people to believe, but my favorite chapter where the rumble occurs. It gives a lot more detail, and you can feel every punch, every kick and every throw delivered in this work of art.The movie was well made, will never exceed the quality of this awesome work. I could read this over and over and never get sick of it!

They have 2 different groups and they hate eachother. And they're the east and west side groups. And if their seen on their territory they get beat up by the jocks. Almost or in the middle of the they have a rumble on whose the best on each side. I like it when they save the kids from the burning church and the the part I didn't like was where his friend burns his back and dies from it. Because of why he was saving the kids from the burning church. This book is really good and I do recommend other people to read this book, because it's about courage, and other emotional problems. In this book they can get courage from it and not to even be scared of the bullies. (...)I like Ponyboy, because he as not like those other guys in the group. He had more manners than the other guys and he was nice to this girl. I don't think I hate any character in the book. He made the readers feel what the characters felt when they were scared or having problems. The reason why i love this book, is because the teenage boys have many problem like us. And they don't know how to deal with it. He made me feel like i was their watching what they went through. He had a good writing for the book. The way he wrote it i could see what was happening in the book. i liked the writing because it made sense to me when i read the book.

Then one night when his friend kills a soc. The murder gets to him, teaching him that pain feels the same whether a soc or a greaser. I would say more but I don't wanna give the rest away.

Ponyboy is an execellent example of a teen who has more to live for than fighting alongside his friends and brothers in a feud between rival gangs: Greasers and the Socials. The Greasers represent the less fortunate group of teens, who have no money, no adequate education, and most of all, a loving family. Ponyboy, as one of the youngest members of the Greasers, thinks about the reality he dwells in. He realizes that with his parents gone, it is up to his older brothers, Sodapop and Darry, to raise him well and love him. Sodapop, being the friendliest of them all, nurtures Ponyboy with love and dedication. Darry, on the other hand, is the oldest and most strictest of them all. Often correcting Ponyboy for his mistakes, Darry and Ponyboy sometimes have difficulty getting along. However, Pony realizes that Darrys' reason for his tough exterior is because he assumes the role as the man of the house. It is his responsibility to raise Ponyboy and Sodapop so that they may grow up to be successful. Ponyboy at first seems like a weak, stoic, and shy type of teen, but as this episode of the story progresses further, he becomes metally strong and sticks to what is right. In the midst of maturing into a young adult, he encounters enemies and friends. His best friend, Johnny, is younger, but is more like an older brother to Ponyboy. It is they who stick together until the end, evermore expressing how powerful their friendship is. Reading The Outsiders is a must for all kids of any age. It is books like this that will help young children and teens grow up heading towards a successful adulthood, because the latter stage in life is deeply affected by the former stage. Reading this, a person may come to realize that growing up is difficult and requires strength, sacrifice, honesty, and courage. This will help children prepare for whatever their life may unfold."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I think that The Outsiders is a very good book for older kids.

It is a very thrilling book about Ponyboy and Johnny on their adventure. It is a very interesting book. There are two very different groups of people the Greasers and the Socs.Johnny and Ponyboy are attacked by the Socs and Pony is almost drowned Johnny pulls out a knife and kills one of the Socs. Pony and Johnny run away to an abandoned church. Later they go to eat at DQ and there is a fire in the church and Johnny and Pony run in to save a bunch of school kids. Johnny is badly burned. Later in the hospital Johnny ends up dying. The greasers have a brawl with the Socs and the greasers win. This book is a very good story about teens in a rough neighborhood and they have a hard time getting through life. I would give this book 5 star on the way they portray the scenes. This is a very good book. It is a must read for you!!If you haven't read this book you are missing out. It is a very good book and a must read. The gang fights between the greasers and the Socs cause chaos in the city. People are getting killed as a result of their feud. It sparks a beautifully laid out novel by S.E. Hinton. If you are looking for a thriller this is the book for you. I think anyone who likes to read will like this book."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book was not what I expected. It had a thorough story and plot, which was very satisfying for a young adult book, as well as good details of settings and events. The characters and their personalities are developed very well. You can relate to them, and you expect the events to have happened to a real-life person. When you read about the main character, Ponyboy, and his misfortune and all the difficulties he went through, you feel pity torwards him. And when you read about Johnny's death, you can feel Ponyboy's shock and sorrow. That is what I mean by well-developed characters. The themes are another high point of the book. The themes S. E. Hinton chose to write about, especially those about life and how to use it, are interesting and thought-evoking. They make you think about the characters' actions as well as your own experiences. For example, Johnny's letter written to Ponyboy is full of wise words, and is where the theme fully comes out.There were a few things that turned me down from reading this book. For one, nearly all of the characters smoke and many are under the legal age of 18. Another point is that the greaser characters, including the main character, are okay with stealing and breaking other various laws and rules. But overall, this book is a good read for anyone."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book is amazing! I absolutly love the theme which is to never judge a book by its cover, since looks can be very decieving at times. I also really like the characters & their personalities because they're totally believable. My favorite character is Dally. He portray's his image as tough & cold-hearted, but actually he has a soft-spot within him. He treats Johnny like his younger brother & helps him & Ponyboy when they're in trouble. Overall I'd give this book five stars:)"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The book on CD was really great! I used it with my junior high class. It enabled them to hear the story and really get caught up in the story!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"\\"The Outsiders\\" is a classic novel about growing up and finding yourself while the world around you seems to be crumbling down. It focuses on a particular gang of greasers(A.K.A.

You won't be able to stop turning pages as the gang experiences things that keep you both entertained and inspired by their bravery. S.E.

Read the book. Do it for Johnny! And stay gold."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The book was amazing! I really fell in love with it and with all the characters. I truly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders, by S.E. Hinton, was a very fascinating book about a boy in a group called the Greasers. His parents died in a car crash and he lives with his 2 brothers that take care of him. He gets into mischief with one of his pals, but something happens that isn't for the best. I'll let you read to find out! He is in a gang that is \\"low class\\", which fights with the \\"high class\\" gang called the Socs. One night it gets a little too rough.The setting of The Outsiders is not like the world I know at all because its based in the late/early 60's in a town with 2 different sides: the Socs and Greasers. S.E. Hinton really makes you feel like you're part of the story because she explains how it's rundown and not a happy place to be. She can make you picture it if you close your eyes. The author really makes you believe the characters are real people because they seem exactly like how these teens would be. I really liked all the characters because they all seem real, but other people might not like Dally and Steve. Dally thinks he's the best and the only thing he truly loves is Johnny. Steve just seems to be mean to anyone who is smaller than him especially Ponyboy.The themes of this book are always fight for what you want because Johnny fights to save Ponyboy's life. Also never give up on what you want because Ponyboy finally got what he wanted, for him to know his brother Darry loved him. The genre of this book is mystery and suspense. It might also be considered drama because of what happens.I loved this book because it was very descriptive and fun to read. I liked learning how life was back then. I think you should read this book because you'll really enjoy it. Every part of the story made sense, like everything happened and you knew why it happened. I really encourage you to read it to have a lot of fun even if you don't like to read like me.I would recommend this book to anyone who is up for a great book. If you don't like to read, I think you will like this book. I hate to read, but I couldn't put this book down. I'd recommend this book to anyone because it's just a good book and I think anyone would like it. I hope you use my review and maybe read this book because I know you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton is a book about a gang of guys who don't have a lot in life. They are constantly getting jumped by the Socs, a gang of rich kids. There is constant violence between the two gangs and it gets to some of the boys. The fights between the two gangs usually consist of only fists. But one night someone takes it too far.The book takes place in the late 50s early 60s. It is in a rough part of town. If you've ever been to a rough part of town, you can relate to what it's like in the place The Outsiders takes place in.The Socs are the \\"enemy\\" in The Outsiders. S.E. Hinton makes you hate them. They are always jumping greasers just because they don't have as much money as them.Ponyboy is the main character in the book. He has two older brothers, Darry and Sodapop. Ponyboy is the youngest in the Greasers, but he is one of the smarter ones. He gets into some trouble with his friend Johnny. You'll have to read the book to find out what happens.I think that The Outsiders is a good book.There is a lot of action in it, so I would recommend it to anyone who likes more exciting/violent books. There arn't a Iot of dull points so it keeps the reader hooked. It is a good story of friendship and brotherhood."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The boys in The Outsiders live on the rough side of town and have many struggles. Even though I don't have a rough life I can imagine it must be hard.S.E. Hinton does a good job by making you feel like you were there. It was easy to picture fights the Greasers and Socs get into, it made you feel like you were there. You could also picture what they all look like and when they talk it's like you can hear their voices.Since the Greasers live on the rough side of town and don't have much money they weren't as clean as the Socs were. The Socs were preppy and drove nice Mustangs, while the Greasers walked or drove rough beat up cars.In the book I liked Johnny and Ponyboy the best. They always stick up for each other and help one another with family and fights. Ever since Johnny got jumped by a Socs though he has been skittish. They both don't like fighting but if another Greaser was about to get killed or beat up they'd be there for them.I didn't like Darry so much though because he didn't handle situations with Ponyboy very well. His anger over powered him. Darry is a rough character, he went through a lot and he is the parent in their situation.Overall I thought this was a really good book. It showed that even though people do categorize others no matter what we all see the same sunset, and you would know what i mean by that if you read this book."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The OutsidersBy: S.E HintonReview by: Nick ScarlettI thought The Outsiders was a great book overall, even though I'm not into the whole hoodlum scene. S.E Hinton really did a great job for her first book, which she wrote when she was 16! The setting was very realistic and well described, however I do not live in an urban city so that makes it harder for me to relate to the setting in this book.I found this book to be interesting, because it's tough to live without any parents. I think the 3 brothers did a fair job going from being protected by their parents to having to watch their back 24/7 and having only each other for support. I would suggest this book to anyone looking for an adventure through life and death, and happiness and sadness."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Her first novel, and it is impressive for a debut.

They grow up together and fight together.My favorite part of the book was the big gang fight towards the end of the story. It started out with Darry taking on anyone who dared to. He ended up fighting someone he already knew. After they began fighting, both groups charged and began fighting. Ponyboy was injured during the fight and ended up missing a lot of school because of it. This was my favorite part of the book because it had tons of action and was a critical part of the story.There are several reasons I love this book and suggest it. Anyone who likes a story about sticking together, action, violence, and getting into a trouble, this book is definitely a book you would enjoy. Also, despite all of the violence, the book stlil has a great message.

It's about finding family through friends, and having each others back. My favorite part of the book was when Ponyboy was with some other members of the Greasers at the drive-in movie theatre. They had met a couple of girls who later turned out to be the girlfriends of some Socs. Even though that would cause some trouble later, Ponyboy realized that the girls he met were really kind, sweet, and understanding people. That showed him that not all Socs (or rich people) were horrible people. I would recommend this book, i didn't think it was excellent, but it wasn't bad either. It had some really good morals and lessons, like loyalty and friendship. I thought the characters were realistic, and each had their own unique personality. I didn't care so much for the \\"battles\\" between the Socs and the Greasers, only because the book ever really explained why the two gangs were always fighting. I would consider this book to be more male oriented, simply because most of the characters were male. If you like to read,(even if you are a girl) try The Outsiders and see for yourself."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This is a great book! It rocks! I like all of the charcters except the Socs.

Hinton's novel The Outsiders is a strong hearted story about different gangs and /or types of people that are separated by their social classes. Ponyboy, the narrator of the story, along with Soda Pop and Dally are members of the lower class gang. Throughout the story, Ponyboy is torn upon a few difficult decisions, which are all based upon being lower class. The \\"Soc\\" the higher classed gang is constantly causing trouble with the lower class boys the \\"Greasers.\\" Many things result from the conflict between these two gangs to form the outcome of a great novel."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The novel The Outsiders written by S.E Hinton, is a moving and touching story. The main character in this story is Ponyboy Curtis. He is a part of a gang named the Greasers, which is the low social group in this small town. The next gang is the Socs. It is made up of rich boys who are rarely suffer consequences of the things that they do.S.E. Hinton uses many writing techniques to show what kind of people the characters are. He uses lots of dialog and an extensive vocabulary to develop the characters. He uses descriptive words to create a feeling for the place and time. He even uses the names of the gangs to show what kind of people belong to them.Throughout this novel Ponyboy and his friends show amazing daring. Ponyboy and his two brothers, Darrel and Soda, show a remarkable amount of love for each other. Since their parents died in a car accident they have to stick together. Darrel serves as the father figure for Soda and Ponyboy. He keeps everything in line and never gives up on his brothers. Ponyboy and his best friend, Johnny, demonstrate the power of loyalty when they are jumped by the Socs; Johnny has to kill one of the Socs with a knife to keep them from drowning Ponyboy. They run away together so that Johnny will not be caught. They show their courage by going into a burning church to save some small children, an event that eventually costs Johnny his life. Once again, the protagonists demonstrate bravery and selflessness.I think this book is great. It is a moving novel in which courage and friendship are illustrated over and over. The characters in this story stick together and become like a family. If you are looking for a moving novel that shows power of the human soul, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I have just finished reading The Outsider novel and I have just one word, Wow!

In this book the Socs were the upper class, and the Greasers are the lower class. It shows how life is in the lower class people in the city. For example, if a Soc was caught with a Greaser girl he would be beat up. Also, Greasers have to go to their own bars and stores. And whenever they are not in their own hang outs they get jumped by the Socs.I think that everyone should read this book.Even though this is a fast read, it really is a classic."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I have read and insane number of books in my day and I am only 15 years old, some so incredibly moving and some so horrible they make me cry. When I read the outsiders it seemed to me that i was in the story, I could feel what the authors was writing about or trying to say in this book, that is how good S.E. Hinton wrote the book The Ousiders.

It is such a beautiful story with such a deep and wonderful message for every single teenager in the world. When I saw the cover of this book, I thought it was just going to be about hot guys that have girlfriends and are rich, but I was wrong. I was amazed and shocked with myself when I noticed tears running down my cheeks. I cried a lot when I finished reading this book, and now that I'm writing this and remembering all that happened in that book, I can't control myself and tears and running down very quickly. If I ever have a chance to talk or to meet S.E. Hinton, I would probably tell her all I felt when I read that book. She had broken my heart with all this and I want to thank her for making such and amazing and beautiful book. I would recommend this book to everyone I know including everyone single soul in this Earth."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"If you like gang fights this is the book for you.

It was an action kind of book, and it was fiction. I liked the book so much that on a scale of 1-10 I give it a 9.999. This was the kind of book that people like to read but learn something from. The book took place in the city. The main idea of the book was a bunch of kids fighting because some are wealthier than others. Then one of them died, and because of that another one killed himself, then one got sick and almost died but got better and didn't. The kids in the book realize what life is and why it's important. It was a good book"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This is a Book I'll never forget. The characters seemed so real, it really made the reader care about them. The end of every chapter left you in suspense, I loved this because I could never put the book down. it just made me want to keep reading until I finished it. I hope readers to come will enjoy this as much as I did. This was not only a good story for readers who enjoy mystery, but those who enjoy suspense also.

Hinton!!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The characters in this book are excellent, and I think that the author really describes them well. It was like I was almost there. I could see their faces, and I could picture their lifestyles. It's a very sad book , and keeps you glued to each page. I read it in about three days and plan on reading it several more times in the future.I'd reccomend it to young junior high students because some may be able to relate to a lot of things that happen in it. I think that some of the sad parts really made me think about how rough some kids have got it like the &quot;greasers&quot;, and how some kids have got everything &quot;socs&quot;. This book was very well written, and the author uses great sensory language to make you feel like you were actually taking a part in the book. I wish the book would've been longer or there'd be a sequel because I'm sure that I'd enjoy it just as much as The Outsiders. I'm also sure that I'd enjoy a lot of his other books even if they are only half as good as this one."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I think that the reason that this was such a good read was because it was written by someone who really UNDERSTANDS teenagers, and who, might one ask, has a greater knowledge of socialism of adolescants, than they themselves?

I started reading the book one night and finished it 2 hours later. It tells about how we should treasure life and that everyone isn't as bad as you thought they were when you really get to know them. There is a strong sense of belonging in Ponyboy's gang even from the very beginning and it grows with the development of the story. A very engaging book I would recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders, is a must read and teaches the reader about life. &quot;He ain't a soc, he's just a guy that wanted to talk.&quot; That sums it up.

Socials are upper-class, well dressed kids who don't show their emotions. Greasers are poor, hoods with long hair who usually have a criminal record. Ponyboy has always assumed, because of their social class, that they were so much different until his best friend kills a social. After a chain of devestating events, he realizes that people do have emotions, weather they admit it or not.I really enjoyed this book. I think it would appeal to adults as well as kids.

When they were in serious trouble, they turn to their friend Dally for help. He sent them to another town and sent the cops on a wild goose chace to Texas. When it all settled down Dally went to get them. On the way back they saw some people in trouble so they went to help them. Why they were helping them they all got hurt.

It also went into a lot of details, which revealed their thoughts and emotions. You can almost put yourself in their positions.

During the middle, some problems arise, and Ponyboy starts to understand that people do care and no matter a greaser or a social you still have feelings."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I had read this novel when I was nine years and it's beauty and honesty towards the way that people are precieved, and to what life is like.

It was not assigned reading, I just saw it in the library and it looked interesting. I just fell in love with all the characters and I must have read the book literally a hundred times. This book led me to discover the poetry of Robert Frost and to this day I can recite &quot;Nothing Gold Can Stay.&quot; I was hugely disappointed by the movie as I had my own ideas of what the characters looked like (and only Patrick Swayze as Darry came close), but the book never fails to remind me now of the intensity and purity of my feelings as a young teenager or how far I have come from my old neighborhood which was a great deal like Ponyboy's."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This is the best book I have ever read.

On the other side of town is a gang that is full of well-dressed preppy boys. The whole story is about a battle between two different worlds. The huge event in the story is when Johnny and Ponyboy get jumped by the preps and Ponyboy is getting drowned but Johnny saves him by killing the guy. After that, its just about how they survive the world by themselves. I loved reading The Outsiders. It was a great book.The main character in the book is Ponyboy. He's a youngboy living with his two older brothers. Ponyboy is the youngest of the gang. He has brown shaggy hair but in the book he has to dye his hair blonde to cover up his identity. Like most gangs, the people in them are usually tough and they think they're all big and bad. Unlike Ponyboy, hes a sweet young man that is harmless. In the book, Ponyboy smokes and so do all of his brothers and friends. The traits Ponyboy and I share are that he's harmless and I basically am too. He's also a sweet young man and the youngest of his friends and brothers. I am the youngest in my family and the youngest of all my friends. One way were different is that he smokes and I don't because I think it's wrong. Another reason I am different from is I live with my parents.My opinion of the book is that I loved it. The book relates to many people's lives in the world. It's not a fake story, it's real. People face gangs and poverty all the time.

It's a great way to teach about gangs and how much pressure they go through. I really liked the characters, and the author described them so well.

The main caracter is an intellegent, opinionated teenager who is willing to hide himself and his feelings in order to fit into the world he is forced to live in..but some people he'll trust to open up too.

He depends on his two older brothers for support and love."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"It amazes me how a 16 year-old can produce such a great work. I thought it was pretty realistic, not like everything ends well. It seems absolutely real to me. Too real, as if S.E. Hinton was really Ponyboy. I liked the way the things happened, not too ridiculous, but like the everyday life of a greaser. It touched me. She saw clearly the bitterness of life and the way a 14 year old sees things, not understanding that Darry actually cared, but was too worried. She weaved all these things into a fascinating story. I liked the names 'Ponyboy' and 'sodapop' too. They added a special touch to the book. The names were unique and there was this aura spun around the names that set them aside in a nice and funny sorta way. Everything about the book had a deep sense of reality in it. I guess it was too real. One could get upset when Dally fell dead or Johnny died. You could literally see everything forming in your mind with every word put across. It is definitely worth the money."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I first read this book in 1968 and it was the first &quot;adult&quot; book I read. It introduced me to a world outside of dick and jane and the cartoon characters I had known so well up to that point.It was through this book that I learned that I was not alone in how I was feeling and what was happening in the world around me. The characters seemed so real and the story made me feel sad, yet , happy at the same time.I can honestly say that I've read the book at least 30 times and, still as an adult, like to pick it up a re-read it. I think that this book is timeless and should be required reading for all young people.I recently introduced The Outsiders to an 11 year old girl and she absolutely loved it, showing that even in today's fast paced world it is still a great read!!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"As a high school English teacher I find that my ninth graders intensely enjoy The Outsiders. Some kids are even moved to tears. I think the power of The Outsiders rests in Pony's narration. He tells the story with great psychological insight, but narrates the story with the tone of a 15 year old boy."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is a wonderful book.

If you like gang fights and fighting themes this is the book for you. Its only a couple bucks so buy it and read it for yourself. I'm not a book person but this is a good book. ...So buy it and when you get done reading it go sell it to a freind or something. Overall the PLOT is what really stands out."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I thought that this book was very interesting. I feel that some of the things that happened in the book I could really relate to. Most of the boys in the story have life very hard but yet they seem to move on day to day.

Hinton really paints a picture of all the emotions going through Ponyboy's head...."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I read this book many years ago and I also read it this week. It is totally amazing. This is definitely a book that will make you laugh and cry. It is told so well by S.E Hinton that you can almost feel like you are on this wild journey with the greasers. I just love the Dally and the Ponyboy characters so much that early in my teen years, I wished that I could step right into the book and become their friend. A regular old greaser. Tuff. The movie is just as good as the book too. Compliments to S.E. Hinton for being such an inspirational writer. I have to admit, this book really comforted me in my times of depression. I hope it helps many more like me. It is totally a five star book."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I read \\"The Outsiders\\" by S.E. Hinton because it was an assigned book for school. The book really touched me and I still wonder about what it would be like to be Ponyboy's friend. For some weird reason, I would like to actually be in the story, but have it be real. I don't know why, but I think I like Ponyboy. That is why I think the book \\"touched\\" me."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"In the final scene of this ground-breaking young adult novel, Ponyboy asked his English teacher, Mr. Syme, if the assigned theme could be longer than the required five pages. &quot;Certainly, Ponyboy,&quot; replies Mr. Syme, &quot;as long as you want it.&quot; As a teacher, the most thrilling aspect of Sue Hinton's book is her ability to depict that elusive truth--good writing comes from the gut. In other words, from your own experience. Ponyboy tried to write about his brother's horse, Mickey Mouse, but &quot;I couldn't get it right; it always came out sounding corny.&quot; That relationship didn't belong to him, but to his brother, Soda. Eventually, he finds the words starting to flow when he writes &quot;about something that was important to me.&quot; He remembers the three boys who had died during the past week. He was there. He was involved. He had been wounded by the experience. &quot;And I decided I could tell people....&quot; Ponyboy had found his voice."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I love this book. I saw the movie a while ago but my english class had to read the book. I knew everything that was goin to happen but i learned a lot from the book more than what i learned from the movie. I'm 13 and i think THE OUTSIDERS is the best novel ever. It's about a boy named Ponyboy, who is also the narrator, who tells the reader all of the problems that go around living on his side of the town. See, he's a greaser (poor) Others on the other side of town are called the west-side rich kids or the socs. This is a great novel that shows a tight bond between a group, the greasers, and how ponyboy accepts himself for what he is."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book was really good, and would suggers this book for boy and girls between the ages of 12-15!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I really loved this book. The one thing I can't stand about good books is finishing them. I read the first chapter the first day(it was assigned by my eight grade teacher). The second day, I read the rest of the entire book and was moved to tears. I was sad about Johnny, though. I rarely read such wonderful books, and I read a lot. Hilton really knows how to express childhood.

My tutor recommended &quot;The Outsiders&quot; and my teacher approved it for my book report. I am sure glad I read it!

I could read it over and over and over again. Thanks , Jennifer Foster"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"After reading this, I am amazed. To think S.E. Hinton wrote this when she was 16 is inspiring.

This is one of those books that you read more than once."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This is going to be an unusual review. I am not actually done with The Outsiders yet, but I feel motivated to comment on it. I really was very interested in this book from the beginning. I literally couldn't put it down because of the exciting events that are happening throughout the book. The characters also made it exciting because of their personalities and the interesting background of their lives. The author's style of writing is a little different because the chapters of the book don't seem to end so having chapters seems pointless. I don't want to give anything away at this point but it seems to me that the theme is that people are often misjudged because of their appearence, amount of money,and who they hang around with. Ponyboy looks like a tough kid but we find that he is actually sensitive and caring. This book is different than any book I have read. I am discovering a part of society that I know exists but I know little about."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"When I was getting ready to go on vacation and realized I had nothing to read, I looked at my older sister's bookshelf for something. When I came across this book, I recalled hearing the movie was good, so I took it. I have read only Stephen King for the last 3 years, so I was surprised that this book was so good. It doesn't take long to read, so it is definately worth the time it takes to read it, even if you don't find it to be fantastic. I think anyone from 10 to 100 should check it out!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I think I am still in shock that S.E. Hinton wrote this book when she was only 16! You could really understand what Ponyboy was going through. It is the same today. You have the popular people and the people who no one knows or give the time of day. It is a very powerful book. A have to read."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"A book like no other, made for all teenagers of all ages. A book filled with life like adventures.

(even if you hate reading)"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Every Teen Ager and Adult should read this book. I read the Outsiders over 20 years ago and still get the chills when I think about it. After reading hundreds of books it remains my favorite. My neices and nephews are coming of age and I can't wait to share it with them. It should be on the required reading list in high school along with To Kill A Mockingbird and other classics."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book was pretty good. I liked it a lot.

The characters really show support for each other and even though it was wrote in the 50's it still can relate to the 90's and shows how families do stick together."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book was so great. It was inspiring and never boring. When I first read this book in fifth grade it was because I used to always hear my mom and sister and aunts and grandma talk about it so I saw it somewhere and bought it.

Everyday I feel like I am living right out of this book."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is my favorite book of all time. The characters are straight out of real life, and so are the things that Ponyboy, Johnny, Dally, Bob, and all the Greasers and Socs go through.

This book desplays amazing examples of all threeconflicts: Man Vs. Man, Man vs. Nature, and Man vs. Himself. This is perfect for book reports and school projects. Your teacher will be amazed at your sophisticated choice of work. Considering the author was only 16 when she wrote this, I think she couldn't have done a better job. This book is beyond acceptable."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This is the first book I had read in the America. Maybe you don't believe what I said, but it is true. I never read through all the parts of book before. I thought it was too long, or too difficut for me. But this one is not. I like it very much because it's easy to understand what the author is going to tell next, or maybe because it was written by a 16-year-old girl. It is a great lesson for any child or young adult, to deal with problems and life. And it tought us the money is not the most important thing in the world, love or friendship is."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"S.E. Hinton does a great job expressing her thoughts of teenage life in a broken down sociaty. Ponyboy you sometimes felt sorry for because he lived a life that didn't really fit him. He was a smart, outgoing kind of guy that could have had more in life if he didn't live a hard life. The Outsiders was another story taken from the &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and &quot;west side story&quot; plays. Teenage kids growing up into a world that was full of hat and violence. Many reviews I have read feel that it has no outlook on how life is, If people feel this way, then, man, they live in a isolated world. Violence, gangs, guns, rumbles, it's all things we in Iowa City have to learn to live with. This book has never gotten boring. Each time I have read it, it makes me think about the world today."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This is a really unique book about jealousy and fear.

My favorite part is when they &quot;try&quot; to save the kids from the church. It just shows that even evil people can do good things once in awhile. The characters names are Ponyboy, Sodapop, Two-bit, Johny, and Dallas. Yes the names of the characters are Ponyboy, and Sodapop. Ponyboy is brave, Johny is dead, Dallas is a hood, Sodapop is good natured, and Two-bit is an idiot.

The way The &quot;Outsiders&quot; described how they feel about parents and the way they hang around with there friends was very close to how I do so I was really surprized. I liked the way it ends too, it ends by showing the whole book was the assignment that Ponyboy's english teacher gave him. It also tought me how hard it was to live in the ghettos.Although English is my second language it wasn't that hard to read this book so I recomend this book to people of any nationality and any age but I recomend this book especially to teenagers."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders was a very interesting book. It kept me in suspence through most of the book. I like several chapter the most because they really had me on my toes.

They are always having fights. By the end of the book it never gets resolved. The ending wasn't very memorable either, it didn't say anything important that I could have missed somewhere else.

I thought it was action-packed but difficult to relate to. The book is about two teenage gangs. One is more high class, while the other is lower class. The story tells of the conflicts that arise between the two groups of kids, the Socials (Socs) and the Greasers. The Outsiders was rather violent and gory at times, but it showed what life was like for the main character. The book moved along quickly and kept the reader intrigued. Although the character's situation was hard to relate to, his feelings were ones we have all felt at one time or another. In the beginning there are lots of characters to remember, but once you get into the book it's easier to remember who is who. I recommend this book for people who like fast reads. ...."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders was a fabulous book. It is a heroic tale about boys who grow up in not the average town.

If you like non stop action and fun this is the book for you. This is for mostly for anyone one who like a awesome quik read.

It has been about ten years since I read The Outsiders, and although I hadn't thought about the book much over the past few years, it has recently caused me to reflect on many things. Most importantly, this book affected a change in my life. While quite good, I'm not speaking of the plot or the content of the book at all. Although I have not read the book in some years, I can attest that it has made a serious impact in my life.Prior to reading The Outsiders in junior high, I had never found a real interest in reading. Not just a mere interests, but a real appreciation for reading. Now that I'm in graduate school, having read numerous books, both fiction and non-fiction, I can honestly say that it was this book that really spurred on my desire to read, and for that, I thank the author."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Are you a spoiled kid who has a lot of money, cars, girls, and almost everything you want? Or are you a kid who has no family, the only thing you&iexcl;ve got is your friends? Well Ponyboy was a greaser, the same as having no family and only your friends. Ponyboy didn&iexcl;t mind this, actually he was proud of being a greaser. Things were going great for him and his gang, until this one night when a couple of Socs, (the rich kids) jumped Ponyboy and his friend. The most unexpected thing happened, his friend killed a Soc, the guys panicked and bailed out. Undercover, where nobody knew where they were, Ponyboy and his friend think of what to do, and after some time they go back home. Although things get even more worse&iexcl;KThis book was an excellent book. I couldn&iexcl;t stop reading it. This book is about the life of the people in the hoods, the people who don&iexcl;t have a family, or any money. This book is about differences between the rich and the poor. However at the same time this book is about the things common teenagers go through day to day. The author, S.E. Hinton was 16 years old when she wrote this book. Somehow it feels as if she knew everything about the life of a greaser, like how they lived, how they dressed and looked. She went into so much detail about their appearance that you can easily picture how they looked and acted. For example, the character Darry, she made him a strong, good looking, smart, and kind of fatherly like type of figure. The way she expressed him was so realistic. Anyways, enough said. If you want to know more, read it for yourself."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This is one of my all time favorite books ( the other favorites by S.E. Hinton). I love how much the Socs and Hoods are so different. You have to trust me and GET THIS BOOK! I wasnt in to the fighting/gang thing but this is definitally not all about voilence. The book is packed with emotion and adventure and the ending is awesome. My cousin told me to read this book and when i started, I COULDNT PUT IT DOWN! this book really makes you think about yourself and especially about your friends and others you know. Just get the book and I almost guarenty you will love it. It was like the author knew what it was like to be a Hood like PonyBoy and Soda, and knew what they were treated like and how they treated people. I want to see the movie, i heard it was awesome, so just read it! hehe Amanda~"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book is probably meant for the teenage reader. It goes through many situations that some teens face every day or will at least face at some point in their life. The plot was lined up in a correct manner for the book. The author followed the sequence of events in which they happened. I believe that if she were to try to tell the story by jumping around to main points, like some authors do, it would have confused the teens it was meant for. I liked the way she told about the characters as they came into the story line. She gave some background information on all of the greasers as they were asking Pony if he was all right. The style seemed like it was meant to be portrayed as if this were a scene from the 50's or 60's. This is shown when the author uses hair grease as a boundary between the two social groups. The book stirred little emotion from me due to the fact that I'm not caught up in the social standards that most people live in today. Whether it's due to money, gender, race, or something else most people have a way of making their own &quot;gangs.&quot; Overall, I thought the book was interesting and it was able to keep me in the mindset of being one of the greasers. The ending is fitting to the book although it just seems that it is giving more problems to an already messed up world."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is one of my favorite books of all time. S.E. Hinton is an amazing author. The Outsiders is a book about a 14 year old boy named Ponyboy, and his family and friends struggles. One day, something happens that can change his life forever, and he and his friend Johnny flee to escape it. But they can't leave behind what they left. This book will keep you spellbound until the very last page! Read this book! You won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I first read this book in 7th grade; I couldn't put it down then and still enjoy it now. What makes the book amazing in its own right is that it was written by a perceptive, gifted 16 year old and it was written from the heart. Some aspects of the book bugged me when I first read it, such as why Ponyboy felt his older brother despised him when it is clear from the beginning of the book that Darry loved him. Big brothers who despise you don't make you put Band-Aids on cuts, make you come home on time, or go out of their way to pick you up from the movies. Yes he hit him when Pony came home late, but only because he was so worried. Pony is 14, after all, and therefore a little egocentric. Darry is harder on Pony than he is on other brother Soda because Pony is the youngest, and also has a lot of potential if he would start paying attention. Soda is the big brother everyone would love to have-a lot of fun, good looking, and willing to listen to your problems without making fun of you. We are also as shocked as Pony to find out that even Soda has problems; he just keeps them to himself. Though hardened Dally blows up and gets himself killed when buddy Johnny dies, one wonders that even if Johnny had lived if Dally would have ended up differently. Hinton does a good job convincing us that rich kids have just as tough a time as poor kids, though admittedly in different ways. Pony is an orphan, but he is shown more love and concern by his two older brothers than the Socs are shown by their own parents, and certainly more than Johnny and Dally received from theirs, which is none at all. One wonders what Pony will become in the years to follow, and what sort of father he will be to his own children. We can only hope they do not have green eyes-those who have read the book will know what I mean. :-)"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"It was really good. I liked it.

In fifth grade, i moved to a new city and I had moved from a cathloc school into a whole new enviorment: Public school. People didn't like me because I was diffrent. I didn't swear, listen to they're type of music, or learn they're type of 'hood' vocabulary. I can understand what Ponyboy (what kind of name is that?) Soda (again, what kind of..) and the rest of the gang went through. this is a good book but could refrain from the violence."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This is a book that will appeal to almost any young reader. I have taught The Outsiders to my middle school students for 10 years, and I have yet to meet a single one who has not enjoyed the book.The book is written at an easy-to-read level, with a very conversational style. The kids find it very engaging. They can't believe it when they find out that Susan Eloise Hinton wrote this book when SHE was a teenager!The basic conflict of the novel, Greasers vs. Socs, is a conflict you will find in almost any school in America. The labels may be different, but the premise is the same. The book is a great springboard for conversations about gangs, non-traditional families, abuse, viloence, friendship, prejudice, and teenage life.I highly recommend this book, especially to &quot;reluctant&quot; young readers."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book was very good. For once, some one put the perspective from some one who's poor, not so popular, and goes through difficult times. It is a very hard life for Ponyboy Curtis, yet he makes it through.

That makes pretty much all of you..."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I'm only 11 and when i read this book i wanted every other book by S. E. Hinton. She has a talent to put down words that i can't. Ponyboy has a rugh life his parents death, his best friend Johnnys death, and Dally being shot down by the cops. I have two copies of the book both with different covers, but in a way they discribe the same thing. i could not put the book down, my head inhaled the words slowly at first but quicker, as i began more and more to love the book. I read parts of it every night, and will never forget any of it."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Whether you are a person who loves to read, or a person that hates it with a passion, you will most definately love this book. It is about a boy named Ponyboy Curtis, his brother Sodapop, his other brother Darrel, Two-Bit Mathews, Dally Winston, Johnny Cade, and Steve Randal, a.k.a &quot;The Greasers.&quot; In the town where Ponyboy lives, there are two crowds, The Greasers, and the rich Socials, a.k.a, &quot;The Socs.&quot; The time span of the book is about one week, and belive you me, A LOT can happen in a week, as this book clearly proves. Throughout the book, you will be moved from laughter to tears and vice-versa. I am not going to tell you anything else about the book like the other reviews do, because that would would defeat the whole purpose of reading it. Have fun reading this book, I guarantee you'll love it, I sure know I did!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book was published in 1967 by S.E. Hinton and is about thelife of the kids without any money, the Greasers and the rich kids,the Socs. Ponyboy Curtis is a 14 year old greaser, other Greasers are his brothers Darrel and Sodapop his best friend Johnny Cade and Dalls Winston. The Greasers and the Socs always have fights but never anything very serious until one of the Greasers kills a Socs (in self-defense) one night. So as he and Ponyboy find Dallas for money and a gun they set off for a church. While in hiding two of the Greasers go in the hospital which makes Ponyboy come back home. Then at the end thay have a fight with the Socs and win. But when it ends Ponyboy and Dallas go to see their friend in the hospital to tell him the good news.As Ponyboy tells him they won his friend tells Ponyboy its not any good.As the talk ends he tells Ponyboy to &quot;stay gold&quot;. Alot more goes on in this book but you well HAVE TO READ IT..

I think it is also one of the best you well ever read too."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I first read 'The Outsiders' at age twelve. Six years on, its still, without a shadow of a doubt, my favourite novel. I can't particulary relate to any of the main characters situations but they are so craftily developed that you end up feeling strangely atteched to some of them. Dally and Johnny are particularly enrapturing and as the novel unfolds you discover insights into their personalities that have been cleverly woven in. Loyalty, frienship and the lengths some people will go to maintain these bonds are the main issues examined in this book. Some of the reasons for the divide between the social classes are also carefully examined and S. E. Hinton gives this complicated issue a realistic conclusion-people from different social classes don't always get along and that will never change. The main character, Ponyboy, is the narrator and the book follows his inward struggle to accept who he is and shows how he deals with three particularly difficult situations which can either be the breaking or making of his life. The fact that the author was sixteen when she wrote this book perhaps explains how accurately she managed to capture the teenage characters intensity, arrogance, innocence and vunerability. Read it."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book was really good. It taught me a real good lesson. It showed how two different groups of people handle life. It relates to the &quot;real world,&quot; and how people live it. The plot of the book was really interesting. It also showed me how a young person can handle the event of life like death, love, and wealth. This book was great and I recommend it to anyone, especially young people."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I loved the book The Outsiders! it was a good book showing how the two kinds of people handled life.

There was even a movie made after it. I would give this book 5 stars, but you have to be able to understand what she is writing about. This type of stuff really does happen. Two friends Johnny and Ponyboy find themselves in some tight situations throughout this story until the major conflict that ends up making the story what it really is. If you are a person who gets into mischief then this is defiantly is a book that you want to read."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I read The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton because my English teacher recommended it as an engaging novel. In the beginning, it was difficult to understand what was going on because S.E Hinton uses a lot of old slang. Also I don't know much about the American teenagers, especially from the 1960's. During the first two pages, I was opening the dictionary all the time, but by the third chapter, I felt as if I learnt a new language. I also realized that I really related to the characters. Ponyboy and his friends had the same problems as we have as teenagers now-a-days everywhere in the world. The book is honest because the author is a teenager who knows what the life is like. It's more truthful than when an adult writes about their teenage life."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I liked this book alot. It had alot to say about how people treat each other and what people go through that you never really think about. I heard that S.E. Hinton was fifteen when she wrote this book. Man thats crazy. I'd never think someone that young could write a book this deep, and how she could make up some of these really vivid characters like Ponyboy, Johnny, Darry, Soda, and Dally. How Hinton made the characters come alive and how she made me think I actually knew Pony, that was just.... I can't really explain it. The characters and plot developement were instilled with a sense of pride that was almost inspiring."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I read this book in yr 9 english, and i loved it!

I first discovered this book six years ago, when I was ten years old and fell in love with it. It is such a gripping book with beautiful characters and you can just feel what they're going through. You just get so wrapped up in their lives and what's going on with them that you can't put the book down. It's my favorite book of all time and probably still will be my number one favorite when I am 102. I still get a thrill when I hear the name Ponyboy or Dally or Two-bit.

The following is a collective review from my students: The book was an amazing story of kids stuck between childhood and adulthood. However, the setting is too old-fashioned for us; it is too old to feel real. In terms of the characters, there is a lot of emotion betweeen the Socs and the Greasers. Darry is a relatable character, in particular, because he is a great father-figure. Some of the class could relate to him because we feel like the mature child in our families. Regarding the plot, sometimes it moves slowly. In addition, S.E. Hinton uses lots of foreshadowing, which led to a predictable ending for some readers. On the other hand, several of us thought the ending was completely unexpected and different from most books. Finally, before reading you should know there are lots of fights and smoking/drinking. However, as a class, we would recommend this book because the violence shows you how lucky you are."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"i'm just gonna tell you now my review is on this book being not that good.I am interested in the time period it takes over but this book just doesnt cut it. The Outsiders written by S.E. Hinton. Well lets start off by me saying this was fair book. I thought it was going to be a terrible read.But no.S.E. Hinton creates a well descriptive world of the sixties. She really puts a vision in your mind of whats going on.Allthough the characters are two Rival gangs called The Greasers and the Soc's.The soc's are a rich gang and the grasers are poor.They way Ponyboy,johnny,Two-Bit,dally and Soda are described are very sterotypical,for instance greasers rough people up and put grease in their hair.The author says that in the book. Which offended me.I dont see greasers like that.Now to the good parts.The storyline can be mostly confusing and irratable. Meaning the locations and protagonists are randomly seen doing one thing then with in one sentance the plot gets thrown off.There are times in the book while reading you really feel for some Soc blood to be spilled in fact it doesn't happen.Jimmy's parents beat him all the time and he does not want anything to do with him.I can tell you right now this was not a likely to happen during this time period.This book i have read was not the best book i have ever read.I'd rather read Dr.Suess for a whole week than have the nerve to even look at another leather jacket.I give this book a 7.5 out of 10."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I was introduced to THE OUTSIDERS for the first time during seventh-grade reading class. I loved it and have read it several times since.Just an unforgettable story that everyone should read."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This is a great book written in a different voice not many people have. It is a chilling story and makes you have a new respect for your home, family and friends."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The OutsidersBy: S.E. HintonThe Outsiders is about a boy named Ponyboy who lives in a town filled with troublesome gangs and parents who do not care for their children. In this wonderful adventure Ponyboy and his good friend Johnny, have to go through in order to stay out of Juvy. In this book there are many characters that often interact with Ponyboy such as, his two brothers, Dally, Johnny (of course) and many others. This type gang that Ponyboy is part of is called: The Greasers. They grease up their nice and greasy so much that it comes out shiny. The Socs, on the other hand, are another type of gang, the rich and spoiled kind of teenagers. They have short hair and wash their hair every day. They think that they are better then everyone and the only way to show their awesomeness is by killing and showing them that they are capable of anything they want to do. So overall this book is extremely outstanding and I am recommending it to all of the good readers out there because I know it will also be one of your favorite books in the world. This book is probably best for children 10 and older and other wise it's probably the best book you will ever read, EVER!

I walk in that house, and nobody says anything. I stay away all night, and nobody notices. At least you got Soda. I ain't got nobody.\\" This is a fraction of all the trouble dealt with by the \\"Greasers.\\" They are an outside group that is mistreated and wrongly judged.As you might be able to tell, I am telling of the book called The Outsiders. The writer of this excellent book is S.E. Hinton. S.E. Hinton was only sixteen years of age when she wrote The Outsiders. I think the most amazing thing about it was not only the fact that it was her first book but that it was written from her own experiences. S.E. Hinton lives in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with her husband and son. I am a big fan of her work including, Rumble Fish, Tex, Taming the Star Runner, That Was Then This is Now, and many more.This book had a huge effect on my life and might for yours. I put myself right in the story and thought about what I read each chapter.It all starts out with Ponyboy, Two-Bit, Steve, Darry, Johnny, Sodapop, and Dally. Darry however, is not in the gang, \\"Greasers,\\" but still looks out for each one of them. They are enemies to the, \\"Socs,\\" who are the rich and vicious group from the West Side. Their idea of a good time is to jump, \\"Greasers.\\" So you can imagine how much conflict arises. I think this is a story based on survival and adventure along with friendship and belonging. I don't really know how to clearly reason without giving away most of the parts in the book.I give this book, \\"Two thumbs up!\\" I recommend this book to people ages 12 and older."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"the book was very good. I like the book better then the movie. i would have to say the book is better for readers and the movie is a good sumary.later Turkey"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders was a great read. I loved this book because it was so relevant to teenagers today. Teenagers have problems just like Johny and Ponyboy. And the idea of the two gangs in one town is similar to most high schools because the Socials represent the popular groups of students who beat up the less popular group of students who are represented as the Greasers. Also, teenagers can be in situations where they get beaten by their parents, whitch is sad, but true, and some teenagers have been abandon by their parents, like Johny who is beaten by his father and him mother left him. S.E Hinton wrote the book to be relevant to today because even though some teenagers have depressing lives, it is true."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I had to read this book for school.

I absolutely LOVED it and reccomend this book to anyone who is considering reading it. :)"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"What would you do if you had a vicious group of boy's chasing you down? Read and find out what Ponyboy does.The main character's name is Ponyboy. (Trust me this is not a girly book). His best friend is Johnny Cade. They are part of the greasers the poor people with a lot of grease in their hair. The greasers are the good guys. Johnny's parents don't care about him at all. The Socs are the Greaser's enemy. All the greaser's are friends, two are Ponyboy's brothers. Read to find out how this awful war shakes out.My opinion of the book is it's a great book. I liked how it was action packed with drama and some sad parts. S.E Hinton did a good job of writing the book.This an amazing book. I recommend this book to ages 10 and up. Read and find out how Pontboy's life is changed."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"S.E. Hinton's The Outsiders was a book I would read more than once. There were two components that stuck out the most in this book. One, I enjoyed reading about two different gangs who eventually saw the bleak differences between themselves. Second, this book conformed the true meaning of friendship in gangs. I read this book with my 8th grade students, and they would hitch the same opinion of the book. All in all, I would recommend this book to those who are seeking a compelling read.Socs and Greasers were the rich and the poor. Some might say it depicts gangs like to today: Bloods and the Crips. I would not take it to that extent, but it is evident that Socs and Greasers had their indignant differences. How they came together was what drew me into this book. Even though the main character Ponyboy killed a Soc and one of the Greasers main members dies, eventually both sides reached a positive premonition. The belief that every side has their troubles holds a reputation with society today. As you can see, its great how S.E. Hinton took two gangs in the 1960's and gave them a resolved mindset that relates with 2012.Do you think being in a gang means violence? Of course some may think so, but thanks to The Outsiders some of my perceptions changed. The Greasers were on the poor side of town. All they had was each other. When Ponyboy and Johnny committed murder due to self defense they seek guidance from their other gang members or should I say brothers. Johnny had abusive parents at home and so the Greaser gang was the only caring family he had. I am not trying to advocate for gangs, but what I am saying is that S.E. Hinton took a debatable topic like gangs and flourished it to deliver a message of brotherhood and family. Therefore if you have had the odds stacked against you with trust, read The Outsiders and you will see that blood isn't necessarily thicker than water.It is easy to see that I enjoyed reading The Outsiders. I finished the book in a day and I thought to myself, \\"The 8th grade would probably enjoy this.\\" Except for a couple of knuckle heads who dozed off because they can't stand my class, my students were able to understand that money does not make you any better than the next person. They were also able to comprehend the fact that family does not just reside with blood. In conclusion when you read this book, do it with an open mind and you will enjoy it to the fullest!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Just fourteen and having a rude awaking to my perfect life,i couldn't understand what was going on or what i was turning into. i was losing all my friends especially one that was just like a brother.when i read the outsiders i though wow. someone understands us!

It is told from the point of Ponyboy Curtis, a fourteen year old member of a gang of greasers. His brothers', Sodapop Curtis is sixteen and Darry Curtis is twenty and the head of the family since the boys parents died.Johnny Cade and Dallas (Dally) Winston are members of the gang. Johnny is kind of the baby, even though he isn't the youngest. His parents abuse him, so the gang is always trying to care for him. Dally is a tough, with a New York City kind of attitude.There are several other characters, including Cherry Valance: Bob's girlfriend. Steve Randle: Soda's best friend, and a member of the Curtis brothers gang. Two-Bit Mathews: A member of the Curtis brothers gang. Tim Shepard an associate of Ponyboy's gang, but his gang is much more violent. He and Pony boy are both very poor and hate the Socs, so that links them. The last few characters are Bob, who is a friend of Pony's and Randy who is a friend of Bob's.The story tells about the gang members and how they bond and touch each others lives. Everything is pretty normal with fights and rumbles, but when Bob tries to drown Ponyboy because he talks to Cherry, Johnny kills him by stabbing him to death. Johnny runs from the police, but while he is hiding out from them, he and Ponyboy see a church on fire. They hear someone saying that some of the children are missing, Johnny and Ponyboy both run into the burning building to save the children. They both help save the children, but Johnny is badly burnt from a beam falling on him, and he eventually dies. Before he dies, he tells Ponyboy that it was worth it to save the children.Because of the deaths, the Socs and the Greasers want to have a Rumble, a city street fight. Randy tells Pony that he just wants the fighting to end, and Pony agrees. Randy says he will not fight in the rumble. The other members of both gangs agree to fight, and in the end they do. During the fight the police show up and many of the members run away. Dally Winston pulls a gun that isn't loaded and the police shoot him and kill him.Ponyboy is sent to the hospital to recover, and later is called to trial about the killing of Bob. He was going to tell the judge that he killed Bob, but the judge only asked him a few questions, and then sent him home. Later he finds out that the Doctors told the Judge that Ponyboy wasn't up to a lot of questions.Ponyboy is sad, and lonely for a long time. Eventually, he learns that he doesn't have to be a greaser forever. He can do anything he wants with his life. He is not the only teenage boy to feel like he does. After that he is better, and adjusts to what has happened."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The book The Outsiders is about a group of boys who have a gang and are against another gang of richer boys. These kids all come from broken homes and their gang is the only thing they have. This book does an excellent job of showing what tough lives some kids have to live and some of the hard things kids have to go through. All the temptations of the teenaged years are expressed in this book openly, such as drugs, violence, and the pressure of being in a gang. The Outsiders is a great book to show kids they are not alone out there and other kids share their same feelings. Peer pressure is brought out into the open with this book and it made it really make the teenaged reader connect with the characters and understand the exact situation the characters are put in. Without a doubt this is one of the best books for teenagers to read."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"THE OUTSIDERSS.E.

I am against the fact that they want this book to be taken away from children. Although there are many fights in this book, it always resulted in something bad. When Johnny killed the Socs, his life was ruined because he was wanted by the police, and the Soc's friends wanted to get Johnny into a fight. It also is a good book because it teaches a lesson about being friends with someone even if they are different. Pony and Sandy were from two different gangs; the Socs and the greasers. Even though that seperated them, their interests made them alike. This book teaches many different lessons about life. It will teach kids that when you do something bad, something bad will happen to you. It also teaches people to not judge people by the way they are grouped and to accept people for what their personality is. Out of all the books I have ever read, The Outsiders is definitely my favorite and I do not think that it should be banned for any reason."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I'm fifteen and I really connected with Ponyboy and understood his situation.

I know most kids identify with it and can learn something about themselves through it.Taking this further into the music industry, I recommend listening to early Bruce Springsteen, who himself was a greaser.

Hinton was quite possibly the first book I ever read in School and understood. The characters are original, easy to sympathize with, and extrordinarilly well written. The book focuses on a gang of north end &quot;greasers&quot; who stick together through thick and thin, more a brotherhood than a quote un-quote &quot;gang&quot;. When things go awry the two main characters are thrown into a sea of turmoil that only their friendship could overcome. An easy book to read and follow, this book is also one of the few to which the movie does some form of justice. Other phenomenal books by Hinton include &quot;Rumble Fish&quot;, &quot;That was then, This is now&quot;, and &quot;Tex&quot;,all of which also have movies that are true to the books which they are based upon.

I have actually chosen this book to do a sociology report for my university. Not only is this book intriguing to the younger generation, it shows extreme longevity in diversity between rich and poor, young and old. An all around fantastic book that I believe should be read by anyone old enough to understand the truth and logic behind this story. Though it is a story this happens to occur and take place on an everyday basis, at every school world wide. If you don't think it does in your own school maybe you should take a look at yourself and see if it is not you who is making it hard for someone else to live their life to the fullest. On a lighter note, I read this book for the first time when I was 11, I read it so much that the pages started to fall out, that is the time when I finally broke down and realized that I could not live with out this book following me through my many transfers in the military as every time I read it, it takes me back to that time in my life that I will always remember as tumultous and amazing.

HintonReviewed by: S.SokPeriod 1&lt;u>The Outsiders&lt;/u> takes you back into the times of the movies such as \\"Grease.\\" There are many gangs with the trend of long, oiled, slicked-back hair with much fighting and drugs, the main character Ponyboy Curtis is an orphan living alone in a house with his older brother Sodapop and Darrel. Ponyboy goes through some tough times such as thinking that Darrel hates him and feeling like a loner all the time. Then one day, the gang \\"Socs\\" pick on and threatened Ponyboy and merely kill him when a friend named Johnny comes and save Ponyboy by killing one of the Soc members, To avoid trouble, they both run away from home with only a couple of hundred dollars, two heavy coats, and a free ride on a storage train to nowhere, Ponyboy and Johnny fight for survival and try to carry on each other in a deserted church. They show true friendship that doesn't seem to break, even with 5,000 men with double-edged swords.I liked this book because it had adventure and suspense. It says in the book, \\"Things gotta get better, I figured, they couldn't get worse. I was wrong.\\" With this said in the book, I myself, didn't think that anything worse could have happened after the fight, but I was also wrong. This sentence made me full of suspense and want to read more to find out what else could have went wrong in the book. However, besides suspense, I also like the true connection of friendship that Ponyboy and Johnny had shared in &lt;u>The Outsiders&lt;/u>.In &lt;u>The Outsiders&lt;/u>, Johnny and Ponyboy would not have survived in the story without their compassion and friendship, as it is said, \\"Everyone needs a friend.\\" If Ponyboy and Johnny didn't have each other, it would have been impossible to live out in the deserted all alone; one of them would have died of boredomness or loneliness. It was showed in the book, \\"One morning, I woke up earlier than usual, Johnny and I slept huddled together for warmth.\\" Ponyboy and Johnny even slept next to each other for survival! That shows true friendship: helping each other survive.My favorite part in the book was when Dally comes finds Johnny and Ponyboy. Even though Dally could have gotten arrested for helping \\"murders,\\" he still desired to give them a hand with their problems. Dally takes them out for Dairy Queen. It made me want an ice cream too because of all the wonderful description S.E. Hinton had put into the book. &lt;u>The Outsiders&lt;/u> is a great book with lots of virtues and morals that are needed in life. I recommend reading this book for great adventure!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is a great book to read and it is very fun and cool it realy is helpful.

Hinton, is a wonderful realistic fiction book about 2 gangs in a quarrel and a boy named Ponyboy,who narrates it all. Ponyboy,the main character, is part of the gang which the socs call, the \\"greasers\\". The greasers are very tough and always stand up for eachother, if they didn't, they wouldn't be a very good gang. The greasers' worst enemy are the \\"socs\\", which is short for socials. They are very stuck up, rich people who love to do nothing but jump the greasers. Usually when a greasers gets jumped there are usually weapons such as,a knife. If they're quick enough, another greaser can help the one who got jumped, but that rarely happens.A summary on the plot: Ponyboy,who lives with his two brothers,Darry and Sodapop, is 14 years old and already had a knife held to his throat. When this happens, it means a greaser has been jumped by a soc and it also means that Darry will yell at him for not using his head. It's not that he was dumb, he got straight a's, it's just that he didn't us his head sometimes. Anyways later he and johnny are walking home from the movies through the park when johnny notices a guy with 5 rings on his hand, he was a soc, and he and his friends jumped them. As they keep trying to drown Ponyboy, Johnny stabs Bob to death. They figured the fuzz (aka the cops) would be chasing them , so they ran away, and died and cut their hair. All of a sudden a fire struck at the nearby church and Ponyboy and Johnny saved the children and Johnny ends up breaking his back.To find out more read the book.I think this book is wonderful for someone who loves suspenseful, realistic books."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The OutsidersThis book is about three main characters Soda, Darry, and Pony.

The narrator of this book is a Greaser. He lives with his two older brothers Darry and Soda. His brothers are Greasers too.At the begining of the book the narrator gets in a gang fight with the Socs. The Socs and the Greasers are gang rivals. If a Soc saw a Greaser on the street they would kill him. Thats almost what happened to the narrator but his brothers saved him. The rest of the story is all about gang fights and saving each others lives. Its about not leaving a member behind and fighting with all you got. I really liked this book and would recomend it to any one looking for adventure and action. I would also recomend this book for any one in 6th grade or older."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The outsiders by S.E. Hinton is a dramatic tale about two gangs in the late '60s. the two gangs are the Socs (so - shuhs) and the Greasers. Ponyboy is part of the blue collar gang, the greasers, and ALL his friends are part of the greaser gang. Relatively speaking, the way the Socs and Greasers jump each other is pretty innocent, until things go too far when a spilled secret is followed by BAM, and then spilled blood. To find out what happens to Ponyboy read the BEST book ever written about social violence."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton is an unforgettable book. It is about a boy named Ponyboy Curtis who lives with his brothers Sodapop and Darry beacuse his parents passed away in a car accident. There are two groups in Ponyboys city, greasers and Socs and, they always argue and get eachother in trouble. Ponyboy has a friend Johnny, who murders one of the rich boys Bob. Ponyboy and Johnny run away to avoid getting caught, and live in an abbandoned church in the country. When the church catches on fire a list of unforgettable events occurs. I liked this book because it has an interesting topic. The greasers live in a dirty neighborhood where everyone smokes and drinks no matter how old they. I hope you love it!!!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Great Book\\"The outsiders\\" is a very good book because the author knows how to connect with teenagers. This book is about a gang called the greasers that must deal with the other gang in the other side of town, the socs. In this book you will feel what a gang must pass to live in the city. I give it four stars because in some parts it gets boring.This book is for teenagers who like action and heroism but indeed in some parts it gets boring. This book connects you. You feel like if you are being comprehended. If you want to enjoy this book, you should explore it in depth. It has a surprising ending.This is a great action book. It also is enthusiastic, tragically and heart touching book that talks about a boy's life in the streets. This book will connect you. Believe me. I don't know how but I feel comprehended. When I read this book I felt how pony boy thought and realized that that was how I thought too!I really recommend this book. I hope you like this marvelous book. This is a fiction book but it could happen to someone. If you buy this book, you will know why I said all of this because believe me, you will like this book. Great Book, Good Time, Good Night."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book was soo good. i can't even explain how much i love this book. i read it it my 7th grade reading class and i'm so happy my teacher picked it. it is about the socs and the greasers and how ponyboy went through many things that most people don't face at that age. it is really deep and touching, it even made me cry in school. The Outsiders is the greatest book and you should read it!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This semester we were assigned to read a novel for class. I chose the book called &quot;The Outsiders.&quot; The reason being because I heard this was a good book I just never had the spare time to read it. This class gave me that time and I took advantage of it and read the book I've been wanting to read. It took me the whole semester to finish this book. After reading this I realized how much I really do enjoy reading. I haven't sat down and read a book since middle school before I read &quot;The Outsiders.&quot; Now that I have, I will read more often because I liked it that much. This book was an amazing story. It was hard for me to believe that a 14-year-old girl wrote this story. I loved reading this book. It relates in a way of what life is really like for me. I have my group of friends and then there is a group of friends who we don't get along with. I am glad I got the opportunity to read this book. I will now continue to read more often. I never use to read. But reading this book changed the way I felt about reading. Reading makes you escape the realness of reality. It lets you live in a dream or a fantasy. I recommend the book &quot;The Outsiders&quot; to everyone. This book is good for all ages and you will get in to it just like I did."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Are you a spoiled kid who has a lot of money, cars, girls, and almost everything you want? Or are you a kid who has no family, the only thing you&iexcl;ve got is your friends? Well Ponyboy was a greaser, the same as having no family and only your friends. Ponyboy didn&iexcl;t mind this, actually he was proud of being a greaser. Things were going great for him and his gang, until this one night when a couple of Socs, (the rich kids) jumped Ponyboy and his friend. The most unexpected thing happened, his friend killed a Soc, the guys panicked and bailed out. Undercover, where nobody knew where they were, Ponyboy and his friend think of what to do, and after some time they go back home. Although things get even more worse&iexcl;KThis book was an excellent book. I couldn&iexcl;t stop reading it. This book is about the life of the people in the hoods, the people who don&iexcl;t have a family, or any money. This book is about differences between the rich and the poor. However at the same time this book is about the things common teenagers go through day to day. The author, S.E. Hinton was 16 years old when she wrote this book. Somehow it feels as if she knew everything about the life of a greaser, like how they lived, how they dressed and looked. She went into so much detail about their appearance that you can easily picture how they looked and acted. For example, the character Darry, she made him a strong, good looking, smart, and kind of fatherly like type of figure. The way she expressed him was so realistic. Anyways, enough said. If you want to know more, read it for yourself."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I loved the outsiders it was the best book i have ever read even though it is full of contrivesy it shows what the reall world is like it is amazing what this writter did at the age of 16 read this great book i dont wanna spoil anything 4 u so i wont talk about what happeneds but i will tell u about the curtis'sDarry the oldest of the three children , Soda the middle child and ponyboy who's parents are dead the are making it on their own darry and soda dropped out of school ponyboy is a straight a student"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Its incredible to step back into time -- into the time of the &quot;Greasers&quot; and the &quot;Socs&quot;.

This book is written for young adults about young adults, and it was even written by S.E. Hinton when she was only 16. I think that this book used a lot of description, and it really made the scenes stick out in my mind, and made me feel like I was right there in the scene. The book was written very simply and not very challenging to read but I think that it is targeted towards younger readers. The book brought out a lot of emotions in me, like not being so judgemental towards people who are not as well off as me, or that don't dress nicely or don't have a lot of money. It also made me sad to see that their are kids out there that are killing and hurting each other. I know that it is something that happens a lot in this world but it is not something that I hear about that often. I would recommend this book to young adults as well as adults because I think that it has a lot of good points for both generations of people. As an adult people deal with predujice all the time. People are always worried about how much money people have and what types of clothes people are wearing. I think that if more adults read this book they would realize, just as some of the young adults that read it, that just because someone is different then you, doesn't mean that they are a bad person."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book was good read. I would recommend it to someone who thought that he or she had a bad life. S.E. Hinton really makes this a real life story.She makes you think that you are right there and you are going through everything that the main character goes through. The book was based on boy that grows up without any parents in the \\"ghetto.\\" He and his friends are in a neighborhood gang. I would recommend this book because it keeps you interested throughout the whole thing. So, if you are looking for a good short book, this is the one to read. This book was written so well that it gives you a mental picture. In the one part of the book the Socs and the Greasers get into a fight it gets pretty brutal. The author make you think that you are going through the pain that she describes."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read. It was so well written, I cried.

It's not easy being refered to as &quot;from the wrong side of the tracks&quot; I have to watch what I do, be careful what I say, and who I say it to. Just like Ponyboy, If I say one wrong word I'll either find yourself dead, or close to it. My parents were both killed, in a car wreck, and the only thing I can depend on is my sisters and our &quot;gang&quot;. You know, our friends. It's a hard life, and this is the first book I've found that comes from someone that has a terrific understanding of the pain and fun of living &quot;on the wrong side of the tracks&quot; People think I'm crazy, thinking it's fun. But it is. The other side doesn't get to wonder what was gonna happen tonight, except for what's for dinner. I get to wonder about how am I gonna get dinner, or who I'm gonna fight for it, or for my life. I'm in about 2 fights a week. it seems like everyone is out to beat me up, just because I'm not as rich as they are. My life is hard, just like Ponyboy's, but I couldn't live any other way. This book is the perfect window into the real world."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book was excellent. You know those books you start and can never seem to put them down, this is one of them. It's full of excietment and good characters. The characters seemed do real, unlike some books where they seem as if they are from a fantasy. I loved how all the boys in the book acted like brothers, and got along so well. Also, I liked how it teaches interdependece to those who may be self reliant. I have read books by this author before, and I admire Hintons work. it inspired me to maybe become a writer myself some day. This book inspired me to read more, it showed me that there are books out there that are actually...interesting. The plot was very exciting, it never seemed to put me asleep.

I think it is a grate book because I can relate. For example when Ponyboy's friend Johnny dies, I can relate by having someone special to me die. I also in enjoyed the rivalry. For example now (today) the U.S. is in war with Afghanistan. This book also was grate b/c it informed you about the two different clicks. The Socs (Socials) and the Greasers.

They went through more tough times then some people will by their 30th birthday.Yes, I would recommend this book to anybody who loves drama, action, anything they are interested in. This book can be for young and old. It doesn't matter because this is a great book!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I liked the book because it showed how three brothers survive together with no parents and a gang that cares about one another. They weren't a mean gang. It told how they faced their hard trials.The theme I picked was friendship because I felt the book showed a great amount of friendship. The greasers and socs aren't friends but the relationship between all of the greasers is amazing. They are so caring, concerned and helpful with one another.

Overall the book was pretty good. I liked the book but I thought the ending was too boring, it could of been better.I like what time period its in because it tells how things were different back then.The one thing I didn't like about this book was how the Greasers and the Socs hated each other. There is so much of that going on right now, I've seen a lot more of it since September 11th.If you want an exciting book to read I would recommend this book.A Student at Secrist Middle School, 1st Period Language Arts"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I really liked The Outsiders, it was a very touching story, and the only reason I didn't give it five stars is because some of the parts in the book are repetitive.This book really demonstrates friendship. Even the Curtis boys are more friends than they are brothers. Also, each friend has a special place or has a certain something in the group. Not one character doesn't show friendship in one form or another.I would definetely recommend this book. It is a very passionate book.

In the book, The Outsiders, by S.E. Hinton, you can see exactly what that would feel like.In the Outsiders Pony Boy and Johnny are in a bad gang, But, they also do good things. For example, one time they rescued little kids from a burning church. The church was on fire because they left a burning cigarette in it. This book is also about people getting jumped and gang rumbles. When you read this book, you learn about life in a gang where some of the rules are, don't go on an other gangs block, never walk alone at night if you're in a gang, and always carry a switchblade.This is my favorite book! I would recommend this book to 5th graders through adults. I would also recommend this book to people who like books about gangs. This book talks about drugs and drinking so little kids shouldn't read it."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is a great book that was written by S.E.Hinton.

One more thing...after completing the book and turning in a book report, we viewed the movie &quot;The Outsiders&quot; in class, and guess what...most liked the book better! If you see the movie, you'll know why. I was impressed that the students liked to imagine the characters the way they saw them, not how Hollywood portrayed them.

And there's the gang, but Ponyboy can't count on them. At night Ponyboy is not always home and able to have a family meal, and in the day Ponyboy does not always go to school. Instead of doing those things, Ponyboy fight in rumbles, and smokes.The Outsiders was a bit troubling because of the strong language and violence. This violence creates a distinct personality for all of the characters. S.E. Hinton really showed how Ponyboy felt throughout the book.I think that the book is aimed at older boys, maybe boys in high school. As I was reading it, however, I found that it is just for very mature readers. To read this book you have top have a very sophisticated mind and be able to handle very intense violence.I really enjoyed this book because of the details and thought-provoking ideas. This book was written very realistically, but I found it hard to believe that kids actually did, and do this to each other."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is a wonderful book. My favorite part was when Ponyboy and Johnny saved those kids from the fire.

Like when the socs and the greasers have a rumble, and the greasers beat the socs.What I liked about this book is when Pony and the others go to a rumble and they fight then the socs give up and run away. Another exciting part that I liked was when Pony and Johnny run away to the park then these socs come then Pony and this soc Bob start talking trash to eachother. then the socs get mad and try to drown Pony then Johnny comes with his knife and Bob ends up getting killed.I would recommend this awsome book to people who likes gang and violence books.

This two gangs would fight against each other to see which gang is better. Dallas,Darry,Two-Bit,Steve,Sodapop,and Johnny are Greasers. They are called Greasers because of the oil they put on their hair. The Greasers are jeolus of the Soc's because they drive fancy cars like a Mustang. Something that I like about this book is that Ponyboy has a good heart and this book has violence.Ponyboy and Johnny were going home and they almost got jumped by the Soc's.

The Outsiders was greatly detailed and I felt as if the guys were my own friends. I could totally relate to them, even though gangs now adays don't use grease. But we face the same problems, children dying. I cried through most of the book and to make me do that, the book must have been really real and touching. The end ended so sadly, yet so real. In short: You must read this book. I would recomend it to anyone!!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"When i was in 8th grade i was told to read &quot;The Outsiders&quot; and it was so great i could not putit down.

Especially pony it is impossible not to fall for a guy like him."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The book The Outsiders is one of my favorite books.

The reason I don't give 5 stars to this book is because it isn't like, &quot;Roll of Thunder, Hear my Cry&quot;.

The Outsiders is a very good book because it teaches about life and how it is different from the East Side and West Side. S.E. Hinton wrote a very good book. Ponyboy Curtis is a nice-looking boy who learns about life. It is taking place in a town in the USA. Ponyboy has a conflict where his friend Johnny kills a Soc named Bob. His lesson is if you kill someone do not try to run because it will make it worse, just face your fears and live with it. Even though, Johnny killed someone I thinks it was good of him because then more people would have died in this book."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The book was abuut two groop of kids who fight each other becaus one groo is grecers and the other are socs.

When my English teacher announced that we would be reading it, my face fell and I told my friends that it was awful and they would hate it. I braced myself and convinced myself that it was an awful book. Then I caught myself sneaking peeks inside of it outside of class, and reacting to it as I would one of my favorite books. Finally I let it sink in and it will never leave me again. I will add that it gets violent and portrays some negative views of teenagers, but also shows that even troubled kids have feelings and feel the need to be loved and respected. I had to talk to someone about the book and so I had to stop talking to my friends for a couple of days. They didn't get it, and didn't want to. I was the only girl in my class that liked it. Even the boys thought I was crazy. But since then I have found several girls like myself who loved the book and wouldn't admit it because of what it was about. My point is: Don't be fooled by the male-oriented first impression of this book. Give it some time and even the most sensitive person will fall in love with this book, along with the boys and tougher people."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I first read this book when i was in junior high.And i immediately identified with the characters in it.

Like Ponyboy's friend Johnny.He was just trying to help but he got the worst of it.The only part that was missing in the story was Ponyboy's parents.

Later he and Jonny get jumped and something terrible happens. Read the book for yourself to find out what happens to Ponyboy and Jonny."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is an interesting book about a gang but its main focus is Pony boy. Pony boy is his real name, his father was very creative. Pony boy has two brothers, one is Darry, and the other is Soda Pop. Their mother and father died in car wreck, so Darry and Soda Pop work at a gas station. The other members of the gang are Two bit, Jonny, and Dallas. I recommend that you read as the gang gets into trouble. But the best part is that there are no commercials and if you need to take a break no problem. This is a great book. It kept me laughing, crying, and thrilled all at the same time."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is a very good book. It is about two gangs, the Socs and the Greasers.

Ponyboy does very well in school and makes all A's . I wonder what adventure he will go threw next!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"There are many events in The Outsiders that are believable. In the book, the Greasers and the Socs are against each other and sometimes get into fights. Like the Greasers and the Socs, some teens are like that today, as teens, in our generation. Some teenagers smoke and drink, just like in The Outsiders. Most teens drink and smoke, etc. because they are pressured, having problems at school or home, or just because they want to be cool and fit in. Like Sodapop in The Outsiders, alot of teenagers drop out of school because &quot;they have better things to do&quot;. Some kids drop out for family problems, etc. There are many things you could compare The Outsiders to a teenager's everyday life. THE END!

The Second thing he did is that he made good grades in school. The Third thing he did is he saved the kids from the burning church.

It also took Dally a lot of courage to show up to the rumble in the condition that he was in. It took a lot of courage for Ponyboy to bluff the Socs with the broken bottle. Courage is a good thing to help you stick by your friends."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Ponyboy does the right thing. He does the right thing when he jumps in the church and saves the kids. He also tries to do all his assignments and keeping up his grades. He does the right thing by being a friend to Jonny.

These are the four things we think Ponyboy did right."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"There are many bad things that happen in the story. First Ponyboy and Johnny save the children in the burning church. Next the Greasers and the socs have a rumble. Finaly Johnny dies at the hospital.

As you can see the Outsiders has bad events."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Johnny and Ponyboy do good when they save the kids from the burning church.On the other hand, Johnny killed Bob even though it wasnt a very good thing, he thought it was at the time becuase he saved his best friend. Johnny also did good when he had to turn himself in to the cops. How ever he also does the right thing when his parents are beating him and he does not hit his parents back.There for thats why Johnny gets upset when his mom comes down to the hospital, he figured that she would just beat him some more and tell him how much trouble he has caused.Little Johnny has changed from being scared to a brave young man."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I liked the book ''The Outsiders'' because it talked about different classes going through different things in life.

HintonThe Outsiders by S.E. Hinton is about a guy named Ponyboy who isin a gang.The only people he can trust are his brothers, Soda and Darry.Ponyboy lives with his brother's because his parents died in a car acciedent.The problem is the Socs hated each other and were always beating each other up.The main characters always fought against the Socs.Some adventures were the Rumble and when,Dallas,Ponyboy and Jonny went into the burning church to try to save thechildren.My favorite character was Dallas because it was allways so intresting to read about his problems.I can't realate to any of the characters but I have felt like some of the characters.For instance when an awful thing happened to Ponyboy and his whole life got torn apart he felt so sad. I have felt thatefore.Then there was the time when the gang won the rumble.They felt happy I have felthappy too.The book was great I loved it. My favorite part was when Dallasgave Jonny and Ponyboy money to run away. If you like action andsuspense,I recommend this book to you.In the book I could change when Jonny gets beaten up badly by a Soc.This book was probablywritten for ages 10-14 and both for boys and girls."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Rina B.The Outsiders, by S.E Hinton was about two different groups of people. The high class kids were called the socials but everyone called them Socs. They lived in the west side. The low class kids were called Greasers. Greasers lived in the East Side. The five main characters were Greasers named Ponyboy, Johnny, Darry, Sodapop, and Dally .One night Ponyboy and Johnny fell asleep in the vacant lot while star gazing. When Ponyboy came home at around 3:00 AM, Darry (Ponyboy's brother) slapped him for coming home so late while Sodapop (Ponyboy's other brother) was just minding his own business. Then Ponyboy took Johnny and they ran away. That was a big adventure Ponyboy and Johnny went on.In the story all of the main characters are boys. I can't really relate to any of thembecause everybody in the book fought and smoked. I can't relate to Johnny, Ponyboy, Darry, or Sodapop because I have two parents who respect me and don'thurt me unlike Johnny's parents. Also, I am not like any of the Socials because they fought too. I think I am mostly like Cherry Valance. Cherry likes sunsets and going to the movies like I do.I liked the book, but not a lot. My favorite part of the book was when the church burned down and Ponyboy, Johnny, and Dally risked their lives to save the lives of other children and went into the burning church. All of the children in the building survived. Johnny, Ponyboy, and Dally got many burns from helping the children get out of the church. My least favorite part of the book was definitely the rumble. I don'tlike violence and during the rumble there was a lot of violenceand many people getting hurt. I would recommend this book forboth boys and girls ages 11-14. The genre of this book is bothaction and adventure."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Shawn GoldsmithBy S.E HintonThe Outsiders, written by S.E. Hinton, is a very well written,hair-raising story. The story was about two rival gangs called the Greasersand the Socs. The Greasers were the poor kids also called hoods. The Socswere the rich kids. These two gangs would always fight to show which group isbetter and stronger. The main characters in the story are Steve, Two-Bit,Darry, Dally, Sodapop, Johnny and Ponyboy. Ponyboy, Johnny and Dallas arethe main charters. They all make up a gang. They stand up for each other,although they have their differences. In my opinion, the story starts whenJohnny and Ponyboy get into a fight with some Socs. In the fight, Johnnykilled a Soc to stop him from drowning Ponyboy. After this, Johnny andPonyboy are on the run from the law.I cannot really relate to any of the characters in this story because Ihave never experienced some of things they have. The night before Ponyboyhas the big fight he is determined and ready although he is not really up toit. At times, I felt this way before something important. Otherwise, I havenever really felt the way they did, or experienced similar things they did.I thought this was a very good book. It was teeming with tension. Myfavorite part of the book was when Johnny and Ponboy (with help from Dally)decide to run away. This book is written for everyone over the age of ten.All parts of this book are interesting. That is why out of one-ten I givethis book a ten."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"'The Oustiders' is a realistic story about teenagers from the wrong side of town who are left to fend for themselves after their parents pass away. There are two main conflicts in the novel. The first is person vs. society. Ponyboy and his friends are considered greasers because they don't have much money. Opportunities for success are not handed to them, so many of the greasers decide to not even try to succeed in the world. Ponyboy is different from most greasers, because by the end of the story, he decides to make something of his story, and his life, even though it will be difficult, and he knows he will have to work hard to succeed in a world that has preconceived notions of him and his kind. The second conflict is person vs. self, as Ponyboy struggles to become the kind of person he wants to be, even after the loss of his parents, Johnny, Dally, and the soc that Johnny stabbed, who was a person with a life, too. The characters in the book were both round and dynamic. They were described in detail, and their changes in attitude and thinking were shown through their actions and dialogue. Although the setting of this book seems to be late fifties to early sixties, gangs and cliques still exist for teens today, and teenagers still push for independence and begin to discover who they are. Because the novel deals with these issues that are present in the lives of nearly all teens, the young adult reader's interest in the book would remain high, even almost forty years after it was written. The book is only at a 5.1 reading level, but of course the content is more appropriate to deal with, and to interest, the high school reader."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I usually detest books I'm forced to read in school, the process of reading them being boring and slow-paced and the books ususally about boys and their pets.

I loved this book and I encourage everyone to read it. AND LISTEN TO YOUR TEACHERS!!! My teacher always tells me to read good books, and when I think about it and decide not to, I always end up regreting it. But when I do read them, I ALWAYS end up loving them.

The Outsiders is a sophisticated, moving, gripping tale of teenage angst, peer pressure, ignorance, and self-discovery. Rarely do readers connect faster or more completely than with Hinton's &quot;Ponyboy&quot; character. The realism and emotion of this book are astounding. It's not a fluffy, feel-good book for kids. It's at the other end of the spectrum from Harry Potter fantasy. This is full-contact fiction dealing with the everyday drama and trauma today's kids witness or worry about: family, friends, school, violence, police, gangs, love, loyalty, fear, and aspirations. This one leaves a mark. Bravo! --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I totally loved this book. Ths book touched me deeply. Parts of it i think you have to be a teen to understand. I read it when some people might have though i was to young.(when i was 12) but I think i was ready for it. i think this is a book that if your not old enough for it you won't like it and won't keep reading it. its one of my favorites. I saw the movie which i thought cut out some very important parts. I think this book can be read many times over and it will continue to touch you. and awaken a part of you that says my life is easy my life could be so much worse.And teens look at it and say there are people like that out there cuz as a teen you see them at school hanging around and this book covers a sensitive subject. the other thing i liked about this book was the strong sense of friendship it was almost always there and i think that's what helped the kids get as far as they did.I think that if you are in 6th grade or abive and you are pretty mature you can read this book adn love it iknow i did."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"We have been reading the book the Out Siders in my seventh grade exploratory class.

This is a must read book for all ages."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Ithink that the outsiders is a wonderful book for kids ages 12-16. I think this because the characters in the outsiders go through a lot of the problems that teenagers face today. They go through problems like stereotyping, fights and clashes between social groups. The problems that ponyboy and Johnny(the main characters of the book)go htrough trying to solve there problems show kids that the problems they face arent the end of the world. Another good thing about this book is that something exciting is always going on and there is a lot of action. The people in the book seem to always be in trouble they face things like fights saving lifes and even coming close to death. This makes it a lot easier to pay attention and focus on the book. I highly reccomend this book to any kid who likes to read books full of excitement and action."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is a book about Ponyboy Curtis, and his hardships of living on the wrong side of town.

But they dont let the socs bother them"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I think this is a very good book. I like end of it the best. We just finished reading in our English class. I think it describes what happens in high school. Very good book!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is a book that is mainly about five guys. Ponyboy, Sodapop, and Darrel are brothers. Dally and Johnny are close friends. Johnny and Ponyboy are complete opposite of Dally. Johnny and Ponyboy are shy and hate getting into trouble. Dally loves making trouble. The book is about two sides that hate each other. There's your &quot;Socials&quot; and your &quot;Greasers&quot;. When someone trespasses on the other side trouble begins.I highly recommend this book to everybody. It really tells you what happens when two sets of rivals come face to face. S.E Henton did a great job on this book. It had its funny parts and it had its emotional parts. It starts out so happy and everything is going great then as it narrows it self to the end trouble starts to happen. If you like to read a funny but sad book then read The Outsiders."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I had to read this book for my English class and when i first got it i thought that this was going to be a boring book. But wonce i got into it, it was wonderful. the way Ponyboy Curtis discribs his life is just amazing. I actualy cried when i read the book. Just the thought of what he had to go through. Also read the book before you deside to whatch the movie. The book is alot better in details and more emotional. If you are about 12 and older it would be a great book to read."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This is one of the most wonderful books that I have ever read. It's so touching and very well written. Fair warning: This book is not for the faint of heart. It's extremely sad in some parts. I usually am pretty unemotional when reading a book, but this really touched me and I had tears in my eyes. I recommend this to anyone and everyone, young or old. The characters are very well developed. By the end of the story, I felt as though I had made some new friends. I esepecially felt for Johnny, a character who is emotionally traumatized and who you can't help but feel sorry for. Once again, I highly recommend the Outiders. It teaches you that there is a lot more to the common &quot;hoodlum&quot; than what meets the eye."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I have read this book 3 times,it never gets old!!This is my favorite book!!!It is a realistic story that made me cry.EVERYONE should read this book!!Ponyboy is deep and sensitive,unlike the others.This book is tremendously good!!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders definitely falls into the ten best books I've ever read. I laughed, I cried, I really did. Everyone should read this book it gives insight to everyone about the trials teens face and how stereotypes affect everyone. Definitely read this book you wont be able to put it down.:)"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I really thought that this book really goes in to gang wars even though this book was wrote before the gangs started to show up like really bad.I think that S.E Hinton did a very fine job on writing this book and deserves a well desserved round of applouse for this!!!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Even though this book is clearly written for young adults, I didn't read it until after I graduated from college. I enjoyed it so much that I immediately introduced it to my eighth grade English class, and they loved it. Since then, I've read it with my classes almost every year, and I haven't gotten tired of it yet."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I think almost anyone would enjoy reading this book. It tells the truth and it tells how hard real life is. Also it tells about the tough desicions in life. As you read this book you get a clear vision of what is going on.

I had to read it for English (Honor student) &amp; every day when we piled into the room &amp; urged our teacher to allow us to read in turns. We read the book in class a toal of 4 times. We each had to do a packet on how we really felt about the book. Only one person didn't pass that packet. Our teacher was astonished at our work &amp; even submitted then into an essay contest. 3 of us won.

It had everything that everygood book has . A good plot and it gets you into it . I would safely call it a new age clasic. It tells exactly what any gang going teen is going through . It takes place a while ago but it realates to now more then then . I would recomend this book to anyone who likes action adventure or who wants to know what is going on in gangs today . The downfalls of this book however are that it moves at an extremly high pace ,and at times the dialect that they use is hard to comprehend. On the other hand though it never looses your attention and it addes alot to the story but the dialect and acent and slang they use. It gives you a feel for when and where the boys are from and how well educated they are. &quot;The Outsiders&quot; by S.E. Hinton is a very good book and I would recomend it to anyone. It's about a group of boys who live in a small poor part of town and belong to a group or gang of greasers. In this gang are some very strong personalities. Pony Boy is the main charictor . along with Johnny , Soda Pop, Dally{Dallas}, Darrel,Steve ,and Two Bit. They have fudes with the preeps from acrost town all the time. The greasers meet up with a girl named Cherry ,whos a preep. After this there is a serious chain of events that you'll never believe. This book deals with issues that teens today are going through . All in all this is a wonderful book and it's going to soon be a very famous book."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This story was the best one I have ever read. I just spent the entire day working on a book report, and guess what book it was on. THE OUTSIDERS!!! Stay gold everyone!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is a book for everyone. &quot;Why?&quot; You are probablly asking yourself. Well it is about tome of tragedy, fun, struggles, and a lot of fights. It teaches a pperson a lot about life. There is one town and two gangs. &quot;Socs&quot; are rich, snobby, bad guys, and the &quot;Greasers&quot; don;t want any trouble. The Socs don't know when to stop picking on the Greasers. One day Ponyboy's (the narator) best friend, Johnny snapped and killed a Soc. From there the story is a wild goose chase, and keeps you on your seat to the very end. S. E. Hinton makes you want more and more at every turn.This realistic fiction is so real that you will have sympathy for the Greasers. this is one of S. E. Hinton greatest books, but these are a few more The Rumble Fish, Tex, That Was Then This is Now, and much more. If you want a comparision to another book it would be Grease, because of all the people, women problems, and cars. The Outsiders is one of the greatest pieces of writing i've ever read. It may be old but it will still have an impact and relate to your life."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"One of the greatest books that I have read, and written by a 16 year old! A realistic fiction, it documents what social classes of the author's time were like. With characters that seem real, and a true message that comes across strongly, this is a great book for teenagers, and late preteens. I thought more about social structures of our schools today, and it showed me the faults with our \\"cliques\\" and our classifications of people."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This is a GREAT book! I had to read it for school. When i started reading it i didn't know if i was going to enjoy it that much, but when I got a few chapters into it I couldn't put it down! Definatly read this book!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I think this was an outstanding book. I think it has a great moral to it telling people that everyone has problems whether your rich or poor. It also shows that fighting gets you know where in life.The characters were all outstanding and showed their chracter in the story and stick together through times of problems. This book makes me wish it was never ending becuase I wanted to keep going on and on. This is one of the few books that makes me think about it after I read it. I want to read it over and over again and I can't get my mind off of it.(seriously) I suggest this book to all ages becuase the moral of it is recognizable to anyone. This is just my opinion but I don't know how it's possible not to like it. If you read it closely, you shouldn't be let down.Read it!!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This story is about young men and the strict and unfair social rules of their community. Pony boy and Johnny are the youngest members of the greasers. The greasers are the outsiders, and socs are the insiders. The socs are bullies with money, influence, and attitude. Pony boy and Johnny get into trouble when they go to the movies and talk to, sit with, and escort home, two soc girls. This seems like harmless interaction, but quickly escalates to a fight with a fatal outcome. There is more tragedy that follows this event. They story is great but the real strengh is the development of the characters and the depth of their personalities. This fictional story is relvant to all teenagers. Useful to teach themes like isolation, bullying, dysfunctional families, death, and being disadvantaged. Also interesting because it is told by from a boy's perspective but written by a female."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"M.P MIller PlaceThe title of this book is called the Outsiders and the author is SE Hinton. This book is a fictional drama and action. The theme of this book is a bunch of kids growing up in Oklahoma trying to make it through their teenage years.This book is about two main gangs called the soc's and the greasers. I believe that the greasers are good-hearted people that just didn't have the family, support and money to be brought up like a soc. The soc's were brought up like snobs and mentally and physically attack the greasers. A couple of times these two gangs collided in battle and the greasers came out as the winner. I believe it was good karma for the greasers.The greasers are good people and the soc's are stuck up and rude. They are not nice to the greasers who are looked down upon as the lower classmen."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I read this and the other S.E. Hinton staple books (\\"That Was Then, This is Now\\" - \\"Tex\\" - and \\"Rumble Fish\\") repeatably as a teenager. Even then they were dated in literal context (i.e. gangs are between caucasian upper and lower class in this book), but they still captured the angsty spirit of being a teen and the changes that result from growing up. It also captured the brutility that jealousy can engender as well as cause and effect. Unfortunately, as usual, Hinton also falls back on her parentless boys raising themselves, creating their own sense of 'family' plot-point. I don't know why her four books hinge on this, but it would be interesting to see the other side of this coin.As it is, the protagonist, Ponyboy, has written his story as a make up essay for a class. Within it is the struggle of somebody who has both the capacity and drive to lift himself from his poor, gang-life background, but is full of uncertainty whether he can or should. His friends and siblings are all fully realized characters, flawed, but still endearing for the most part. Even they recognize the differences in Ponyboy and in their own ways as surrogate older brothers, support him. Again, as usual, with Hinton, it takes a series of tragedies to force the conclusion of this book.I bought this for my son, though at nearly twelve, I'll likely wait a bit to give it to him. Living as he does in an era where gangs are an invasive part of city life, regardless of whether you belong to one or not, I believe it would be good for him to understand the various reasons one might join a gang, as well as experience a point of view of those who have not had as fortunate an upringing as his own."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This genuine quest for a place in this world is a masterpiece with it's descriptions bringing the characters to life and the storyline who could get anyone hooked.The story starts with young Ponyboy as a Greaser and that is what he knows and loves about himself. However as the novel progresses he becomes more and more uneasy about what he wants. Pretending to be Tuff and Tough is all part of the equation and makes him stuck but with some great friends and family he everntually realises the big picture and comes together with who he is. Ponyboy. This book shall stay gold for years to come. CLASSIC!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I absolutely loved this book. Friends who are closer than family taking their lives day by day, and taking it on as it comes. They meet many struggles but always manage to get their way out of it together. It was a book about character and friendship, two of the most important things in life. This book is more than just a good book, it was completely phenominal!!! I read it to my kid sister for a lesson on what it was really like to have a hard life. (She complains that she has the worst life ever and she has it soooo hard.)If you ever get the chance read this book. Not just becuse it is a wonderful piece of literature, but because it is an enjoyable life lesson that will stay with you forever."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This is my favorite book that i've read. its about two gangs who always fight. Two characters named Ponyboy and Johnny do something that get them into trouble. They killed a member of the soc gang so was forced to hide out in an abandoned church.The rest you got to read.This book might as well be made today knowing all of the violence going on.This book is mainly for the young audience.

I first learned of the story from its the movie version. I remember reading the book for the first time sometime in the summer between my eight grade and freshman year in high school.I found myself relating to some of the issues that Pony Boy is faced with. I find the story to be an accurate description of a young man's struggles in a society where his is not given a fair chance to succeed. I appreciate the way that Hinton incorporates Pony Boy's rough and tough exterior with his inner appreciation of beauty. I suggest it as a must read book for any teen."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I love this book! I'm usually not into the books about gangs and all that, but I got this book at the library because I've heard about it so much and it was supposed to be really good. I am so glad I did!The Greasers were the &quot;bad boys&quot; from the tough neighborhood, but they acted very loose and they seemed so much more human than the Socs because they actually had emotion. I loved how Ponyboy and his brothers were very affectionate toward each other.Ponyboy himself was a very likable character. He tried to act tough and cool, but at times he was so vulnerable that I wanted someone to give him a big hug.Well, I can't talk about the whole book, but I'll just say that everyone should read this!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"With a slightly romaticized view of an era long gone S.E.Hinton attempts to take the reader into a world without rules, parents, and authority.Young kids left to their own join forces on oposing sides but they face similair situations in life.Each group, the Soc's and the Greasers, have their own version of reality. When these realities collide life altering circumstances ensue.From Johnny, the punch scared runaway to Dally Winston you get the feeling that everyone is running. Chasing Ponyboy's golden dreams of youth. Dallas choose his way out of the facade in a violent suddeness but Cherry chooses her own way out as well.You will love this book and the movie.

A must for anyone who likes the ideas of gangs."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"the outsiders had a neat twist that I really liked. The author S.E. Hinton is an exelent writer.

A week ago I finished this book and I just want to say it was kind of interesting. S.E. Hinton did a good job explaining the characters exept at the end. At the end Johnny Curtis dieing was not a good ending. Even though the story took place between 1950-1960 it was still a good book to read.

They are all time rivals with the other gang that lives on the West Side of town who are rich called the Socs. Things get out of hand when Ponyboy and his best friend Johnny Cade decide to take a midnight stroll....We think that The Outsiders is dramatic at times and adventurous and suspenseful at others.It also has a powerful impact on friendship.

Hinton, was such a good book! You would think it would be only for boys but it isn't. There is so much emotion that it's good for girls but there are lots of fights and action and gangs for boys. The genre is suspense.When I started to read it I couldn't put it down. It was so suspensful! It was one of the best books I've ever read. My favorite characters were Ponyboy and Johnny. I like them because they are more sensitive than the other guys. I also like Sodapop, his brother, because he was nice.The Socs, or the Socials who are rich, are so mean to the Greasers who are kind of poor. Their neighborhood is so violent, I am glad that I don't live there. I could picture how scary their neighborhood was because she wrote it so well. I also like Two-Bit, Steve, Darry, Johnny and Dallas. on the outside they are tough but on the inside they do care. Like Dallas, he looks like he doesn't care but near the end of the book you'll find out that he really does care.The story starts with Ponyboy going to the movies by himself. on his way home the Socs found him and started beating him up. When he got home he was all beat up. The next day Johnny and Ponyboy went to the movies and after, they fell asleep in the grass and woke up really early in the morning. When he got home his older brother yelled at him. Ponyboy was going to run away with Johnny when they met up with the Socs.To briefly say what happened, they were holding Ponyboy underwater and johnny had to stop them so he stabbed one of the Socs. They had to runaway. To find out if they got caught read the book."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I really liked S.E. Hinton's The Outsiders because of the unique way the book was written. Instead of the &quot;conventional&quot; writing style, Ms. Hinton wrote the book like she is Ponyboy Michael Curtis, &quot;Greaser.&quot; This book was very interesting, it had many unexpected twists and turns. The Outsiders is a very believable book, and in many ways there are real &quot;outsiders&quot; today.The Outsiders dealt with prejudice, and as you are reading this book you begin to understand what life is like for other groups and how they act towards each other. It's sad because no matter what or who is in the group, they are all classified as &quot;bad,&quot; &quot;good,&quot; &quot;smart,&quot; etc. It made me realize that I too judge and group people too easily, we all do.I would recommend this book to anyone (over the age of 11 or so) who wants to read an awesome novel about life, family relationships, friendships, social groups and prejudice.A Student at Secrist Middle School, 3rd period Language Arts"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book is better than My all-time favorite &quot;The Phantom Tollbooth&quot;.

He lives a happy life as a greaser until the night his best friend, Johnny, kills a soc who jumped on him. You can feel strong brotherhood and true friendship in this book.

Hinton, and I was not disappointed. What amazes me the most is how she can get into the mind of Ponyboy, a rebel who runs away to an abandoned church. This book tells the truth, it gives you an example of how teens can be influenced without a caring parental figure. It also deals with prejudice which is still alive in today's society, and one the main media aspects of today, guns. You will not be able to put this down."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"It is hard for me to describe just how huge an impact this book had on my life when I was growing up. I first read this book in middle school and then re-read it many times going into my high school years. Any young adult can relate to this book, especially the way it vividly portrays what it feels like to be an &quot;outsider&quot; who's not part of the &quot;popular&quot; crowd; and the surprising flip side, that the people in the popular group may be just as lonely (and subject to the same pressures) as the outsiders. Any teen should relate strongly to this story. If asked to name my favorite book of all time, this would probably be it; it meant so much to me growing up. Thank you S.E. Hinton, from the bottom of my heart."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I first encountered this book many years ago when I was in eight grade. My English teacher had us read the book. I read the book two times that year because it was such a good book that I wanted to read it again. I have also read the book several times since that eight grade class. This book is a great book for both boy and girl readers and can be followed up, if using it in a classroom, with the movie by the same title.The Outsiders is told in first-person by Ponyboy, a greaser. Throughout the book there is struggle and conflict between the socs (the rich kids from one side of town) and the greasers (the poor kids from the opposite end of town). One night Ponyboy falls asleep in the lot and returns home way past his curfew. His oldest brother Darrel,or Darry as he is usually refered to, is extremely mad at Ponyboy for worrying his two older brothers and not being considerate enough of other people when he acts. Ponyboy lives with his two older brothers because his parents were killed in a car accident. After Ponyboy and Darry argue Darry accidentally hits Ponyboy out of anger. This causes Ponyboy to run away but he planned to go home until the socs show up in their turf. The socs attempt to drown Ponyboy causing his best friend Johnny to kill one of the socs. The book then turns into an out of control spiral as Johnny and Ponyboy runaway to an abandon church. The book is told from Ponyboy's perspective of the events to insue after that dreadful night.This book is a must read for middle school students. Although written towards the middle school audience this book can be enjoyed by high school students as well. This book will have you on your toes wanting to know what will happen next so if you haven't picked up this book yet then do it now. I promise it will not be a waste of time."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders, by S.E.

To survive in this kind of economy, the boys team them self up with other city boys to make a gang called \\"greasers\\". These boys have very difficult lives compared to ours. Every corner they take has a group of Socs waiting to ambush them. This book shows how being a gang and living in a dangerous place is brutal and unbearable for any of us. This book was one of the best books I've ever read and I definitely recommend this to young readers."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book is called The Outsiders. This is an novel written by S.E.Hinton in 1967. Ponyboy is the main character of this book who acts strong asnd brave. He also uses his head more during the book. The theme of this book is a character called Pony who figured that everyone is all the same and just humans.His parents were killed in an auto wreck. He lives with his brothers Darry and Soda because his parents were killed. He goes to the movies alone and gets jumped by the Socs, a gang of rich spoiled kids. Later in the book Pony goes to the movies with his friends Johnny, Dally, and Two-Bit and they find some Soc girls. They walk the girls home. Then they get caught by the Socs. Later Pony and Johnny meet up with the Socs and Johnny does someting illegal and they have to go hide. What will happen next? Are they going to survive?I don't like to read, but I thought this was a pretty good book. The time period was the 1960's and they do more stuff like fighting. One thing I didn't like was the bad environment for Pony because he gets hit by Darry. One thing I did like was the movies-fun scene ( Dally was smarting off to the Socs girls.) During the book the big events were explained in detail. Kids who might like to read this book are people who like tragic and action books. I rate it 3.5 out of 5 because the language used by the characters was sometimes hard to understand and confusing.Written by Josh H."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Although many readers have obviously found a great deal of enjoyment in this book, I kept thinking about the parallels between this book and the sterilized violence in \\"West Side Story\\". While young adult authors like Walter Dean Myers have used this same theme to a more realistic extreme, Myers's work never felt like an \\"Afterschool Special\\". While I can appreciate what the book must have been in 1967, I felt as though it falls a little flat today.Most people are familiar with the all-star cast of the movie before they even read the book. Having never seen the movie, I absolve myself of this prejudice. The book is centered on one of two conflicting gangs, the Greasers. Their conflicts with the wealthier Socs often turn violence. At the center of the Greasers' story is Ponyboy. The youngest of three brothers, he recently lived through the death of both parents. Granted to the custody of his oldest brother and elder of the Greasers, Ponyboy is a target. Ultimately, the choice of the book is whittled down to whether Ponyboy wants to continue living with his brothers or continue his life of violence and risk losing his family.There are points where the story takes some unrealistic terms, but it is still able to make its points and advance the plot. The way the author choses to end the book is also rather clever. Still, I missed something in the book that draws in so many readers. This is not to suggest it is a bad book so much as it is not my cup of tea."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I absolutely LOVE this book already, I am reading it in class and i just love it, buy it, read it, love it (:"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders 40th Anniversary editionThe Outsiders is the quintessential middle school book. It always seemed so corny to me, like West Side Story, so I never read it. Then last year when my son was in seventh grade, his language arts teacher assigned it to the class. My son loved The Outsiders so much, he devoured all of S. E. Hinton's books and hungered for more when he'd exhausted the Hinton canon. I saw that last year The Outsiders was on a list of top ten paperback children's books of all time. It's no wonder, as there is little to date this book, and teens dig it as much today as they did in the late sixties when it was first published. And, I confess, I love it, too.The Outsiders centers on Ponyboy Curtis, a greaser who lives on the wrong side of the tracks with his two older brothers. His parents had been killed in a car wreck; his oldest brother Darry, the twenty-year-old head of the family, works two jobs to keep the family together. Middle brother Sodapop, a sixteen-year-old high-school dropout, works at a gas station. The family's goal is to stay together and keep fourteen-year-old Ponyboy, a bright studious kid, in school. Ponyboy is a dreamer, who loves movies and books, but, according to Darry, lacks commonsense. Darry is worried that because Ponyboy doesn't think and often gets into trouble, he and Sodapop will be taken away and put in a home.As if the boys don't have enough to worry about, being greasers, they are engaged in class warfare with the Socs, the gang of rich kids who live on the other side of town. As Ponyboy says, \\"It wasn't fair for the Socs to have everything. We were as good as they were; it wasn't our fault we were greasers.\\" One night Ponyboy and his friend Johnny are attacked by a group of Socs; the ensuing fight leaves one kid dead and two on the run.Hinton wrote The Outsiders when she was sixteen and understands the teenage mind as only a teenager can. She herself said that she wrote it at the right time, as \\"the feelings you have at sixteen you can't recapture.\\" And her focus is completely on the teenagers, as there are no major adult characters. Like a Charlie Brown cartoon, Ponyboy's world is free of parents. Ponyboy's parents were loving, but are now dead. Most of the living parents are abusive and neglectful, and many of the greasers often stay over at Ponyboy's house. The absence of parents adds an element of fun. If Ponyboy and his brothers want chocolate cake for breakfast, they bake a cake. If they want friends to hang around all night, their friends come over. I suspect this aspect of the book is a big draw for the teens. What teenager doesn't at some point daydream about a life without parental interference?"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Although I am a reader, I am not a particularly avid reader of fiction. I'm an even less avid reader of what most people would consider \\"classic literature\\", i.e. the kind of books that are usually required reading in public schools. Meaning my basis of comparison to other similar books is fairly limited.I first read this book years ago while I was still in 8th grade. Despite the fact that I was not much of a reader back then, I took a liking to it. Years later, I finally got around to rereading it, twice so far now, and I would definitely reread it again. As with most purely fiction books, it's hard to describe what makes them so appealing, but I'll try.I think one of the things I REALLY appreciated about this book, especially when I was in 8th grade, is its simplicity. It's one of those books that's so simple, it's beautiful. It does not try to use pompous, flowery language. It's not one of those annoyingly long books that's 600+ pages long and should have ended by page 300. It's a simple, effective story that's believable.Which I guess leads me to the other reason why I like this book so much. It's not one of those overly romantic books where \\"everyone lives happily ever after\\", as is so often the case with a lot of popular fiction books. It's realistic. There are triumphs and tragedies that give the book credibly. The characters, though we don't even get to know them for that long, sound believable and interesting and multi-dimensional.If you want to find out more about what I'm talking about, I suggest you read The Outsiders for yourself. You won't be disappointed. It's a great book to recommend especially to people who aren't much into reading or who just hate complex writing styles.Also, I'm told this book is largely similar to West Side Story plot-wise. Having never read West Side Story, I can't comment on how true or exaggerated that claim is."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I think we've all at least heard of, if not read, The Outsiders. In some schools, it was a mandatory read. Unfortunately for me, it was not, which is why I haven't read it until now. It's one of those books that I had to read because everyone else had. I wanted to be apart of that club.This book packs quite a punch for being only 156 pages long. Ponyboy, SodaPop and Darry are brothers just trying to survive since the death of their parents. Darry and Sodapop want nothing more than for their youngest brother to make it to college, something they never got the chance to do. The three brothers are part of the Greasers gang. All hell breaks loose when one of the Socs, their rival gang, almost kills Ponyboy. Ponyboy and his best friend Johnny have to run away from town, their families and most importantly the cops. This book takes us through Ponyboy's journey of drama, turmoil, tragedy and loss. Most importantly, we watch as Ponyboy truly finds himself.The best thing about this book is that it's timeless. It was written in the 60s but still its message still holds strong and true in today's day and age. We are still dealing with, and battling, the same social dilemmas.When I read a book and it intrigues me (and The Outsiders did just that) I go digging. I have to find out more about the author: Why did they write the book? What made them write the book? I was amazed to find out that the book was written by a teenage girl, S.E. (Susan Eloise) Hinton, and that it was her first published book. She wrote it back in 1965 when she was 15 years old. She used her initials instead of her name because the publishers felt that readers and critics wouldn't read a book about teenage boys written by a girl. She has since stuck with using her initials for her work to keep her professional life separated from her personal life. She is a very private person and has done such a good job at doing so that you really can't find much more about her other than she likes horses.The Outsiders was made into a movie, that I'm sure most have seen. I am probably one of the few people who have not yet seen the movie but I definitely plan to."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders by S.E.Hinton\\"This can't be happening. This can't be happening.This can't be... \\"You really killed him, huh Johnny?\\" \\"Yeah.\\" His voice quivered slightly. \\" I had to. They were drowning you, Pony. They might have killed you. And they had a blade... they were gonna beat me up...\\" (Hinton 57). Ponyboy, Johnny, Soda, Darry, Two-bit, Dally, and Steve all stick together, along with all the other greasers in town. Being a greaser is dangerous because of the Socs. The Socs are a vicious group of rich kids who beat up greasers; however, one tragic night will change everything for the greasers, and they will all need each other more than ever.The Outsiders by S. E. Hinton is an 180 page book that has something for everyone. There is an amazing lineup of remarkable characters and a captivating plot that will pull at your heart strings and help you understand the struggles teenagers go through while growing up.One of the greatest moments of the book is when a church is on fire and Ponyboy, Johnny, and Dally realize what needs to be done and they risk their lives to save a group of young kids from the fire. This choice ends up costly though, landing Johnny and Dally in the hospital.Throughout the story, the main character Ponyboy is a strong willed character who tries to understand what is right and wrong. He is a character who dreams of being more than a greaser unlike the others, he would not give up. He also ends up realizing that he and the Socs aren't so different after all. In fact, they are more alike then either side could imagine. Ponyboy has to deal with the struggles of life and learns that family is the most important thing in the end.The Outsiders is part of the realistic fiction genre. I give it a 10/10. The Outsiders is an inspiring and classic book and is a great story for people who love classics, and enjoy inspirational and life changing stories. The Outsiders is your best choice."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"in a sentence or so: in a timeless \\"us vs. them\\" set in the 1960s, the rival groups of the greasers and the socs experience ever-increasing tensions that eventually bubble over and result in death.the book is narrated in a journalistic first-person style by Ponyboy Curtis. Ponyboy is a 14 year old greaser (lives on the east side, lower income) who lives with his two brothers, Darry and Sodapop. the Curtis boy's parents are dead, which means that they are all they've got left. well, each other and the rest of their gang. life is anything by easy for Ponyboy and the other greasers. especially for Ponyboy, who is a natural athlete and smart, he realizes he is against all odds to make something of himself. he sees the challenges his older brothers face in using their gifts - Darry has to stay home and make ends meet instead of going to college, and Soda, while genuinely loving his job as a mechanic, realizes that he wants more for his brother Ponyboy.tensions between the greasers and the socs (short for socialite, the upper-class west side kids) have always been high strung, but after Ponyboy and another greaser are spotted with two of the Soc's girlfriends at the movies, it unleashes a rage and sets into motion a series of events that are tragic, intense, and challenging.what struck me about this book was how much it felt like a character study. each time Ponyboy would discuss someone or introduce a new character, i not only got a description of their hair, eyes, dress, and any distinguishing features, but i also got an insight into the core of their being. each character, especially the greasers, were dissected and evaluated.something that i really appreciated about this book was how Ponyboy dealt with the stress and trauma of the events. without giving spoilers, i will simply say that how he reacted to the tension and the fallout of the various confrontations fits into the character-study feel to the book overall. we see who Ponyboy really is in how he reacts to the intense drama, and we learn what sets him apart from the other greasers.fave quote: \\"'You can't win, you know that, don't you?' And when I remained silent, he went on: 'You can't win, even if you whip us. You'll still be where you were before - at the bottom. And we'll still be the lucky ones with all the breaks. So it doesn't do any good, the fighting and the killing. It doesn't prove a thing. We'll forget it if you win, or if you don't. Greasers will still be greasers and Socs will still be Socs. Sometimes I think it's the ones in the middle that are really the lucky stiffs...' \\" (117)fix er up: okay - i realize i am totally in the minority here, but i thought this was slow, cheesy, and predictable (except for the realistic reaction to trauma near the end by Ponyboy). now, i realize that the value of this story is in what it represents (the struggle of us vs. them, overcoming obstacles, finding your true self, etc.) and that it is one of the most challenged books ever because of the repeated drug/alcohol/violence by young people, and i even know that it was written by the author when she was 15-16. that doesn't change the fact that i literally almost gagged when someone told Ponyboy to \\"stay golden\\" with his final breaths. yes - i know it was in reference to a poem and it was special...but that seemed cheesy beyond all belief to me. it's not that i don't think that thugs/greasers can't appreciate Robert Frost or even be a fan of sunsets, it just didn't come off as believable to me in this book - despite the fact that they are based on real characters (says S.E. Hinton)."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Ponyboy. Darry. Sodapop. Steve. Dally. Johnny. Two-Bit. They're best friends. But they're also Greasers.

I think this book has a great story and it is relatively true. I was reading through some of the other reviews and I would like to argue the fact that the story was giving false information. At the time the book took place there really was Socs and Greasers. The book did a good job on educating you on how they didn't get along. Back then it was important that youths belong to something and the book shows that very well. Now days gangs are very popular. Where I live we don't have gangs, but there are people that belong to different groups. For example we've got Stoners, preppies, dorks' jocks, and &quot;just the good old boys&quot; (logger type) Maybe I can relate to this book more because we don't do our fighting with guns or knives, just good old fashioned fist fighting. Just like in the book. It's not that I don't have guns, I have lots of guns, more than most. But were I come from people know that when the bullet leaves the gun you can't stop it.

Socs are the richer kids who live on the west side and greasers are the less wealthy who wear a lot of grease in there hair and live on the east side. The socs and greasers never get along no matter what usually. They always fight with fists or some other things. Ponyboy is a greaser who relies on his brothers and friends. Both social classes go back and forth with their fighting.

Hinton became a hit literary sensation and one of the groundbreaking authors of young adult fiction with the publication of THE OUTSIDERS. One of the characteristics of young adult fiction is that adults are rarely present and in THE OUTSIDERS outside of police officers, firefighters, and doctors and nurses, adults don't seem to exist. The protagonist of the novel is a young teenage boy named Ponyboy (yes that is his real name). His parents died a few years before and his oldest brother, Darry, didn't want to split the family apart and has been raising Ponyboy and his other brother Sodapop on his own. The three brothers grew up on the wrong side of the tracks and have had to mostly fend for themselves. They call themselves Greasers and have a close-knit group of friends who stick up for each other. After all when you're not from the right side of the tracks, rich kids, called Socs, like to abuse Greasers just for kicks. Ponyboy is the youngest member of his group. He's a handsome kid who's also highly intelligent. One night he meets a pretty redhead Soc and that cause Ponyboy's life to be turned upside down.THE OUTSIDERS was first published in 1967, yet not only remains popular, but continues to be relevant as well. The types of gangs that exist in major cities today simply didn't exist forty years ago. Yet the confusion and struggles that Ponyboy experiences are things that just about every teenager in America can relate to in some way. I've worked with a variety of high school students who are reluctant readers. I was surprised at how many site THE OUTSIDERS as their favorite book or the only book they've been forced to read that they actually enjoy. It was this interest in the book by students that led me to finally reading it. The book deals with many important issues that teenagers relate with, from cliques and gangs to difficulties of home life without one's parents. There is a great deal of sadness conveyed in the book, but it is honest and genuine. Despite this, the book ends with a message of hope. You can come from a rough neighborhood and have a tough home life, but those are things that can be overcome. Highly recommended for older children and young adults, especially for those who are reluctant readers."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This is my friend pony boy or as his friends call him pony.

Every year I debate where to place The Outsiders in my curriculum. If I start with the novel in September, the students fall in love with reading. They finish the book within the first few nights of assigning it. We have stimulating debates about cliques and stereoptypes. Even though the novel was written in the '60s students have their own versions of socs and greasers. They have preps versus goths. They love my stories about my high school experiences as well. We even had separate parking lots at my school: jock lot, boff lot, and band lot. S.E. Hinton created a story that is timeless. Students see this and appreciate it. When I start in September with The Outsiders, the material we cover the rest of the year pales in comparison to her stimulating story. If I end with The Outsiders, then I have to wait an entire school year to see my students come alive with this novel.S.E. Hinton is a great story teller. Is she a good writer? Will I be committing a sacrilege if I say, \\"No?\\" While I commend her for writing from the point of view of a fourteen year old boy, Ponyboy is not a realistic boy. My male students pick up on it more than my female students. The girls love the romance of The Outsiders. They love the 'hot' characters. The boys see through it a bit. Not to say they don't like the novel, but I see many raised eyebrows as we read some of her descriptions and dialogue.BUT, all in all, they do love the novel. Like I said, Hinton tells a great story.

I would recommend this book for any young adult like myself because it is written in the point of view of a young boy named Ponyboy. When S.E. Hinton wrote The Outsiders she was a young adult herself and so it is easy for young adults to understand what she is trying to convey in The Outsiders. There are in my opinion two important messages that S.E. Hinton is trying to say in her book. First, is how important love is to people and the impact that it has on brotherly love. Secondly, is about hate and the conflicts that people have towards one another because they are not willing to accept others because of who they are and where they come from. In telling this story S.E. Hinton tries to persuade the reader that just because someone is not like you that you should discriminate against them. The story does a good job in describing the differences among the two rival gangs. The \\"Greasers\\", which is the gang from the poor side of town and whose lives are full of bad experiences and a tough way of life. Then there is the gang who call themselves the \\"Socs\\". These kids are from the rich side of town and who have grown up having a fairly easy life. Over all The Outsiders is filled with many different emotionals. It has action, suspense, love, violence, and even some humor.

I thought she was nuts, it was a library book I knew there was no way I would finish it by the time she had to hand it in. But she insisted so I took it. The next day my parents had to drive to Tulsa (yes, the setting of the book, I'm from Oklahoma) which is about an hour from where we lived. I decided to read the book on the way. By the time we got to Tulsa I was hooked, every place we went I stayed in the car and kept reading while my parents shopped, by that evening I was finished. The next day I read it again.At a time when I was beginning to discover who I was and who I wanted to be the Outsiders spoke volumes to me.

Hinton as a story full of overwhelming violence and hatred. In reality, this adventure filled story is about a group of boys trying to find their inner selves. Throughout the story there is a never-ending battle between the Greasers, a gang of economically poor teenagers, and the Socs, (short for socials) another gang that is a rich, well to do group of teenagers. The Outsiders is a story full of love, horror, suspense, and reality that creates a story line that is a great read for all ages.In a small, beat-up town in Oklahoma, teens like Ponyboy suffer from societal pressures such as violence, drugs, and even more. Pony, a member of a small gang who call themselves the Greasers, struggles in life because of family situations as well as peer relationships. For example, Pony believed that his brother Darry, a serious and hard working man, hated him. Also, almost every member of the Greaser gang feels that they are not socially accepted by all of their peers. A few of the members do not care, but Pony and Johnny are affected by this and especially want to be equal with everybody. They were motivated to be in a gang and fight because they wanted to appear tougher than the other gangs, which in their eyes would make them be better as a person.One night, things are taken too far between the Socs and Greasers. Something serious happens and Pony and Johnny's whole life changes in an instant. They are filled with regrets and wish they could have that night back so they could make better choices. They are forced to run away to an old abandoned church in a small town in the country side called Windrixville. During this difficult time, Pony recites a poem called \\"Nothing Gold Can Stay.\\" By remembering this poem, Pony wants to teach his friends to stay gold by staying true to themselves like the poem says. This poem sets the stage for the rest of the book. In the middle of each turn of events, Pony and his friends take one step at a time and start to realize that violence will not take them anywhere in life. They also begin to realize this from their young 16 year old friend, Johnny. He is the first one to realize this and he tells them not to fight anymore because it does not help their circumstances in life.The Outsiders is a great book that is likely to catch any reader's attention. It is an awesome story throughout the entire book. In the end, Pony officially finds himself as a person and is able to keep his own personality with the help of his friends. As a result, this book comes close to reality and at the same time it teaches a lesson that everyone should know about life."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The book that I am reviewing is called The Outsiders, by S. E. Hinton. On the first page of the book, you, the reader, are introduced to Ponyboy Curtis, a fourteen year old boy with two things on his mind: Paul Newman and a ride home. Pony and his two older brothers, Darry and Soda (Pop) have been taking care of each other every since their parents died. They are all a part of a gang called the Greaser's. The Greaser life is filled with stealing, smoking, drinking, and fighting; however, Pony is not your average greaser. He enjoys movies, reading, writing, and yes, even school! Fellow Greaser's include Two-Bit, Dally and Johnny. Not only do Greaser's deal with the everyday struggles of being poor, but they also experience hatred and discrimination from the rich, upper class kids, better known as the Soc's. The main goal of a Soc is to make a Greaser's life miserable, or so Pony thinks. Like I said before, fights are common in Pony's neck of the woods, but he never imagined that something he was so accustomed to would change his life forever.This is by far one of the best books I have read in a long time. Its unique story line can appeal to virtually anyone. I rate this book a 5 (being the highest) because of the following things: its characters, description and message.You always know a book is truly good when you can get inside the main characters' head. When you read this book, you can literally feel Ponyboy's troubles, good times, and frustrations. For example, many times throughout the book you are shown how different Pony really is from the rest of his crowd. He's emotional, complex, and doesn't really have anyone he can connect with, except for Johnny. Johnny is like the poor, little puppy that's been kicked around too much. His parents beat him, and he was in a near death \\"rumble\\" against the Soc's. Pony and Johnny can both appreciate the less \\"macho\\" and \\"tough\\" things in life, such as sunsets.The Outsiders also has a ton of description. When an author writes a book about the streets, he or she can either tells the whole story, or part of it. S. E. Hinton definitely tells the whole story. We learn how difficult life is for Greaser's. How Darry has to work two jobs to feed his brothers, and how Soda had to drop out to help Darry, and also how sometimes stealing is the only way out sometimes. The constant threat of being \\"jumped\\", and the struggle simply to fit in with your friends.Finally, the reason I fell in love with this book is because of its message. Who would believe that two hoodlums could be heroes, or that two groups who seem so different on the outside really are the same on the inside. This book teaches you about discrimination, society, perseverance, and loyalty, all in 188 pages. Moreover, the biggest lesson this book teaches you is to \\"stay golden\\" and to realize that it doesn't matter if you live on the east or west, we all see the same sunset. The Outsiders take you inside their lives, and make you one of their own in this remarkable novel. It gives you a credible view into the lives of those less fortunate, and their constant struggle to come out on top in a world that always wants to push you down."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton is very well writen and I enjoyed it alot. The best character in this book would be Johnny because on the inside he is a good person even though he is a member of the gang known as &quot;Greasers.&quot; The best most exciting part (other than the rumble) is when Johnny, Ponyboy, and Dally save the children from a fire in a old church. The theme of this book is to stay young and &quot;gold&quot;. The book is much more interesting than the movie but it wasn't very exciting."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I think that the book The Outsiders was a ok book. I dont think that it was the best book that i have ever read because it wasnt really anything that i can relate to and it was kinda boreing reading it for the 3rd time. My favorite character was Johnny. I think that Johnny was brave for saving the kids in the burning church. That was also my favorite scene, in this scene i also think that S.E. Hinton gave the most details and it was the most descriptive. I think that the movie was way better than the book not only because it took a lot of time but because you u actually got to see the people and a picture of what they may have looked like."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"In this book a guy named Ponyboy and his friend, Johnny, get them selves into big trouble and eventually learn more about each other, their closest friends, family, and even their enemies than they had before the murder. Throughout the book you learn that family ties remain strong throuh even tough times and that even all the money in the world doesn't gaurentee happiness."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is an exciting nonstop action kind of book about a hhod named Ponyboy. Who in one week runs in to tuns of troubles, such as the cops fighting death and much more. In some ways it tells the truth about gangs and what such. But ti was the best book I've ever read. If your not sure with my review just try and start the book and give it a chance. I think you'll end up likin' it."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Well the book is INCREDIBLY boring at first but around the 5th chapter it begins to actually get interesting. Too much happens at once during the climax. There are much better books to read that are worth your time."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book is so awesome! It is full of suspense and action. There is never a moment when the book is boring. It tells of a boy by the name of Ponyboy who belongs to a gang along with his brothers Darry and SodaPop. It is a story of groups of teens going against each other basically because of what financial class they are in. The two groups this book relates to are the &quot;Greasers&quot; and the &quot;Socs&quot;. The greasers being the &quot;lower&quot; class and the Socs being the higher. If you haven't read this book I highly recommend it. If you normally don't read a lot just try it and see if you like it, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is a terrific book for everyone. It is a exciting adventure as Ponyboy and the Greasers, deal out their daily problems. This book would have to be one of my favorite's. One minute it is sad and the next they are getting into fights. The Greasers are a group of poor kids who's parents let them get into all sorts of trouble. They rob banks and gas stations for fun. The Socs are an group of rich or wealthy people. They beat up people for fun. They have a little better education too. The Greasers and Socs hate each other. But in the book they see the differences and feelings between one another. S.E. Hinton couldn't have wrote this book any better."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is a terrific book for everyone.

E. Hinton, once banned in a school library because it &#34;promotes juvenile delinquency&#34; which, of course, it does not. I've taught this novel, and used it for tutoring a private student. In this edition, HInton gives a good afterword which can be used at the discretion of the teacher. I highly recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I'm looking at The Outsiders through the lens of Catcher in the Rye because Catcher's large footprint overlaps into the Coming of Age genre and so many people are familiar with Salinger's literary classic.The Outsiders is about two groups of feuding teenagers, Greasers and Socses (pronounced \\"soshes\\"). Greasers are from the poor side of town, the east side. The Socses are from the upscale west side. The story is narrated in first-person by a Greaser, fourteen year-old Ponyboy, an orphan who lives with two older brothers, Darry and Sodapop. There are three levels of conflict: the grudge between the two feuding factions, inter-family conflict between Ponyboy and twenty year-old Darry, and Ponyboy's inner struggle with self identity--what and who he wants to make of himself.At 180 pages, the book was an easy read despite the unrefined writing style, which I struggled with but readily accepted because the roughness of an untrained authorial voice sounded realistic.I was first drawn to The Outsiders because I kept running across comments about the book in discussions concerning The Catcher in the Rye, a book that I have reread and analyzed extensively with great enthusiasm. I am a great fan of Salinger. I am also writing my own coming of age novel and find it helpful to study other works in the genre. The Outsiders has sold over thirteen million copies to Catcher's sixty-five-plus million. The two books have similarities and differences worth examining.Narrative Voice:Both stories are told in first-person. Holden, though unsympathetic, scattered and seemingly unreliable, is convincing and believable. Ponyboy is sympathetic and scattered but sometimes unconvincing because of the rough writing. In the beginning he kept boring me with long descriptions to set up the characters and situation. And later on he would make repetitive asides, telling instead of showing or letting it evolve naturally. Here's an example from page 3:\\"We're poorer than the Socs and the middle class. I reckon we're wilder too. Not like the Socs, who jump Greasers and wreck houses and throw beer blasts for kicks, and get editorials in the paper for being a public disgrace one day and an asset to society the next. Greasers are almost like hoods; we steal things and drive old souped-up cars and hold up gas stations and have a gang fight once in a while. I don't mean I do things like that. Darry would kill me if I got into trouble with the police. Since Mom and Dad were killed in an auto wreck, the three of us get to stay together.\\" (The passage goes on for most of a page.)I know Holden does the same thing, but his voice clicks from the very first word. Listen to Ponyboy's opening line: \\"When I stepped out into the bright sunlight from the darkness of the movie house I only had two things on my mind: Paul Newman and a ride home.\\" The sentence was expressed in reverse order. It threw me off. It should have read: \\"When I stepped from the darkness of the movie house out into the bright sunlight... .\\"Holden's opening line reads: \\"If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably want to know is where I was born, and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, ... .\\" Smooth.It's not fair to compare the writing of a kid with that of a seasoned master, but it illustrates what I'm trying to get across--writing that flows is more digestible and less intrusive.Characters:In both novels, the authenticity of the narrator's voice is the most critical factor. In first-person, the reader is locked inside the narrator's head. But this is where the similarity ends. Holden comes across as privileged, arrogant and whiney, an unsympathetic character, whereas Ponyboy is at the opposite end of the socio-economic scale and quickly earns our sympathy and interest, starting with the fact that, along with his brothers, he's a recent orphan. Also, in the opening pages he get's attacked by a gang and is rescued by his two brothers and four other members of the Greasers' gang, Steve, Two-bit, Dally and Johnny \\"Jonnycake\\" Cade. The reader is drawn in by the loyalty of the boys to a member in trouble.Other sympathetic characters include: Cherry, a cheerleader and a Socs leader's girlfiriend; Randy, a Socs who leaves his gang; Mr. Syme, Ponyboy's English teacher; and Marcia, a friend of Cherry's.Hinton spends a distracting amount of time describing her characters' physical appearance. Salinger describes his characters briefly, with laser precision and only when necessary.A major weakness of Outsiders is the ensemble of villains that are flat, not sufficiently rendered to make the reader feel Ponyboy's fear of them. The Socs are pretty much faceless except for Randy, who turns out to be a pretty good guy.A major difference between the two books is that Hinton stays with this core cast of characters for the duration of the novel, whereas Salinger takes Holden through a series of mini-dramas with a succession of characters and locations, exposing the reader to a broad spectrum of Holden's life.I had trouble relating to some of the characters in Outsiders. They didn't seem real, where as all the characters in Catcher did.Setting:Neither book pays a lot of attention to setting. Salinger handles setting methodically, with surgical precision. Hinton's treatment is more haphazard. There's too much in some places and none in others. Although research indicates the novel is based on Tulsa, Oklahoma, the author tells us only that the location is a city in the Southwestern United States. Ninety percent of the novel takes place on the east side of town, Greaser territory, with the rest occurring, after a short train ride, near Windrixville during a weeklong hideout in an abandoned church on a hill.Catcher covers forty-eight hours in the mid 1940s, whereas Outsider has an approximately two-week duration in 1967.Plot:Catcher is virtually plotless. The reader is kept off balance by not knowing what's coming next but readers are so invested in Holden that they're willing to go along.Outsiders moves along rapidly with few surprises. The plot feels predictable and I don't feel much of a threat from the Socses. The plot doesn't grab me, but I read along because I'm hooked on the sympathetic main character, Ponyboy.An outstanding feature of Outsiders is the way the Greasers stick together as a surrogate family, sharing chores and looking out for one another in a bond of love and respect when functional parents aren't around to guide them. The primacy of sibling affection is a major theme, if not the premise, in both books.The book is an amazing achievement for such a young author."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"My middle school daughter needed this book for class so she can annotate it. This is actually harder to find than you can imagine and most are priced higher. Of course this book is a classic and I remember reading it in school and loved the movie too. A great read for any student middle school and beyond."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"THE OUTSIDERS The Outsiders was a great book from beginning to the end. It was suspenseful the whole way through. I've read it before, and seen the movie. I would never have read except for that my Mom made me read the first chapter. The first chapter was so good I couldn't stop I read it in one day about 2 hours for me. I would recommend this book anywhere from 13 to adult. It shows the good and bad sides of the two gangs. This is a good book and you should read it."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"When I was given this book to read by my english teacher I thought it would be pathetic. It was not! Ponyboy's hardship and his personal strength was amazing. S.E.Hinton describes this book well, with much detail. I do not know how anyone could not like this book. The twist about the book actually being Ponyboy's semester theme was also really good. The letter from Johnny was so sad that I cied. I think that everyone should read this book. I have also seen the movie. That is also good but with the book you can really sence what the character is feeling. S.E.Hinton writes the book to feel as though you are there, a part of Ponyboy's life and feeling his emotions. That is what's so good about it."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I read this book when I was in grade six some nineteen years ago and was instantly transported into the world of the &quot;greasers&quot;. The way in which the author details the differences between the &quot;greasers&quot; and &quot;socs&quot; are vividly believeable and realistic. As a reader, you find yourself rooting for and being concerned with the outcome of the &quot;greasers&quot;. This book had an influence on me more than any other I have ever read. S.E. Hinton makes you feel something for these &quot;outsiders&quot;. You begin to see things from their point of view and the world they come from. Even though I was only twelve when I read it, I remember that it had a profound effect on me. This book brought me to tears and really tugged at my heart strings. I'd finish reading it, then pick it up again and read it all over once more, that's just how wonderful this book was for me. In total, I've read it fifteen times and will be picking it up sometime soon to read again. I especially felt compasionate towards the main character, Ponyboy and the yearing he felt for the &quot;greasers&quot; to be accepted. I commend S.E. Hinton for writing such a classic. I am amazed at she could be such a compelling writer at only sixteen years of age. This book is definitely a classic. I will treasure this book forever and it will always be a part of my childhood. I am lucky enough to own a copy that was published in the 1970's and will always make sure to preserve the battered copy of this book. I will recommend this one to my children for sure. The classic opening line narrated by Ponyboy in the opening chapter still rings in my mind, &quot;When I stepped out of the movie house, I had two things on my mind, Paul Newman and a ride home....&quot;"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I read this book for my English class and I thought that it was the best book that I ever read in my whole life!(And I am ususally difficult with the boks I read!)

I've read both, the new version published and the old one, but they both are the same except for the pictures on the front. (The characters are easier to identify in the old version.) My favourite character was Darry because I can really identify to him; he doesn't show his feelings as much but deep inside he is human, too! I also want to thank my English teacher for encouraging me to read this book, I can never thank you enough; it changed my whole life.

In it, there are 2 groups of cliques, the Soc's (short for \\"sociable\\") pretentious and living off their parents' wealth, and the greasers, not so rich and shunned by society. Today, the Soc's would probably be called jocks and the greasers would be called freaks or heads. It's told through the greaser's point of view and Ponyboy Curtis is the narrator of the story. Since his parents passed away in a car accident, he and his older brother Sodapop are looked after by eldest brother Darrel. Darrel is a somewhat bossy perfectionist but he cares a lot about Ponyboy and sees a lot of potential in him (he also worries that if Ponyboy doesn't stay out of trouble, he could lose his brothers to a boy's home). Ponyboy's friends include vulnerable Johnny Cade who's ostracized by his parents and tough hood Dallas Winston who through the criminal record and rough image is an older brother figure to both Johnny and to a lesser extent Ponyboy. Without giving away too much, Ponyboy, Dallas and Johnny have a chance to see life on the other side when they briefly become heroes (much to the embarrassment of Dallas) after dealing with running away from home and an act of self-defense which could count against Johnny."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book was inspiring.

It turned out not to be the book itself, which was very well written, but I was just not ready for it when I first read it. I'd say make sure your son or daughter (yes, this book is for either gender) is at least in the 7th grade (6th if they are mature) before letting them read this book.

Hinton fashion is a page-turner from begging to end. In The Outsiders there are two gangs the greasers and the social group a.k.a. (soc). The greasers live on one side of town and they are what you can call middle class or a little poorer than that. The soc's are the gang that lives on the opposite side of town and they are what you can call rich and spoiled. T he main characters are Darry. Darry is the oldest of the three brothers. He is also the oldest in the group. Darry is the strongest and he has the best built out of the group. His brothers are named Soda Pop and Ponyboy. Then there comes Soda Pop. He is the middle-aged brother. He is strong and he is also caring. He is also really nice to Ponyboy. Ponyboy is the youngest of the three brothers. He isn't really strong but he has a good build for his age. Ponyboy is the most caring out of the gang. After Ponyboy there comes Twobit. He is Darry's best friend and he is the funny guy in the gang. He never takes anything seriously at all. Twobit is strong and tough. Steve is the other guy in the gang. He is Soda Pop's best friend.

I found it quiteinteresting and I was surprised when I finished it. I was so caughtup in the novel that I had no idea that I was almost done with it! I think that the main character, Ponyboy, is someone that I can relate to. He has a tough as nails exterior because he wants to fit in with his friends, but throughout the novel, you find out that he is very soft on the inside. Ponyboy and Johnny, his best friend, accidentally kill a rival gang member. They have to go hide out in an abandoned church. Johnny is injured while trying to save some small children from the burning church. Ponyboy goes through many mental and physical traumas that keep you glued to the book until it is finished.

I was enthralled for the first half and cried for the entire second half of the book. This book is incredibly insightful into Ponyboy's mind and the motivations behind everything. The author was 16 when she wrote this. the writing style is really sophisticated though, and when I read that she was just 16, i was shocked. But at the same time, it made sense, because this book really understands firsthand what it means to be a teen, and it still rings true even after 30 years. this is one of the best books I have ever read.

However, I really liked this book, and I recommend it to anyone, especially teenagers who don't normally enjoy reading."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders was a book that I enjoyed.The characters in the novel come across many problems.This novel also teaches you what you get out of being in gangs and fighting,in other words taking the wrong path."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I really liked this book. It really caught my attention and it's a book that once you read it you would want to read again and again!This is a great book for teenagers to read at this point because alot of teens like to fight alot and don't even know why they are fighting.Alot of us, teens can learn many lessons from this book. We should all be like Pony and observe what's going on and not be part of it. We should learn from other people's mistake!So I recommened this book to all the teens that like to fight and be involved in gangs and don't know their reasons why they are there or fight."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This was a great and enjoying book to read.

When Ponyboy and Jonny Cade (Ponyboy's best friend) are in trouble with the law, they know they must run. how long can the stay on their own? Will the be caught? You must read the book to find out.The Charaters are on-of-a-kind. Each sentence makes you want to read more. This book is the perfect example of a page-turner. It makes you laugh, it makes you cry. It makes you think. If you are anything like me, this book will stay on the bookself ~Jenn N."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"A great read, still after forty years. I read this book with my middle school students and they were still able to relate to the characters and the theme even though the \\"slang\\" is soooo different from todays. It was great pulling out the slang terms from that period and comparing it with the ones of today. However, the social, and boy-girl relationships still reflect those of today. Please read this book or share it with your students."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"THE OUTSIDERSBy: Michael J.

Ponyboy is a greaser who has enemies, which are socs. Socs. are the rich kids who have pity on anyone who is a greaser. They often get into fights, but when they are not round each other, they do just fine. Everything was going good until one of pony's friends, Johnny, killed a soc. After that incident happened, they were on the run. They left and went as far as they could go. Along their way, Pony and Johnny ran into some old friends and got to live in interesting places.This book is really good and it is interesting the whole way through.

The Soc's, another group who tries to always interfere with the Greasers, makes it difficult for the Greaser's to find peace. Will the Greasers ever find peace? Read to find out because this book teaches many great lessons. I recommend this book to any teenagers who want to enjoy a good realistic fiction book"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"If you are interested in books about gangs that are always fighting, then you should read The Outsiders, written by S.E. Hinten. This book is about two gangs named The Greasers and The Socs. The two gangs don't like each other very well. They had a lot of problems and a lot of them even died.Ponyboy and his gang The Greasers wanted their gang to be the best.The socs never walked aione.Ponyboy brothers were Sodapop and Darry.They were aiways careing for him becaues he was only fourteen and he didn't know much.When ponyboy and johnney were on the streets they wouldn't care If they were alone.Johnney never cared because he felt that his mother didn't love him.Thats when the trouble starts.As soon as the socs saw them alone they would rush up to pick a fight.This book is intersting because some even lose their friends.I like how they solve their problems by standing by each other.What I like about this book was how they were in gangs and dressed a certian way. I give this book 5 stars. I recommend this book to everybody!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"You get attached to the characters so much, you feel like crying once you finish reading it...connects to so many people in life today...IF YOU LOVED THE MOVIE, YOU'LL LOVE THE BOOK EVEN MORE!!!!

I love how every chapter is a page turner and how Ponyboy endears himself to the reader with every passing page. S.E Hinton is to be cespecially commended for the ending of the book, which was thought provoking and satisfying. Thanks for a great reading experience"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders by S.E. HiltonThis is one of the best books ever written. S.E. Hilton does a great job of describing events and feelings that the characters go through. The book is a little old, but the theme and ideas still are going on in young people's life today. It's an all time classic.Hilton has the best wording to poetry how dire the situation is. My favorite is said by Ponyboy \\"I feel asleep in a hoodlum's jacket, with a gun next to my head.\\" The way she writes just the simplest line, but beneath it is a deep meaning. She brings the character to live. You feel as if you know them and you feel their problems are your own. Her writing is unique, her names different. Ponyboy and Sodapop just two of the cool names she has in her book.This book is great. You'll instantly fall in love with it. The first sentence captures your attention and after that you won't be able to put it down.By Me"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I saw the movie \\"The Outsiders\\" after reading he novel by S.E Hinton. If I could rate the movie with a scale from 1 to 5, I would give it a 4 because of several reasons.I didn't give it the highest score (5) because in some parts, it's kind of boring and the theme is not that interesting. The book is much more interesting than the movie, and I think that they could've done a much better job.Even though, I didn't give it the lowest score because the characters acted very well and they really act according to their personalities. You could tell who was who. Also, the setting was well done.In conclusion, the book is better because you can picture things, how you want. The movie resembled the book, but something of it was missing. I think that if they did it again now, they could add much more detail and make it a lot better."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"In the past months, we read an extraordinary book. This book was named \\"The Outsiders\\". This is one of the most interesting and fun books that I had ever read. This is one of the books that had really made me reflect of many things. The problems that were the most important were economical problems, different social classes, and different people's point of view. We saw the movie of \\"The Outsiders.\\" I think the movie wasn't as good as the book, but I did like it. With the book I could feel the different point of view of the characters, and with the movie I could see how they really felt and not just imagine them, actually see it. If I could rate this movie form 1 to 5 I think I could give it a 4. This movie really made me see the different points of view of the characters. I think that the movie was almost the same as the book because the characters almost always said the same think as the movie. The character that I liked the most in the movie was Dallas. He really got into his character as the book said. Also, the settings in the movie were really good; it was as I thought it would be. I really recommend you to read the book and then watch the movie, because if you see only the movie I think you won't understand it as well as if you would read the book. The book will first make you reflect and imagine it and feel everything better, then the movie will show you everything! It was a fantastic movie!*Estefania Canales"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book is downright nasty and retarded. It over-exaggerates , insults the poor and brings pity to those who read it.

Pity Pony and Hinton!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I just finished reading this book in my 8th grade Language Arts class. It was incredible! I laughed, I cried, so on and so forth.

Have AMD and it is hard to read some of the print in the booksthese days but this was fine.Enjoyed the story and the talk with the author"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book starts out as a Greaser named Ponyboy is walking home from the movies. He's in a gang called the Greasers. The Greasers enemies are the Socs. He's walking along and a gang of Socs surround him. They pin him down and threaten to beat him up. Ponyboy's friends run up and save him. In this book the Greasers have a lot of fights with the Socs. One night Ponyboy and Johnny were sitting watching the stars when some drunk Socs came up. They started drowning Ponyboy and Johnny got scared. He didn't want Ponyboy to die so he took out his six-inch switchblade and killed the Soc name Bob. There are little fights between the gangs throughout the book but there is one big one in particular. It's called the Rumble. Since the Socs are really mad a Greaser killed a good friend of theirs they want revenge. Bob knew a lot of people and he was a good guy. All the Socs and all the Greasers meet and have a big fight. They fight for awhile and the Greasers finally win. I think it's good that they win because the Socs have all the money, clothes, cars, and everything else better than the Greasers. Three people die in this book. Johnny dies from severe burns. Dally dies from being shot by the police. Dally is a Greaser too. This book is really good and I think anyone could read it. It pulls you in and you wonder what's going to happen next. It seems weird that this book was written by a woman because it doesn't seem like it."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"the outsiders is not very good... i dont like rumble fish... s.e. hinton is not very good."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"i did this book for my book-talk!!! it wuz the BEST book evah!!!!!! the movie is even better. actors r soooo hot.

The 'heroes' of the story were killing people! and then they went and hid from everything so they wouldn't get in trouble! i mean, all they had to do was tell the police that it was for self-defence, and they would've let u off easily, but if you came later (w/ out the self-defence excuse(they were too dumb to figure it out 4 themseves)), then the police would give you a much harder punishment. the whole book is scewed up like this. the kids don't use their heads! i mean, some person reading this book could interpret i differently than Ms. Hinton had meant to be interpreted, and they could think, &quot;oh, if this BOOK said it was okay, than it really must be okay!&quot; DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Definitly not reccomended. All this book does is glorify gangs, crime, drinking, and smoking yet my teacher continually tried to tell us what a great lesson it taught. Huh."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I had to read this book for my english class. It is my least favorite book out of every book I have ever read. We had to answer these questions, which were like, \\"Are you surprised that a high schooler wrote this?\\" Well, NO! The writing is immature, an adult with higher education has far superior text. This book is pointless, stupid, and violent, and I see no benefit in reading it. Maybe they want us to not join a gang or you'll end up a smoking 14-year-old wanted for murder in the hospital. Or maybe it's just don't grease your hair. Honestly, who would write a book about greasers and rich kids? Not all kids then belonged to one of those groups! There is no plot. It's a \\"boy book.\\" if it is anything, and girls would never read it by choice. A girl wrote it because a boy who experienced this wouldn't bother. I suggest you not bother to read this either."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. I was forced to read it in my English class and I hope I never have to again. S.E. Hinton does a quite shabby job of portraying the boys in this novel, whose abominable grammar is irritating and difficult to understand. The plot is ridiculous and the dialogue is poor; I found myself laughing in the most serious parts of the book. The characters are interminably dumb, and their actions are equally foolish. Hinton adds an obnoxious air of melodrama and sappiness to the story in so many parts, namely the one where Dally &quot;kills himself&quot;. Ponyboy's inept attempts to be poetic and deep annoyed me especially. The characters also set horrible examples for today's youth with their inexcusable and absurd behavior. I advise you all not to read this book unless you are prepared to undergo extreme boredness for a good laugh at mediocre writing."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This is your average typical teenage book that is so absurd and hard to believe that even if you used your imagination to it's limit, you can't even think about what the characters did as human or possible.

I only read this because I was forced to in school, oh god...I now have an urge to read George Eliot or Thomas Hardy."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"A careful reading of this book shows that it has a very heavy editorial hand.Why would anyone today, when gangs, drugs, violence and antisocial behavior are so prevelent suggest reading this sentimental book?Glorifying destructive and anti social behavior in the guise of representing the *persecution* of an underclass is the last thing today's children need.The book falls into the *West Side Story* category.Of course, people, adults as well as children, outside the *mainstream* are misunderstood. But whether every, or even one, drunk, weapon toting, violence prone youth has a *heart of gold* is debatable."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"this book has no plot and it doesn't interest me one bit. these greaser guys are all phsychos with long sideburns.

I don't understand why so many people can actually enjoy it. When I was heartlessly forced to read it in school (funny that, school, you'd think that in school they wouldn't want you to read books that glorify gangsters), many other kids enjoyed it. I HATED it. Perhaps this is because I felt to childish for my tastes. Everybody had a lame nickname, the writing was without merit of any kind, the entire book reaked of kiddieness. For the love of all that you hold sacred, I urge you not to read this book!!!!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"safe that's what this book is, stereoypical characters, steretypical enemies, steretypical morals. The author wasn't a greaser the author was Cherry. The only good part may be that some people will look up Robert Frost after they read the book. I was asked what I thought about the book by a friend, and I said that it was cliche that, her messages and morals were the basics, don't judge people by the way they look we should all get along everyone has good in them. He told me that yeah well now its cliche but back then it was new and on the edge.I thought of South America at that time, and of Marquiez.I though of Existensilism a few decades earlierI thought of Faulkner, Bellew, Ellison, and othersI even though of another book in which the narrator is writing down thier life story the Tin Drum by Gunther Grass.This is as best as I can sum it up. Predictable morals, cardboard characters, an annoying attitude, and so many other problems. The worse insult a writer can get is that they are a sheep in wolves clothing.-Baa Baa"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book is absolutely horrible. S.E.

He tries to make every thing okay with the two gangs sometimes other times if he is really mad he doesn't quite want to do that. Overall this book was a terrific book."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is a book that describes the life of kids that live very close together, but are from two different worlds. The book revolves around the \\"Greasers\\" (lower class) and the \\"Socs\\" (upper class). The Greasers and the Socs don't get along at all and often fight with each other. They both stay on their sides of the city and don't go around each others neighborhood unless they are looking for trouble. Both the Greasers and the Socs are like big gangs, they all stick together and they will help each other out when they need it. Both groups will soon find out though, that the lifestyles and the decisions they make can be costly. One tragic incident makes everyone realize that the problem between the two groups is bigger than they thought and that it was getting out of control. Through all this the characters will learn the importance of family and friends. The difference between them can be over come, if they would look deeper then where people live, what kind of car they drive and where that stand in social status.S.E. Hinton wrote this book when she was a teenager. This is a very well written book and it is exceptional for a teenager. Other books that she wrote, like Rumblefish, are very good also. Rumblefish is similar to The Outsiders."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I really enjoyed this book by S.E. Hinton. It is about a bunch of kids(Greasers) who stick with each other and help one another through tough times. The main character, Ponyboy, has two older brothers, Soda and Darry. Ponyboy's best friend, Johnny, killed one of the people in a gang, the Socs. They ran away to the country to hide out. They hid in a church and after a couple of days it caught on fire while Ponyboy and Johnny were at a store. Little kids were playing in the church and then it cought on fire. Ponyboy and Johnny go and save the kids but a burning piece of the ceiling fell on Johnny and he was rushed to the hospital. Johnny eventually died. Another character, Dally, only really cared for Johnny. Johnny was practically like his brother. Since Johnny died, Dally really wanted to die to and he robbed a store. The cops were after him and Dally pulled out a gun and the police shot him. Dally got what he wanted because he always gets what he wants. I also really enjoyed the ending of the book. I would really reccommend this book.

Oh and when one of the greecer had died at gun fire from cops because johny was practically his little brother that had died and he wanted to join johny in heaven.you see this book is really good. the detail and everything was really good when i had read it. i encourage many peolpe to read it"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"\\"The Outsiders\\" is a fast paced, well-written book for teenagers looking to heal hurting relationships. In \\"The Outsiders,\\" relationships are based on fear and hatred, even between brothers, as evidenced by Darry and Ponyboy. The two distinct groups, Socs and Greasers, generally keep their distance except to participate in horrific gang fights where one boy is stabbed to death.In the final chapters, the characters gradually release their hatred and become courageous and compassionate people. Randy, a Soc, and Ponyboy, Greaser and narrator, come to respect each other, which takes a lot of courage.\\"The Outsiders\\" is a poignant evaluation of friendship and togetherness. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Hinton does an excellent job of depicting a 'diamond in the rough' image in the character of Pony Boy. She also shows how two sides can come together if they put their differences aside and how ignorant it is to judge somebody based entirely on the kind of car they drive or the clothes they wear, or even the side of town they live in. I would recommend this novel to anyone who has ever been misunderstood or has been guilty of misunderstanding another. I think that covers just about everybody. Also recommended: THE LOSERS' CLUB by Richard Perez"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book is very heart-taking and real. The way ponyboy help johnny was family-like.

He himself is a greaser who by defanition has barley, or no money, greasy hair and always hang out in groups. This book makes you think about life in a whole 'nother way.

(Although it is a quick read it really is an incredible book) It takes alot to make me cry-and i mean ALOT-but his book brought tears to my eyes.

It was a fun-filled book that made me want to keep reading. I was always wondering what was going to happen next. The two gangs continuously brawling and one time someone got killed. This was a very suspenseful book because I never could predict what was going to happen next. The book was short, but long enough to get all the details in, like the character, and a detailed description of what was going on at every moment. And the book was very easy to read. Even though I cant relate to any of the characters in the book, I can imagine what it would be like to be in a gang. Being in a gang would be very hard because you are expected to do a lot, like get into a fight if someone makes fun of you. And if you don't then you let the whole gang down."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"We all feel like outsiders at one time or another. Hinton gives a taste in this book of how it is to be an outsider with now feasible way out. Ponyboy and his friends in the \\"gang\\" are trapped.

My book club read this great book.I thought it had a wonderful plot and ending"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Viewed some 35 years down the line S.E. Hinton's \\"can't we all just get along\\" youth-targeted novel can certainly come across as a bit dated, especially in the wake of events like Columbine. However, one has to bear in mind that she (yes, it was written by a woman) was 16 when she wrote it, and its message is a timeless one, regardless of how cynical and knowing we have all become. The story is fairly straightforward, in a small town in Ohio, there are the \\"greasers\\" (lower-class teenagers from broken up households who are a step below being \\"hoods,\\" that is to say, actual criminals) and the \\"socs\\" (middle-class teenagers with nice clothes and cars who are headed for college). The two literally live on different sides of the tracks and are locked in a long-standing running battle against each other. Their background and the story of what happens when a greaser kills a soc in self-defense is narrated by Ponyboy, a bookwormy, head in the clouds greaser who slowly comes to realize that while there are bad elements on both sides, greasers and socs are more alike than they both think. There's a dishy and awfully wise cheerleader girl thrown in the mix, and you can see the Romeo & Juliet and West Side Story influences shining through at times. And while it's a plea for peace and \\"we are the world\\" type of message, it's still a valid one, and one worth trying to expose kids to. Some have disparaged the book for portraying youth violence and drug use, which is kind of ridiculous because while the levels of violence and drugs (drinking and smoking) might have been shocking (although probably not) in 1967, they are fairly tame by today's real life standards. Others criticize the book for glorifying or excusing criminal behavior and violence, which seems to be missing the main point of the book."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I loved this book! Its the best one ive ever read. The characters are unforgetable! I loves ponyboy and johnny. If you liked this book i would suggest reading all her other books to. and there is a movie the outsiders that pretty much follows the book."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is about a group of boys that live on the wrong side of the tracks. These boys are known as greasers because of their rough tough looks and attitudes. This gets them into a lot of trouble with the police and the Soc's. As the main character would have explained Soc's are nothing but white trash with Madras and Mustangs, by the end he figured different. There are rumbles, murders, robberies, and runaways so this book is really exciting.Many of the things that go on in this book don't typically happen these days. Sure some of them do but it is not a thing you hear about on a day-to-day basis. There are few things I can personally relate to in this book, but there are many things I am able to understand that the characters are going through throughout the entire book. The three main characters in the book are Darry, Sodapop, and Ponyboy. They are all brothers. There are some characteristics of Darry's that I share. Darry has a lot of muscle and brains just like I do. He can also be rather cold at times, but once in a while he is affectionate.This was a very good book. This book is one that everyone should read at least once. There is at least one character that everyone will in some way feel close to whether it is because they act alike or because they have the same personality. You will find a character that you can identify with.The thing I liked most about this book is that there is a lot of action and if you read this book you will know what I am talking about.I would definitely recommend this book to anybody that enjoys a good action book and a good story. I give this book a 9 out of 10 stars on all levels. You need to read this book to know what I am talking about, so just read it."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The story of The Outsiders is about a rival gang between the Socs and the Greasers. The Socs are rich kid gangs that hate the Greasers who are less well off, for no particular reason. The story tells about gang members Ponnyboy, Johnnycake, and Dally. Ponnyboy and Johnnycake are the youngest members of the Greasers gang Dally is a mean, crude person who gets in a lot of fights and trouble; in fact, he lives for it. Soda, Ponnyboy's brother is high on life and gets into fights for the fun of it. Darry, Pohnnyboy's oldest brother, is a hard tough person who tries to be both a father and a big brother to his two younger brothers.It is easy for readers to relate to the characters in The Outsiders because they seem like real people. Soda stands out to me because I enjoy life just like Soda does. Ponyboy describes Soda as a person that gets drunk on life. He lives for drag racing and dancing and gets drunk on life without ever touching a beer. In many ways, Soda leads the life I'd like to have. Ponnyboy is another character that comes easily to life in the book. I understand just how Pohnnyboy feels about the loss of his parents because my dad left my mother. Ponnyboy often daydreams about the times when his family was together. He remembers his mom's chocolate cakes and his dad's kidding. Then suddenly reality hits. I would often daydream about how life was better befor mom and dad were fighting. Then reality would snap me back. These are some of the ways this book was real for me.I think this book is excellent and provides credible portrayal of city gang life. My favorite part of the book was the bonding that came about as a result of the deaths of some of the gang members. They begin to give more appreciation and commitment to each other's needs. I also liked the part where Cherry the Soc cheerleader begins to understand why the Greasers act the way they do.I would recommend this book to young readers. Many young people who are in gangs today will find many things in common with the Greasers. There is a lesson here for everyone."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I liked the book the outsiders because it showed the conflicts between two different social classes.

The main characters are three brothers Darry, Sodapop, and Ponyboy, who live alone because their parents died. They also are in a gang, which is like family to all of them. Johnny, who got badly beaten by a Soc once has always gotten scared ever since. Johnny is Ponyboy's best friend in the gang. Ponyboy and Johnny killed a Soc one night so they had to run away, which was a big problem because they needed help. Ponyboy and Johnny ran into a few problems while hiding out, which they had to figure out what to do in a situation. My favorite character in the story was Ponyboy because he wasn't so mean and violent like the rest of the gang- he was nicer and more calm...This was a very good novel that I think many people should read."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Samantha E.The Outsiders, by S.E Hinton, is an incredible novel. Some of the main characters were Ponyboy, Sodapop, and Darry Curtis, Johnny, and Dallas were also part of the Greaser gang and the Socs, another gang, the Greasers' enemy, are some of the main characters. The Greasers ran into many fights and disasters throughout the novel, in which they had to deal with. The character in this story that I admired the most was Ponyboy Curtis. Ponyboy was the youngest in the gang and family, therefore one would think he would be most affected by the other Greasers' actions, but it was the total opposite. I feel that he was the backbone of the gang and family because he was intelligent, compassionate and truly the one who kept the gang together and under control when things got wild.In reality, I can't relate to any of the characters in the story because the whole novel revolves around the environment and the gangs that they are involved with and my surroundings aren't in any way like that. Nor have I ever done some of things that they have done or felt any of the feelings that they have experienced.I thought that this was remarkable novel that every teenager at some point should have the privilege of reading. The whole entire book was exciting and adventurous, there wasn't a single chapter that I didn't enjoy. Although, if I could change one element in the novel it would be that the Greasers would not express, but at least realize and appreciate the very large asset and benefit that Ponyboy was to the gang. I think that both male and female teenagers would very much value and enjoy this story. I hope that all of the people that will read this extraordinary novel will appreciate and love this novel as much as I did."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Adi R.The Outsiders, by S.E.Hinton is about a young teenager named Ponyboy, a member of the Greaser gang. He has two brothers, Sodapop who is also know as Soda and Darrel who is also known as Darry. Ponyboy loves Soda more than anyone in his family including his parent who had just recently passed away. In the gang there was also Two-Bit, the oldest of all Greasers, Steve, Dally and Johnny. Johnny, whose parents on't care for him, had just recently been jumped by the Socs, the other gang in town. In this book the Socs get away much easier than the Greasers, for example if there were a rumble in between the two gangs the Greasers would get much more severe punishments.I could relate to Johnny because about two years ago two kids came over to me when I was walking down the block with my friend and started a fight with me and my friend. Like Johnny, I had to protect myself, so I had the same feeling he had when he and Ponyboy were walking in the park and the bunch of Socs jumped them. Although, I didn't get into as much trouble as Johnny was in.I really liked the book, The Outsiders. My favorite part of the book was when Johnny and Ponyboy met Cherry. It showed that even though they were from different gangs they still kept a great relationship and a strong bond. The way they didn't drop there relationship showed me that though they kept it secret it showed that they really had great relationship. I think ten to fifteen year old boys should read this book."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Shalin ..This book is called The Outsiders. This story was about a boy named Ponyboy who had three brothers and their parents died.Their were these Socs who were rich boys and always bet up Ponyboy and Ponyboy's friend Jonny. The main characters in this story is Ponyboy, Jonny, Sodapop, Darry. Darry which was Ponyboy's brother he was very pertictave and he takes care and loves Ponyboy a lot.Jonny which was Ponyboy's friend always hang's out with Ponyboy.Sodapop which is Ponyboy's older brother lets Ponyboy do what hewants but takes care of Ponyboy. Jonny ran into a lot of problems what happened is the Socs bet him up and they also bet Ponyboy. My favorite character was Darry beacuse he was taking care of the family and loved Ponyboy and Sodapop but he wasent the oldest he is in the middle.I felt like Ponyboy because many people make fun of him and beat him up. Because it goes by the rich poor or in the middle I know I'm not rich and im not poor im in the middle and Ponyboy wasen't he was poor thats one thing that isn't alike about me and Ponyboy, but what is, is that we both get hitten by others and made fun by people. One more thing is that we are both loved by our familys. I liked the book a lot because it was intresting and it is a kind of book that you want to know what happens next. My favoite part of the book is when Darry yellled at Ponyboy when he got home and then Ponyboy ran away from home. my least favorite part of the book was when Jonny and Ponyboy got betten up by the Socs. I think a 12 year old like us or older, and male because they have more alike.

Hinton, is about two gangs, the Socs and the Greasers. One day after the movies Ponyboy, a member of the Greasers, comes home late and his brother Darry starts yelling at him. Ponyboy runs away and picks up Johnny whois also a member of the Greasers. They both go to the park and meet the Socs who started hurting Ponyboy, as Johnny could not watch this anymore he pulls out a knife and kills Bob, a member of the Socs. Everything turns around and now they have to run for their lives from the police. The adventure begins now, but you have to read the book to yourself to figure out the ending!In the story, I relate to Ponyboy because he has gone through a lot of fights. Sometimes I get into fights at a baseball field by my house because there is a group of kids there that don't let anybody play. When Johnny killed Bob, he felt scared. I felt the same thing on the first day of a new school when I was little. I didn't know what to do, so I started panicking and felt scared.I liked the book a lot and my favorite part of the book was the middle because it was exciting. It was when Johnny killed Bob because you don't know what is going to happen next and it gets exciting. I didn't have a least favorite part of the book because the whole book was good. This book is good for boys and girls ages 10-14. If I could change something in the book it would be when Johnny and Ponyboy were at the movies because they talked to the girls for a long time. The whole chapter was about the two boys talking to the girls about different things and it got a little boring.

He didnt deserve to die so young, he had so much to live for. And then Dally dies, the gang is shattered, but they keep going. They're all so young and have so much to look forward to in life, why was the world so cruel to them? Their bond was definately a special one.

Like when Ponyboy and Johnny saved the kids, or when they all fought the socs. That helped me realize that fighting isn't the right thing to do and that no one is really better than you, even if they have money and you dont. It can help alot of boys and girls realize that fighting and making fun of each other doesn't solve anything but someone getting hurt. People should get to know each other before they say things about them. Like Ponyboy and Randy did. I am sure they talked about each other but they finally made peace with each other.

Ponyboy portrays any regular Joe, and the Greasers can relate to any kind of gang or group of friends that care about each other.

Specially the scenes where Ponyboy is loyal to his gang and also when he feels insecure about his ideals and thoughts we have all been through something like this.

When a violent encounter erupts with Ponyboy and his best friend Johnny versus several drunken socs it exposes them to the series of wild events, Ponyboy experiences first-hand the uselessness of fighting and dying for an illogical division in class. Although there is one violent scene, the story really deals with how the people he meets in his young path towards emerging manhood affect Ponyboy's relationships and perceptions.

I believe it's a book that if I was introduced to earlier in my schoolyears or life, I would have been more interested in the book because I've already been through most of this stuff.I would definitely recommend this book to some younger readers.The author gives good complete detail of events that take place in the neighborhood. For example the details she gives on the gangs, violence, people and kinds of situations that's inside the neighborhood.I believe that someone younger will have more interest than I did. I had slight interest in the book. Someone younger might learn more, because its plot and themes might come up in the actual life we live today in different environments. Some of the things they've been through had actually been situations in neighborhoods that I've resided or been in. For example, people get killed in my neighborhood and the person that killed them skip town so that they won't get caught.So therefore I believe that it's a very interesting book.

The book is still taught today and has slowly graduated from a contemporary tale using new slang and terms to a historical view of kids living in an urban setting before the massive takeover of drugs and electronics.In this book, the lines are clearly drawn. You are either a Greaser or a Soc. Socs are rich over-privileged kids (all white) given too much license and too little interest by their parents. Hinton suggests that the only way they can \\"feel\\" is to fight the Greasers in the town. Why anyone in their right mind would want to fight a Greaser is beyond me. Greasers are the poor kids (all white) that live on the wrong side of the tracks. Everyone's familiar with the stereotypical John Travolta in \\"Grease\\" type character. They're harsh and mean but, as we see in this tale, they have good hearts every one. Our hero is one Ponyboy Curtis. Apparently 1967 was the last year you could be named \\"Ponyboy\\" and not get daily thrashings from your peers for having such a la-de-dah name. With his crew of fellow Greasers and friends, Ponyboy's a great student and a nice guy. When he gets involved in a game of murder by bad luck, he's finds himself on the run with fellow innocent wide-eyed Greaser Johnny. From this experience the two learn what is really important, and Ponyboy finds the strength to tell the story of this friends and their lives.The idea that this book was written by a seventeen year-old is still shocking to me. There's a real maturity to the text, no question. Sure, some ideas are pounded into the reader over and over until you're completely sick of them. But the characters really do exhibit a sense of affection for one another. You believe that Ponyboy, Sodapop, and Darry are brothers. You understand the love Dally felt for the puppy dog-like Johnny. The book does take on a kind of \\"West Side Story\\" track at certain times, no question. On their way to a rumble, the characters actually burst into song ala \\"Officer Krupky\\". And where are all the minorities? Severely lacking (and therefore making this book less of a great choice to teach in high schools these days).Hinton, being a woman, has an odd take on females in this book. Ponyboy is not interested in the girls in his social set. Greaser girls are, according to him, too harsh and unfeminine. The Soc girls, on the other hand, are just his type. Personally, I was a little offended by the idea that the richer a girl is the more desirable she becomes. But what's a classic tale without some archaic elements?It is a little hard to forgive the slang of this book at times. But compared to some other slangy novels, this one's pretty good. There is the occasional, \\"You dig okay\\", and other unfortunate phrasings, but they're kept to a bare minimum. I'm not surprised this book is taught in high schools around the country either. Swearing is non-existent and violence is, while common, deplored. This is a pretty darn squeaky clean story. Fortunately, it's eminently readable and somewhat deserving of its status as a \\"classic\\"."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"That book is one of the greatest book I have ever read! It shows that blood is thicker than water and it shows true friendship. It makes you want to cry, get mad, sad, and shock all at the same time. I would want anybody of all ages to read this book."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"\\"the outsiders\\" is completely a book worth reading. I had hated all the other books until i got this one.

We usually don't read books, but we really liked reading this book. We really liked the discriptive paragraphs and unique details of fight scenes. The way the author described their life styles was intriguing, which kept us reading the book. We enjoyed the psychological character development. Our lives changed so much since we read this very appealing book."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Between gang wars to murders, Ponyboy has to live through it all. How hard will live get if you need to bleach your hair and run from the police? Ponyboy has many problems that he needs to face in the book The Outsiders, written by the author S.E. Hinton.Ponyboy a normal everyday boy, passing in school and to get in trouble everyday or two, but the hardest thing in his live is to be part of a gang called the greasers. Wearing their hair slick back and a leather jacket, jeans and a white shirt. Ponyboy is the weakest in the gang, but he is also is the youngest in the gang. Only the middle-class and upper class hates them. The upper class has the biggest problem they were known as the socs, short for the socialites. They think the greasers are no good. The socs are known to drive mustangs and to drink lots of whisky.Ponyboy is the youngest in the family and is being raised by his two brothers (Sodapop and Darry) since their parents died many years ago. Darry is the leader of the gang and is all tough and is known to not get in trouble but that is the opposite of sodapop he is known to get in a lot of trouble with his friend twobit. Ponyboy is the smartest of them all because they were forced to drop out of school to get a job and get money in the house. Well it seems like it all went well, through the time until many of the greasers were being founds with blood gushing from their heads, and cuts over their body and to later find out that the socs were behind this all. The socs soon tried again against two younger boys Johnnycake and Ponyboy, they started to drown Ponyboy so johnnycake helped him but it wasn't something smart (this was when the climax was reached)... Read the book to find out the ending. Later on a new problem was unraveled, there was going to be a rumble, but the only weapons to use were your fists, the first gang to leave loses, well they did as told but it wasn't the socs and the greasers who went to the fight. The greasers had many other gangs had been on their side, like two other gangs from other towns. Ponyboy ended up getting thrown around, and many people have brought the rule, people came out with bloody noses and even a black eye. Although Ponyboy was the youngest he had to help his friend Johnnycake out, since he was down one arm since he was in a fire earlier that month. One gang soon left.... Read the book to find out!The author has done a great job and effort to make this book. S.E. Hinton has made this book interesting by adding the lingo that many kids use today like \\"We ain't going to lose\\" and stuff like that. S.E. Hinton has many mouthwatering moments in this book and it is the hardest thing to do is put the book down, that is like impossible.My group and I came to a decision that this book is recommended to kids from the grades of 5^-8th. This book teaches you the right from wrong. And by reading this book it will help you to stay out of trouble all of high school, it will make you think that \\"Should I do that and what are the consequences?\\"This book review has been made from the school of Highland, also known as White Plains Middle school. White Plains, New York. I suggest you go to your local library and grab a copy of this book, if you don't you will miss out on a lot of cool and exciting stuff."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This is one of those books where you can't stop reading it! It is a fiction story but seems to be based on the reality of gangs in life. I was soo sad when i finished because i wanted there to be more. S.E. Hinton has written six wonderful young adult books, and i encourage you to read them all. She wrote this book at the age of 16 which is absolutly unbelievable. This book inspired me to read more because it shows that books can be 100 times better than tv. All the characters seem so real. Ponyboy has been my favorite character from all of the books i have ever read."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This is the first favorite book i have ever read. I enjoyed the whole thing. When i started reading it i felt like it was a movie or something. the confusing part of the story is that they used lots of 50's or 60's slang terms in there. (E.G. heater is a gun.) This book is about gangs so if you are a person who likes movies you should read this."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"In the bok The Outsiders, I believe that it shows a real,beievable,teenage life that relates to todays society. It shows different cliques, and how they live against eachother, like how the real world is, and shows about consequences of your own actions, which we need today for our citizens. I feel that this is a type of book that shows you abo9ut the real world, written like it came from the real world."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book was really good. My teacher said I would like it, but I wasn't sure. It really hit home with me though because we have gangs in our schools today. I didn't know that in the olden days they also had gangs to worry about. it goes to show that our parents may have had some of the same problems we do. I really liked the characters in the story and I'm glad Ponyboy didn't die. I was really surprised when Mrs. Goodin told us that the author was a woman. She wrote the book when she was young."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book was a smashing book. I mean all the action with johnny and everything was GREAT!

I first read this book in the 7th grade, and have read it many times since then. this book is about the relationships and bond between 7 boys between the ages of 14-21. One night the two youngest boys get into trouble with the law. They get into a fight with the&quot;socs&quot;, the upperclass snobs, which results in one of the boys killing a soc. While running from the police the boys learn more than they ever would in school. All in all I LOVE THIS BOOK! I recommend this book to kids above the age of 12 because it does contain some violence but I also reccomend it to girls and guys. I know you'll enjoy it, I sure did!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I think this book is one of the few that I will always be able to relate to in my life. The characters are so real to me, and I can see them in so many of the people that are close to me, as well as myself. As a result of this book, I have had a greater understanding of these people, and will always enjoy reading it over and over again. I'd recommend this book to anyone, because it helps you see the other side of things, it really gets you thinking. Most of all, it inspires you to just be who you are and appreciate those who are important to you."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I think this book was a great book. When I first read it I liked it so much that i read it every day. I even took it to school to read in my reading period. I liked this book because to me it was very touching. The thing I liked about it was when Ponyboy was at the hospital and his brothers came to visit him. He thought that Darry really didn't care but he saw him sort of crying and they gave each other hugs. That was sweet. I also like it because there was some action and hattred that made me read more. Like when they were having a rumble.Another thing that made me like this book was the fact that there was real close friendships and caring going around. Everyone cared about Jonny and always respected him. The sadest part in this book was when Jonny was dead. I thought that was sad because to me he was like an innocent. He had no brothers or sisters, and had parents that didnt care about him. The only people that cared about him was the gang. Also when Dally kills himself because Jonny was dead. That was sad because Dally lost the only person he really cared about. I liked this book because there was courage, for ex. when they ran in the burning church, there was friendship like gang had for Jonny and many more. I really liked this book because it has inspired me to read more exciting books like this one. S.E. Hinton did a great jop writing this book."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book is amazing, I read it in school my 7th grade year and bought the book. I've read it over and over.

If you like everything I've said so far read the book."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders by S.E.

I truly loved this book mainly, because of this fact, and that it is well developed and beautifully written."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"It had been a long time since i read The Outsiders but i do remember a lot of it because a good book sticks with you for a lond time. It was very accurate on portraing what happens in the streets on a city. Another good thing about this book is that you can relate to atleast one of the characters because there are so many of them and they are all different in many ways. I think think that sometimes we all think about what we would do if we saw are friend being beaten up and a lot of us would do the same to save his life.I recamend this book mainly for younger poeple because it deals with a lot of situations that could or may have already came along. I think that YOU should read this book"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"While reading the reveiws I saw many people that loved the book but some that hated it. It showed me that many people have it better than they think. Like me, a middle class teen that read this book in the 6th grade and since read it atleast 20 more times. When I think I have a rough life this book always helps me to see how lucky I'm to have parents and to live in a nice house and neighborhood. I mean, that, even if I don't have a perfect life and all, I still am pretty good off. This book is very emotional and brings me to tears at the end. It is wonderfully written by s.e. hilton and should stay on everyones summer reading list. For those who hate the book, I can't say how much that surpises me. I've recommend this book to all my friends that didn't read it over the summer. Like I siad this book helps you see from three points of view, you, greasers and socs. The differences between them are't much but ho important are differences when its the people that causes the problems and/or having to see them. To find out if what I say is true, READ THE BOOK!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I found this book too old to connect to real life these days. It may give a look into what your parents had done in the past, but for a modern day teenager, leather jackets and tons of grease are no more than a mere figment of their imaginations to see in real life.Quite similar to the themes in Go Ask Alice, where drugs and friends make all the difference in the world. Not an especially thourough deep look into each character's well being and thoughts, but emotions are well played out. This is more of a TEEN classic, not a classic that will last for centuries to come."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The outsidersThe outsiders were a book about two groups of kids that did not like each other they were called the greasers and the socs.

But you will soon realize it's a heartfelt story. It gives emotion and shows love and the power of friendship.Ponyboy, a 14 year-old hoodlum, is growing up with his controlling older brother Darry, and his softer brother sodapop who's the only one Pony can relate to. He's a good kid, and does great in school, and is just like every other boy his age, but the only problem is that he's a greaser. As a greaser, Pony and his gang are constantly fighting the Soc; the upper class.All the conflicts start when Johnny, Pony's best buddy, end up going to a movie together one night. They meet two Soc girls and when their boyfriends find out later that night, and a conflict erupts, Pony and Johnny are forced to run away.As the boys are hiding away there, they teach each other different things about life. They learn importance in things that didn't mean so much to them before then. But when tragedy strikes the boys are there to become heroes. After risking their lives, a bigger problem arises and Pony fears the loss of someone close to him.Throughout the story Pony has faced many problems but he wasn't ready for what happens later. As he is dealing with his biggest fear ever, he's also helping his gang stop the hatred and violence once and for all against the Soc.

In fact a couple of them have committed these acts, even killing. All this fighting you'd think they'd learn or even try to fix it. That's how this story came to be.When you think of Pony boy, a main character in the book, you'd probably think he's sensitive but brave. Also he has a pretty good personality for where he lives. Dally, on the other hand, is rough and mean. He's always into trouble and not many people get along with him. Soda Pop is in between. He's handsome and brave but fights a lot. Johnny is a scared, but can be brave boy who's lost in his dying world. Cherry Valance is a smart, pretty soc who decides to help the greasers in the war against the Socials because she hates the fighting and will do anything to stop it.So when Pony Boy and Johnny get jumped and up roar occurs in their group. So as Johnny and Pony Boy run away things start occurring until they suddenly find themselves back in their home town but not the way they had intended returning. All the while there's a big rumble being planned between the Socials and the Greasers to end all battles.

But the Socials believe that nothing will change even if they win.This book is all about fighting for life and rights. Also about how some people trying to reach there dreams even if they're at the bottom of the pyramid. It's a great book to read and has a good meaning to help people in life. It teaches people that fighting is no answer for problems. Also that you shouldn't treat people like they're less than you. Cause no one's less because of where they live or if they're poor.

Hinton as a story full of overwhelming violence and hatred. In reality, this adventure filled story is about a group of boys trying to find their inner selves. Throughout the story there is a never-ending battle between the Greasers, a gang of economically poor teenagers, and the Socs, (short for socials) another gang that is a rich, well to do group of teenagers. The Outsiders is a story full of love, horror, suspense, and reality that creates a story line that is a great read for all ages.In a small, beat-up town in Oklahoma, teens like Ponyboy suffer from societal pressures such as violence, drugs, and even more. Pony, a member of a small gang who call themselves the Greasers, struggles in life because of family situations as well as peer relationships. For example, Pony believed that his brother Darry, a serious and hard working man, hated him. Also, almost every member of the Greaser gang feels that they are not socially accepted by all of their peers. A few of the members do not care, but Pony and Johnny are affected by this and especially want to be equal with everybody. They were motivated to be in a gang and fight because they wanted to appear tougher than the other gangs, which in their eyes would make them be better as a person.One night, things are taken too far between the Socs and Greasers. Something serious happens and Pony and Johnny's whole life changes in an instant. They are filled with regrets and wish they could have that night back so they could make better choices. They are forced to run away to an old abandoned church in a small town in the country side called Windrixville. During this difficult time, Pony recites a poem called \\"Nothing Gold Can Stay.\\" By remembering this poem, Pony wants to teach his friends to stay gold by staying true to themselves like the poem says. This poem sets the stage for the rest of the book. In the middle of each turn of events, Pony and his friends take one step at a time and start to realize that violence will not take them anywhere in life. They also begin to realize this from their young 16 year old friend, Johnny. He is the first one to realize this and he tells them not to fight anymore because it does not help their circumstances in life.The Outsiders is a great book that is likely to catch any reader's attention. It is an awesome story throughout the entire book. In the end, Pony officially finds himself as a person and is able to keep his own personality with the help of his friends. As a result, this book comes close to reality and at the same time it teaches a lesson that everyone should know about life."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"When a glance is given to the book The Outsiders, the cover might not catch the eye. But when the words are read, you'll come to realize that this story is full of action relating to teen life. Adventure, love, mystery, and violence are all experienced in this tale of friendship.A boy of 14 years old named Ponyboy walks out of a movie theater only to find Socs, rich kids from high school, jumping him. He's not the only one that has this problem though. His brothers Darry and Sodapop and his friends Steve, Two-Bit, Dally and Johnny deal with the same people over and over again. Living on the eastside of Oklahoma, these boys are considered greasers, J.D.'s and hoods. This title keeps them empowered and tough in their world.Later on in the story, a conflict is made and Johnny and Ponyboy are forced to run away. They survive on little supplies but when trouble is found, Ponyboy and Johnny are off to the rescue. After risking their lives, they are put in the hospital. The tale goes on with more action packed parts and adventure.Through all the troubles Ponyboy faces, he learns the importance of helping another out. The story ends with a beautiful finish of love and lesson. You will find yourself so involved with this book of many wonders. It truly is a fine journey to go on."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"\\"So it doesn't do any good, the fighting and the killing.\\" This was a lesson both worlds (the socials and the greasers) had to learn in the book the Outsiders. Almost all that happened with the socials and the greasers had to do with fighting, or even killing. Johnny, Pony Boy, and the rest of their gang dealt with the first hand. In fact a couple of them have committed these acts, even killing. All this fighting you'd think they'd learn or even try to fix it. That's how this story came to be.When you think of Pony boy, a main character in the book, you'd probably think he's sensitive but brave. Also he has a pretty good personality for where he lives. Dally, on the other hand, is rough and mean. He's always into trouble and not many people get along with him. Soda Pop is in between. He's handsome and brave but fights a lot. Johnny is a scared, but can be brave boy who's lost in his dying world. Cherry Valance is a smart, pretty soc who decides to help the greasers in the war against the Socials because she hates the fighting and will do anything to stop it.So when Pony Boy and Johnny get jumped and up roar occurs in their group. So as Johnny and Pony Boy run away things start occurring until they suddenly find themselves back in their home town but not the way they had intended returning. All the while there's a big rumble being planned between the Socials and the Greasers to end all battles. This motivates many of the characters to be ready and win this rumble so they can stop some of the violence. But the Socials believe that nothing will change even if they win.This book is all about fighting for life and rights. Also about how some people trying to reach there dreams even if they're at the bottom of the pyramid. It's a great book to read and has a good meaning to help people in life. It teaches people that fighting is no answer for problems. Also that you shouldn't treat people like they're less than you. Cause no one's less because of where they live or if they're poor. It does deal with death and what consequences could happen when you do something drastic or something you knows not right. Consider reading this book."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"this novel is by far the best i have ever read in my life. it shows how people are treated in society and alot more this is a classic!!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is a book about a city in the western United States where the Socs (the socials) fight, endlessly, the Greasers (poor hoodlum-types of kids). Ponyboy Curtis, the main character, his brothers Sodapop and Darry (don't ask), and their friends are a gang of Greasers that live a good life with no real trouble ahead of them. Johnny Cade is the only member of the gang who really has trouble in his past, and his future.Everything seems to be going alright for Ponyboy in his life. He even manages to make a semi-friendship with a Soc, but that same night that Soc's boyfriend jumps Johnny and Ponyboy, and things start to get really out of control. Bob, the boyfriend, and his friends start to drown Ponyboy and Bob, himself, attacks Johnny. Johnny, with his experience, knows what might happen and does something unspeakable.This is a great, realistic fiction book about life and all the troubles it has along the way. The stories it tells are compelling, true to life, and hold your interest. I recommend this book to anyone 11 and up."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"At first, I thought \\"Oh no, not another West Side story!\\" Well, apart from the love story it looks a lot like it. Besides some parts, I did not like the story much. However, I can imagine that children, especially boys, from the age of twelve and above will love it. It is not a \\"soft\\" story though it handles about the feelings of some real tough guys. I was surprised by the part that two of these \\"Greasers\\" were reading Gone with the Wind. The part that Ponyboy finds out that all Greasers are dreaming of a better life was the most philosophic. That he and Johnny were aloud to be different from the others surprised me. The book is written from Ponyboy's point of view. I like it that the book ends in the same way as it started. The readers are actually reading Ponyboy's essay"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is by far the best book I have ever read. It takes place in Oklahoma. Its about a 14 year old kid named Ponyboy who is a greaser. The book takes you through Ponyboy's life as a kid growing up with little money and no parents, just two older brothers. As the reader you experience what life is like for Ponyboy. The troubles he has with his older brother, the desire he has to get somewhere in life, and all the conflicts the Greasers experience with the Socs. During a fight a friend of Ponyboys stabs the leader of the Socs in self defense. Ponyboy, a dedicated friend, stands by and helps his friend get through the felony.I would recommend this book to 6th graders and higher because of the mature situations and death.Read this book to find out about what happens to a fourteen year old Greaser."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Wow, this is an absoluetly amazing book!! once i started reading, i couldn't put it down anymore, and ended up even reading it under teh table in school. i found it to be a very shocking story, but it was brutally honest. it made me think about society and how kids have problems when they don't fit in. I liked the way it was written, especially the fact that it didn't have a happy-hollywood-type ending, where everything turns out to be ok. its a great book, and you should read it too!!!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This is the most amazing book I have ever read...I actually had to read it for school and it really got to me.

It really can target the young teen reader to show how much they have. I would recommend this book to kids of my age. I think the author does a good job showing how much kids can have and how much they can have taken away."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders was the best book that i have ever read in my entire life. It was very exciting and made you want to keep reading the book. The book was about two rival gangs called Soc's and Greasers their were charcters such as Darry, Soda, Pony-Boy, Steve, Johnny, and a lot more. The two got into a rival when the soc's attacked one of the Greasers named Johnny. Every so often they would fight and jump and try hurting the other group. One time they were trying to hurt Pony and Johnny kills one of them. After that the Soc's chase after the Greasers. Three people die in the story and is kind of sad at the end of the story. I really enjoyed reading the story. It was my favorite book!!!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"All I wanted to say is that this book was AMAZING!!!It was the most........ The book was to GREAT to put into words. Ive been trying to for the longest time but I just can't think of a word that would describe this book. The characters are amazing and sometimes i just find myself having coversations with Ponyboy or Sodapop or Johnny or any of them and I think that reason I can do that is because S.E. Hinton described them so well and gave them great personalities that I feel like there real and I know them And to all the people who said that \\"This book had to much violence in it\\" and that \\"Kids wouldnt do any of that like fight and stuff\\" Well I dont think that they understand that kids at that time and that grew up in inner cities would do that kind of stuff. I would recommend this book to anyone !!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"&quot;The Outsiders&quot; is a compelling tale of suspense, hate, and the obvious differences between two groups of people.

I highly reccomend this well-written book to anyone!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book is a perfectly fine story about teenage kids in gangs, but it's simply not spectacular. One major dissapointment is that all of S.E. Hinton's books seem exactly the same--read The Outsiders four times and save your money."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I love the book. I can really relate to Ponyboy.I am just like him (except I did't kill anyone).I am like him becuase I am also in a &quot;tight-knit&quot; gang like him. I've been in gang fights, and rumbles. Finally there's a book that shows how I feel. I know how it feels to lose someone. The book really says a lot. I just love the book alot."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The characters in the novel The Outsiders were not the type of people that I would usually find in my neighborhood.

I would recommend The Outsiders to almost any young adult reader."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book was one of the best books I ever read...I must of read it a thousand times before i fanally put it down and read another book. I thought it was sad at the end...when i first read it I cried... I'm not sure if it's my favorite book or not but it's the best non-fantacy book I ever read. I usually only read fantacy books but I really liked the Outsiders. I read this about 2 years ago at somebody's house and when I finished I just had to go out and buy a copy."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"S.E.

This is brilliant and if you like The Outsiders, read them all."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"You have to read this book. If you like gangs books and all that stuff you gotta read. Caution, if you read this you'll want to read more about hinton"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I first read this book when I was 9 yrs. old.I read it of my own free will.

I absolutely fell in love with it and I hope you will,also!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book gave me an idea of what life was like when there were greasers and socs.

They were realistic, but not of the kind I like to read about. This book is a good one for school reading, but not for private reading."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The book is great. The story is about ponyboy. Ponyboy lost his parents and only has his two brothers and his gang as family now. Johnny, his best friend, gets in trouble and they are forced to do some suspensful stuff. I recommend this book to everybody, all ages. Its full of suspense and action as well."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I really recommend The Outsiders because it is a book filled with real life situations. You find values and antivalues that make you think about the problem teens lived in the 60's and that they are basically the same that kids live now. I also see the book as a warning for parents, to prevent their kids from belonging to a gang and to really love and pay attention to what their kids do and who they hang out with. Hinton's books is still popular because it is very realistic."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I recommend this book to all teenagers. This book shows the life of a bunch of teenagers with some home life problems. They learn to stick together and to help each other fight the &quot;socks&quot;. They were just a preppy gang that they clashed with. The book will teach a kid some morals in life and to appreciate them. I think that this was an excellant book to read. I really don't recommend it to a younger person and I don't recomend it to a older person but great for a teen."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Have you ever wondered what being an outsider would be like? Living in constant fear that you might get caught and killed? What an experience that would be... and it's described perfectly in S.E. Hinton's book THE OUTSIDERS. So, sit back and listen to what I have to say!In the beginning, the main character, Ponyboy, is explaining and setting up the story. He mentions an important part of the book. He was telling us how there were three social groups. The greasers were a poor, wild group, and they were the lowest class (he was in this class), middle class, and the &quot;socs&quot; (short for socials) who were spoiled, rich, people who like to jump &quot;greasers&quot; as a hobby.Ponyboy had two brothers, Sodapop and Darry. Ponyboy's parents had passed away and Darry was taking care of them. THey had to be good or Sodapop and Ponyboy could be taken away from Darry. If they weren't extra careful they could be sent to foster homes.One night when Johnny (another member of the &quot;greaser&quot; gang) and Ponyboy were under the stars, Ponyboy got home very late and his brother Darry got VERY angry. Darry was SO angry he slapped him! Ponyboy ran to find Johnny and then ran away to the park. Just their luck, a group of drunken &quot;socs,&quot; pulled up. As they tried to drown Ponyboy, Johnny pulled out a knife in self-defense and stabbed one of them!What will happen? Will Johnny and Ponyboy be able to escape and stay away from the police? If you want to hear the answer to these questions, read this book, and you'll get quite a thrill. It will also teach you a great and important lesson."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"As a high school student myself, 'The Outsiders' is a compelling novel with much lessons to offer. With a new twist in every chapter, 'The Outsiders' provides problems and solutions for the everyday teen. While violence is a reoccuring event in the novel, the lessons come with the solutions to those acts, many which pertain to self-discovery. The book clearly illistrates that there is no difference between our parents generations to ours because even then high school violence did occur. Having just completed this book at my age, I find it all the more compelling. We as teens see violence on television but it is more national, as compared to 'The Outsiders' which pertains to high school students everywehre, even close to home. The characters in the novel are very much like those of which I can relate to because they mention such defined groups. There is the \\"greasers\\" and the socs\\". While the generations have changed, we do not classify people as \\"greasers\\" or \\"socs\\", but groups exist and they exist in large numbers. I see these groups in our school, and the tension does exist. As much as we are told to be individuals and go our own ways, we are still all groups of people and 'The Outsiders' offers help and guidence in braking down the social walls. 'The Outsiders' is truely worthy of five stars and should be read for many years to come."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"After I read the first sentence I thought it would be about a boy who likes to watch movies. But once I finished chapter one I new it was something a little bit more special than that. The outsiders is about two gangs in one town .The Greasers and the Socs (short for socials).The Greasers and Socs have contempt for each other, which is obvious with the language and the way they act towards one another. The book tells about how gang life can be and the effects of death on someone.The story is also about ponyboy and his brother darrel who fight alot. There are times when S.E.Hinton flashs back to fights and sad memories. If you haven't already read this book, let me just say that you are missing out. I suggest you read this book."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I think the book &quot;Outsiders&quot; is the best book I have ever read in a long time. I think you should read this book because it keeps you reading and you dont want to stop. It has a lot of action when the church on Jays mountain caught on fire. Johney, Dally and Ponyboy risked there life for four to five eight year old kids. The kids parents told Johney and his friends they were heros sent from god. there are to different groups the Soc. (the rich kids) and the Greasers that are(poor and they have no money) . I think everybody should read the book at least once."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This was an excellent book!!! It was funny, serious, and interesting. It is a good read. This book gave me a front row eye view of the battle between the Socs and the Greasers. It was funny because soda, Ponyboy's brother, is very comical. Like when he and the rest of the gang start doing acrobatics of the porch a bunch of people fall down. This story is also serious at the same time like when Johnny goes to the hospital the whole gang is sad. Also at the same time it can be poetic when the fuzz, police, is after Ponyboy &amp; Johnny they go to an abandoned church and the story slows down and Ponyboy recites some poetry about life. And still after all of that it is still one of the best books I have read!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The novel &quot;The Outsiders&quot; was a great book. It was a book a lot of action, friendship, and differences. Some of the parts that had a lot of action were when the Greasers and the Socs at the huge rumble and when Pony and Johnny saved those boys from the church. This book also showed a lot of friendship and loyalty. The Greasers showed a lot of loyalty to each other because they are all like brothers. Also in this book there were a lot of differences. For example the Greasers and Socs. They were different in pretty much every way. &quot;The Outsiders&quot; is a great book for teenagers and adults I thought it was the best book I ever read."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I recommend the book \\"The Outsiders\\" by S.E. Hinton to all the 13 year olders and up in America.This book is full of many realistic events in it.For example, all the fights between the Greasers and the Socs and the family problems with both Ponyboy's family and Johnny's family.Another reason I recommend this book is because you can relate.For instance, you have to deal with other gang members just as spoiled and rude as the Socs everyday. Another reason I recommend this book is because it deals with friendships and my friends and I have always enjoyed books that involve friendships.Ror example when Ponyboy and JJohnny ran away together because one of them was in trouble. I recommend this book to anyone who can read because everybody will like it."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This was a very very good book.

Dally and Two-bit are Darry and Soda's friends. This whole book is leading up to a big fight between these two gangs. The Soc are cheap. They will bring weapons to this fight.

The Soc.(short for the Socials)are the ones who get all the breaks and extra privileges and then there are the greasers who have to always look out for themselves and basically have eyes in the back of their head and live on the bad side of town. Ponyboy is proud to be a greaser but he feels sympthany when a Soc. is killed. After the killing, a lot of events lead up to the surpising conclusion which you'll have to buy the book to read it.

Hinton, describes the lives of young adults when they are going through tough times. The \\"greasers\\", Ponyboy, Sodapop, Darry, Two-Bit, and Dally are the poorer boys of the city. The Socs,(also called the Socials) are the higher class of boys in the city. They bully and beat-up the greasers just because they are poorer than they are. I enjoyed this book due to the characters, how they act, and how humorous they are. My favorite characters are Darry and Ponyboy. I like Darry because he is smart and strong. I also like Darry because he likes to show off his muscles. I like Ponyboy because he enjoys movies and he always sticks to his gut feeling. You should read The Outsiders- it is a great book!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders will forever remain my favorite book.The book features 14 year old Ponyboy, living on \\"the wrong side of the tracks\\". Him and his buddies have been labeled Greasers by The West Side Socs, the snooty rich kids. Their lives have been planned out for them since birth. Socs jump Greasers, Greasers are hoods. Nothing could change that. Well, something could.On a fateful night, Ponyboy and his friend Johnny do something beyond just a fight. Now, they must skip town and seek refuge in another town with the help of a rambunctious hoodlum and friend. Together, Ponyboy and Johnny and their hoodlum friend Dally change the labels stuck on them for years.While the summary wasn't as accurate as I'd wanted, I didn't want to ruin an amazing storyline.The Outsiders was written by 16 year old S.E. Hinton after she heard about her friend being jumped. This story shows bold heroism and friendship. You can relate to any one of the characters and feel obliged to hear what will happen in the lives of the characters next. Full of twists and turns and expressions of anger and confusion and most definitely frustration, this book takes you on an unforgettable journey into the life of a \\"greaser\\", and how one night can alter the very fate of a city.This book contains more mature content and should be read by those of us who are 13 and over.The book is 5 starred, though it deserves more. The book is well written and the word usage and language is breathtaking. The way Hinton creates personality in the form of dialogue is something to be admired by aspiring writers.Inspirational and definitely worth it."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This was truly an amazing book. It's about a greaser named Ponyboy who is a core member of the \\"greasers\\" but prefers to be alone sometimes such as when he watches movies. His dad is dead so he has to live with Darry and Soda. Darry, being the oldest and in charge of the house, is very serious and needs to take a chill pill and that puts stress on Pony. At first Pony's life is pretty typical (aside from occasional friend fights and family blunders), but then he saves children from a burning church and gets into rumbles with the Socs (socials) who are your typical spoiled rich kids. This novel has many good vibes and life messages in it that would be helpful during the teen years."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is an interesting book about a boy named Ponyboy who lives with his two brothers Darry and Sodapop. A couple of years ago Ponyboy's parents got into a devastating car accident and died instantly. Now Darry the oldest in the family has to take care of Soda and Ponyboy. Ponyboy is in a gang called greasers with some of his friends Johnny, Dallas, Two-Bit, and his brothers. Ponyboy can count on his brothers and on his friends, but not on much else besides trouble with the Socs. The Socs are a vicious gang of rich kids whose idea of a good time is beating up greasers. Ponyboy knows what to expect, until Johnny goes a little out of hand and kills one of the Socs. Now they have to hide out in an abandoned church. Something really bad happens to Johnny and all his friends wish that it never happened.I think that this is a really good book. I like this book because I like to read about gangs and how they live their lives. S.E. Hinton wrote the book so well that you can sometimes feel what is going on in the story and know exactly how the characters are feeling. She describes how people are different and how they are the same. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read books about gangs and getting into fights with people that you barely even know. I would recommend this book to 13-18 year olds because I don't think that people over 18 would want to read a book about kids. I think you if they read this book then you will want to read this book over and over again and you won't want to put the book down."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders Puffin Books 1997, 180 pps., $6.99S.E. Hinton ISBN 0-14-038572-XOne day while Johnny and Ponyboy are in the park a horrible fight starts to brake out, to find out what happens read The Outsiders. The book The Outsiders, by S.E. Hinton, tells the story about two gangs that live on different sides of town, the Eastside and the Westside. The Greasers main members are Ponyboy, Sodapop, Darrel, Dally, and Johnny who are from the eastside. Two kids, Ponyboy and Johnny, murdered one of the Socs, rich kids from the west. Now they need to run away and change what they look like, so the cops do not catch them. Then one day something happened to their hide away. Then just because that happens it takes you to a different side of all the gang members on both sides of town.I would recommend this book to kids that like to read books that have, kids in them and then change because of a dramatic scene in the book. The age range that would be good for this book would be around the teen ages because kids are sometimes in gangs at this age and in the book, Ponyboy and Johnny are 14 and 16 years old.I think that this is a very good book to read about because it tell how two different groups of people have a little bit in common, but just because they react to each other before they know each other then it makes a big deal. I think that the main concept of this book is don't judge people before you know them because they may have a lot in common with you, and you may never know.- Bridget Gaccione"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders written by S.E Hinton is based on a group of struggling kids lifes at the age of fourteen. This story will bring you the adventures and dangers that friends(Ponyboy, Johny,Two-bit, Sodapop, Darry, and Dally)face. The Socs (the upperclass kids at the other side of town) start trouble with them and cause conflicts(fights). The adventures that Ponyboy and the rest of the friends face are incredible as they go through hard times in years that are supposed to be the best times of there lives. This is a strong well told story that everyone should read cause it relates to real life situations.One reason that i liked this book was that it showed me the ups and downs of life and had me thinking ahead every chapter. I did not dislike this book in any way,you cannot dislike a book which goes into great detail with every chapter in it."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Ponyboy Curtis lives in a world where there are only two types of people - those with all the breaks and those who just get broken- the Socs and the Greasers. When Ponyboy finds himself hiding from the police because he and his best friend are wanted for the murder of a member of their rival gang, it is clear to Ponyboy what type of life he can expect. Things seem as bad as they can be. But will Ponyboy be able to come to terms with who he is or will he remain just another Greaser? Find out in The Outsiders. Even though The Outsiders was written in 1967, S.E. Hinton's portrayal of gang life is as poignant today as it was then. Though the dated slang and the trite ending might turn off young readers, Ponyboy's struggle with loyalty and the search for independence are timeless.SynopsisA revealing picture of the tension between loyalty toward friends and family and the struggle for individuality in the life of a young gang member."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"A book about life in a U.S. city told through the eyes of a teenager, Ponyboy, who lives with his two brothers in an environment where two classes - the rich Socs and the poor Greasers - fight, and die."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book, the Outsiders is about this gang called the greasers.

I think it's a very interesting story about life for kids in such situation as Ponyboy and the rest of the gang. My favorite is Dally because his character is just so strong and realistic. The way he acts, his almost madness... how he hides his true feelings... The characterization of him is done very powerfully, i think. Hinton is a great author to me, and i look up to her very much, Myself i write stories in the same area as she does, just that i can't let it be read by someone like a teacher or somethin like that. But i sometimes wish i could publish it cause like Hinton i have so many points about life to tell about to the people, thoughts... that i somehow introduce in the story just like Hinton does. I think i know ihow she fetl when she wrote the story... you probably think i'm dumb or somethin but that's how i feel. I love writting and reading... The Ousiders motivated me to go on, before i didn't want to read anythin nor write, but now i do... I just wish one day the world will be able to read my story, just like Hinton's... Thank you very much for reading, bye"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I read The Outsiders and I thought it was an o.k. book. But it wasn't a book type I would read all the time. If I would have chosen this on my own, I probably would have stopped reading it. It's about gang related things. I don't aprove of smoking and stuff like that and that's basically all the book talks about. That subject came up a lot throughout the book. But other then that I thought it was a well written story. My favorite character was Johnny, because he got beat up at the beginning of the story and he was scared about getting beat up again, And that's how I would react too."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":".

Characters don't create a sense of reality and this book is over all trash. You can make these assumptions without reading this book. It's a waste of time!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Have you ever wondered how it was in the 1940s and 1950s? If you have too then is the book for you. It is called THE OUTSIDERS, by S. E. Hinton. It is about a gang fight between the Socs and Greasers. Johnny, one of the main characters, gets beat up.Then Johnny and Pony boy run away. It tells what happens when they run away and comes back. They were having an argument with each other. To quote a part of the book, &quot;'How come you like fights Darry?' He gave me one of those looks to hide what he's thiking. But Soda piped up: 'He likes to show off his muscles. I'm gonna show'em off on you little buddy if you get any mouthier.'&quot; This shows that Darry is trying to be in charge of raising them as family. Ponyboy was a main character in the story. He was Soda's little brother. He liked movies and like to read. The story takes place in the slums or ghetto of a big town somewhere. The gangs in the slums or ghettos seem to be more violent toward each other than other gangs. I recommend this book to boys or girls over fifth grade and up because it deals with gangs that are more like the ones in high school. That's why I think over fifth graders should read it. I think almost everyone would enjoy this book. There is somewhat of a moral to it. I enjoyed it and I feel the book was very good. Some parts were sad, although most of it was enjoyable. It was a well-rounded book."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders I just finished reading the book, and then I watched the movie. I think the book is more descripitive than the movie. The characters looked like how they were described in the book, but their personalities weren't. I liked how the author discribed the characters. I understood what the characters were like. Dallas was my favorite character because he was the oldest and was always tough. He was different from the others and was the smartest."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book was kinda stale... First of all it wasn't something ANYONE could relate with, the society was totally fake maybe the author was dreaming when he thought up that &quot;society&quot; and there was no real &quot;plot&quot; i think the author tried to get a message across to the readers, but the fact that it was SO OBVIOUS shows a lot about his writing skill... If u want me to pick up something leave it in there for me to think about, dont smash it on my head with a hammer."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Okay, first of all there were no gangs in the book. The greasers were called Greasers because that was their style, in the same way Elvis Presley was a greaser. The &quot;Socs&quot; was just a slang term for the folks on the other side of town and they only stalked and jumped the greasers the same way &quot;jocks&quot; pick on &quot;nerds&quot;. Except for the rumble over the &quot;Soc&quot; Johnny accidentally killed while saving Ponyboy, the struggle was not about gang warfare; it was social classes, between the lower-middle class to poor and the upper-middle class to rich. They may have hung out in groups of friends but that didn't make them street gangs, as we may or may not know them today. No codes, initiations, affiliations, nor obligations to anyone or anything, and anyone could come and go out of their group or circle as they pleased with no worrys of the circle's feeling betrayed. NOW, AS FAR AS THE BOOK IS CONCERNED: it's thoroughly readable, I don't know how many times I've read it myself but I'm sure I'd need more than 8 fingers and 2 thumbs to count them. Off-hand, I don't know anyone personally who hasn't also read it and/or seen the movie (which is almost identical to the book only they cut out just a small handful of vital parts. I.E. Ponyboy temporarily dropping his sensitivity and braininess, to name just one). Anyway, it's a good book and good story for the time it was written. Maybe some of the minute details are a bit outdated (back then switchblades, today machine guns) but it's still a good read. Two thumbs up for S.E. Hinton, who was about sixteen when she wrote this."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"In the novel The Outsiders, S.E. Hinton provides the reader with a warm, realistic and captivating view into the world of a young adolescent boy named Ponyboy Curtis. Ponyboy is forced to meet the normal struggles of a fourteen year old young man while in a disadvantaged situation. Ponyboy's parents' recent death in a car accident leaves him to be raised by his two older brothers, twenty year old Darry and sixteen year old Soda Pop. The older brothers work and maintain a home while Ponyboy attends high school. All of the brothers belong to a gang of friends nicknamed the \\"Greasers\\". The Greasers are considered the lower class members of their community. United with four other close \\"Greaser\\" friends, the brothers must navigate the ups and downs of everyday life while also encountering opposition from their rivals, the Socialites or \\"Socs\\". The continual tension between the Greasers and the Socs culminates in a violent situation that changes the lives of the boys drastically.S.E. Hinton skillfully guides the reader through the story from the perspective of Pony Boy. Hinton's use of a conversational tone and casual language makes one feel as if they are walking with Ponyboy through each and every encounter. His experiences include everything from a temporal trip to the drive - in movie, to the intensity of a street fight or \\"rumble\\" in the park with the opposing street gang. Hinton's descriptive narrative enables the reader to not only picture the story as it unfolds, but it also allows the reader to endure the emotion of the characters. Ponyboy reveals his innermost thoughts regarding his feelings about his friends, his brothers and his status in society. He also divulges his thoughts about girls, revealing his affection for the beautiful Socialite Cherry Valance. Cherry is a young lady with whom Ponyboy has a chance encounter. This situation gives Ponyboy the opportunity to see the Soc's in a different light, thus allowing him to gaze upon the reality that everyone shares the same basic joys and struggles despite their socioeconomic background.While S. E. Hinton's , The Outsider's is an excellent engaging novel a few negative aspects of the book need mention. The story includes description of the young men drinking alcohol, smoking and committing acts of violence and other crimes. Hinton's descriptions of these activities are necessary to the storyline. However, it would need to be reinforced with the young reader that while the illegal and otherwise negative activities described appear intriguing, they are still inappropriate ways to cope with the struggles of day to day life at any age. In addition, Hinton's use of slang, while skillful, may prove confusing for today's reader. The reader would best approach this book with some knowledge of the slang and colloquialisms of the era described (1950's). Overall, The Outsider's is an excellent read and is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"My daughter, who absolutely hates to read, watched the movie and asked for the book.

The gang known as the \\"Greasers\\" are characterized by their long, silky, and greasy hair. This group is the lower class, but yet much smarter than the upper class. The upper class gang is the \\"Socs\\" or Socials. This story shows the life and tensions between these two gangs. After Johnny, a member of the Greasers kills a member of the Socs even greater tensions rise. This leads Johnny and Ponyboy, whom the story revolves around, to hide out and try to stay away from the police. While in hiding something tragic happens to Johnny, leaving an unthinkable fate. As the gangs are furious with the losses, they declare a rumble. After this rumble, a miraculous thing occurs in the story. Something that is so thrilling you will have to read it to find out!I really enjoyed this book, although it seemed to be almost an exact replica of West Side Story. That factor in a way took the fun out of reading parts of it, as you could almost guess what was going to happen next. Though for readers not familiar with West Side Story, this book is a fantastic tale of love, hate, and tension. Though I felt it was repetitive, it was very compelling and kept you turning the pages. It also left you wanting more at the end, though the ending was purely fabulous. I recommend this book to young adults and teens who enjoy enticing stories and stories with many genres. This book is a good purchase, and you will not be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The outsiders is a heroic book about the troubles of growing up as a greaser in town also full of Socs.

Hinton writes with a keen sense of teenage fears, emotions, and alienation from the world of adults. The story concerns the divide between the richer Socs and the lower-income Greasers in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The main character is Ponyboy Curtis, an orphan who is likeable, tough, fearful, and into his Greaser gang. Ponyboy and his peers must deal with a confusing mix of school, friends, the socs, the law, and problems at home. Ponyboy gets jumped by a group of Socs (increasing his coolness), and later finds himself mixed in when his friend Johnny kills a Soc in a confrontation. The two flee, but more trouble follows. This story has nearly all the elements; teenage alienation, machismo, broken homes, alcohol, violence and tragedy.A couple friends and I read this book in 7th grade in the 1970's, and despite our stable, gang-free existence, we identified strongly with Ponyboy and his Greasers. Readers today may develop a similiar identification, although the story seems a bit tame by today's gang realities of drug dealing and violence."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I have no idea why this book resonated so deeply with me. I was not raised in Oklahoma, I was not a teenage boy when I read it. My parents were alive and well and I didn't run with a gang...I liked the Beatles, and didn't care about Elvis, but I identified so much with Ponyboy that it might have been me telling the story. I've read this book at least a dozen times, and enjoyed it just as much each time as I did the first time. Maybe it's because this book taps into the angst of our teenage years. Even if you aren't in a gang, aren't a greaser or a soc, most teenagers go through a period where they feel like they just don't belong. Like they are on the outside looking in. Like they are different from the crowd. I think the book appeals to the masses for that reason alone. Although Ponyboy is unique, he's sensitive, he's smart, he is acutely aware of his differences...he is still the 'everyteen', easy to relate to.

He has two other brothers and he is part of a gang who are all Greasers and don't have much money. They are rivals with the Socs who are the rich kids in town. The Socs are always jumping and beating up the Greasers and making fun of them. There are used to being the scum of the city when something big happens and changes the whole way people look at them.This novel has a plot that kicks off the whole book from the beginning. The climax changes the whole story around right when it's about to bore you. The conflict the novel illuminates makes you want to get right in there and join the rumble and help the characters. The setting in the novel brings you right there with its resourceful descriptions and scenery. The author has such good voice and she makes you feel like you're right there beside her. She plants you right in the plot and gets you excited.Some of the bad aspects of this book are that it has foul language. They say a lot cuss words and foul language in many parts. This book also has a ton of gang related aspects. This shows the conflict between the richer and poorer gangs in the area. There is violence galore in this novel. There are rumbles, pushes, slaps and more, all in this violence-filled book. Fire guns and broken bottles take up a large part of this novel.I would recommend this book for teens and up. The profanity in this novel is a limitation that may not be appropriate to children under thirteen.If you keep yourself on the inside, you should try a book from the outside!Review #2The book The Outsiders is a great book. It is one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read. This takes place in the 1950s. This book is about greasers and Socs. This book is mainly about a guy named Ponyboy and the day by day struggles he goes through. Ponyboy lives with his brother Darry and Sodapop. They all are greasers. Ponyboy narrates the story and he tells it from his prospective. Some of the good things are the setting. For example, if you read the book, you will see how detailed Hinton makes the plot when they are talking about the story's events. Also it shows a lot of mood because one second it is happy, then next second could be sad. Ponyboy doesn't like to fight because he wants to make peace but his brothers are the opposite. Some of the bad things in this novel are violence in a knifing; also they call cigarettes \\"cancer sticks.\\" Also there is domestic violence among the brothers. All of these things are inappropriate for little kids. More mature readers could handle this. I think that anyone that can handle people getting killed and little kids doing inappropriate stuff can handle this. Don't be an outsider, be a insider by reading the book.Review #3The Outsiders, a novel by S.E. Hinton, involves a Greaser by the name of Ponyboy. In this novel Ponyboy and his two brothers Darry and Soda-pop have lost their parents in a car accident. He is living with Darry, his brother, as a guest. There is this other gang in this novel called the Socials or \\"The Socs,\\" and the greasers are rivals with their gang. In the beginning of this novel Ponyboy was walking back from the movies when Ponyboy was alone, \\"The Socs\\" started to threaten him by saying they would kill him and cut off all his hair. They held up a switchblade to his neck, but then his friends saw him over there and they saved him.In this novel there are some of what I think is graphic content and that's one of the reasons I think this book is \\"Bad\\". In this novel there are a lot of knives and fighting which could be not so good for younger kids to learn from. Towards the end of this book, Darry, one of the characters, was killed. I consider the content pretty graphic to kids under the age of eleven because of the violence and gang related theme.I think this book has been banned because kids could think it's ok to get in fights and smoke. A younger kid could think it's ok to bring a switchblade around and get in a knife fight when life isn't like a novel. If you're a parent, I wouldn't let this kid read this until you consider him/her mature.This novel isn't all bad. This novel is told from the main character's point of view throughout the novel which I consider pretty cool. The novel's gang situations could teach younger kids not to get in fights. This book isn't all bad. This book has some great learning lessons like watching out for messing with the wrong people. \\"They grew up on the outside of society. They weren't looking for a fight. They were looking to belong.\\"Review #4If you love action books, then The Outsiders, by S.E. Hinton is for you. This book is action-packed with both conflict and compassion. I know that I loved this book. So, if you can't decide if you want to read it then I would suggest that you do because I know you will like it. Out of 5 stars I would give it a 4 . The reason it is not a 5 is because it might encourage a younger reader to do some bad things.The main character, Ponyboy, thinks that there are two types of people, the Greasers and the Soc (socials). He is a Greaser and is proud to be one. The Greasers are rough and aren't scared of anything. While the Soc gets everything they want, from cars to a good education. Pony has had some fights and rumbles before but what happens to him in this book is life changing. He will give up everything to save his friend from jail.We also learn about the rich side of town where the Soc live in comfort and safety and the regular side of town where the Greaser live not knowing if they will live another day without safety.Some good things about this book are the focus on camaraderie, characters, and setting. The camaraderie is carried throughout the book and in the end shows that it does not matter if you are a Greaser or a Soc, you all have to stick together and help each other, especially your friends.The best characters, I would say, are Dally and Soda Pop. Dally is good because he can be compassionate for one second and turn on you in another, much like a typical teenager. He shows great bravery and wits, which makes him the ideal Greaser. Soda Pop is Ponyboy's older brother. He works most of the time because he dropped out of school to earn money for the family since their parents died. Soda Pop is also very protective of his younger brother, Ponyboy.The story takes place in a classic mid-west town in Oklahoma in the late 1950's. The author's descriptions of the surroundings, especially the sunsets, with all the colors you can imagine, are exhilarating. The rich side of town is described as clean and nice, while the regular side of town is described as more dirty and run down. The book goes into great details about the setting, which paints a picture in your mind. It is these aspects of the book that make this book a thoughtful and well-written book.I would recommend this book to 6th grade and up because it has violence and questionable behavior that might not be appropriate for younger children.

In the book it had lots of surprises and a good ending. The book ties together at the end. You should read this book!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"In the book the Outsiders it is slow in the begging but then it starts to get faster in the middle. The Novel outsiders is about two different types of kids. The kids are part of a gang. The two names of the gangs are Soc's and the Greasers. The Soc's are the rich boys and they smoke and drink. The Greasers wear there hair back. They also smoke and drink. The greasers are the poor. The two gangs are always fighting and arguing.The Characters in this book were very different and they hade there one way of do things. One of the main characters is Johnny. Johnny's best friend is Pony boy. Johnny and pony came home late one night and Johnny's parents didn't even know that he was gone and him and pony fell asleep at one of the places that they hang out. Pony Boy is another one of the main characters. Him and Johnny always are getting picked on by the Soc's. One of the times after a movie when the Soc's were drunk the were picking on pony boy and Johnny was going to help him but he went a little to far. He killed a Soc's named bob. Pony boy and Johnny ran away to a different city. Derry Was Pony boys brother and he took care of him. He was mean to Pony in the begging but then he starts to be nice to him when the book starts to be exiting. Dally was another was a friend and he gave Johnny and Pony the gun and told them were to go. Cherry was a Soc's but she was a nice one and Pony liked her. Dally was very mean to her because she didn't like them.This book was kind of slow in the beginning but then it got cool in the middle. This book was mainly about Johnny and Pony running away and living in the church and then when it is time for them to come bake the Dally comes to get them. When Dally gets them and they go back to the church to get there stuff the church is on fire and Johnny And Pony go to help little kids in the fire. They get all of the kids back but Johnny doesn't get out. Johnny and Pony have to go to the hospital but Pony gets out pretty fast but Johnny doesn't get out and he ends up dieing in the hospital. The Soc's and the Greasers have a big rumble at the end and the Soc's run away after the get beat by the Greasers."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The book was more realaistic than other's books and how some people can relate to it.

This book could be the best book ever written and you dont even know it. I love this book. I think it represents how are school is with the sk8erz and the preps. (I am a sk8er). The author of this book rules and doserves some kind of special award or something. I recomend this book for people who dont like to read, because after this book they will want to read it over and over again. S.E.

Most books I read I don't like, but this book was very good. The Outsiders is a book about a bunch of gangs who beat up on each other. The two main gangs are the Greasers and the Socs. The Greasers are the poorer kids who grease their hair and talk trash. The other group is the Socs \\"Social\\". They are the rich kids who jump the greasers. The book has a lot of friendship and loyalty in the gangs. If you like adventure and suspense then you would like The Outsiders."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is one of my all-time favorite books. I first read it 5 years ago, and I have re-read it so many times since then. I just got finished reading it again, and I felt the urge to go out and tell the world. It is a book that no one should miss.The story is about Ponyboy Curtis, who lives with his two brothers, Darry and Sodapop, because his parents died. This little family is also part of a gang, with people that are classified as greasers. They are poor and are not liked by the public. On the other side of town, are the rich kids, the Socs. These two groups war against each other all the time, jump each other. It is a rough life. One day, a Soc goes too far, and Ponyboy and another member of his gang, Johnny, find themselves in a world of trouble. From here the book takes flight in a fast-paced and convincing style. Ponyboy conquers all that he goes up against, in one way or another. I recommend this book to any reader, no matter how old you are!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I have been working as a substitute teacher, and one of the perks is to find out the books that are being used in schools. This one and S.E.Hinton's book RUMBLE FISH are being used in the district where I do a lot of my work. There's a reason. They're excellent quality. This book was published three years after I graduated from high school. Where I graduated, we didn't have the terms \\"soc\\" (pronounced sosh, long O)and \\"greaser,\\" but I identified the two groups immediately. If there was any \\"rumbling\\" going on between the two of the groups in our school, I didn't know about it. But I know from painful personal experience what it is liked to be picked on by the \\"cool crowd.\\" And after I graduated I learned that when it came to the \\"cool crowd,\\" not all was gold that glittered. Those young people had a lot of genuine problems to deal with, too.This author knows how to paint personality types and make a believable story. Even though I have long since ceased to be a \\"young adult,\\" I lapped up this story as if I had just dropped back into junior and senior high school There's action, suspense, humor -- and be warned -- lots of tears. Ms. Hinton paints us a believable story of young boys who are trying to make their way with little guidance from their families and not much else but their mutual caring for one another to support them. The story moves quickly and will keep you on the edge of your seat.The ending is one of personal triumph, the very best kind to have.So -- even if you're a kid my age (considerably over 21 years old) try reading the book! You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"My students really enjoyed this reading of the book. I've never seen them so quiet."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Book Reviewed by:Scott N.S.E. Hinton's book, The Outsiders, really caught my attention. Basically, it's about a young protagonist, Ponyboy, and the rest of his friends. This gang of friends is called the \\"Greasers.\\" Soon, a problem escalates between the \\"Greasers\\" and the \\"Socs,\\" the opposite social group. After the death of one of the \\"Socs,\\" things turn to chaos. Ponyboy and his friend, Johnny, show their heroic personalities after saving a few kids from a burning church. Unfortunately, Johnny gets seriously wounded in the fire. Suddenly, Ponyboy is faced with a couple of questions. Will Johnny die? Will they go to jail for killing that Soc?After reading this book once, I would definitely read it again. Because it was written in the 1960's, it will catch the eyes of any historical fiction lover. The use of alcohol, drugs, violence, and profanity makes the book unsuitable for anyone under the age of thirteen. I'm sure that both males and females will like this book, too. Overall S.E. Hinton wrote an awesome, action-packed book."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"A book review by D. WilliamsThis book is of course by S.E. Hinton that she wrote when she was only 16, deals with many emotional conflicts of teens or young adults, especially with a character from the book named Pony Boy. Parentless, he and his two older brothers, Darry and Soda Pop, must survive the brutality of city living with the Socs, the bullies from the wealthy. Pony Boy believes that there are only two kinds of people, Greasers (Pony, Dally, and Soda Pop) and Socs.Of course Pony, Dally, and Soda can't hold off the rich uptight gang. That's they have friends like Two-Bit, Dally, and Johnny, which are also greasers. Pony and Johnny then find themselves in a sticky, one-way situation. I don't read much, but this is a great book and reentered me into the wonderful world of reading."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"My 8th grade students were put off by the extreme country-bumpkin accent in this audio recording. They didn't feel the accent truly matched the characters. The narrator read too slowly for them as well.

The book was impossible to put down and it even made me cry a little at times, but thats what a good book will do to you. I recommend this for teens because it has some violence and other things you may expect to find in a book about fights between gangs. This is a wonderful story of friendship and tragedy."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"\\"The outsiders\\" is a great book about loyalty and friendship. Ponyboy is the youngest of his brothers and the youngest in his gang. The other characters are Two bit, Sodapop, Dally, Steve, and Johnny. Their rivals the Socs fight the Greasers just for fun. Ponyboy has never gotten bothered until the night Ponyboy walks home alone and gets jumped. This creates tensions for the two rival gangs. But somebody in one of the gangs takes it to far. And they are forced to leave town and hide out from the police. After this only two things that the two gangs want to do is fight. This book is equipped with a very dramatic ending. This book is worth reading if you like action and drama in your books."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Great classic masterpiece! A \\"must read\\"! I still can't believe this was written by a sixteen year old!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton is an inspirational story of the lives of low society.

Ponyboy and his friends/family are all known as the greasers, while there southside rivals are known as the socs. Life is hard and dangerous were Ponyboy lives and gets to be preety frustrating. One night Ponyboy and his friend Jhonny get into some real trouble with socs and have to flee town or go to jail. Both Ponyboy and Jhonny face hard decitions and have life changing expieriences. I think this book is very moving in a way in which makes you feel good of the things you can do for others. I think that this book is ment for any person who has a little time to put their heart into something.

What Ponyboy does not know is that he will get into a suspenseful situation that will put his and his friends lives in danger as well as keeping his family together.The Outsiders is a one of a kind book that all ages can enjoy. I have read this book a while ago and was my favorite book and is still my favorite piece of literature. I believe the reason for my liking of the book is that it is action packed and full of suspense. Once you pick up The Outsiders you will not be able to put it down, for you will want to find out what happens next. One quote from the book that will make you eager to keep reading is on page 75. \\"We could take whatever was coming now\\".

The \\"Greasers\\" are the have-nots in the story. They belong to gangs who don't always see eye-to-eye, but don't let the \\"Socs\\" cross one of them. The \\"Socs\\" (pronounced So-chez) are the kids who seem to have it all. The story comes together when a couple of the \\"Greasers\\" get to know some \\"Socs\\" and discover that things aren't always as they appear on the surface."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Stamped as Greasers, or better known as social outcasts to the Scos, the main character, Pony, is the youngest member of a gang of Greasers that consist of his two older brothers and their childhood friends. Fighting and being considered 'tuff' are the main worries of the Greasers while the Soc's don't have much to worry about, except to give the Greasers a hard time whether that means physical or verbal abuse. Ponyboy on the other hand has an education on his hands and seems to think more than a lot of the other boys. When the life of a Soc is taken by a Greaser all hell breaks loose as the two social groups decide to fight each other. Who will win and get the bragging rights? The story itself is one of self discovery in many of the characters, but mainly in Ponyboy who learns that sometimes, social stereotypes don't always brand a person correctly.I really liked this book first off because I thought Hinton truly capture the mind of a fourteen year old. Unsure of why adults do certain things and always making decisions without thinking are exactly the characterize a fourteen year old boy. The storyline itself was fast pace and was constantly on the move, which I also enjoyed. The brotherly bond between Ponyboy and his older brothers is evident as they are constantly on the lookout for him and joking around in the way that family does. Without their parents, it's surprising to find that they are a strong family unit and incorporate that with all their childhood friends. I could remember reading the outsiders when I was younger but reading it now is a completely different experience as I understand how their bond with one another and uprising affected their decisions throughout the novel. All in all, I really did enjoy the book the second time around, probably more than the first."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I just finished teaching this book to my 7th grade Language Arts Class.

Her effective style she and symbols used throughout the book our very well defined. The most important facts in determining whether or not a work is effective in through the author's style. Another literary technique known as symbol also adds to the overall value of the novel. In Hinton's novel she overall uses excellent literary devices throughout the whole novel. Hinton's use of the first person narrative throughout the novel adds to the effectiveness of the story. By telling the story through the character of Ponboy, Hinton can make her story sound more believable, while at the same time illicid great emotion from the reader. If the novel had not been written in first person, it would not be such a compelling story. Hinton uses many symbols throughout her novel. The most significant symbol is her use of the diffrent gangs. The &quot;greasers&quot; are the lower economic class and struggle on as peoples whose lives are on the outside. The &quot;socs&quot; represent the wealthy upperclass who are hated by the &quot;greasers.&quot; The two diffrent gangs symbolize two totally diffrent groups in the world. Another symbol frequently used is the adolescents always drinking,smoking,and breaking into the movie theatre just to defy society. In conclusion Hinton uses a variety of ways to represent the teenage society of the 60's and of the present. Society in teenagers has not changed from the time she wrote this novel. Adolescents are still doing things to rebel, or things that make them feel good about themselves. She is a very good author who uses her sense of writting to show how society really is, and how people really act. I am not saying that every teenager does these types of things, but what she is talking about takes place in most every town in America."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This was an all around good book.

Hinton, is a work of contemporary realistic fiction and is on the extreme edge of appropriateness for readers aged 7 to 12 years old.The plot of the book centers on the conflict between two groups of youths, the \\"Greasers\\" and the \\"Socs,\\" and is progressive in structure. \\"Ponyboy\\" is the main character and narrator of the story. He tells the story from a first-person point of view. He is fourteen years old and his parents are dead. His best friend is \\"Johnny.\\" The secondary characters include the various members of the gangs, several girls, and other characters used to develop the plot and characterizations. During a gang fight between the two main groups, Johnny kills a rival gang member to save Ponyboy's life. The murder, the circumstances surrounding the murder, and the responses of the characters to the murder, make up the plot of the story.The narrative of The Outsiders is presented primarily in chronological order, with significant events occurring as time passes. Several conflicts are presented in the book. Character versus character conflict is evident from the antagonism between the two groups (Greasers and Socs). Character versus society conflict is evident from the characters' experiences with class warfare, prejudice, family dynamics, child abuse, and inequitable treatment. Character versus self conflict is also developed as Ponyboy struggles with internal tension regarding decisions about doing the \\"right\\" thing after the murder. He also struggles with the realization that both groups have much in common, although they appear different on the surface. Furthermore, he struggles to maintain a tough exterior to cover his genuinely sensitive personality (he likes to read).I found S.E. Hinton's story of disenchanted youth and class conflict a surprisingly engaging and insightful book, and deserving of its many awards. I did not expect to enjoy it. Although it was written in the 1960's, its themes remain universal and contemporary. Today's young readers will connect with the story's characters, especially those readers who have experienced similar challenges.I would recommend this book to anyone trying to meet the needs of young readers."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"One of the things I love about this book is that S.E. Hinton wrote a simple, short book, but managed to make it great. I have read A Clockwork Orange and Slaughterhouse-five and am currently reading The Catcher in the Rye and Breakfast of Champrons, my point being that I really enjoyed/am enjoying these but can still appreciate The Outsiders for the great book it is. The story is told in first person by Ponyboy Curtis, a greaser growing up in the 1960's Midwest. He looks up to his brother Sodapop, feels rejected and unloved by his brother Darry and doesn't know what to think about the Socs, the rich kids in town who despise greasers.One night at the movies, Pony and his best friend Johnny meet two soc girls who aren't like any Socs they have ever met, they don't care that Pony and Johnny are poor, they just like them for who they are, something the two greasers had never thought a soc was capable of. However later that night Ponyboy and Johnny are attacked by the girl's boyfriends, one of whom is killed in self-defense by Johnny. Pony and Johnny then leave town to avoid punishment. After a tragic turn for the worst things eventually come down to a rumble beetween the greasers and socs, and the eventual breakdown of the gang's wildcard: Dally. The greasers are mearly looking for exceptance though they are labeled by almost everyone as the bad guys. The Outsiders is a magnificent book that shows the foolishness of sterotyping and follows a fourteen year old on a journey through the hardest part of his life."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I think this book was the best book I have read about teens and gangs.This is a good lecture were teens can read and think more about geting involved with gangs.It teachs you more about why teens get involve in gangs because they need love and they go and get it with his gang members.This story is about gangs and the love they have for each other they soppport every member of their gang on everything they do everybody follows along."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I first read the Outsiders when I was in the sixth grade. Back then I hated to read and thought books were stupid and pointless like many kids do. That all changed when I read The Outsiders.I never thought that I was actually going to like the book. The kid's name was Ponyboy for god's sake, but I did, and I have loved it ever sense.So don't be afraid, pick up this book. I have never read anything that has hit me so hard and has changed the way that I view people. I still read the book every so often becuase it was just such a great acheivment for it's time period, not to mention it was written in a way that I understood and could relate to.The charaters in this book made me feel that I knew them personaly. I wouldn't be so suprised to see one of them at the mall sometime or at McDonald's; they became that real.As I said before, don't overlook this classic tale of friendship and belonging becuase of the time period or the seemingly strage names. It still relates to kids today. Trust me, if a book has been around for almost 40 years, has won numerous awards and had a movie based after it, it's going to be a good read. So, take the chace, read this book and maybe you will enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I read this book as a school assignment with an ambition to read it in three days.

Very detailed with decent characters, this is a really, really, good book."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"S.E. Hinton's novel of class conflict, choice and determination, set in 1950s Oklahoma, creates empathy for characters that live on the periphery of society. Hinton's protagonist, Pony boy, along with his fellow \\"gang\\" members, including Two-bit, Dally, Darry and Johnny, are \\"greasers\\". Outwardly, they are an unsavory lot. They wear their hair long and greasy, wear jeans, t-shirts and, if they can eat chocolate cake and soda for breakfast, live in unfashionable homes in poor neighborhoods and are generally doomed to poor-paying blue-colored jobs. They do little to endure themselves to those who are not of their group. For instance, at the drive-in movie, they \\"introduce\\" themselves to some girls through uncouth behavior.The average greaser's nemesis is the \\"soc\\". The soc comes from a privileges background, wears fashionable clothing and often enjoys his or her parents' indulgence.Hinton, through a series of plot elements, presents the greasers as the misunderstood heroes of the book. For instance, Johnny, the least aggressive of the greasers, kills a soc. However, the killing is clearly presents as a case of self-defense. Further, we understand that Johnny had previously been savagely beaten by the very same soc who, on this occasion, without question, had intended to kill Johnny. Johnny later suffers fatal wounds when he rescues a group of children from a burning church- the same building in which he and Pony boy had been hiding out subsequent to the killing of Bob.The toughest greaser also is portrayed sympathetically. Even when Dally ends up being shot by the police after he attempted armed robbery, Dally seems more a tragic than a threatening figure. Pony boy reveals that Dally's gun did not hold and bullets; Dally desperate act is attributed to his inability to cope with Johnny's death.Throughout the book, the greasers are portrayed as loyal and misunderstood, imbued with an anger and despair that has been etched upon their psyches through years of abuse and neglect.Despite this, Johnny and Pony boy are able to maintain a grasp upon their humanity. Johnny pays with his life. Pony boy's fate is more promising. His nervous collapse at the end of the novel galvanizes the resolve of the rest of the greasers. They vow to break the cycle wherein their fate seems pre-determined if not for their own sake, then for Pony boy's. \\"Don't get tough,\\" Two-Bit urges Pony, \\"You're not like the rest of us and don't try to be (Hinton 1989, p. 152).&qout; Soda reminds him, \\"I you don't have anything, you end up like Dallas... and I don't mean dead, eather (Hinton 1989, p. 152).\\"Where Hinton's vision lacks courage is in her portrayal of the greasers as societal victims who lack genuine flaws. Certainly the greasers keep irregular hours, watch too much television, smoke and have poor diets, but they do not have serious faults. Any faults can be readily attributes to their circumstances and to the inequitable political and social systems that subjugate them. Hinton's novel would have been more of an achievement had she been able to generate empathy for the members of an underclass who are not simply \\"noble savages\\". It is easy to accept the romantic portrayal of a marginalized class of people; it is difficult to accept a cold, accurate rendering of the same group, especially when the group's attitudes, values and behaviors are profoundly different from those of the reader.Still, Hinton's work, while it is often sentimental, is also also sensitive and even poetic. We can hear Hinton herself speaking through Pony boy when he laments, \\"I could picture hundreds and hundreds of boys living on the wrong sides of cities, boys with blink eyes who jump at their own shadows. Hundreds of boys who maybe watch sunsets and looked at stars and ached for something better (Hinton 1989, P. 155)."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders was an excellent book! It's touching story is inspiring and riviting. It shows that there is always a ray of hope in any situation that a young person(or anyone in this case)can face in the harsh world of reality. It explains how words can either touch or hurt any person, no matter what race, religion, or social statis. The Outsiders is extremely moving with it's tale of brother hood and togetherness. Therefore I rate this story by S.E. Hinton with five stars for it's remarkable story of friendship."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I've seen both great praise and great criticism for this book, and I'd like to add...I first encountered this book in 8th grade English class. I didn't know if I'd like it at first, but by the end of the year, I had read it three times. The writing is superb. You feel like you are right there with Ponyboy. There is a sense of understanding that you can gain from this book that is very real. Some may say the situations are inappropriate for children; I don't believe they are teaching violence, but rather how important friendship is and that it is possible to make good out of a bad situation. If violence is a large concern for you, you may desire to stay away from this book. Personally, I will never forget this book; the characters are practically part of my life now. If you haven't read this one yet, what are you waiting for?????"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is a fun,exciting book it keeps you on tour toes the whole time.There are gang fights between the &quot;greasers&quot; and the &quot;socs&quot;.The youngest member kills somebody and the oldest one gets killed.The book is about friendship and how so many people judge others.It's a great book you should read it sometime."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The outsiders is a good book. It isn't the best that I ever read, but is a book that have a deep message about social differences. The problem that Ponyboy have, is really difficult; his strong frienship strings to Jhonny, shows how important is to have a friend. I really recomend you to read this book because it will give you a reflection about the differences on the social classes, and how importan is the tolerance"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This story is so touching and spirited. It shows you what trust and loyalty truely means. I cried and laughed while reading this book and you will too. I feel in love with this book and you can just as easily. Imagine you, with two older brothers and your 'gang' friends. No mom, no dad. Just imagine, how would you get along? How would you suvive? How would you avoid the cops? Read this book to find out."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"OMG! The Outsiders is such a good book! I cried when it was over! When I first got the book in my LA class I thought it would just be another boreing book that we have to read in language arts class! But the whold class liked it! My best friend fell in love with Sodapop Dally! (I know, strange!) But if your looking for a good book to read I suggest this ine!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I really like The Outsiders, it was a very touching story, and the only reason I didn't give it five stars is because some parts in the book are reptitive.This book really demonstrates friendship. Even the Curtis boys are more friends than they are brothers. Also, each friend has a special place or has a certain something in the group. Not one character doesn't show friendship in one form or another.I would definetely recommend this book. It is a very passionate book. This is a classic to add to anyone's library of books.A Student at Secrist Middle School, 1st period Language Arts"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Have you ever wondered what it would fell like walking down a dark ally, worrying about getting jumped and cut up? In the book, The Outsiders, by S.E. Hinton, you can see exactly what that would feel like.In the Outsiders Pony Boy and Johnny are in a bad gang, But, they also do good things. For example, one time they rescued little kids from a burning church. The church was on fire because they left a burning cigarette in it. This book is also about people getting jumped and gang rumbles. When you read this book, you learn about life in a gang where some of the rules are, don't go on an other gangs block, never walk alone at night if you're in a gang, and always carry a switchblade.This is my favorite book! I would recommend this book to 5th graders through adults. I would also recommend this book to people who like books about gangs. This book talks about drugs and drinking so little kids shouldn't read it."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"\\"Stay gold, Ponyboy.\\" These were Johnny's last words. The Outsiders, by S.E. Hinton, is a great novel for young readers. Ponyboy is a 14 year old that has to deal with the death of his parents and the war between the Socs and Greasers. Long time enemies find that they really aren't so different and things are \\"rough all over\\". When the unthinkable happens, Ponyboy learns that family matters and the hood is like one big family that sticks together no matter what. His long time friend Johnny dies after all, and Ponyboy learns that the only way to be is to be yourself, and you will always be gold like when you were a kid."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"If you want a sad, funny, tough, and adventurous book, you should read &quot;The Outsiders&quot;. It is about some boys who are hoodlums, and had bad reputations. As you read this book you will probably cry, and laugh, while discovering what they did, and what they went through. Discover a whole new world of life from this book. This is the best book that I have ever read in my life.

I liked everyone in the story because there all cool and serious when they want to be I can't say I dident like anyone of them I liked them all!...

The story sounds so real that Ithought I was in it. It seemed so real, like it was based on a truestory. The characters have verey funny names like Pony Boy and theauthor detailed them so good I could imagen them in my head what theylooked like. On a scale from 1-10 I give it a 10 which is very good.

I enjoyed thes book because there are thengs that deal about real life in a poor or just above poor point of view. My favorite charcter was Johnny because he was not only brave but was sincere to others. My least favorite charater is mostly Bob because he beat up people and didn't care if they got hurt. I think the book is like real life, like I said before it has a mainly poor point of view."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I loved the book! It was a great book. She wrote so great, and it's ashame that Johnny had to go, and my heart was torn up. But yet, it made understand what some people really have to go through. Great Book! If your looking for an excellent book, you found it!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is an excellent book full of acyion, excitement, suspense, and friendship. One of the likeable aspects of the book is that the characters are &quot;down to earth&quot; and they are not perfect. This makes the reader feel comfortable. There are several things to be learned from reading The Outsiders, one is that one should learn to understand, accept, and be kind to your enemies. Also, everyone is human and everyone has their faults"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is a superb book. The part where Johnny and Ponyboy engage in sexual intercourse was great. I love this book. It made me moist all over. And when they all die after a huge orgy is great. Dont worry, its plenty descriptive.

I even ate while i read it! I loved this book and I think a lot of people would too."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Im a sevinth grader and I just got done with reading the outsiders. That is my favorite book yet. And the movie. I liked the mavie too. I am glade i read this book. It teaches me to be good. And not to smoke. I would not smoke if my life depended on it. I was wonkering if you could right me back."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The book The Outsiders, I thought it was a great book for teens. It explains what some teens life is like in school or out. There is always a popular or social group that thinks there so great, and this book tells how other people really feel about that. Peronally I liked the book The Outsiders better then the movie, but don't get me wrong the movie was also good. My favorite characters in the book were Dally because he's wild and cool and Darry because he's strong and sounds cute. Well that about raps it up for The Outsiders, if you have not yet read it you really should."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I likeed the book alot i think that you are very cretive athor and should keep on working on making more books about young adults today and how that time eriod has changed. Something that I really didnt like was all of the bad things that went on. My favorite charactors were Soda-Pop and Cherry Valance.I liked those actors because they move I thought that the movie was much,much better than the book. I think that this book is like Dead Warning because it kind of is about the same topic about teens that are doing bad things. I would recommend this book to any one who likes books about teens."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I like the book it is a good book for kids ages 10 to adlt because it is about teenagers and what happends in there lifes. My favoret carachter is poney boy because he is not like the other guys the other guys likes to fight and go to rumbles and poney boy likes to wach movies and watch sunsets and read books. I also seen the movie and i liked them both they both were ood the movie was almost daying the same things as the book. I never waned to stop reading it and I always wanted to know what happend next!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I loved this book. It was interesting, intriguing, and suspenful. It has a great moral that many people should take to heart and if they did the world would be a much better place. You will fall in love, as I have, with Soda, Ponyboy, Johnny, and many more. The book has one part when you can kind of tell that it was written by a 16 year old pupil (and it was when it was written) because the story kind of penetrated the set stage and was somewhat hrad to follow. It is a really great book, and I recommend to everyone, especially people who do not have a high self-esteem. I need to shut up now so that I don't give anything away, but this book will always stay gold."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I loved this book so much! You can really tell the difference between then and now. It really makes you think that there really are people (kids) out there going through all this drama."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This is a classic tale of the &quot;preps&quot;, as we call them now, and the not-so-popular kids. Even today, there are the rich kids, who wear nice clothes and have nice friends and family, and then there's the poor kids, who have less than their share. To me, Ponyboy doesn't seem rough and ready to fight, he's just trying to protect his fellow Greasers. It's amazing how they stick up for each other like that. Most &quot;friends&quot;, as they call themselves, don't have enough guts to stick up for their friends nowadays. It takes true courage to be a Greaser like Ponyboy and Johnny. Pony's willing to help Johnny even though he didn't do anything to kill that soc. That, to me, is a true friendship. This is an amazing book and all readers, old and young, can learn a lesson from it."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I was assigned this book for the summer. At first I thought it would be boring to read during the summer, but as soon as I started to read it I cuoldn't put it down. When I finished this book I imediately got another book written by S.E.Hinton.(That Was,Then This Is Now- also excellent)This story was breathtaking because of the way it was written.It was so real you had to stop and say &quot;Hey this could happen&quot;. I felt like I was a part of the story. My faviote character was Ponyboy because he was so excing to read about.You never knew what was gonig to happen to him or anyone else. The book kept you on the edge of your seat to the very last word. I highly recommended it."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"For a book report, I did the book The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton for my 7th grade class. This book was full of excitement. I felt like I was in the book. I liked the part when they saved the kids from a burning building. I would recommend this book for anyone who likes adventure and excitement. I really enjoyed reading this book, The Outsiders. I never wanted to put it down."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I didn't know what this book was about, but my class is reading it. It is the best book I have ever read!

They fought these Rocafella type monry making wannabes to survive. I give Johnny props for killing the Soc."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book was the best ever. I personally liked Ponyboy, because I think that we have a lot in common. We both observe what is going on around us and then jugde. If you notice he was at the end of the book who really cared and because he observed, wrote about the past week in a report for his English class."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I loved this book, as soon as i layed my eyes on the name of the book.

You should read this book because when you read it, your nose never gets out of the book. I like to read books about kids and that is why I think I liked it so much! You should really READ it."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I thought the book the Outsiders was a great book for young teens who have a love for reading. There are some books that you get bored with reading very fast, but I found that with this book I was never bored and found it hard to put it down. In this book people are labled as being &quot;greasers&quot; or &quot;socs&quot;. The &quot;greasers&quot; are low class and don't have very much. The &quot;socs&quot; are more high class and rich. I think reading this book is a good idea because it shows the pressures of peers and how it hurts to be labled."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"It was about two groups. The Socs. that were rich, and the Greasers who were on the wrong side of town. It was full of feuds, friendships, learning, loses, and gains.

Great for guys OR girls!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"i love this book sooooo much. i've read it six times. it's a great story with characters you can relate to. i feels like your living the story with them.

I will soon finish it now however!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I was amazed by how many reviews this book was given. I had to read it in high school and I loved it! It shows that youcan't judge a book by its cover and you can't judge a character strictly from the outside (no pun intended!).The &quot;greasers&quot; and the &quot;socs&quot; are both just normal people, as the reader will soon find out. It's just that the &quot;greasers&quot; have less money and are judged as inferior by the &quot;socs&quot;."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This is the best book any one could ever read.I have read this book 6 times and the movie 10 times.I like this book because it seems so real.

I think this book is a little out of our time, being that it was written in the 1950's, but there is, and supposedly will always be two enemies that are a lot diffrent outside, a little diffrent on the inside, but you'd be suprised at how much they have in common."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This is one of the best books i've ever read. It's a quick read that keeps you to the end. The way the characters are displayed makes you feel like you are in the book with them going through rumbles, movie theaters, running from the fuzz (cops), and being jumped by the Socs.

Ponyboy and Dallas Winston are two characters who became real in my mind.

If you, a child, or student haven't read the book yet, have them give it a try and see what you or they think."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"S.E. Hinton has probably authored the book that influenced my life the most. The Outsiders is incredibly well written. The division between the greasers and the socs is relatable to high school students, which is no surprise considering Hinton was so young when she wrote the book. Ponyboy is so honest throughout the whole book. He just pours himself out to the reader, and makes him or her empathize with all of the tormenting that the greasers are put through. I read this book for the first time in 7th grade, and it was the perfect young adult book to read as a transition from children's novels to more teenage appropriate reading."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I had to read this book for la. I am a seventh grade boy and I absolutely loved this book it got really sad at times but overall was an amazing books."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This is a great book about a group of mischievous teens and adults that find themselves in all sorts of trouble. The main character in this book, Ponyboy Curtis, is the youngest member of these greasers. All though he is the youngest, he turns out to be the bravest out of all of them. The gang has had a misunderstanding with another group called the \\"Socs\\" (short for \\"socials\\"). This book is filled with gang fights, runaways, and romance. A great read if you're looking for a classic."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book is incredible! It is amazing. It captivates the reader and keeps them interested. It is full of adventure, friendship, and hardship. A real masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"&quot;The Outsiders,&quot; written by S.E. Hinton, is a compelling and heartwarming story between two friends, who are both in trouble for murdering a member of their rivals, The Socs. These two boys are both Greasers, a group of boys who are thought to be a group of bad boys, but they are all about friendship, unity, and bonds. During the time they ran away from the situation, they stay at an abandoned church and form that bond, that friendship, and unity. I recommend you read this book because the things these boys go through and how S.E. Hinton wrote the story will touch your heart. It's a book you will never want to put down, trust me I know."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I loved The Outsiders,by SE Hinton. I gave it 4 stars, but not 5 because it doesn't quite reach that bar to be a 5 star book-but it still is very good. I'm an avid reader, and of all of the books we were requiered to read back in Middle School; the Outsiders was my favorite. I know I'm probably in the minority, but I would personally like to see more scenes of the Curtis brothers interacting. I'm pretty sure that SE Hinton has no desire to write a sequel, but I personally wished she would. I also wish we got to learn a little more about Sandy(Soda's girlfriend who gets pregnant, but the kid isn't his) The lessons learned in THe Outsiders can be related to real life. There are still strugles between different groups, there is still a social pecking order. You can look at the Outsiders as story, or look at it from a deeper contex. In the 60s, when this book was first published violence seemed limited to the inner city. Many midddle class kids probably couldn't relate to the gangs. But now in the 90s with all of the shootings, and deaths this book has even more meaning."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"at first, when my english teacher assigned this book for us to read i thought it was going to be boring. woah! was i wrong! i totally love to read books, and of all the ones i have read this one by far is one of the best! it was just interesting, and i really could relate to it. and i must admit that johnny was by far my favorite character. maybe this was because i could just picture him so well. but i almost cried myself when i finished it. im already starting to read it again, and i just finished it on the 19! i really recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"When a glance is given to the book The Outsiders, the cover might not catch the eye.

I recommend it to ya'll because it deals with issues almost every teenager will face. It is by far the best fiction book for teenagers ever"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Reading a novel is one thing but listening whilst reading adds a new dimension to it. The Outsiders is written by an American author and it's set in the 1960s. I am Australian and the language in the novel is not. It makes sense to listen to a trained actor deliver the novel with the correct intonation, dramatic intensity and charaterisation that simply reading cannot provide. The themes in The Outsiders are relevant to today's teenagers who deal with peer pressure, dysfunctional families and the all too human need to belong somewhere....anywhere. Conflict is sustained throughout and there is the final resolution. This is good to play on a car trip to keep teenagers engaged instead of hearing \\"are we there yet?\\"or to improve reading skills by listening whilst reading. This is one way to help improve word recognition. Especially suitable for people with vision difficulties who may find it easier to listen to, rather than read a book. Very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I read The Outsiders written by S.E. Hinton. I enjoyed this book a lot. This is my favorite book. I've read it 6 times and I still want to read it again and again and again because it has adventure and excitement, and you really learn to like the characters. It has so much anticipation. For instance, when Ponyboy is walking home from the movies, he notices a car following him. Socs get out of the car and jump Ponyboy.The Outsiders is about a boy named PonyBoy Curtis who grew up on the wrong side of town and is part of a gang, which one of the members is Johnny Cade, Ponyboy's best friend. One night, they were walking in the park around 2 in the morning and some \\"socs\\" try to jump them (socs is a short name for the socials) and try to drown Ponyboy. Johnny gets up and stabs one the socs, Bob, who dies. So they decide that they need a hide out so they hear about this place from Dallas Winston, another member of the gang. There's a hideout in a abandoned church where Ponyboy and Johnny end up hiding for 5 days. Dallas comes to visit and takes them to a place for some food. While they're eating, Johnny explains to Dallas that he wants to go back home and turn themselves in. On their way back, they realize that some kids were playing around in the church which is on fire. Ponyboy and Johnny run in to save the kids. When all the kids are out, they try to escape but when Ponyboy is out, Johnny trys to get out but the ceiling starts to collapse. It falls on Johnny. Will Johnny die? Will Ponyboy and Johnny get jailed for killing that soc? Read this book and you will soon find out.I would recommend this book to some one who likes adventure, tragedy and some one who likes to read about gangs and rumbles."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Even though S.E. Hinton's young adult novel, The Outsiders, was first published 35 years ago, it is timeless. Just like Romeo and Juliet, or West Side Story, it is a story of rivaling groups and the emotional and physical scars that the rivalry plays on the individuals of both sides. There is no love story, but the relationships among three recently orphaned brothers and their gang of greaser friends tells of deep attachments, love and hate.The story is told by fourteen year old Ponyboy who is the youngest of the Curtis boys. He reveals his opinions, insights and feelings towards the people and events going on around him. Throughout the story Ponyboy's sensitivity to the complexities of peoples thoughts, motivations, and actions, including his own, increases dramatically. As Ponyboy develops an understanding of his world, so does the reader develop an understanding of how a teenage mind works and grows.Hinton's greasers and socs (socialites) represent the cliques that forever seem to reign in middle and high schools. For this reason most readers will find it easy to relate to one or more of the characters. If the reader is an adult, like me, Ponyboy's revelations will shed some light on who some of those other kids in school were, and why they did what they did. For the teen reading the book for the first time,Ponyboy offers insights that might make the road they're travelling easier to understand now.If you have a teen in your home, don't show them the movie. Give them this book to read. They are sure to appreciate the gift."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book pretty much changed my life. It tells the story of a young boy, the brothers he loves, and the friends he hangs with who are almost like brothers, and all the adventures they get into. I don't know how many times I've read it - but it touched something inside of me so much, like S.E. Hinton knew what I was feeling as a teen. I wanted to be Ponyboy (a neat trick for a girl!), and eventually I was, at least for a while.If you're a teen who dreams of danger and adventures and friendships that you can count on no matter what, then I recommend this book to you! An absolute classic."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"\\"Help, help, help us please, someone!\\" The children cry as the hot, red burning flames tempt the children to scream as the flames lick ferociously at the frightened children's feet. Ponyboy, Johnny, and Dallas are just driving up as they see the old church (where Ponyboy and Johnny have been staying) burning. Ponyboy and Johnny run in because they can tell that there are children trapped in the burning church. The Outsiders is a book of courage and friendships and how friends stick by you when it matters the most.Just because people have more money or better, and more stylish clothes than someone else, doesn't mean that they should treat people any different or with less respect. You should try and make them feel better about themselves instead. The Socs looked down on the Greasers because the Socs are richer than them and the Greasers don't have the fancy cars or the Madras shirts like the Socs.I think that friends should stick together through good, bad, and sad times When Johnny killed a Soc, he did it out of friendship to Ponyboy. If it wasn't for him, Ponyboy would've drowned. When Ponyboy woke up and saw the Soc just lying there in a puddle of blood, he didn't try and run away from Johnny.Just because someone else does drugs or drinks and fights at a young age, doesn't mean that they are a bad person. Ponyboy and Johnny smoked, drank, and also fought, but they had to protect themselves from the Socs because they would go around town trying to find Greasers like Ponyboy and Johnny to jump (beat u.) They ran into the burning, old church when the school had taken the children on a field trip, the children had gone in there and gotten scared and trapped. They put their own lives in danger in order to save someone else. He and Ponyboy still managed to get all of the kids out of the old, burning, church.When two people are different, for example Greasers and Socs, that doesn't mean that you can't be that person's friend. Cherry Valance, a Soc, and Ponyboy, a Greaser, were friends and they could both talk to each other, and they understood one another about sunsets.In conclusion, The Outsiders was a very good book. It teaches you that just because people have more money or better clothes, doesn't mean that they should treat people any different; friends should stick together through good times and bad; just because someone does drugs or drinks and fights at a young age, doesn't mean that they are a bad person; and when two people are different that doesn't mean that you can't be friends with that person. Therefore, I believe that The Outsiders is a great book. I hope that in times of need my friends and family will be there for me and can give me the strength to carry on and be brave. I think that middle and high school students should read this book. You can hope to get out of the book lessons to use in life like not to smoke, drink, and do drugs; to have family and friends that care for you and will help you through anything."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders tells the story of two gangs: the Greasers and Socs (short for Socials).

There were times in the book, near the middle, when I was yelling and screaming at the book, and times, at the end, where I cried.

As is happening in Isreal with the Jews and Palastinians. It also shows that everybody has a good side even the bad ones, as Dally saved the kids, and Johnny. When Johnny and Ponyboy went to Windrexvliie it showed that everybody tries to run from there problems. When dally goes and kills himslef shows that all people care about somone.

She also does a good job of explaining, in rich detail, how Ponyboy goes through his troubles.In which they all begin when a small fight begins, and Johnny saves Ponyboy's life by taking another.

At 14, he is already wise to the ways of the world. Pony knows the \\"Socs\\" - the town's upper crust - can get away with everything because of their money, while \\"Greasers\\" like himself will always be behind, no matter how smart or determined they are.Still - unlike his brothers and friends - Pony's got a softer side. He's an A student who enjoys reading poetry, and dreams of a better life. The smart-mouthed, gum-cracking girls the other Greasers date aren't for him, or the crappy dead-end jobs.Then one horrible night, Ponyboy's best friend Johnny kills a Soc to save Pony's life. Although it was self-defense, the two boys know too well how such a situation will end for them. They flee into the countryside, while the city erupts into full-out warfare over the crime.As if they hadn't been through enough, tragedy again strikes...this time nearly claiming Johnny's life. Ponyboy is forced to return home, where he is also forced to face the brothers who raised him. Are they really so different from him? Or is this recent turn of events the breaking point, the catalyst for making Ponyboy as hard and unfeeling as everyone else around him?I first read this book in the seventh grade, as one of the first novels I'd ever been assigned, and have read it numerous times since. This is one of those books that provides you with some new details, some nuance of story, that you didn't pick up the last time you read it.

Not only me, but also most of the class! When reading it I wanted to go on and on but couldn't because we only supposed to read a chapter a night! It's not like a book that has action every 100 pages or action every page that you can't understand the character well. This book is about how there are two groups, the socs and greasers, who hate each other. Many big and fun things happen and you have got to read this! The description is well I could sometimes picture the scenes happening. In a way it also says the true meaning of friendship and caring"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"\\"The Outsiders\\"Reviewed By: Madelynage: 13I saw parts of the movie last year at school. It was, however, the last day where they show movies but everyone's too busy talking with friends, and loudly planning out there summer to even bother with paying attention. I didn't think much of it until a month ago when I was at my aunt's, and noticed a copy of it on her bookshelf. I asked to borrow the book, not thinking of anything but that it only that it would be some nice summer reading material.But, the moment I read the first page of that book, I couldn't put it down! I'll bet you that if my house had caught fire, I would have waited to the end of the chapter before I bothered to do anything about it. The Characters, setting, plot, and even the 60's lingo was compelling.I read that whole darn thing in one night and the moment I got to the end, I simply thought, \\"Well heck, might as well read it again\\". And so I read it again and again and again. By the end of the week I could tell you the entire story without evening cracking the book open. (I' must've read it 20 or 25 times!)The story tells of rough yet dreamy Ponyboy. He's surrounded by a world of the tough (or \\"T-U-F-F) boys from the east-side. The Greasers. While in a constant battle with the rich and preppy west-side Soc's (Short for Socials). With his parents gone, Ponyboy only has his two brothers Darry and Soda, and a couple of close friends, who together create a gang that's tighter than friendship but not related by blood.Ponyboy, Johnny, Dallas a.k.a Dally, Two-Bit (real name is Keith Matthews but nobody bothers to remember), Darrel a.k.a Darry, Sodapop, and Steve are inseparable. But on one dark night. Fast-occurring events throw Ponyboy and Johnny in a murder rap and hiding in a small-town church. They there until more occurring events (It'll ruin the surprise if I say more!! :D) bring them back home.After a victorious rumble, the night turns cold. At the end, Ponyboy turns what began as innocent English paper, into a work of art when he explains the week that took away the lives of some, who didn't make it to the end of the book. The Childhood, of those who immediately grew up. And the Life that the gang was so used to. There will still be soc's, and there will still be greasers, but there was definitely something that had changed.If you didn't love the book then you have no right to be near books at all. \\"The Outsiders\\" is a timeless classic written by a wonderful author who has inspired me to become a writer myself. Thank You Ms. Hinton, for this heart filled book, thank you Mr. Coppola for turning it into an awesome film. In the end, you've SO got to read this!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"THE OUTSIDERSMain CharactersPony Curtis - the narrator and protagonist of the story. His elder brother, Darry, brings him up after the death of his parents in a car accident. Though Pony resents him, he is also in awe of him. He also idolizes his middle brother, Soda. All three brothers belong to a gang of poor teenagers called the Greasers, named for their long, oily hair. Their bitter rivals are the Socs, the rich kids living on the west side of town. Pony is involved in the murder of a Soc named Bob. After the killing, he runs away with his friend Johnny to Windrixville. There they hide in an abandoned church. When the church catches on fire, they bravely rescue some children trapped in it. Johnny is badly injured and has to be hospitalized. When he dies, Pony is completely shattered. He cannot reconcile himself to his friend's death until he reads a letter Johnny has left for him telling him to 'stay gold' and to continue appreciating sunsets. He finally understands that with hard work he can overcome his circumstances and not remain an outsider all his life. Pony then adopts a mission for himself to tell the rest of the world about the odds that under-privileged children have to face. He also realizes and appreciates how much Darry loves and cares for him.Johnny Cade - a member of the Greasers whom the other gang members try to protect. His father constantly beats him up, and his mother either ignores his presence or screams at him. He becomes a nervous wreck after he is terribly beaten up by the Socs. He starts carrying a switchblade in his pocket; when he and Pony are attacked by the Socs, he uses the knife to kill Bob in self-defense. He hides with Pony in an abandoned church in Windrixville and heroically rescues children who are trapped in the church after it catches fire. During the rescue, a burning beam falls on his back, and he later dies in a hospital. Before dying, he tells Dally that 'fighting's no good' and asks Pony to 'stay gold.' Even after death, his spirit reaches out to Pony in the form of a letter which he leaves for him, exhorting him to remain pure and rise above being an outsider. The letter motivates Pony to tell the rest of the world that it is wrong to judge children by the amount of hair oil they wear.Dallas Winston (Dally) - the toughest, coldest, and meanest of the Greasers. He has been in and out of jail since the age of ten. He gives Pony and Johnny a gun and some money when they come to him after Bob's death. He also tells them where to hide. During the rescue, Dally plunges into the burning church to rescue Johnny, who is trapped under a beam. Upset by Johnny's death, he threatens the police with an unloaded gun after robbing a store. He dies without the world knowing about his qualities or the reasons for his delinquency.SETTINGThe Outsiders is set in a large, unnamed town in the United States. It is about a gang of teenage boys who are called the Greasers. They live on the east side of the town, also known as the wrong side of town; the eastside neighborhood is described in graphic detail. The story is set in the 1960's and relates the incidents that take place over a few days. After killing Bob, Pony and Johnny take shelter in an abandoned church in Windrixville. After it catches fire and burns down, they return to their hometown, where Johnny dies in a hospital.CONFLICTProtagonistPony Curtis is the teenage narrator and protagonist of the novel. When his parents were killed in a car accident, Darry, his twenty- year-old brother, began to provide for him. He resents Darry's bullying manner, not realizing that he does so because he loves him and wants him to make something of himself. Pony belongs to an eastside gang of poor teenagers, called the Greasers; their rivals are the Socs, the rich kids living on the west side of town.AntagonistPony's antagonist is his status in life. Poor and from the wrong side of town, he gets no breaks in life, even though he is a good student and studies hard. He joins the Greasers because it is the thing to do if you live on the east side of town. Their rivals are the Socs, a gang of rich, spoiled kids living on the west side of town. The Socs constantly pick fights with the Greasers, and Bob, one of the Socs, attacks Johnny and Pony because they have been friendly with Cherry. Johnny kills Bob in self-defense, and he and Pony go into hiding in a church in Windrixville. When the church catches on fire, Johnny and Pony try to save the children trapped inside. Johnny is serious injured during the rescue and dies a few days later in a hospital. Dally, who was Johnny's best friend, is completely shattered by his death. Crazy with grief, he robs a store and then threatens the police with an unloaded gun. As a result, he is killed. Now Pony has lost two friends. He falls sick, becomes delirious, tries to deny Johnny's death, and begins to fail in school.ClimaxThe climax occurs when Pony reads the letter that Johnny has written to him before his death. Johnny encourages his friend to \\"stay gold\\" - to look for the sunsets and good things in life. He tells Pony that if he tries, he will be able to make something worthwhile out of his life. Reading the letter is the turning point in Pony's life.OutcomeThe novel ends as a tragic comedy. Even though Bob, Johnny, and Dally have needlessly perished, Pony overcomes his problems, largely due to Johnny's letter of encouragement. He reconciles with Darry, finally understanding how much his older brother loves and cares for him. He also accepts that he does not have to be an outsider or a Greaser for the rest of his life. In order to seek help and understanding for underprivileged children like himself, Pony's mission becomes to tell others about the immense obstacles that stand in the way of success for teenagers from the wrong side of town. The novel, therefore, ends on a note of hope and optimism.PLOTPony Curtis is a member of the Greasers, a gang of poor teenagers with long, oily hair and from the wrong side of town. While returning home from the movies one night, Pony is attacked by the Socs, a gang of rich kids from the west side of town. Pony is afraid that they are going to kill him and starts shouting for help. His brothers (Darry and Soda), along with Steve Randle, Two Bit Matthews, Dally Winston, and Johnny Cade, rush to his rescue. After ascertaining that Pony is relatively unharmed, Darry shouts at him for walking alone and tells him that he should use a bit of common sense. Darry is Pony's oldest brother who has provided for him since his parents were killed in a car accident. Darry knows that Pony is smart and wants him to do well in life. As a result, he constantly nags Pony about doing well in school and making good grades. Pony resents his brother's intrusion in his life and his unemotional ways. In contrast, Pony adores Soda, his middle brother. He is a high school dropout, who works at a gas station with his best friend Steve Randal. Two-Bit Matthews is a member of the Greasers who always tries to have the last word on things. Johnny Cade is another gang member whom everyone tries to protect, because his father constantly tries to beat him up. The toughest character of the Greaser's gang is Dally, who has been in and out of jail since the age of ten. Pony, Johnny, and Dally decide to go to the drive-in the next evening. There they meet Cherry and Marcia, friends of the Socs. Dally is rude and obnoxious. When Cherry throws a coke in his face, he stalks off in anger. Pony and Johnny are left to watch the movie with the girls, but they are soon joined by Two Bits. After the movie they decide to walk to Two Bits' house to pick up his car in order to take the girls home. Along the way, Pony and Cherry find that they have a lot in common; they are both are idealistic dreamers, who love sunsets. Suddenly a blue Mustang pulls up near them. Two members of the Socs, Bob and Randy, emerge from the car to confront them. A fight almost takes place between the boys, but Cherry prevents it by getting into the Mustang.Two-Bit goes off to play snooker, and Pony and Johnny go to the vacant lot where they often hang out. At about two-thirty in the morning, Pony gets up with a start, for he has fallen asleep in the vacant lot. He rushes home to find Darry awake and frantic with worry. He shouts at Pony, which results in an argument. When Darry slaps his younger brother, Pony rushes out of the house and finds Johnny. As they walk in the park, Bob, Randy, and several other Socs attack them for being with their girls earlier. In the fight that follows, Johnny, in self-defense, kills Bob with his switchblade.In a panic, Johnny and Pony go to Dally for help. He gives them a loaded gun, money, and directions to reach an abandoned church in Windrixville, where they can hide out. They change their appearance by cutting off their long hair and pass the time by reading Gone with the Wind and discussing life. Once Pony recites one of Robert Frost's poems, \\"Nothing Gold Can Stay.\\" Johnny understands that \\"gold\\" in the poem stands for freshness, innocence, and purity.On the fifth day of their hiding, Dally comes to visit Pony and Johnny. He takes them out to eat and informs them that the tension between the Socs and the Greasers has increased. A rumble between the two gangs is supposedly to take place the following evening. Dally says that he has started carrying an unloaded gun to serve as a deterrent to any serious trouble. Johnny announces his decision to turn himself in to the police, for he does not want to be on the run for the rest of his life. He believes that he will get a light sentence since he has killed Bob in self-defense. Dally tries to dissuade him; he knows first-hand that any prison time is miserable.THEMESMajorThe major theme of the novel revolves around the purposelessness of any gang of teenagers. The book centers on the foolish gang rivalry existing between the Socs, the rich kids from the west side of town, and the Greasers, the poor kids from the east side.Pony, the protagonist of the story, is bitter about the fact that the wealthy Socs have nice cars, fancy clothes, and girlfriends; things are simply easier for them than for the Greasers. Because the Socs are convinced that they are better, they constantly pick on members of the Greasers, who fight back. During one squabble, Bob, one of the Socs, is murdered by Johnny in self-defense. Then Johnny, while hiding out in a church, is killed while trying to rescue children from the burning building. In reaction to Johnny's death, Dally, his best friend, goes on a rampage. He robs a store and points an unloaded gun at the police; as a result, he is shot and killed. Because of the needless gang fighting, three teenagers are killed in the novel, clearly pointing out the negative aspect of belonging to a gang. Hinton is obviously trying to warn the reader against participation in any gang.MinorRelated to the major theme of the book is the theme that a teenager can rise above his circumstances through hard work, patience, and determination. Pony is the proof of this theme. Even though he is born into poverty, loses his parents in a car accident at an early age, and participates in the Greasers, by the end of the book, he is determined to better his plight in life, largely due to the encouragement he receives from the deceased Johnny in a letter. At the close of the novel, Pony wants to tell the world that underprivileged children need to have some breaks in order to get ahead and need to be judged for who they are, not by how they look or how they dress. Hinton definitely convinces the reader that Pony, because of his intelligence and determination, will rise above the poverty and gang life that he was born into.MOODWhen the story opens, the mood is bitter and rebellious. Pony and the other Greasers resent the fact that the Socs have lots of money, nice cars, fancy clothes, and many girlfriends. In contrast, they are poor and must work extremely hard for everything they have. In addition, society is prejudiced against them because of their clothes, long hair, and greasy appearance. In the middle of the novel, the mood becomes increasingly angry. The Greasers are tired of the Socs always picking on them, and the Socs are furious about the Greasers hanging out with some of \\"their girls.\\" As a result, the Socs jump Pony and Johnny. In self-defense Johnny kills Bob, one of the Socs. The mood then becomes one of terror. Pony and Johnny are scared for their own safety and fear the police. Upon Dally's advice, they hide in an abandoned church and worry about being found. The mood then switches to great sadness, for Johnny, in trying to rescue the children when the church catches on fire, is killed himself. Dally then gets himself foolishly shot by the police, leaving Pony with two less friends. By the end of the novel, however, the mood has some degree of hope. Pony is determined to rise above his past. He adopts a new mission in life, to tell the world about the problems and deprivations of underprivileged children, like himself. It is obvious that in the end, Hinton is very sympathetic towards the plight of Pony and the Greasers."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"WOW! I cannot imagine how such a young girl can write such a good book! I first saw it in my school library a few years ago and I thought it was going to be one of those stupid gang-violence books. I was required to buy it for Lit. class 'cause we had to write notes in it and stuff and letme tell you this me and my fellow classmates LOVED it ( thanks Miss Cassels! ). Now I take my copy w/ me everywhere and read it 20+ times and still I can't seem to get enough! I know Ms. Hinton always says she'll never write a sequel, but I'm praying she'll change her mind. After we read it we watched the movie in school, and not so long after that I bought the video, and watching it as I speak ( type? Oh well ). So to make a long story short ( although I think its a little too late for my case )I'll sum up my review in three words: READ THE BOOK! -GabbieXena (Kym) oxxx|------&gt;"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book is one of the best. Trust me... unlike the person who says, &#34;OMG LOL the actors are like sooo hawwt!!!&#34; Don't listen to attention whores. This book is great."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Do you ever wonder what it would be like to be in a gang, and the only thing that keeps you going is the love and friendship of the gang? _The Outsiders_ is a realistic fiction book written by S.E Hinton. If this book were made into a movie, it would be rated PG 13. This book was one of the best books I have read, and I would give it 5 stars. It's a story about a gang, or more like a band of brothers, who'd give their lives for each other. Their rivalry gang is the Socs. Hate is the word I would use to describe their relationship. The Socs have their own name for their rivals. They call them \\"Greasers'\\" because they believe that they are better then them. Also because they're a rough, dirty group of kids who have long hair that they always keep greased. The Greasers gang is their way of life and their brotherhood means a lot to them. The Socs gang does not have this same bond. Throughout the book they fight, attack, and jump each other. Some people even get killed. That's where one of the main conflicts comes in. The three best things about this book are that it's action packed, it's a very deep story that makes you keep reading, and has a ton of life lessons. I would recommend this book to someone who feel lost or out of place and also to someone who loves books full of action and adventure. The author's writing style is first person because it is the main character telling the story. An example of this is \\"I shook my head wordlessly.\\" This book was great and was perfectly written. I highly recommend reading this book. The reader won't be disappointed. Review by Lucas L."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"S.E. Hilton's novel, \\"The Outsides,\\" is among my favorite novels that follows the tradition of Realism. The novel seeks to portray a group of young people (a gang) called the Greasers, who are often viewed by others in their community as little more than white trash. However, through Ponyboy Curtis' narration, S.E. Hilton complicates the notion that the poor are stupid losers rather than people who have had a hard life. For instance, both of Ponyboy's parents are dead as a result of a tragic accident, and Ponyboy's 20 year old brother, Darry, has forgone college to work in order to support Ponyboy, so Ponyboy and Sodapop (other brother) would not end up in a boy's home.Even Ponyboy's narration of the text is communicated in such a way that Ponyboy's intelligence shines through, which, of course, would be realistic, because, in the United States, there are many intelligent young people who are never given the opportunity to show how intelligent they really are by a school system that fails to provide students with a rigorous education, for any of a number of reasons including a lack of funding or even a desire to perpetuate an underclass.Johnny Cade's character is also well developed. In addition to being Ponyboy's friend, S.E. Hilton's portrayal of 16 year old Johnny (through Ponyboy's narration) is one of deep, emotional depth. Johnny is not a bad kid. He murders a Soc, but only because the Socs, in their state of drunkenness, might have murdered Ponyboy. In addition, Johnny feels very badly after committing the murder, and the scenes in the abandoned church (as well as the fire scene) further convey Johnny's humanity. [My Note: In my opinion, Johnny's character is important in dispelling modern notions that wish to place people in boxes of either GOOD or BAD, as though people are either saint-like or demonic, and as though economic circumstances and other environmental factors exert no influence over a person's life or actions.]Of course, S.E. Hilton's novel is not about portraying Greasers as good and Socs as bad. That would defeat the entire purpose of her novel. The Socs are also products of their environment, an environment of total entitlement, lack of discipline by wealthy parents, and a police department that turns the other way when children of the wealthy engage in drunkenness, sexual promiscuity, etc. Worded differently, the Socs cannot imagine a world in which are not the kings of the hill - the rulers of the scum of the earth (i.e. the Greasers) because that is how their parents view young people of 'the ghetto.'In short, this novel can be read as a call for humanism - to acknowledge that people are products of their environment and backgrounds (economic and social) - and a call for all human beings to treat one another with greater dignity and respect."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is the mandatory book on my 11-year-old step-son's summer reading list. When ordering it for him, I told him enthusiastically how much I had enjoyed reading it, at his age. He was skeptical, so I assured him it's not a girly book; it's about boys. My husband piped up, \\"It's a book about boys, written for girls!\\" I opened my mouth to argue, but had to close it. What my husband said is true.I'm sure other reviewers have summarized the plot details, so I won't. It is a manipulatively emotional story of the inner tenderness of \\"tough guys\\"; and the sad truth that even when kids get in trouble because they live in harsh circumstances, unfairly deprived of appropriate guidance from adults, THEY - and not the parents or society who have failed them - ultimately will be held responsible for their own actions and suffer whatever consequences arise. It is also the story of the inspiring self-sacrifice of a father, working to see that his son's life will be better than his own (although the \\"parent\\" and \\"child\\" in the story are actually brothers).I was touched by this book, as a kid. It never occurred to me then, that it might have been written only to please my adolescent, female sensibilities and have no relation to the inner lives of real boys. Although it's not the kind of thing I read now, I still suspect my husband's dismissal of it stems from the fact that, as a kid, he hated reading raw, tear-jerky accounts of the ties between men; and NOT that, once he was forced to read it, he found it phony and unbelievable.We'll see what my step-son thinks..."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This enduring classic is the story of the Curtis brothers - Daryl, Sodapop, and Ponyboy, who are struggling to keep what's left of their family together in 1960's Oklahoma.

The only people who are loyal to him are his gang."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"THE OUTSIDERSI thought that this book was really good. It is about gangs and the hard times the Greasers went through with the Socs. There was only one bad part about the book. (Of what I thought) Was when two of the Greasers (Ponyboy and Johnny) went to abandoned church to get away from the Socs. I would give this book five stars. In this book, I thought everything was good but there is some violence. I would recommend that everyone that likes action and drama between the characters in the story then you should read the book &quot;The Outsiders&quot;."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders was a very dramatical book.

The narrator is a boy Greaser who shows us the good and hard times about being a greaser. However, if you do not like violence, I don't think you should read this book. There are a lot of situations in this book that contains violence. Overall, I really liked this book, because most books we read in school aren't very good. If you like stories with some violence and a lot of thoughts and emotions going on between the characters then you should read &quot;The Outsiders.&quot;"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"OUTSIDERSThe book &quot; The Outsiders&quot; was normally a book I wouldn't have read. However I was assigned to read this book and found out it wasn't that bad. All though I found it a little hard to relate to the problems Ponyboy and the other characters had. However I found I could to some extent understand what was going on, and how they felt. This story is about two gangs of boys that are always fighting to earn respect between two social groups. This book isn't my favorite book, but I did enjoy it. It's easy reading, for all ages, and not that long. So try it I'll bet you'll like it. Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I thought this book was a good book that got better. This is a great book, and I highly recommended this The Outsiders to everyone. The thing that made this book real good is its great character development, super plot, and the climax. No, I won't tell you the climax. It's about two gangs in the 50's. The gang's names are the greasers, the hard nice guys, and the Soc, the rich punks. They always quarreling, and Ponyboy is caught in the middle of it. If you want to find out more about Ponyboy and his adventures, buy The Outsiders now."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The OutsidersThe outsiders was a great book, the reason is it a good book is that it is like a real-life event. It was a very interesting book because you were scared for the people like they were scared for themselves. The reason it's like a real like experience is because when you get in a gang you get in fights, and get beat up by other people for no reason. And if your in a gang you have that chance of getting killed by someone that was supposed to be your friend or by killing yourself or like how Bob got killed, by someone that hated him.

Hinton, is a fast-paced story about a family struggling to stick together on the bad side of town somewhere in Ohio. \\"Greasers,\\" such as Ponyboy Curtis, the main character, get jumped by the rich \\"Socs.\\" Ponyboy is living with his two brothers because his mom and dad were killed in a tragic car-crash. His life is turned upside-down when his friend, Johnny, commits a horrible, gruesome crime. Ponyboy and Johnny go into hiding causing further disruption.The author, S. E. Hinton, writes a gripping, compassionate story engrossed in this remarkable, electrifying novel. The Outsiders was quite simple to read but, S. E. Hinton makes the reader really get to know the characters and explains their feelings very well. We would recommend this book to any child who is between sixth and eighth grade."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This audio tape is outstanding! The reader does a great job in reading the novel word for word with a comfortable pace for my 7th graders. He changes the voices for the lead characters.

I recommend this audio tape to anyone who loves to be read to."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Soda is different, different from anybody; he understands everything, almost... He's always happy-go-lucky and grinning...\\" said Ponyboy as he walked from the movie theater.When ever anybody asks me who my favorite character is I always say without thinking Soda Pop Curtis from The Outsiders, written by S.E. Hinton. Soda Pop is a very sensitive sixteen year old boy. Soda's sensitive side shows when he gets a letter in the mail from his girlfriend saying that her parents wouldn't allow her to marry a gang member, Soda Pop. Another time when Soda is sensitive is when Ponyboy, his brother, runs away. Soda Pop cried for 2 nights straight.I think Soda Pop has the right to be emotional because his parents died in a car accident, the Socs never leave him and his gang alone and when his brothers, Ponyboy and Darry fight he is always the middle man, like a tug-a-war match. Soda Pop's sensitivity is what makes him my favorite character."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This is the story of the greasers and the Socs, the two social groups in the boys' town. The greasers are kind of a family of friends, because for most of them all they have is each other. The Socs are more violent and like to fight. They are the rich kids who have things that the greasers can only dream of. They fight every once in a while -- but one night someone takes it too far.From that point on the story surrounds the two boys who are on the run from the \\"fuzz\\" (police). The story is told from the viewpoint of Ponyboy Curtis, who is a fourteen-year-old greaser. He has two brothers, Darry Curtis and Sodapop Curtis. Their parents were killed a few years back, but the courts let them stay together as long as they stayed out of trouble.This book is about so much more than the clich&eacute; of popular boys vs. loser boys. There are feelings and characters that you want to see succeed. That's what makes this book different from all the others, in a good way of course.I liked that the characters seemed so real, like you really knew them! I love it when a book is like that. There are internal conflicts with many of the characters as well as the good vs. evil aspect. Everyone in eighth grade should be required to read this book!Reviewed by: Taylor Rector"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Nick WrightThe OutsidersThe outsiders is a book about two groups of who don't get along. One of the Groups is the Socs, who are the rich kids. Then the Greasers, who are the poor kids with a tough life.My favorite part in The Outsiders was when Johnny and Ponyboy saw the church that they were living at was on fire. There was school kids around and one of the teachers told everyone there were kids still in the house. Ponyboy and Johnny jumped in a brokenwindow. They saved the kids that were in the burning house. Johnny and Dallas were hurt while doing this. This showed that greasers aren't uncaring people who wouldn't help someone. This was my favorite part because I think it made a lot of Socs change there perspectives about greasers.I think that this is a great book for everyone who can understand it. This book shows a lot of different things. I think this book shows that even though you're different people you can still be friends and have stuff in common. It shows that everyone needs friends and that people have to work out there differences. Also it teaches the lesson that you don't pick where you come from but you can be friends with anybody. I think The Outsiders was a great book."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Ousiders is a book about a group of teenagers in the 1950' 1960's who grew up on the wrong side of the tracks in their neighborhood. In the book there are 2 different gangs the \\"greasers\\"( the poor kids who get blamed for everything), and the \\"socs\\" ( the rich kids). In the book the main characters are greasers. The book shows the events these kids go through and also how they view the \\"socs\\". Throughout the book there are rumbles ( fights) going on,people getting jumped, people getting killed, etc. I think the best part about the book is when Ponyboy realizes that fighting is not going to solve anything and that besides differences in things like clothing and houses the two groups are similar in that they are both ghoing through tough times and trying to find their way in life. The book Outsiders was a very exciting book that had me in suspense after every chapter. This book made you want to keep reading. This book also makes you really have a different perspective on some things. The main character Ponyboy understands things that are going on that most others would not. If you want a page turning book I would recomend this book in a second."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is an awsome book, its my favorite. It is about gangstas like me and fagget socs like the preps.

Also, theres this kid dallas winston that stole a magazing from a store and got shot down under a street light, hes just like me too.

Though it isn't my favorite book in the world, like Eragon by: Christopher Paolini and Eldest by: Christopher Paolini, it still was really great. It felt as if you were an actual greaser walking with Ponyboy throughout the story. As I read the book, I could picture it and feel what the characters were feeling simultaneously. I highly recommend reading it. It is full of suspense, which at some points killed me, and has action and so much i can't think of at this moment..... But yes, as I said, I highly recommend reading it."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"A Story of a lost young boy who is part of a gang with only two older brothers to look after him.

The Outsiders is a descriptive book that details what gang life is really like and how this kind of life can damage a friendship. This is by far the best book I've ever read. I would definitely rate it a five on a one to five scale.

The murder completely changes his opinon on all this fighting. I like this book because its not like the books for teens that are out there. They're all about teen love, the prom or the popular kids.

This is such a touching book, and so close to home for alot of teens today. I highly recommend this book! I'm so glad I had to read this book for my English class."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"When I was really little I loved to read but now I only read when I have to. I had to read &quot;The Outsiders&quot; for English class and immediately discovered it was an excellent book. I just finished it today! If I hadn't been in class I probably would have been crying because it really touches you. Not to mention my favorite charachter was Johnny. I could also relate to Ponyboy because I have the same qualities. You can really see people you know in each character! Many people classify this book as young adult, which I am, but I really think anyone of any age could learn a lot from &quot;The Outsiders.&quot; S. E. Hinton must be a incredible author to write a book like this when she was just 16! I plan on reading more of her books and I hope you read &quot;The Outsiders&quot; because it is more than a book, it touches your heart like nothing else. My class will also be showing the movie, but I don't even know how a movie could be this good."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I read this book in English class and it was very good! When we would stop reading a voice in my head said, \\"PLEASE KEEP ON!!!\\" This book was very good and I really love it. I'm kind of like Ponyboy because sometimes I forget things. I'm also like Sodapop because I'm happy all the time. I really love this book because it's a great book!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Boys struggle with real life problems as they navigate difficult teenage years,May 12, 2004Reviewer: akdancer, from Wilmette Junior High School, Illinois.The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton shows the difficult coming of age events one boy has to face. The Socs were the rich kids, who had it all. They were never satisfied with their lives, and always wanted more. The Greasers from the other side of tracks are stereotypical bad boys. Ponyboy a Greaser lives with his brothers. One day Ponyboy and his friend Johnny decide to talk to the Socs girlfriends. The Socs disapprove and beat them up, just for socializing with the girls. A Soc boy tries drowning Ponyboy, but Johnny grabs him off and kills him. The Greasers know immediately that they must run away in order to escape being caught by the police. Ponyboy and Johnny hide in a church. After a few days, Johnny wants to return home and confess their crime. Before they leave, one of their cigarettes lights the church on fire and a few little children get trapped inside. Johnny and Ponyboy get the kids out in the nick of time to save their lives, but Johnny gets seriously hurt. The town calls them heroes. Johnny is rushed to the hospital on the verge of death. This suspenseful book fills readers with excitement, tragedy, and many emotions. \\"The Outsiders\\" was an amazing book, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good cry."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The outsiders is a good book that has to do with conflicts between two groups, the socs and the greasers. It is kind of violent because the two groups are often fighting. The book is sometimes difficult to follow because there are a lot if different charicters in the book, other than that it is a great book. It is full of action and suspense and I would recomened it to anyone who likes those types of books."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is about a fourteen year old boy named Ponyboy. Ponyboy has grown up in tough surroundings. When his best friend, Johnny, killed a rival gang member, called the Socs, it forced Ponyboy and Johnny to go into hiding. That was only the beginning of Ponyboy's wild adventure. This is the only book that I'm willing to read more than once. It's hard to compare this to another book, when this is the best book I've ever read. It's so different than a lot of other books I've read. It gets straight to the point and it affects you emotionally of all the hard times each character goes through. I feel that I identify with Darry the most. He stayed strong, and kept his family together. He had to raise a family all by himself. This book is great for all ages. I read back in seventh grade. And I also read it now in twelth grade. The only draw back is the circumstances of Johnny and Dally. My two favorite characters of the book."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is a very interesting book told in first person by Ponyboy Curtis, a gang member of the 'Greasers'. He is fourteen years old and lives with his older brothers Darrel and Sodapop. His best friend and also gang member,Johnny Cade, kills a member of the rival gang (for self-defense) and Ponyboy and Johnny go into hiding with the help of the toughest member of the 'Greasers', Dallas Winston. They're hiding in the country when they see a church burning down. They hear that there are some kids in the church so Ponyboy and Johnny go in to save them. They manage to save all the kids but while Johnny was trying to jump out the window the roof colapsed and hit Johnny on the back leaving him paralized and with a third degree burn. Ponyboy managed to get out safely. Days later Johnny dies. Dallas can't take the pain since Johnny was the only person he's ever loved. He decided to rob a grocery store. He was being chased by the cops when he turns around and pulls out an unloaded gun. The police don't hesitate to shot and leave Dallas dead on the ground. Ponyboy witnesse all this and becomes sick. Weeks passed and he is still depressed but decided he can't stop living because someone else did. He continues school but has bad grades. His English teacher tells him to write a composition on anything he wants. Ponyboy decides to write about his events with Johnny and the whole gang.There is more to this story. You just have to read it and understand it and you'll like it as much as I did (and still do)."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"For me, this is one of those books that you can read over and over and over, and even though you know the ending, you still can't put it down and you wish that maybe this time, there'll be a different ending.I won't bother writing a detailed review about this book because I'd probably go on and on about it. I read it in my early teen years, and though it was never really relevant to my life (the setting, for one, is completely different from what I'm used to, and I was always somewhere in the middle of high school cliques - not on the outside, but not on the inside, either), but even then, I couldn't help but care deeply for each of the greasers. Ponyboy and his friends & family were flawed, but still likable, and they made me want the best for each of them.Highly recommended. I can't say that enough."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"My mom first got me this book when I was in 5th grade. I read the first few pages but quickly lost interest. 3 years later, I was forced to read it for language arts class. Needless to say, it became the best book I ever had to read for a school assignment. I would recommend reading The Outsiders during middle school or junior high and later in life as well. Elementary schoolers (especially 5th graders) won't have too much trouble with the difficulty of reading, but will have trouble relating to the book or the characters. Overall, this is an outstanding book that every teenager should read"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I loved the out siders it is one of those books that you can read over and over.

The movie contains almost all the most important ideas, but I feel its missing to capture more ideas from the book in the beginning. Its good to see the movie after you read the book, I believe that you will be lost if you just see the movie some day without first reading the book, now that the book has much more description and you get to know better each of the characters. Just read the book, its not bad at all."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The past weeks we read \\"The outsiders\\" novel by S.E. Hinton. I was able to identify myself with the different characters and their feelings. I felt I was inside the book. Later, we watch the movie, so we could compare both of the characters, setting, and actually see what was happening. If I could rate this movie form 1 to 5, I will give it a 3. I think the book was better than the movie because it has more events; the characters have more feelings, and you can somehow imagine better what is happening. The book was more descriptive and I think is better to imagine some of the scenes. The role of the characters in the movie was very good. I think some of the characters were really into their part and you could identify their feelings. I think Ponyboy really showed how he felt towards his brothers, the gang, and Johnny. I thought Soda was going to be stronger, and that he was going to take part in more parts in the story, as well as Darry. They skip some parts in the movie, but most of it really included the main events. I thought the movie was going to be better; maybe I just thought it was going to be more recent and with better effects. The setting in the movie was also good; I imagined most of the parts like they were shown. Some parts were really fake and different to what I imagined it would be.Well, it was a good movie and I would really recommend it, but the book is way better!-marifer ibarrola"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The OutsidersWell, this movie has been one of the best I have saw but I know because of the year it was made, some scenes are boring or not that interesting because of the setting and characters. Even do this movie is very funny and also has sad moments such as the part were Bob die and Johnny. I give this movie four stars.The main actors played their part wonderful like Ponyboy he had many feelings, he acted very emotional he laugh, cried and get mad. Another good actor was Johnny when he was at the hospital, he talked very worried all sick and depressing because he didn't want to die. Also one of the important characters is Dallas, he acted like he didn't care about anything, and he said he was the coolest guy in the whole world. He love to be with girls and like to have fights.This movie and story had many interesting parts such as when Bob die or when the church was at fire that story has different plots. The plots are great they catch your attention and make the story more interesting. The setting of the story was not that good, they didn't describe it, put you know by seeing were they were and at what time. The setting was good but it would be great if they describe it more.The world I had imagine while reading S.E Hinton's book was more or less the one of the movie, all old of the 80s, the characters cloths exactly how they were, the fights of greasers and socials were like I had imagine hitting but without knifes or guns. The church on fire was like I imagine they were returning for Dairy Queen and then they saw all the small kids inside with flames everywhere. The movie discussed very well the themes of the book but the movie missed some things like the first fight when the socials were going to cuts Ponyboy hair. It also passed more things that didn't pass in the book. But anyway the movie and the book were well discussed they were very relative.Which is better the movie or the book?Well, that a good question but definitive the book, it is more exited when you are going to read it you get very enthusiastic because you want to know what is going to happen next. Also because the book is more complete describes more the characters the setting. So I liked more the book and I recommend it a lot it is very interesting and you get engaged in the novel.Paulina Lara#13 8A"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"When S. E. Hinton wrote The Outsiders, she wrote a great book. It started with a fight that led you into the book's central conflict of \\"socs\\" versus \\"greasers\\". These two groups battled it out all the way through the book and, in the middle of it, there was murder, runaways, accidents, bravery, and death. In the end, The Outsiders really brings home the importance of friendship and how it can get you through the toughest of times. I really enjoyed the book, and I think others will too. While it's geared toward teenagers, I feel that other ages can relate to it also; the problems encountered are universal.The narrator, a young greaser named Ponyboy, tells you his account of everything as he saw it in 1967, Tulsa, Oklahoma. The rowdy group of greasers he calls family never had a dull moment. Whether Pony was with his brothers, Sodapop and Darry, or with Johnny, Two-bit, Steve, and Dally, there was a feeling of family among the group. This is probably because none of the boys really had great family lives: Pony's and his brothers' parents were dead; Johnny's parents were cold and heartless; and Dally didn't really have a family. I don't know if they would have made it through the times ahead if it wasn't for how close they were.From the very beginning, it was evident that the central conflict is socs versus greasers. While there were a few insignificant fights between the two groups, there was a constant reminder of Johnny's run-in with some socs. He was injured so badly that he carried a knife with him from then on. However, one night was taken too far. Pony and Johnny had decided they were going to run away, but their plans were shattered when a large group of socs drove up. The socs held Ponyboy under water and were going to drown him. When Johnny realized this, he pulled out his knife and used it. Pony and Johnny knew they couldn't stay there anymore, so they went to find Dally and get his help. I suppose, in a sense, they got what they wanted - they were running away.Pony and Johnny hid out in an abandoned church in the country for a week before Dally came to visit them. It was then that Johnny announced that they were going to turn themselves in. Dally thought they were crazy, but his concerns were pushed away when they all realized that the church they had been hiding in was on fire. The three of them rushed to the scene and learned that there were children trapped inside. Instantly, Pony and Johnny were in the burning building saving the kids. It was evident that Johnny was happy doing this. In the end, all the kids were out safely and, just as the boys were climbing out, the building began crashing down. The three of them - Pony, Johnny, and Dally - were rushed to a hospital. Pony was released quickly, but Dally would have to stay in for a little while; he would be fine though. Johnny, however, had gotten the worst of it. If he survived, he would be paralyzed. It was a tough time, and Dally took it the hardest. Johnny was the only thing he had ever loved.Three people were dead in one week. The toll this took on the remaining greasers was a phenomenal one, and they could only turn to each other for support. The strong friendship among them was the only thing that got them through. This book definitely got its message across that friendship can help you through almost anything, and the characters that portrayed this were excellent. I enjoyed this book very much, and I know others will too."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book is my FAVORITE BOOK IN THE WHOLE WORLD!!!!!!!!!! Im a mager reader and I have never seen a book like this one, it took me to the time and place in a miraculous way that no other book ever has.It left me with my mouth completly open in amazement, it made me cry, it made me laugh, but it also made me relize how hard life could be for people who never really had the chance to make it big or be sucsesful.I recamend it to all walks of life, its wondeful."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I initially read this book for the first time in high school in 1983, the same year the movie was released. I still have that copy, which has seen better days. I remember the story and the characters drawing me in from the start. It's a classic coming of age tale of kids from the wrong side of the tracks struggling to fit in and fighting against those who view them as outcasts. Not only do I find it a great read even as an adult, I feel it is as relevant today as when first published in 1967, showing that whether rich or poor, all teenagers are essentially the same, having the same concerns and fears and angst. The book speaks to kids in an unpatronizing fashion, and will continue to resonate with many long after they've turned the last page. After all, what kid hasn't been in Ponyboy's and his brothers' and friends' shoes at some point -- misunderstood and being put down simply for who they are, or aren't? I have no doubt those who have read and enjoyed The Outsiders, both kids and adults, will enjoy the other Hinton greats (That Was Then, This Is Now; Tex and Rumblefish), in addition to other troubled teen novels such as The Catcher in the Rye, The Amboy Dukes and American Odyssey."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"A boy named Ponyboy, and his two brothers, Sodapop and Derry, turn into hoodlums when their parents die in a car crash. They join a group of hoods: Johnny, 2-Bit, Steve and Dally. They are in a battle against the Socs, who are spoiled and very rich. The Socs always jump the hoods (Greasers) when they are alone. They all have parts to play: Dally is the tough guy, 2-Bit is known for his switchblade, Steve is known to mess around a lot, Sodapop comforts people, Johnny is the pet of the gang, and Ponyboy is the youngest at the age of fourteen. There are two other gangs of greasers.I really enjoyed this story because it is very graphic - there is a lot of violence and blood, and also it is very sad at points. It makes it so you cling to the book with excitement, and it also lets you understand it better because it has more detail. It also has a great plot and storyline. It is very well written and the author, S.E. Hinton, was only 16 when she started this great book. I think it would be great for eleven up, definitely NOT under ten, but if you are a teen and you've read any books like this, I strongly recommend this book for you."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I loved the action and the love that was shown in this book. It wasn't just a book about gangs, it showed love of family and love of friends."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I loved this book. Its harsh reality shows that no one person should be considered an outsider. Everyone who feels that they are the only one that feels things in a certain way, should come to realize that there are others who feel that way too. Even when the other person seems to come from a different world. I have read this book so many times that I've memorized the first and last line!!:)"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders The Outsiders by S. E. Hinton is about a boy named Ponyboy and his family. Ponyboy is the only one in his family who goes to school. His second oldest brother, Soda Pop, works at the gas station and his oldest brother, Darry, works with roofing tiles. Their parents died before the story begins. Ponyboy belongs to one of two main gangs in the area he lives in. His gang is called the Greasers and the other gang is called the Socials. The main conflict of this book involves Johnny and Ponyboy killing someone and running from the police. While running away from the police Johnny, Ponyboy, and Dally save some kids from a burning church. After they save the children they go to the hospital to check their injuries. Ponyboy has minor cuts and burns, Dally has minor cuts and burns and a broken arm, Johnny is hurt the worst. He has a broken back and is paralyzed from the waist down. While reading this book I learned that gangs stick together no matter what happens. The Outsiders is very interesting because it gives the reader an idea about the gang world. This book contains lots of detail about fighting and other interactions that happen in gangs. The unique feature about this book is that any type of family especially a poor family, can live in the same environment as the rest of us. This book will be interesting to people who want to know what gangs are like. The language used is very easy to understand, gang members don't have big vocabularies, so they keep the language simple. The characters are very believable because they act like people I know. The book's message is that it is never good to get into a fight even if you out number the enemy. This book is appropriate for our age (13-14)."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is a great book.

I enjoyed the controversy between the greasers and the socs. I found Ponyboy's personality very intriguing because he is very different at the beginning then he is at the end. The story of The Outsiders is very raw and true to what life was like in the small town of Tulsa, OK during the early 60s. It has appeal to young readers as well as older readers, the fact that the story deals with teenagers and is easy to follow is probably why the book is favored by so many age goups. The Outsiders will always be loved and treasured by all who read it."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders, by S.E. Hinton, shows that people from different communities are more alike then different. Ponyboy a greaser is ready to fight in order to support his fellow greasers, but when he gets in a fight, and his friend, Johnny kills a Soc, things get a bit complicated. After this Ponyboy goes through a chain of events that end up showing him that Soc's and Greaser's both think alike in some circumstances. I highly recommend this book because once you start reading you will not be able to stop. The book also keeps you hooked because of excitement found throughout it."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The outsiders, an amazing book, is one of my personal favorites. This book is unpredictable and well written, and causes your reaction to change throughout the book. Even though it's set in the past, it relates to today's world in many ways. There is a sequel to the book called, That Was Then This Is Now, that I wish to read in the near future.S.E. Hinton shows great talent while writing the book, particularly because she was only sixteen at the time she wrote it. I felt like the character as I read, as if I was walking in their shoes, and seeing what they saw. I was facing the problems they faced, and feeling what they felt. This truly amazing writer definitely got through to me, and touched me.As you read the book, it takes you on a roller coaster ride of emotion. Sometimes I was astonished and glad, sometimes shocked and sad. No matter which way I was feeling, it held my attention and kept me turning the pages.The story takes place in a city, with two very different sides of the town. There is the West Side and the East Side. The East Side is where the greasers live. They're hoods with no money, which are looked down on by people that are \\"better\\" than they are. Some wear hand-me-downs because they can't afford clothes. Most of them are dropouts that have a poor job and a pack of cigarettes handy. Almost everyone that isn't a greaser thinks that the greasers aren't well educated, and don't have any manners or are just plain rude. Ponyboy (Pony) Curtis, a greaser, is the main character. Darry Curtis, Sodapop (Soda) Curtis, Dally Winston, Johnny Cade, Two-Bit Matthews, and Steve, are also members of the greasers. Through the many difficult situations in the book, including deaths and murders, the greasers always stick together.On the other side of town, the West Side, the Socs are rich, stuck-up snobs. They're smart and don't have any problems (well, that's what all the greasers think). The Socs have as many problems as the greasers do, and are normal people like them. However, you'll find in the story that the greasers think they don't have any problems at all. The Socs own rich, fancy cars, such as the Mustang. The greasers and socs don't like each other at all. For fun, the socs \\"jump\\" the greasers.Pony, Soda and Darry live alone with out their parents who died in a car accident. They aren't forced to go to a boys' home, but if anything goes wrong, they will. Darry, the oldest, and Pony, the youngest, don't get along. Darry is responsible for Pony and Soda, though he takes out all his stress out on Pony. At one point in the book Darry gets furious and causes Pony's absence, creating a big scene that is central to the plot of the whole book.This extraordinary book relates to today's world in so many ways. This book definitely says that \\"you can't judge a book by it's cover\\" meaning that it's not what you do physically that counts the most, it's what kind of person you are on the inside.The Outsiders is an amazing, extraordinary, and fabulous book that I strongly recommend to other people."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders impressed me with it's honesty. This is a great book for young adults to read in the classsroom. There is action, drama, suspense and shocking situations. While we would never wish these situations on our young people I think it is important to expose them to the realities of other young people's lives in the world. The characters are believable and reliable. I found the sense of loyalty that is evident amongst the characters comendable and necesary, however misguided it is. It also gives us some idea of what life without the usual support systems can be like for a group of struggling young men. There is an inferred moral to the story and lessons to be learned using the language of young adults. This is a must add to the classroom reading list."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Pony was a Greaser,a lowlife gang.All Greasers hated the Socs,a snoby rich gang.But,one night things went to far,a Greaser went to killed a Soc.

Unless you have a gang of friends to stick up for you like Ponyboy. The Socs have always been cruel to the Greasers, which is what the what the people in Ponyboy's neighborhood are called.

I absolutely loved this book! It was amazing and the author did a great job on details. I never realized how bad it is in some parts of the world. This book made me realize that not everyone has a good home or decent parents- or even parents at all. This book taught me a lot and I will continue to re-read this book. The story was a little funny and it was REALLY SAD! But it was a GREAT book! If you don't believe me then read it yourself! I had doubts to this book before I read it but once I was in the middle of it I just couldn't stop reading! And I'm not a big fan of reading. In the past couple years I have only read about one book that wasn't required for school. And even if I never in my life will be required to read this book, I'll do it anyway because it is just a really enjoyable book to read. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone. I hope you buy it!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I read the Outsiders when I was 14 and since then I have often re read it, because of it's detail of friendship and loyalty that it gives to teens acrooss the nation.

It details the relationship of three brothers and their gang who are from \\"the wrong side of the tracks\\" and the upper crust \\"socs\\". While struggling to accept the events of one night, Ponyboy must over come certain issues in his life.

The upper class lives on the west side of town and the lower class lives on the east side of town. The upper class consists of socials who drive fancy cars and wear madras (plaid shirts) and ski jackets. The lower class is made up of greasers and hoods. They like old souped-up cars and wear T-shirts, blue jeans, leather jackets, and hair that's long dark and greasy.The main characters are Ponyboy and Johnny...I would recommend this book to everybody. I would definitely recommend this book to all my friends. People who like books with a lot of action that get off to a quick start will definitely like this book. I think the point that the author tried to get across is that it does not matter if you have all the money in the world or no money at all, people still have problems."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The book \\"The Outsiders\\" teaches many life lessons. It proves that social problems that occur today also occured in the 50s and 60s. The book also shows how times have changed. When was the last time you saw a bunch of teens living together that started smoking at the ripe age of 12 and get into fights? This is one of my favorite books. It was very realistic and once you start reading it you get hooked. Very addicting I GIVE IT 5 stars ! :)"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Hey guys! Well, if you are reading these reviews you've probably read The Outsiders or are thinking about reading it. This book was one of the best books, in fact it is the best book I've ever read. I had to read it as an English assignment. Well, like any student I didn't want to read it, so I was going to put it off as long as possible. I even let my friend borrow it for the weekend so I wouldn't have to read it. Well I got it back and I read the first chapter and I couldn't put it down after that. Its so realistic that it kinda scares me. I mean it went with the society back then and it stills goes with society today. Theres still the Soc vs. Greaser problem in todays society. They maybe labeled something different but dont you ever look around your school and notice it. Theres the rich clique, the popular group, and then theres the less fortunate people, the bad group. After reading this book I noticed it a lot more and started being nicer to the less fortunate people. This book teaches you alot and its very suspensful and well written. S.E. Hinton has a very unique style of writing and its very good. I'm glad I had to read this book as an English assignment, because I would have never read it by myself. I hope that all English teachers start making their students read it, because out of my english hour not one student disliked this book. The way the characters act are also unique. There's Ponyboy, the sensitive one. Johnny, the quiet one. Darry, the big strong one. Two-bit, the talkative one.Dally, the troubled one. Sodapop, the one who understands everyone. Steve, Soda's best bud. Ok, Ive babbled on a long time....Just read the book and you'll see how great it is! Its the best book ever! May I also suggest reading S.E. Hinton's other books, That was then this is now, Tex, The Puppy Sister, Taming the Star Runner, and Rumble fish. If you've read the Outsiders book you should also check out the movie. Its great and Dally's hott! Two bit and Sodapop are hot too..but yeah, you get my point. The movie doesn't go in depth as the book though."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"this book was such a good book it was intesting i really injojed"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"According to The Outsiders there were two kinds of people, Socs and greasers. The Socs are considered high-class and had cars, whereas the greasers were low-class and had no cars. It wasn&#65533;t just money separating them but their different set of values. The greasers were more emotional and to the Socs nothing was real to them. So the only thing that was between the two was feelings. All of the characters were different in their own way, but came from the same social background. This book really brings out the negative effects of the social classes. As you read on, this book presents violence, girls, and even murder. Out of all, my favorite character is Dallas.I could relate to Darry, Ponyboy's older brother. Everyday I am hard and strict with my younger brothers as well. On weekdays everyone has to do their homework together and can't do anything else, until done. So we can't come home and go straight to the television. We can maybe get something to eat, but after that, get our work done. Since I am the oldest, I have it worst because if I don't get the job done and set an example, everything will fall apart, and it will be my fault. My little brothers answers to me, and I have to answer to my father. So basically everyone has a job to do and has someone to answer to.I enjoyed the story because it&#65533;s about young teens, like myself. The best part of the book is the rumble. All guys from different gangs fighting to represent themselves and to show they will stick up for each other as well as themselves. The part that wasn't interesting was when Johnny and Pony were at the church for the first time. No action occurred, so I wasn't pleased. In any case, I wouldn't change anything about the book because everything went together like a puzzle.I recommend this book to everyone especially young teens. It's a good story about gangs, unity, and especially fighting. I think it can teach a lot of kids to enjoy reading. Even though it is a great book written by a woman, I think guys would be more interested, but I think everyone should read it."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Ponyboy Curtis lives his life day-to-day one step at a time. He lives in the poor part of the city and cannot afford to spend much time thinking and planning for the future. His brothers were forced to drop out of high school following their parents' deaths. The brothers now have to work to support themselves and Ponyboy. Ponyboy has to be on the lookout for the Socs, a vicious gang of rich kids whose idea of a good time is beating up \\"greasers\\" like him. One night, Ponyboy and his friend Johnny are jumped by Socs and have to fight to defend themselves. The leader of the group of Socs ends up dead, forcing Ponyboy and Johnny to run away to the country. One problem leads to the next for Ponyboy. He now has to change his physical appearance and loose his most valued possession, his famed hair. The two friends keep a low profile to avoid being found out and turned into the authorities.After returning from a local diner, Ponyboy and Johnny find their place of refuge in flames. To make matters worse, there are children trapped inside the burning building. Ponyboy and Johnny rush inside to save the kids. They succeed in their rescue efforts, but they themselves are burnt and badly injured. The ever-grateful parents of the children take them to the hospital. Ponyboy and Johnny are forgiven for their crime, since it was committed in self-defense, and pronounced heroes.Ponyboy is my favorite character from the book. He struggles the most and is also the most objective viewer. I can relate to Ponyboy. He wants to be different from the people that surround him, and he tries to use his head to solve problems. I have also tried to use my head when faced with difficult situations. It is not easy to avoid physical force, but there is a greater satisfaction when thinking is used as a solution to a problem.I like this book very much. It has an excellent plot with great characters. My favorite part of the book is when Ponyboy recalls his first mass. I thought it was funny when he described his friend Two-Bit's actions. This was also Two-Bit's first mass and he didn't know how to react. Two-Bit always tried to get the last laugh or have the last say in things. The way he acted was very funny.I highly recommend this book to everyone. A person between the ages of 14 and maybe 60 will be able to get the most out of the story. People who like the culture of the 1950's and early 60's will really enjoy the book since it was written recalling that period in U.S. history."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This is the best book ever! I love this book! You can really understand every body! Like Ponyboy is very understanding i love him the most of all the greasers and socs!!!!!!!!!!! If you think about buying this book, do ,because this is the book ever written!!!!!!!!! And the thing is I hate to read."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I really Injoyed this book It really did place a picture in my head. Althoght it was really sad there was plenty of action,and those are the book I like. Out of the books i read the had to be the best. Ithink I would like to live the life of Ponyboy (expet the part of my friends dieing)."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"(...)\\"Things are ruff all over\\" Cherry Valence once said. If you are interested in youth rivalry then this is a must read. It's not just about rivalry it's also about loving and caring for your friends and family. The Outsiders is a haunting story.The Greasers are poor and greasy. The Socs are the rich kids, the ones with all the breaks. The Socs idea of a good time is beer blast and jumping Greasers. The Curtis brothers' parents have just died and Darry the oldest is a carpenter. Sodapop the middle brother is a dropout and Ponyboy the youngest is still in high school. Also the problem is that one night someone takes things too far.Ponyboy is quiet like Johnny. Ponyboy likes books and movies. Darry says Ponyboy doesn't ever think. The Outsiders trapped me and I am certain it will trap you. I would recommend yhis to to anyone who liked Rumble fish."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I read the book the outsiders by S.E. Hinton. This book was great it was about three brothers growing up poor and orphans. The main Characters in this story are Pony boy the youngest brother, Jonny a friend of pony boys, Darry oldest brother, Soda middle brother, and Dally gang leader. All of these guys are in this gang called the greasers, and they were poor kids. They always had a problem with this other gang called the Socs who were the rich boy. One time Pony boy and Jonny fought to of the Socs and Jonny ended up stabbing and killing one of the Socs. So then the boys leave town and run to some abandon church where they stay until it is burnt down. Jonny ends up dieing in the fire. Jonny's death teaches Pony boy that he needs to get his life in shape and be good. My favorite character was Pony boy because he is the one who changes the most in this book.I can relate to Pony boy because we both had major problems in school, but at the end we had someone to point us in the right direction. I kno exactly how Pony boy felt when he lost his brother because I have lost a couple people who are very close to me.I liked this book very much. It had great action and adventure. One of my favorite parts about this book was when the two gangs met at the end for a huge fight and the greasers won. If I could change anything about this book I would have made Pony boy not so much of a wimp because I mean he did grow up with his two rebel brothers. I would recommend this book to anyone because it is truly that great of a book. If you are a person that likes action and adventure then I extremely advise you to go pick this book up because you will never lay it down."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders by S.E Hinton is a must read for anyone of all ages.It describes the many conflicts between gangs, social groups, family violence, and friends.The socs a gang of rich kids whode idea of a good time is beating up the greasers.The greasers are known as the poor kids whose only pride comes from their greasy hair.Ponyboy is a greaser and proud of it and is even willing to risk his life in a rumple to show his pride of his gang.Untill one night things get taken to far and even is resloved in a murder.Every emotion is very sicere and well portrayed and not a detail is left out.Even though it expresses the many sad parts of life in the city, it gives a message that there can be hope and there is hope for those who have not lost the fight yet.This is an amazing novel one that will forever have a special place in my heart."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders, written by S.E. Hinton, is about a 14-years-old boy named Ponyboy. Ponyboy lived in the east side of a large, unnamed town only with his brothers because his parents died from the car accident. His brothers, Darry and Sodapop, were members of the greasers same as Ponyboy. Dallas, Johnny, Two-Bit Mathews, and Steve were the other members of the gang. They had rivals, Socs, who were richer, and educated than the greasers. Johnny, who was Ponyboy's buddy, killed one of the Socs by self-defense because they tried to torture Ponyboy and him. Johnny and Ponyboy ran away to hide from cops, and saved little kids from the fire. They became heroes, but Johnny died because he got hurt really bad.I read the book for hours and hours when I started to read for first time. I could not stop reading! This book is not like the other books about fairy-tale or good life characters. The Outsiders shows readers about the different life than the readers may have, and some actions of doing bad things and good things. I recommend this book to the readers who like actions and adventures. The book that became my number one favorite book, The Outsiders, is not very difficult to read, so everyone can read without the pressure of not knowing what is happening in the book. The best parts of this book are when Ponyboy and Johnny spent few days in the hiding place, and when they saved the kids. I like the saving part because it shows the readers that they are not bad boys even though they do some bad things, and smoke. I choose The Outsiders for the assignment because one of my friends suggested this book for really good book and I heard from many other people saying that this book is fantastic. I hope many other people will read this book and understand what \\"Stay gold\\" means."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I read The Outsiders written by S.E. Hinton. I enjoyed this book. This isn't my favorite book, but I would recommend it to teenagers and young adults because it has adventure and excitement, and I don't think there is any way that someone could not like the characters. It has so much anticipation. For instance, when Ponyboy is walking home from the movies, he notices a car following him. Socs get out of the car and jump him.The Outsiders is about a boy named PonyBoy Curtis that grew up on the wrong side of town. He is part of a gang, the greasers. One of the members is Johnny Cade, Ponyboy's best friend. One night, Ponyboy and Johhny were walking in the city park in the morning when some socs, their rival gang, tryed to jump them and tryed to drown Ponyboy. Johnny gots up and stabbed Bob, a soc, and he died. So they then decided that they needed a hide out. They heard about this place from Dallas Winston, another member of the greasers. There is a hideout in an abandoned church where Ponyboy and Johnny hid there for 5 days. Dallas cames to visit and took them to some place for a little food. While they were eating, Johnny explained to Dallas that he wanted to go back home and turn themselves in. On their way back, they realized that some kids were playing around in the church and it accidentally set ablaze. Ponyboy and Johnny ran into save the kids. When all the kids were out, they tried to escape but when Ponyboy got out, John tried to follow suitt but the ceiling started to collapse. It fell on Johnny. Was the collapse fatal? Will Ponyboy and Johnny get arrested for killing bob? Read this book and you will soon find out.I would recommend this book to teenagers and young adults that enjoy adventure and heartbreak."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"In The Outsiders, there are two gangs.

They were all very good but the best of course was the book. It hits home to teens and shows us that people do understand groups and cliqes. And it showes us to stay gold. That is very important. The is extremely entertaining and relates to us in many ways. Any person who is thinking about buying The Outsiders Do it!!! It is well worth your money!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The book The Outsiders should not be underestimated by how it looks. This book is really easy to get into and I've found it to be very interesting. This on going plot has scenes about action, a little bit of romance and a lot of sentimental family values.S.E Hinton describes the characters so perfectly so that you can get an exact picture in your mind. Thought the main plot of this book happens over a short period of time, it is so detailed and full of adventureThe narrator of this book is the main character Pony Boy Curtis. He gets comments on his name because it sounds more like a nickname. Ponyboy is a 14 year old boy who lives with his two older brothers Darry and Sodapop Curtis. The eldest of the two was Darry. He looked over his younger brothers since he was stronger and the wisest. The second eldest was Sodapop. He kind of looked out for mainly Ponyboy too and usually stayed on his side when he and Darry got into arguments. Sodapop was a high school dropout because he had to help Darry with the bills because their parents got into a car accident a while back so Soda works long hours in a auto body shop. The Greasers (Which they call themselves) had a family outside of their own like Johnny and Two Bitt. The greasers got their name because they usually wore a lot of hair gel and they live on the east side of town which the poorer side.The Soc's, which are the total opposite of the greasers, live on the west side of town. They are mainly upper class rich kids that cause a lot of destruction and like to get into fight with the Greasers throughout the book.Don't equate the cover of the book with the quality because the book reads much better than the cover looks. This book really proves that you can't judge a book by its cover."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is a look into a world of gangs and violence though the true meaning of the book is about heros and friends that stick together through everything. I recommend this book to someone who likes to read about action and suspense. Throughout the book there are many fights between two gangs which makes the book exciting. One fault with the book is the many characters who seem to have similar names. This makes the book far to confusing. Altogether though, the book shows you how to be a true hero and how to keep friendships even through hard times."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book could be one of the better books that I have read in my career as a reader. If you like stories of heros and hardships than you will love this book. This book tells an epic story of some kids living in the hood, and their troubles with life. They are constantly put down, and disregarded as inferior because of their name, GREASERS. Get to know these kids and you'll love this book."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Have you ever noticed that there are always those loved, perfect people, and yet there has to be those so called disguisting things that for some odd reason have to exsist, well, that is who S. E. Hinton likes to consider the \\"outsiders.\\" As these group of people face some hard times throughout the past everything seems to go down hill once again. It's a hard life being a teen, but whoever really thought it to be this difficult just to survive. This book is filled with sorrow yet the perfect setting to help you with life.

Ponyboy said that there are two kinds of people,greasers and socs.

I would recommend this book to people who are ages 11 and up and people who love reading about life so, in other words everyone should read this book. The book is about two very different kinds of teenagers and there nightmare of violence. In this book two boys named Ponyboy and Johnny who get into some trouble some bad trouble like killing someone not just anyone but a soc-Bob. Soon a riot begins between the greasers-a rough, tough gang with long greasy haired boys from the wrong side of the tracks, and the soc's- the rich kids with all the breaks. I think this book will make a difference to anyone that reads it. You can relate to the characters which is great and it shows that no-matter how different people may seem they really are simular and can be going through the samethings.

I recommend it, if you don't have to read this book for school, ask your teacher if you can, or go to the library and get it. By the way, watch the movie, that's also one of the best movies I've ever seen (Ponyboy looks good as a blonde or as a brunette)"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Even though that this book was about gangs, it was still very emotional.

If you don't like to read much, then make this one of the few that you *do* read. I guarantee that you won't be able to put it down. Don't get the movie out first - read the book. The movie doesn't explain about the relationships between the brothers the way that the book does - and since this is the basis of the book, then it kind of misses the point. Don't get me wrong - it's still a good movie, but then since it's based on this, then it could hardly fail - especially with the cast that it has!! Patrick Swayze, Tom Cruise (pre caps), C Thomas Howell, Ralph Macchio... The list goes on...Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I read this book in a day! It is so good and so hard to put down.

If you do, the book \\"THE OUTSIDERS\\" by S.E.Hinton is for you. Well the fights are good but I also like other things. One other thing I like is the characters. The main characters are Ponyboy and Johnny. Ponyboy is fourteen years old. He is tough and confused but also sensitive. Johnny is the youngest of the GREASERS. The other characters are Two-Bit Mathews, Steve Randel, Sodapop, Dallas, Darrry, and a girl named Cherry they met at the thearter. This book is about the GREASERS who dislike the socials, and Ponyboy's best friend killing a social. It's a nightmare of violence. This is a good book, so go read it."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"After reading the book, The Outsiders I have noticed a few little things that make this particular story interesting. Although, it is hard for me to relate to this book mainly bacause I have yet to experience some of the things in the book. For example, being in a gang, gettting involved in gang fights, and having your parents die in a car accident.Ponyboy Curtis is the main character and also the narrator of the story. Ponyoby belongs to a group of low-class kids in Oklahoma who call themselves the Greasers, because they all have greasy long hair. Their rivals are the Socs, which is short for socials. The Socs and the Greasers are always picking fights with each other's group and there is never any peace.Some of the other main characters in the story include Sodapop who is a charming high-school dropout, Darry who is Ponyboys oldest brother and who has taken care of him since his parents died in a car accident. The rest of the crew is Johnny, and Dally who has a long criminal record, Steve who is Sodapop's best friend and last but not least there is Two-Bit, the oldest and funniest group member.My favorite part of the book was when Ponyoby realizes that he has to make up with Dally and change his lifestyle. The worst part of the book to me was when Johnny dies. Johnny was a real close friend to Ponyboy and would never did a thing to hurt anyone. I cannot really relate to anyone in this book but if I had to I think it would be Johnny, because I see myself as a pretty good friend.After reading the book, The Outsiders, I have realized how good of a book it was. I would recommend this book to any one who is a teenager and who also likes the story line of a book like \\"West Side Story\\" because these two books are similar in many ways. In the book The Outsiders, my favorite character was Ponyboy. Ponyboy Curtis was my favorite character because you could watch him develop over the entire book from a fighter, to a kid who has seen too many people who he loved die during his young life. His many experiences have made him realize that life is too short and enjoy it while you can."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"S.E. Hinton's novel The Outsiders is one of the best books I have ever read. This is one of Hinton's many novels. It is fictional story about a boy named Ponyboy, his brothers, and his fellow buddies. Ponyboy is 14 years old and is trying to make it in the life he has to live. Ponyboy and his fellow greasers (friends) have run-ins with the socs (rich kids from the west side). There are many chains of events that lead up to three boys dead and Ponyboy confused.S.E. Hinton is a magnificent writer, and she was only 16 when she wrote this story. All the words flow together so perfectly. Hinton is a smart, funny, and serious writer. She shows the rough tuff sides to a gang, and also the sensitive side.Hinton didn't really go into the description to the town as much as the characters. I like that about her. With her writing she makes you feel like you are pulled into the story. The characters seem so real. All the characters have a rough side, and some have a softer side too. Ponyboy, Johnny Ponyboy's best friend, Soda his brother, and well everyone except for Dally who was first jailed when he was 10. This book goes into their feelings just not their thoughts.I would recomend this book to anyone from 8th grade through high school students. This book touches anyone from ages 14-20, and I think anyone will have a great time reading this book. If I had to recomend a book to someone I would tell them to read The Outsiders. This book is the best one I've read and probably will read by far. I laughed, got watery eyes, and could not put this book down. Once you start reading you won't be able to put it down either, so what are you waiting for."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is about a boy named Ponyboy curtis and his brothers Darry and Sodapop. Their parents died form a car crash, a couple of years ago, so Darry the oldest brother and Sodapop the Middle child take care of eachother. This is a very good book, and it teaches you alot about life and family.Ponyboy is a greaser, and he's always been proud of it, even willing to rumble against a gang of socs for the sake of his fellow greasers--until one terrible night when his friend Johnny kills a soc, they find themselves running from the cops and disguiseing themselves."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders, a fiction story by S.E. Hinton, is a novel with feuding rivalry between two gangs in a town throughout the story. \\"The Greasers\\", the tough guys from the east side of town who always need to watch their backs, and the \\"Socs\\", short for \\"socials\\", the preppy rich boys from the west side of town. The narrator and main character of the novel is a 14-year-old who lives with his two older brothers, Soda and Darry. His name is Ponyboy. Ponyboy lives under strict rule of his brothers, and is always paranoid of getting jumped by a soc. There are seven other greasers who are considered brothers of Ponyboy. They all watch out for each other throughout the story and through the feuding with the Socs.I recommend this book to anyone who likes adventures and friendship. S.E. Hinton made this book very easy to read and comprehend by using simple vocabulary to describe intense situations. My favorite part of the book is when Ponyboy is jumped by the Socs in the beginning because it is an exciting scene and makes it really easy for you to get into the book early."}]`),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},A={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],D={key:0},j={key:1};function J(s,o,n,u,r,i){const y=c("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",A,[(e(!0),t(w,null,b(i.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(e(),f(y,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",j,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",D,"See more"))],8,H)):m("",!0)])}const B=d(E,[["render",J],["__scopeId","data-v-3d50c123"]]),C=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/22.md","filePath":"quotesmag/22.md"}'),W={name:"quotesmag/22.md"},q=Object.assign(W,{setup(s){return(o,n)=>(e(),t("div",null,[p(B)]))}});export{C as __pageData,q as default};
