Genesis Force is a bit darker than most Star Trek novels. It starts with a hellish scene of Worf leading Klingons in a rescue effort on a planet about to be struck by the genesis wave and the panic that has set in. We switch scenes to the planet of Aluwna. The remainder of the book tells the story of the effect of the genesis wave on the planet and the rescue and return of some of the citizens of that planet.

He separates the verses and the individual phrases within the verses to make his comments easy to follow and ideal for quick reference. The print is small, so there's a great deal of information on each page. Poole does a good job of referencing some of the other verses that pertain to a passage's particular subject matter. And the language is actually somewhat easy to read when compared with some of the other older commentaries.One of the things I am especially pleased with is that, in some cases, he gives various interpretations of a word's meaning or sometimes even the whole point that is intended. It's not that he's swaying in his understanding. It seems to be a simple acknowledgement of uncertainty. So instead of guessing, as some do, he communicates the different perspectives. And often he will let the reader know to which interpretation he leans.The only drawback is his comments sometimes lack enough detail. Anyone like me, who not only wants to know what it means but why, better be prepared to do the research if this is important. Poole doesn't always explain how he arrived at a particular understanding and he doesn't give a great deal of historical data either. But in researching these things myself, I generally find Poole to be on target with what I'm able to conclude.In my opinion, either Matthew Poole or Matthew Henry is the first commentary set a student should consider, depending on preference. Both cover the whole Bible. Both are very handsome sets of books (unless you purchase the Matthew Henry commentary in one book). And most importantly both are the scholarly works of men who have a passion for God's word. However, I slightly favor Poole's comments simply because they're an easier read."},{"Title":"Matthew Poole's Commentary on the Holy Bible - Set","review":"I recommend this work because 1) The excellent use of the scriptures themselves and not suspect outside sorces to illuminate verses and passages (i.e. He uses scripture to explain scripture - not a bunch of liberal PhD's ideas on what the Bible \\"might\\" say!) 2) Very vigorous and classic 17th Century prose is used througout the work. This commentary was published in the 1680's and still has marks of the quality of scholarship that produced the KJV. It is as engaging as reading Edward Gibbon. 3) It is printed with the Holy Text and the notes combined and negates the need to keep switching from a Bible back to the notes. These three factors themselves are the best reasons to purchase this work I can give you. Also you will not find it any cheaper that here at Amazon[.com].

Suffice it to say that I do not preach, teach, or write on the Scriptures without first consulting these volumes. He is a first-rate scholar and theologian, who wrote with an attentive eye to detail, history, typology, and a pastor's heart for practical application.The great British Reformed Baptist pastor Charles Spurgeon, when asked what commentary he would select if could have only one, responded that, since he had read Matthew Henry's expositions so thoroughly, he would pick Poole. Praise doesn't come much higher than that endorsement.While you can easily find Poole for free through various biblical study software programs, I have loved having the volumes in print as well.

This nineteenth century preacher was the most prominent leader in a movement of Back-to-the-Bible Christians. The Disciples of Christ and Churches of Christ are modern churches with roots in the Restoration Movement, an attempt to restore New Testament Christianity today. His impact on frontier American Christianity is often overlooked or ignored. This novel does great justice to the man and the ideas of this preacher!

With the world so fractured, so extreme, to read of one man's thoughtful spiritual search for truth is, well...refreshing. When someone not only puts rancor and hard feelings aside, but also teaches many of us to do so, we owe him a debt of gratitude.A. Campbell has been villified and misunderstood because of his movement, often called a 'Restoration' movement. The only minister asked to address a joint session of Congress, this singular thinker was a genius that Ireland, Scotland, and America could claim. America has the better claim, however, because he lit the clerical world on fire, and taught feisty frontiersmen how to drop their sectarian pasts and to read for themselves...to think for themselves. Campbell was Presbyterian, Baptist, and finally, an independent Christian leader. Campbell was admired by the ladies, feared by his opponents, and a leader against black slavery.Personally...I despise conflict, particularly the religious back and forth of sectarianism. I found myself rooting for this brash young Irishman in Virginia, daring to upset convention, and yet rising above pettiness while doing it...mostly.

While we don't get to that point during the book (whose timeframe begins with the Titanic and doesn't extend much past the Rising), we do see the birth of the 20th century Republican movement.If you're interested in the history of the times, the difference between this and a history book is sort of like the difference between a small-plane overflight and a walkabout on the actual ground. You don't see as much of the forest, but you see the trees very well, and that of course is the focus of the book. It's very outspokenly feminist (whether that's a positive or negative probably depends on your personal views). The use of contemporary headlines at the ends of chapters is a masterful touch that keeps the story in context; too bad some chapters have them and some don't.I did have some trouble imagining the main character as a credible human being, what with his propensity for always landing right in the midst of the action. For someone who's supposed to be so intelligent, he isn't especially introspective and doesn't really appear to foresee any consequences to his actions. Can't help but like him, though. The pace of action is generally pretty good even where the writing isn't that creative.The epitome of a mixed review: if you like its strengths, you'll like it.

As a student of history, particularly Irish history, I had read the historic facts from several different angles and sources, yet the author still found ways to surprise me. The story, woven through the deeply personal passages of main characters including a survivor of the Titanic tragedy, adds a focused, personal perspective on a very heroic, yet ultimately terrible tragedy of hope and loss. Yet, contained in the withered stalk of defeat is the living seed that will, in just a very few years' time, finally leave Ireland a free nation again.Ringing with the authenticity her work is known for, Ms. Llywellyn teaches us both the glory of the heroes struggle as much as the inhumanity and terror hiding in the shadows and the indifference residing in Dublin Castle.

At the risk of being label a sexist, for that very reason I rarely buy a book written by a woman and probably wouldn't have bought this one if I realized the author was a woman. In addition to the romantic content there was another technique that irritated me, but it was necessary to make the romantic angle work. Namely, the book contained way too many coincidentally meetings of people. People seemed to be tripping over people they knew everywhere they went.I'm of mixed minds about whether or not I'll buy the sequels to this book.

I'd give the novel about three stars but the history is worth a solid five."},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"In 1916 Morgan Llywelyn provides us with a rousing view of the Irish uprising of 1916. Llywelyn's novel is historical fiction with emphasis upon the fiction. Morgan's characters are fresh and real and she relates the events leading to the uprising from multiple perspectives. I do recommend this novel, but it is not her best.1916 centers upon the life of Edward Joseph (Ned) Halloran, a poor boy from county Clare, who loses both of his parents on the Titanic. His relatives enroll him in an Irish school in Dublin, which provides the opportunity for an education and access to numerous Irish revolutionary leaders. The fictional character, Ned, becomes the vehicle by which Llywelyn provides a view into the activities of the Irish nationalistic movement.Beginning with his schooling, Ned encounters most of the vital characters of the Irish independence. He becomes close friends of many of the key persons. So we meet, and come to know major figures in Irish history such as: Padraic Pearse, Thomas Clarke, Thomas MacDonagh, and Joseph Plunkett. We gain an acquaintanceship with James Connolly, Eamonn Ceannt, Eamon de Valera, and Constance Markievicz. After reading 1916, these heroes of Irish history are now friends.This is a detailed historical approach. 1916 has vivid battle scenes, reveals intimate relationships of friends, and pictures the grief and oppression of poverty. Llywelyn presents many significant details of daily living so that we may understand the society of Dublin and Ireland. Through Ned's activities we learn the Irish culture and the seeds of resistance to Great Britain. With Ned's help we come to dislike the English military, and the political domination of Ireland. With Ned we begin to understand the deprivation of imperialism upon the people.Unfortunately, the great emphasis upon Ned, his sister, and his girlfriend, detract from the novel. The sinking of the Titanic, an affair between a fictional priest and a fictional lady, and Ned's growing love for a prostitute, were unnecessary distractions. At 521 pages this is a lengthy book. I believe the story would be better told through the eyes of an impartial observer, like a newspaper reporter. To me this would put the emphasis upon the historical characters and events, which need no enhancement.I have read two other books by Morgan Llywelyn (Bard, Red Branch), this is not her best.

While I am glad to have learned something about the events depicted, I felt that the presentation was substandard.

The biggest single problem with 1916 is in the loose characterization. For instance, the protagonist, a fifteen year old Irish boy, is privy to insights into human nature that most very mature adults have no clue about. At one point, Llywelyn states that Ned (the boy) cringes each time he sees a particular character because he senses that the brightest candles burn out the quickest. This thought is occurring to a lad who just months before was daydreaming of pirtates attacking the cruise ship he was on. Oh yeah, did I mention that the ship was named the Titanic? If not for the gross inaccuracies in character response and interaction this novel may have been enjoyable as well as informative."},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"Never have I been so bored by a novel set in Ireland.

I am now reading the second in this series (I was very happy to learn that there are two more books beyond 1916!) and will be bringing the last in the series with me when I travel to Ireland next month!

In any event, she is thoroughly Irish (or Irish-American)(or as Welsh as her name). Her love of history came early, when her mother encouraged her to explore her Llywelyn roots. This exploration made her a modern reinterpreter of the old Celtic legends which she presents in the form of novels. Prolific, she has written more than a score of books in that many years.Given the length of most of her works, her imagination is clearly protean. The quality of her output is unsurprisingly uneven, to be objectively critical. You can't have a winner every time, especially at that pace. I've liked many of her books, but disliked others.InThe Horse Goddesswe meet the ancient Celts of the Iron Age Hallstatt Era. InDruidswe are witness to the downfall of the Gauls in the face of Roman imperialism. InBardwe view an unspoiled Ireland first being colonized by the Celtiberians. InRed Branchwe are presented with a readable retelling of the Ulster Cycle legends.As the story opens here, we meet young Ned Halloran as he embarks as a second class passenger on the TITANIC, not to emigrate, but to visit his sister in New York. To be brutally honest, this contrived opening made me roll my eyes. I put this novel back on my shelf at that point, where it gathered dust for eleven (!) years. When I finally did pick it up again, I read it straight through, which should say something about the story.Upon returning to Ireland, Ned is enrolled at St. Enda's School For Boys, an alternative school headmastered by Patrick Henry Pearse, poet, lawyer, educator, Irish nationalist and visionary idealist. Like his American namesake, Patrick Henry Pearse believed that the only alternative to liberty is death. St. Enda's was his ground for preparing the future leadership of Ireland. The boys are given an excellent classical education, leavened with sport, Irish history, and compulsory use of the Irish language.Llywelyn does a nonpareil job of bringing her fictional character of Ned Halloran into contact with the historical Pearse, and through Pearse we are introduced to other Irish Republicans. Thus, our Ned is a front row observer of the birth pangs of the Irish nation.Just as Ned graduates St. Enda's and begins a career as a journalist, Ireland is granted Home Rule, but this right is suspended indefinitely for political reasons. It is at this point that the Irish leaders begin to plan a Rising.Pearse calls it \\"a conspiracy of poets.\\" It is. Most of the leaders of the Rising are artists, musicians and writers (Ireland abounds in great literary figures). Some are working class organizers. Few are militants or have any military training. Yet, this small band took and held central Dublin, Wexford, and other towns against overwhelming British military might for six days. Their Proclamation of Irish Independence remains a stirring read. Pearse is appointed as President of the Provisional Government. In Llywelyn's Dublin, Ned Halloran becomes his personal courier.It's important to point out (as Llywelyn does, without malice), that the leadership of the Rising made several disastrous mistakes along the way:First, the heads of the Provisional Government badly overestimated the general Irish sentiment against Great Britain and for complete independence in that era. Once the Rising began, Pearse, Connolly and the other leaders discovered that they could not count upon what they anticipated as a popular groundswell of support for the Republic. Most Irishmen would have been content (at that point) to remain in the U.K., albeit with Dominion status and Home Rule. Llywelyn is a rock-ribbed Irish Republican, but she does not shy away from recounting the fact that many Irish jeered Pearse (or worse yet, ignored him utterly). Given that the Great British Empire was at war with Germany, most Irish were content to defer Home Rule until the enemy was defeated. In the event, the Irish had to fight for the right to govern themselves after the war anyway; the leaders of the Rising were prescient in that regard.Second, the Republican leadership failed to recognize that so many young Irish boys had enlisted/been conscripted into the British Army by 1916 that any attack on British forces would necessarily been seen as disloyal, a betrayal of \\"our boys at the front.\\" Given the extent of the bloodletting on the \\"green fields of France,\\" the last thing most people wanted was a fraternal bloodletting on their front steps. The timing of the Rising, then, could hardly have been worse.Third, the Republicans were woefully unprepared. Their war plans were ill-considered and amateurish. They did little to protect themselves from infiltration. Communications broke down. Orders were conflicting and confusing. The Rising was first cancelled on Easter Sunday, (and then at the last moment only postponed to Easter Monday), causing many otherwise ready supporters to have stood themselves down. By the time the situation clarified itself, the element of surprise was lost and these troops never came into action. The Republicans established their Capitol in the Dublin General Post Office. They seized only a few well-defended strong points. They did not take control of essential service points like the Telephone Exchange and Dublin Castle. Control of these service points allowed the British Imperial Government to summon help from beyond inner Dublin.Fourth, the Republican decision to acquire arms from Germany, while pragmatically necessary (no Allied nation would have sold them arms in 1916, and the possibility of importing them from America was fraught with too many difficulties to be practical), put the Republican movement squarely in the enemy camp with the Central Powers, alienating many (Irish, English, American or Allied) who otherwise would have been supportive of Irish aspirations. They were seen by their natural friends and allies as treasonous and seditious toward the Allied cause. Admittedly, some Irish leaders did see themselves as pro-German. The decision to use German arms was in fact the catalyst for the terrible personal consequences which afterward befell the Irish leadership of the Rising, no matter their individual political views.Nevertheless, Llywelyn does underscore that ultimately the British seized defeat from the jaws of victory:First, although the Republicans numbered only a few thousand throughout Ireland, the British military treated all Irish as disloyal, opening fire on noncombatant men, women, and children, causing unnecessary deaths. This created anti-British, pro-Republican sentiment.Second, although the Republicans held only a few strong points in Dublin, the British artillery barrage of the city was indiscriminate, destroying swaths of Dublin and killing hundreds who had not even left their homes or places of employ. Again, this created pro-Republican, anti-British sentiment.Third, the post-Rising crackdown disrupted the lives of thousands of uninvolved persons, whether through mass arrests or property seizures or gratuitous brutality. Yet again this created pro-Republican, anti-British sentiment.Fourth, the British authorities gave broad legitimacy to and made noble the otherwise-marginal Republican leadership by quickly arresting them, trying them in secret Courts Martial, and shooting them summarily within days. There was no \\"typical\\" British sense of fairness or justice extended to them, no legal due process provided to them, no constitutional protections invoked for them, and no appeals procedures made available to them. The actions of the British military command highlighted what the Republicans had been saying all along, that the rights of Englishmen were restricted only to Englishmen and that the Irish were treated as a colonial people, and worse yet. By putting 67 men (including Pearse) before the firing squad, the British did nothing more than create a mass of martyrs for the Republican cause. British \\"kindness\\" to James Connolly, allowing the sick, wounded man to be shot in a seated position, was seen as a form of mockery; their decision to commute the death sentence of Countess Markievicz was seen as patronizing (Markievicz herself was outraged, and insisted that she be shot, but her demands were ignored). The British refusal to allow last visitors or letters was seen as an act of gleeful cruelty. The venial treatment of the bodies after death (dissolving them in quicklime) enraged decent people everywhere. The fact that the rest of the Republicans were pardoned in a General Amnesty of 1917 only seemed to prove that the initial British reaction was irrational (and indeed the commanding General in Dublin was later sacked by Downing Street, but only long after the fact).By dying for Ireland at the hands of the British, Pearse and his fellows created the critical mass necessary for the independence movement to coalesce; while there were no further outright rebellions for the duration of the Great War, the Republican movement percolated, finally reemerging in 1919. Though most historians consider the Irish War of Independence to have started at that point, the Easter Rising truly was the first battle of that war.By mildly fictionalizing history, Llywelyn allows us to get inside the story of the Easter Rising of 1916. This is the first novel I have read that has endnotes, and many of the characters' quotes are their actual words, either spoken or written. This is masterful historical fiction.This is the first volume in what became Morgan Llwelyn's \\"Irish Century\\" series which consists of1916: A Novel of the Irish Rebellion,1921: The Great Novel of the Irish Civil War,1949: A Novel of the Irish Free State,1972: A Novel of Ireland's Unfinished Revolution, and1999: A Novel of the Celtic Tiger and the Search for Peace, all critical points in modern Ireland's history, and all seen through the eyes of the Halloran family."},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"I have read a lot of Irish history,have visited Ireland 3 times and never cease to be amazed at the character and resilience of the culture and history of the people of this great country.Ireland had a great culture and people long before England invaded over 800 years ago and has survived and even advanced to an amazing degree;despite all the cruelty and evil that England has imposed on her in an attempt to bring her into submission.Many books have been written about Ireland and particularly rebellions against England.Ireland was the first country that England took over in building her Empire and it appears that it will be the last country that she has been finally kicked out of.Little wonder, after the brutality that England has imposed on Ireland for all these years,the Union Jack is referred to as \\"The Butcher's Apron\\".Morgan Llywelyn is an excellent historical novelist,and has covered the history of Ireland in 5 novels;beginning with this one leading up to and about the Easter Rebellion in \\"1916\\",followed by the Civil War in \\"1921\\",the founding of the Irish Republicin i \\"1949\\",the horrors of Bloody Sunday in \\"1972\\",and the latest \\"1999\\",a novel of the Celtic Tiger and the Search for Peace.She needs to write at least one more when all of the Island becomes \\"A Nation Once Again\\".Let's hope that will be sooner than later.I ave all these books assembled and intend to read them in order.\\"1916\\" is a great read. It is written as clearly and interesting as can be possible.It is as well written as was Margaret Mitchell's \\"Gone With The Wind\\" was about the American Civil War.I find history about war and politics can be very involved,with an enormous amount of events,personalities,dates,etc.and often one has difficulty \\"seeing the trees for the forest\\".Llywelyn has the great skill of being able to write in a way that cuts through all the details and by using characters to show what and why things happened.This ability makes for a book that is so well written that it is hard to put down once the reader gets started.I found this a terrific read and now am looking forward to the othes.If you want to understand modern day, or 20th Century Ireland ;Morgan Llywelyn does it for you here.I visited Kilmainham Jail several years ago.A visit there and a listen to that unbelievably poignant song \\"Grace\\" about Grace Gifford and Joe Plunkett,burn into your heart the events of 1916 forever."},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"i enjoy reading this because it reminds me of joyces ulysses in the travels about dublin, many other inferences pop up as i remember the works of yeats, ocasey and liam oflaherty, ( the informer). 1921 is a good followup to this book as is the film about michael collins, i really enjoy it because it discusses the lives of plunkett and pearse who i enjoy as poets and patriots as well as thomas mcdonagh. at times morgan creates images of the times and the people that are so real you think you were there i will have read it in 2 days , so i like it. also dont forget to study seamus macmanus if you can find him , another great writer as well as padraic colum"},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"This is a beautiful book,poignant,stunning,gripping.And there is something in the way Morgan Llywelyn writes that without her having to use any great excess of adjectives you see the picture she is painting with perfect clarity.An important novel for anyone to read but an absolute nesceccity for the Irish fanatics.I also suggest \\"Six Days to Shake an Empire\\" and Frank Delaney's \\"Ireland\\".The story of the Easter Rebellion always reminds me of one of Jimmy Stewart's lines in Mr.Smith goes to Washington,when he says that the lost causes are the only ones worth fighting for.Brilliant,brilliant,brilliant."},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"Llwelyn captures a period in contemporary Irish history integrating fictional major characters with those who fought for Home Rule in Ireland. It's a compelling story which makes setting aside the book a difficult challenge. Ned and Caitlin bring to life a story about being Irish, being Catholic, being separated by the Atlantic, the loss of parents on the Titanic, and fighting for a free Erie. While we know, from history the outcome of the fight for freedom, the story rivets our attention because the all characters capture us and our emotions. The best book read in 1998!! You'll love it, whether you're Irish, Catholic or not."},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"I must admit, prior to reading this book, I had no real previous knowledge of the events that had taken place leading up to and during the 1916 Easter rebellion of Dublin. Morgan Llywelyn does an incredible job of weaving fictional characters with those of true historical significance without tainting the integrity of actuality. You learn so much from reading this book and yet you are not force-fed facts like some other historical novels that attempt to educate you rather than entertain you first. I can honestly say that I am unbiased towards Lylwelyn since this is my first experience with her work but I highly recommend this book and should hope to find her other novels as pleasurable to read as I found this one."},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"1916 promises by its title that it will be a novel of the rebellion of 1916 - not so much. I like stories of battles and struggle. I like tales of strategy and stress. I like tales of war, tactics and weakness revealed. 1916 is not much about the elements I listed.Instead, 1916 is about a fictional family and their life in an Ireland where the Irish barely survive the English occupation. Then, later in the book, it becomes about the 1916 revolution. To me, what separates this from a great historical novel is the fictional part. Please stick to history Professor Llywelyn, you are an expert there, and entertaining. 1916 is a let down because I expect focus on the history - told well. Cut out the first third (it is 540 pages after all), and you have a truely great book."},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"Although I maintain that women generally make better, and more accurate, authors of historical fiction, sometimes they let the love story get in the way of the history.Morgan Llywelyn will probably remain one of my favorite historical fiction authors. Her books \\"Finn MacCool\\" and \\"Lion of Ireland\\" were nothing short of grand, in both accuracy and readability. Granted, one must mentally dilute the romance as one reads, but overall they shone.'1916' on the other hand, left me feeling rather ...well, fooled with.I don't claim that Ms. Llywelyn didn't do months of involved research. Her facts are quite accurate. In fact, they're impeccable. She could have written a research paper with all the information she doubtlessly compiled.Which is part of the problem. She didn't write a research paper, she wrote a novel. A novel which, like her others, has a very strong romantic slant to it, and more than a little bit of hero-ization.I've read several books on or based around the events of the Easter Rising, including my favourite 'At Swim, Two Boys' by Jamie O'Neill. Although Llywelyn's interpretation of the events is historically valid, emotionally, I feel it's a bit of a flop.The love story between Ned and Sile gives the book a happy feeling, even though the events are anything but. Everything turns out OK for them in the end, even though the organisers and participants of the Rebellion were shot on the spot, hanged, or imprisoned. Which is another point. The characters are hard to feel for; their trials and motives concealed in paragraphs of dialog that could come out of a history textbook.Llywelyn seems to shy away from the gritty details which would have added a sense of reality to the scene. We don't get a sense of the desperation, frustration, or fear that the rebels undoubtedly felt. What about everybody who was shot? What about their families? What about the blood and tears and screaming?The novel seemed more like a fairy tale in which Good is perfect and shining, and Evil is black and gets defeated in the end than an account of real events.Because everything turns out so dandily for Ned and Sile, Llywelyn gives the impression that the 1916 Rising was, overall, a very Good Thing. Which, if you read your history texts, it wasn't--at least not to the boys who were shot or the rebels who were hanged.I would really rate this book a 7/10, which translates to 3.5 stars, but since there are only 5 of the things, I rounded up.Not a complete disappointment, but try and remember your perspective as you read."},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"1916 is one of those books that you will remember for the rest of your life! It's long lenght may deter some from wanting to read it, but once you start it is hard to put down! This book gives any reader a comprehensive idea of the history of Ireland's 1916 REbellion (the key people involved, the events leading up to it, the actual standoff itself and the poigant aftermath), yet does so in a very unconventional, non-text book-like way. Following the life of a fictional teenage boy who becomes embroiled in the midst of the rising revolutionary movement, actual historical figurs weave in and out of the story, with fictional players as well. Even if you are not interested in Irish history (which you may be after reading this book), 1916 will enthrall you w/ its easy, conversational writning style and entertain you with its adventurous twists in the plot. Llwellyn masterfully blends history with fiction to give readers a sense of that era- a time of strife, hope,fear and change in Ireland that parallels the time of the American Revolution, with the Irish insurrectionist being as wise and admirable as the American forefathers. Although 1916 does not end rosy and happy (people die - and there's also a sex scence- be foretold, it brings up many needed messages about persistance, human nature and &quot;lost causes&quot;, as well as enthralling the reader in a seldom-told Irish history lesson. It also has some great one-liners. So if you're up for an epic read, but one that will go by quickly and leave you interested in more, 1916 is a book for you."},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"This was a first rate melding of an excellent fictional plot with the great non-fictional story of the 1916 Easter Rebellion. Her writing almost makes the reader feel they have stepped into this period -- it is that authentic. I do agree with a reviewer on one minor point, however. If we really needed the Kathleen story, which I don't think we did, it at least should have been wrapped up. This book definitely lends itself to a sequel, with the main characters being updated into the events of 1922, with the Collins/deValera split and the eventual realization of Pearce's dream -- sort of. No doubt there would also be a divergence of views among the main characters as to which 1922 faction to support, and that would make for a fascinating development of those events."},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"1916 is one of those books you hate to put down and its a sad day when you finish. Ms Llywelyn has the wonderful ability to draw you into her books by bringing the characters to life. I almost feel as though I met Pearce, McDermott, Connolly and the others. It was a fascinating period of Irish history and this is an excellent way to learn about it."},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"This is the best book you cold ever read"},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"This is a story that takes you through the 1916 Rising in Dublin like no other book can. The characters are so completely developed and enjoyable you just wish you could know them in real life. Pearse is a man who was truly dedicated to a cause - yet Ms Llywelyn brings out the humanist not forgetting to delve into his family life (a fact so often left out of the history books.) This is the stuff of good detailed history - with a love story beautifully permeating throughout. It is also available as an audio book (Brilliance Corporation) in authentic Irish accent. Now Who could resist that? However you decide to enjoy this marvellous piece; just make sure to do it soon!"},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"Morgan Llywelyn's 1916 seems to have strong potential; one can hardly hope for more engaging material than the background of the Easter Rebellion, yet the book attempts to do too many things, and ends up doing none of them well. The main character, a fictional teenager named Ned Halloran quickly becomes the Forrest Gump of this novel (this is NOT a complement). He magically appears whenever something important happens, and is immediately brought into the deepest levels of the most secret plans. In spite of his being a newcomer to the republican movement he is a first-hand witness of every secret meeting of the rebellion's leaders. Fear of informers was so great that the rebellion was kept secret from many that were actually participating in it, and yet Ned, a mere teenager, knows all and sees all.The characters, both Ned and the non-fictional, come across at best as mediocre characters lacking depth, at worst as cliches. the dialogue is often forced. Main characters who are well-acquainted with information will begin talking in the most basic terms soley for the benefit of the reader. At times a character will, without any provocation, sum up four years of history in conversation just to let the reader know some (often unimportant) details. While some of this information is essential for a complete understanding of the book, there are better ways of bringing it across. Perhaps it would flow better of the novel concentrated on the elemnts pretaining to the rebellion more, at the expense of rather lackluster personal trials of Ned Halloran. When Ned has to choose between Mary, a pro-British, pro-Union, girl he meets, and Sile, the prostitute with a heart of gold, one wonders what takes him so long to reject Mary, with whom he never had anything in common at all. Worse still is Ned's acquisition of &quot;Precious&quot;, an infant half stolen, half-abandoned, that manages to become his.1916 is certainly well-researched, and, with some minor exceptions (namely a few comments about Bulmer Hobson), historically accurate (when one discounts the actions of the fictional characters). Unfortunately, this, by itself, does not make a good book. Someone interested in these events would do better to read Peter de Rosa's novel &quot;Rebels&quot;, which forgoes the frivilous fictional characters instead shining the spotlight on Pearse, MacNeill, Clarke, Casement, and the other men who really were important to this period. Those who would really like to learn about the Rising need only look at Llywelyn's bibliography for some facinating material. Caulfield, Edwards, and MacArdle are all good places to start. Her bibliography may be the most rewarding part of 1916."},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"Ms. Llywely's novel about the Easter Rising is an embarrassment to this pivotal event in Irish history. While her historical research is solid (and documents with brief footnotes), the story itself is contrived--full of cardboard characters who seemingly pop up at every important event during the period in question. The book itself amounts to little more than a soap opera, and a badly written one at that."},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"I thought the book was very well written, good story about Ned and Sile but I wondered at the end what happened to Kathleen. I hope Morgan Llywelyn lets us know in another book. The factual tale of the rising was most interesting in this author's pen. It truly makes you feel you would want to join these brave men and women if you lived back then."},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"This book will make the reader feel that they are actually living during the 1916 rebellion. The book is very well written and makes people think about the struggle for Independence through the eyes of someone in Ireland. The reader will also find that because of the thick smattering of Gaelic they will be able to speak a little! Educational and Entertaining!"},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"I shouldn't have been so surprised; this author is simply a magician when it comes to crafting history into a readable, enjoyable glimpse of the past. I used to think that I hated history, but the more I read by authors as talented as Llywelyn, the more I know how important it is that we are aware of our past. She has the ability to transport her reader into the lives of her characters, even when you know the ultimate outcome is not good--you willingly go down that road, holding her hand. Thank you Morgan."},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It provided accurate historical facts in novel form."},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"This book was a pleasant surprise. I haven't read any historical fiction since grammar school but my Da recommended this since he's into Irish republicanism. It probably helped that I was familiar with the history, but I was completely engaged in the story the whole time. The part about Easter week was a real page-turner for me even though I knew what would happen. The fictional main character, Ned, is seamlessly woven in with the freedom fighters, and the love story is crafted well.I particularly enjoyed the in-depth portrayal of historical figure Padraic Pearse. I knew a little about him but was completely charmed by Llywelyn's description. I feel I got to know the personalities and perspectives of all the signers of the Easter Proclamation.The book is pretty good writing as well, with the full gamut of historical viewpoints and motivations. Very well edited--I don't remember any typographical errors. This book is everything it sets out to be. If you want to learn more about the fight for Irish freedom, but aren't interested in a dry historical text, this is an excellent read."},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"As much a history as historical fiction, Llywelyn populates the story of the Easter Rising in Ireland with many more real people than fictional, along with copious notes indicating her historical sources for the details she weaves into the tale.It would be hard to find a better subject for an historical novel, and Llywelyn does a fine job of balancing story-telling with historical accuracy and completeness. Some of the characters remain two-dimensional, but there are so many characters in this tale, that it's hardly surprising.An all around good read, and a great way to learn a lot more about this time in Irish history."},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"If you are at all interested in the events leading up to and during the 1916 Easter Rising, (and don't particulary like to read conventional history books) - then this is the book for you. It's excellent. You will be immersed in the whole affair, become well acquainted with the brave leaders, and most importantly you'll understand the events that led up to Easter rising, the rising itself and the importance of it all in the Irish getting their independence from Britain. The only bad thing (and it's minor) is the little fictitious story set in NY, that's going on in the background - it's not necessary. Other than that this is a GREAT read."},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"I have read several of Ms. Llywelyn's books and this is far and away the best. It accuratly conveys the increasing tension between the British and the Irish of the early years of the 20th, and the brilliant Patrick (Padrig) Pease who was one of the organizers of the &quot;Rising of '16&quot; All the &quot;leading lights&quot; of the Irish independence movement are here: Sheedy-Skeffington, &quot;The O'Rahilly&quot;, Conolly, William Pease (Patrick's younger brother),Plunkett and all the others who gave their lives for Ireland's freedom. Allof this is seen through the eyes of young Ned Halloran, one of Pease's students. Ned of course becomes heavily involved in the rising and witness severalof the pivotal events. A good bit of research has been done for this book as any reading of a non-fiction book dealing the Rising will show. The Easter Rising in Dublin was &quot;Ireland's Alamo&quot; and Ms. Llywelyn's excellent novel conveys the dedication of the brave men and women who were willing to take on the mightiest empire on earth to free their country and make it a nation...."},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"Once you get past the contrived beginning, this is a wonderful book. I would highly recommend it to all lovers of Irish history."},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"Although I thought I knew the history of the 1916 Rising, Morgan Llywelyn's book drew me in and made me feel as if I was present with Padraig Pearse through Ned Halloran. The book is totally engrossing, enlighting, and endearing. I would unequivocally recommend it to anyone who has an interest in the Irish struggle for freedom."},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"I had high expectations when I bought this book. I had heard good things about Morgan and was excited about reading something about the Rising that added some drama, unlike the strickly factual interpretations I have read in the past. What I learned from reading 1916 however, is that the Easter Rebellion needs no dramatization or embellishment. The Titanic, a broken priest, a prositute heroine, are things that simply detract from what is one of the more telling stories of modern times. The book wasn't completely without merit. The truths it did decide to deal with, it dealt with accurately."},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"This book is a must read for anyone of Irish ancestry who wishes to learn about the 1916 Uprising. The characters are fascinating and inspiring. A refreshing read about people who are motivated by ideals and aspirations of freedom. I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"Llywelyn's characters, real and fictitious, came to life as breathing, feeling, genuine people whom I found interesting and sympathic. It's the best book about turn-of-the century Ireland that I've read yet. Two compelling stories collide at the end of the book -- a great plot. The first pages grip you as you learn, through the account of the main character, about the lives of the people who lost or were lost due to the sinking of the Titanic. Very clever intro -- I was held captive through the rest of the book."},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"This is a powerful novel of the events surrounding the 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin Ireland. The book opens in 1912 as Ned Halloran and his parents are on a journey from Ireland to America to visit Ned's sister Kathleen. Fate has intervened and they make their voyage on the Titanic. Ned survives the sinking, however his parents as well as new friend Dan Breen, are all lost to the sea.Kathleen and her fianc&eacute;, Alexander Campbell, urge Ned to stay in New York but his heart is in Ireland and he returns to County Clare and his family farm where his older brother and two younger sisters are left to mourn the loss of their parents.Meanwhile, Lord Inchpin of nearby Dromoland Castle, to make up for what young Ned has been through, has offered him a rare opportunity for a farm lad from County Clare - further education at a private school in Dublin. The school chosen turns out to be St. Enda's, the school run by Padraig (Patrick) Pearse, south of downtown. Pearse, as those familiar with early 20th C. Irish history know, is one of the heroes of the 1916 Easter Rising. This is a fictionalized account of events leading up to that fateful week.Ned interacts with many historical figures during this time including all the principals of the Irish Rebellion in which he becomes a courier for the eventual heroes. During this time, too, he runs into Sile (prounced &quot;Sheila&quot;) Breen, Dan's sister, who has run off to Dublin and is how working in the world's oldest profession. The nave Ned isn't aware of this at first and is, instead, stunned by her beauty although he is side-tracked by another woman he clearly has a crush on. Important too, is secondary character Henry Mooney, the young journalist from county Limerick Ned meets on the train on his way to Dublin.Even though the reader may already be aware of the events of April and May 1916 in Ireland, the emotions evoked by this novel, become very real - as if they happened yesterday instead of 85 years ago. Llywelyn portrays the Pearse brothers, Joseph Mary Plunkett, Thomas Clark, James Connolly, Sean MacDermott, Thomas MacDonagh, and others in such away as the reader feels the same love for Ireland and has the same desires as they do.In the sequel to this book, 1921, Morgan Llywelyn has one character say to another &quot;History tells what happened; literature tells what it felt like.&quot; This is exactly how I feel about 1916. Despite reading history books relating the events, reading this novel has made this very personal. I could feel the pain of these characters, I could feel their fervor and enthusiasm for the cause they believed in, and in the end I could feel the need to keep the memory of these brave people alive as the country fights for home rule and freedom from British oppression.When you are finished reading this book, and I highly recommend that you do, pick up the sequel 1921, which relates the events of the next six years in Ireland's struggle for independence and although it is Henry Mooney's story, it does feature Ned in a very big way.There's no better compliment I can give a novel than to say it not only made me think, made me want to read everything I can get my hands on, and wish to visit the historical sites in Ireland including the GPO, Kilmainham Gaol, and other locales mentioned in the book. Llywelyn has made this very easy with the maps in front of the book showing the locations of these places. Also helpful is the list of characters, both fictional and historical, in the front of the book. She adds several pages of notes and a selected bibliography at the end. Read this book - FEEL history."},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"1916 Good Story and Solid HistorySome element of this book that I found helpful and interesting:* It's a novel that employs footnotes.* Characterizations are excellent and historically accurate* Maps are helpful* Listing of Characters is absolutely great.I am not normally a fan of historical romance novels but 1916 was very well written. Really the romance portion was overshadowed by the momentous events of the day. The story of the 1916 Irish Rebellion (later called the Easter Rebellion) is a thoughtful tale of a country boy caught up in Irish nationalist fervor. Some key events led up to the Rebellion were: the forced conscription of Irish citizens for World War I, the rise of nationalism and German promises of assistance. The author brings all of these to light as well as other elements all interwoven in her story. Overall a good story well told.I recommend this book to readers that enjoy histories, light romance and especially Irish culture."},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"I enjoyed this novel very much, and not only because of its strong characters and riveting plot. Morgan Llywelyn entertains while she teaches, and I learned a great deal about Irish history and the fundamental reasons for the fractious state of affairs that exist today in the north. After reading 1916, I went on to read the other two books in Llywelyn's series, 1921 and 1949. Readers who enjoy 1916 are likely to enjoy the other two books as well."},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"If you've ever wondered about what happened during the Irish Rebellion of 1916, but you don't want a boring textbook re-telling of the events, then this is the book for you. 1916 mixes fact with fiction in a way that makes the events of the Irish rebellion lifelike and engaging. Fans of historical fiction will truly relish this novel.The story begins predictably enough on board the Titanic, on which (fictional) protagonist, County Clare farmboy Ned Halloran and his parents are headed to New York City for his sister Kathleen's marriage. We all know what happens next, so long story short, Ned survives and his parents don't. Llewelyn uses Ned's experience onboard the ill-fated ship as his sounding board for every single challenge he faces in the book. I don't know how many times he says, &quot;I know I can get through this, I survived the Titanic!&quot; Some may scoff at the fact that Ned is a first-hand witness of two major historical events of the 20th century, but thankfully for the reader, the Titanic episode doesn't occupy much of the novel.The remainder of the book is a painstaking, detailing, fascinating retelling of the few years leading up to the 1916 rebellion. Ned enrolls at St. Enda's School near Dublin, where Padraig Pearse is headmaster, and soon finds himself in the company of the future rebellion leaders. He joins forces with them and eventually becomes embroiled in the Irish movement toward Home Rule. All the while, he interacts with countless famous faces, a veritable Who's Who of Irish history. The book takes the reader to the front lines, allowing him to see the events through the eyes of someone who experienced them.Llewelyn strives to convey what various historical figures such as Joe Plunkett, Countess Markievic, Sean MacBride, Sean Heuston, and numerous others were like in their daily lives and how they came to be part of the rebellion that paved the way for (partial) Irish freedom.As an historian, Llewelyn receives high marks. Every event is painstakingly researched. Even minor occurrences and biographical information are footnoted, and the novel boasts an impressive bibliography. Llewelyn makes the history accessible to the common reader, and for this she deserves praise. 1916 is an excellent historical novel.Where she falters is in the fiction she weaves into the fact, and the prose she uses to convey it. Although she bases them on historical record, many of the characters seem flat and even stereotypical. The plucky Irish always have cute, brogue-laden one-liners to offer, and the British are sufficiently stuffy and callous to make you roll an eye.The novel seems more interested in driving the plot along than in dazzling the reader in the way the author can turn a phrase. Many of the events not directly associated with historical fact (such as Kathleen's romance with a sensitive priest) seem trite and conventional, and the love scenes (yes, there are love scenes) are riddled with borderline ridiculous imagery.But these missteps can be overlooked, as Llewelyn has given us an engrossing work that transports us into the history as it occurs. Students of Irish history as well as those with a casual interest can appreciate this book for the way it opens up history to the reader."},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"From the sinking of the Titanic to the bloody climax of the Irish rebellion, Morgan Llywelyn,gives an up close account of events leading up to the Easter Uprising. &quot;1916&quot; gives a historical account of the rebellion through the eyes of a fictional character, up to par, and much in the same way as James Michner does in his historical novels such as &quot;Hawaii.&quot; For people who like a good story I would give &quot;1916&quot; an eight, for history fans a ten."},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"I love Morgan Llywelyn's books. I was so excited to see this novel published that I recommended it to my book club before I read it. None of my fellow book club readers were familiar with her work, so I jumped at the opportunity to introduce them to this marvelous writer. Over the ensuing weeks, one by one, my fellow readers asked me, \\"Are all of her books like this?\\" I had not started it yet, and was mystified at the lukewarm reception the book seemed to be getting. Once I read it myself, I was not puzzled for long.Llywelyn's research is meticulous, as usual, but her telling of the story is stilted and her fictional characters have none of the complexity or depth of her other books. Perhaps because she was writing about people who lived so recently, and not people are lived centuries ago and are more legend than fact, she felt less at liberty to intersperse her fictional characters into the thick of the action. They seemed to be content to stay on the periphery, only arriving in the thick of the action by happenstance and not to fulfill their destinies. Granted, the events of Easter 1916 are well documented, but one expects more literary license to be taken by one's favorite historical novelists.And this is probably my mistake, not hers. I expected Lion of Ireland but instead found myself reading what I felt were a series of notes on the rebellion, interspersed with a fictional romance. My fellow readers and I never understood why the Titanic was involved, except perhaps to make the lead characters more sympathetic.My words here seem to convey that we hated the book. We didn't. It was a very good exploration of the politics and social crises of the time, and we all loved Padraic Pearse. The knowledge she gives us of this courageous, passionate man is alone worth the price of the hardcover edition. Her examination of the Irish Question is spectacular.What kept this book from rating five stars was the incidental plot line involving her fictional characters. Had she left out the fictional Hallorans entirely the book would have been improved. We did not find ourselves yearning to see the next chapter about them. We prefered to see Padraic Pearse, the O'Rahilly, or Thomas Clarke in the first lines of a new chapter. We sought out Edmund Kent and Sean MacDermott. We ached for more about the fascinating Countess Constance Markievicz, who by herself would make a wonderful subject of another historical novel about the Irish-English conflict.This is not a typical Morgan Llywelyn novel. It is a good novel, but not a great one. It is the one hiccup of an otherwise, in my opinion, highly exceptional writer.I will not hesitate to buy Morgan Llywellyn's next book in hardback, despite my disappointment with this book."},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"What a great book and what a great series of books that covers the history of Ireland throughout the 20th century. Fictional characters interact with historical figures to tell the story of the Halloran and Mooney families."},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"As an avid reader of Morgan Llywelyn, I was very excited to see her chronicle a more modern piece of the Irish struggle. I could not put 1916 down! I really felt she captured to essence of the historical personages, and successfully entwined them in the lives of her fictional characters.One thing I have always enjoyed about reading historical fiction is that I am nearly always inspired to further my knowledge outside of the novel. All of Llywelyn's books have inspired me thusly, but never with such immediacy as did 1916. After finishing this bookI spent about a week on the internet looking up all of these people (Pearse, MacDermott, etc.) and finding out more! I learned so much, and have to thank Morgan Llywelyn for my knowledge. Even dry facts are touched with her magic!"},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"This book is probably one of Llywelyn's best. Taking the reader into history, it provides the emotional background and commitment of the characters found in the history books. The use of Ned Halloran as a vehicle to visit and get into the minds of the leaders of the uprising in 1916 was inspired. Anyone interested in the Irish independence movement, past or present, should read this book.By the end of the novel, I did not want to put the book down and hope that Ned's experiences will be continued. After all, the story of Irish independence did not end in 1916."},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"I read this book at the end of a year studying in Ireland, primarily studying Irish History made this book particularly poigniant. My knowledge of early twentieth century Ireland was both helpful and enhanced by the experience of Ned's journey through this most important of Irish watersheds. By having P&aacute;draic Pearse, Eoin MacNeil, James Connolly, the Countess, etc. as such integral characters and literally lifting them from the realm of historical jargon into breathing gives a reality to this maturing process that the story is. Those people who do not know the story of the 1916 Easter Rising will benefit even more by the fact that this was a real event, these people existed, and hear them speak."},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"Llywelyn's characters, real and fictitious, came to life as breathing, feeling, genuine people that I found interesting and sympathic. It's the best book about turn-of-the century Ireland that I've read yet. Several stories collide at the end of the book -- a great plot. The first pages grip you as you learn, through the account of the main character, about the lives of the people who lost or were lost due to the sinking of the Titanic. Very clever intro -- I was held captive through the rest of the book."},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"Ive read all of Llywelyn's books and this is just as great as the rest. The mix of fictional and historical characters is great. The author uses this to get the reader into the secret meetings of the IRB. A Great Read."},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"This was an outstanding book which really brought to life this troubling time in Irish history. The book made you feel as if you were there."},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"Morgan Llywelyn does an outstanding job of bringing to life the historical participants of Irelands Easter Rising of 1916, as seen through the eyes of a fictional character. Her portrayel sweeps the reader up in the patriotism and pride of the Irish movement. As a student of Irish History I was impressed with the research the author obviously put into this book. I would highly recommend 1916 to anyone who likes a stirring tale of people in a fight for their freedom."},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"1916 continues the tradition of trying to understand the Irish - British problem. The all encompassing &quot;Trinity&quot; by Uris is the paramount of this kind of novel. But 1916 tells the story in the same way and provokes you into wanting more and more. The blunders made by the British in dealing with their cousins, the Irish, are so sad that its a crime. 1916 is just plain good. The beginning may be contrived, a bit. But it sets up the interesting cross-play between Amwerica and Ireland as captured in one family. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"Morgan LLywellyn departs from her customary ancient Ireland and Gaul to show us the early twentieth century. From County Clare to the Titanic to New York to Dublin, the character of Ned Halloran lets us live vicariously through all of these places. While he comes of age, learning of family, friendship, tradjedy, honor, loyalty, and, of course, love, we experience it all as if we were following him around ourselves. Padraic Pearse, Michael Collins and the other historic figures from Ireland's fight for freedom during the Great War are not the mythic heroes Llywellyn fans are used to; but they are great men who work in the modern era to try to free a united Ireland from subjugation. It is difficult to compare 1916 to Morgan Llywellyn's previous novels, simply because she isnt showing us heroes who've become mythological (Cuchulain, Amergin, Finn MacCool, Brian Boru, etc.). She now shows &quot;real&quot; men (and women) who did what they thought had to be done in a much more modern setting. A &quot;must-read&quot; for those interested in all aspects of Irealand's long &amp; glorious history."},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"This is a must for anyone studying history today, and watching the current events unfold as they are on a day to day basis. A book that transcends Irish History alone, a warm and tender love story wrapped within the confines of a cold harsh misunderstood conflict. The Human Drama that runs through the whole book gives it a readability beyond belief. Morgan has once again managed to provide the sights, sounds and smells of history on paper. The characterization of Precious is truly heart touching. It well be interesting to see her in the next two books that Morgan does, &quot;1921&quot; and &quot;1948' I believe. The timing of the movie Titantic with the release of &quot;1916&quot; was a truly predictive sign of the success of this book."},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"If St Patrick's day has you longing for stories of old Ireland, read this book. The Characters completely come to life and the sounds, smells and sites of Dublin seem to wrap around you. Ned Halloran is like any teenager coming of age, full of enthusiasm and potential. Before he even realizes it, he's smack dab in the middle of a rapidly changing political landscape. Hold on for a ride. This book takes you back and forth between America and Ireland, it has battles and love stories, you will move from breathtaking scenery to squalid tenements. In short, this is historical fiction at its very best."},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"Morgan Llywelyn has once again proven why she is one of the greatest authors of Irish fictional history. She can literally put you on the deck of Titanic and then walk you down the streets and alleys of Dublin in 1916. Her portrayal of the poet-warriors (a staple of Ireland) of the Easter Rising forces you to weep for their loss and their triumph. She forces us to accept Padraic Pearse as one of the great heroes of Ireland, in line with Cuchullain and Fin MacCool. I've read a great deal of historical fiction and have never been so convinced that the fictional characters she has created should honestly be there. I expect to look at photographs from the era and see Ned Halloran standing next to Padraic Pearse and Tom Clarke. When shells fall on the G.P.O Miss Llywelyn forces you to hear the reverbearations in your feet. No reader should pass this up and no Irishman should hold back their weeping at her descriptions of one of the most heroic and tragic times in Irish history. Miss Llywelyn has again proven her mastery of storytelling in the great bardic tradition."},{"Title":"1916 LARGE PRINT EDITION","review":"Once again Morgan Llewelyn has proven the power the words in her works have. This book, 1916, is fantastic historical fiction, therefore if you are interested in this period of time in Irish History(which is a very important era if you ask me), pick it up, please, and satisfy your appetites with this book."},{"Title":"The religion of nature,","review":"I was rather disappointed in this book, perhaps due to it being written over 100 years ago and in Great Britain. It wasn't what I was expecting, but still a nice read about one person's view of religion and nature, for what it's worth."},{"Title":"Hot Spell","review":"I bought this book for the Lora Leigh story, and it was good, but I was more impressed by two others - Falling for Anthony (Meljean Brook) and The Countess' Pleasure (Emma Holly). Both were stunningly creative in a genre (erotic paranormal) that is increasingly becoming dominated by stale plots. Both of these stories were set in interesting worlds, both were extremely well written, both made me want to read more by these authors. It's tough to create a unique milieu in a short story - Lora Leigh (who I love) has the benefit of a devoted following to a lengthy series, and Shiloh Walker writes a variation on the vampire myth, but the other two deftly sketch complicated, very original worlds and draw you into the characters. ...And the initial, no-touch sex scene in TCP about melted the page - my toes are still curled."},{"Title":"Hot Spell","review":"***** \\"The Countess's Pleasure\\" by Emma Holly.Too short, but then it's a novella. Another Yama story, like The Demon's Daughter. The hero is a Yama (demon), the heroine, a widowed countess. He's an indentured servant, working as an erotic dancer to keep his mother from prison.As expected from Holly, it's steamy and emotionally true.***** \\"The Breed Next Door\\" by Lora Leigh.Part of a series I'll probably have to check out now. Reminds me of Dark Angel, particularly since we've been watching season 2 on DVD lately. The hero is genetically engineered with cat DNA.Steamy, good suspense.*** \\"Falling for Anthony\\" by Meljean Brook.This one really needed to be longer. If it's part of a series, I'll give it back a half star. But there's enough going on here for a 300+ page book.The paranormal world of angels and nosferatu and guardians; the hero's complex relationship with his mentor; the heroine's complex relationship with her father; the complexities of their developing relationship.***** \\"The Blood Kiss\\" by Shiloh Walker.Evil vampire king imprisons the brother of the werewolf king. Werewolf king goes to get him back, is attracted and aided by vampire king's daughter, who he takes captive in retaliation.Nice intrigue, steamy."},{"Title":"Hot Spell","review":"this book and all of Lora Leigh book are great and very erotic reading...i love them all."},{"Title":"Hot Spell","review":"This was a good read.

The other stories were entertaining as well.J.Davis \\"loves to read\\""},{"Title":"Hot Spell","review":"I bought this for the Shiloh Walker Breed Series and walked away with many additional authors that I will most definately have to check out!! Especially The Countess's Pleasure!!! No words are enough!!"},{"Title":"Hot Spell","review":"It surprised me that you could put so much enjoyment into so short a story. I particularly liked Emma Holly's story \\"The Countess's Pleasure\\" as I generally avoid period novels and Lora Leigh's story \\"The Breed Next Door\\" as dominate males are a real turn off for me. All the stories - while short - were full and satisfying stories."},{"Title":"Hot Spell","review":"Loved \\"The Countess's Pleasure\\". Interesting world and characters and the story was intriging and HOT!Enjoyed \\"The Breed Next Door\\" so much that, although I passed up Lora Leigh's Breeds books before (the reviewers seem to agree that the stories are interesting but the female characters are idiots), I decided go ahead and try out the books.Could not get into \\"Falling for Anthony\\". Did NOT find the characters interesting and the story seemed to drag.Read only 2 chapters of \\"The Blood Kiss\\" and was done. So did not care what happened.So, 5 stars for the first 2 stories and 1-2 for the last 2 stories."},{"Title":"Hot Spell","review":"Hot SpellI too bought this anthology for the continuation of the Breeds.The Breed Next Door: Tarek was a breed. Lyra was his neighbor. At first he did things in his yard that just got on Lyra's nerves. But he could not stay away from the fresh smell of coffee and baked goods. He didn't eat fresh things like that but loved them. The council were always looking for breeds. Lyra was just one unlucky neighbor who got involved with one.After an attack, a break-in on her home and many more things, Tarek took it upon himself to protect her and eventually love/mate her. What he didn't expect was to fight her family.A lot of sex scenes makes puts a \\"HOT SPELL\\" on your body. This anthology was a great addition to the series of Breeds and will continue to read on. I have not read the other anthologies but plan to."},{"Title":"Hot Spell","review":"The Breed Next Door by Lora Leigh was hot & left me pining for more! I'm now in pursuit of Lora Leigh's Breed series of which there are more than 10! Can't believe I wasn't aware of her books before now.Emma Holly delivered a compelling tale. I've read her books before & am not typically caught up in the stories. This time was so different. Truly enjoyed it & will hunt for more of hers again.As others have said, I too found the third tale difficult to get through - too complicated for its size?"},{"Title":"Hot Spell","review":"My review is for the book by Lora Leigh. She is the reason I bought it and though, I will eventually read the other stories, I think her story is well worth the money. The only reason for my 4 instead of 5 stars is that it was TOO SHORT!!! I really enjoyed the story and wished it were a full length novel. I really did get into the characters. It reminded me a lot of Tempting the Beast... which now I will pull it up and reread the series. I love almost all of what Ms. Leigh is putting out and would recommend her to anyone getting into the genre."},{"Title":"Hot Spell","review":"I just want to say I have been reading alot of Ellora's Cave books (which includes many wonderful writers) and I have to say so far there hasn't been any of the series I have not enjoyed. This was a great read."},{"Title":"Hot Spell","review":"This is one of the best anthologys published recently. All four paranormal romances are full of erotic romance. Emma Holly and Lora Leigh are some of the queens of erotic literature.IF you buy this book you will not be disappointed. Every story was different and made you wish the story was longer.Emma Holly tells us the story of the Demon who danced at the Ladies Lotus. We saw him briefly in THE DEMON'S DAUGHTER. I loved finding out the rest of the story.Lora Leigh introduces us to the Breeds. Men gene engineered with animal genes. What real Alpha males! Bet this one becomes a series. The characters were fasinating and the animal characteristics were intriging.In the third we discover men alittle less than angels who are made to guard us against demons and vampires.The fourth delves into the world of werewolves and vampires. Some vampires are made, some are born, and some are hunted. A different take on the vampire tale, but interesting nevertheless."},{"Title":"Hot Spell","review":"It was as great as all of her other novels. WONDERFUL!! I couldn't seem to put this book down. I read it a second time."},{"Title":"Hot Spell","review":"I have this book in hard copy and even though I am a tight wad, I had to buy the kindle version so I could read it when ever I wanted to! Its 4 great romance stories. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Hot Spell","review":"This is a really good PNR erotica anthology. I bought this one because I'm crazy about Emma Holly's demon series, and the novella in this one is part of that series. All I can say is it is awesome! I love the Yama world and the city of Bhamjran that Holly has created for this series. So it's no surprise this novella (\\"The Countess's Pleasure) is my fav of this anthology.There is also a good Breed novella by Lora Leigh, and a good Were/vamp novella by Shiloh Walker. The surprise of the anthology was the novella by Meljean Brook, an author I have never read before. It is my second fav in this anthology, and I liked it so much I intend to read other erotic novels by this author in her series (of which this novella was a part).But if you are a fan of Emma Holly and her demon series the novella in this one is a must. Very romantic and incredibly HOT!!!"},{"Title":"Hot Spell","review":"THE BOOK: This is a novella found within the Hot Spell Anthology.The Breeds, part human - part animal genetically engineered in Genetics Council labs better known as hellholes run by scientists without conscious and malicious trainers, are free and now seek to bring to justice the very scientists and handlers that tortured them. He is sitting in her quiet neighborhood to trap one such trainer and taking his first wack at doing yard work in winter! Tarek, a Breed Enforcer, has never owned a home or done yardwork and when practicing with his trimmer he mangles Lyra's beloved rosebushes she's steaming mad. Tarek definitely likes her steamy rants because he knows she is his mate, the only one that can set his soul ablaze as his desire for her goes from simmering to boiling, but he can't claim her until his task is done.Who cuts their grass and trims shrubs in winter or bargains for fresh bread like he has never tasted it while looking so tempting? Lyra can't figure out her neighbor but she knows he is riling her up just for the fun of it; the interesting part is she is enjoying it too. But when his hunt for the Genetics Trainer brings that danger to her doorstep, he won't be able to keep her anywhere but near him and the mating frenzy won't allow him to wait to claim her. Lyra knows about arrogant men and she's got the brothers and father to prove it; but when she discovers the man at the center of all her fantasies is a Breed, can she handle him and accept him as that Breed ...THE SERIES: This is the 7th story set within a series of currently 26 books thus far. If you enjoy the genre you will find this book a fun short read within the series. The story line sets a new slant on shape shifters amid those evil factions threatening the freedom and peace the Breeds seek after the hellish existence in the labs where their creators and jailers tell them they have no soul because they were created by man, not God. The author notes on her website that the series was published over a few publishing houses, a couple of anthologies, and the series sequencing is hard to catch because titles are not set in true order and the mix between the different breeds makes for confusion in reading the titles. The sequencing on her website and the book descriptions are sketchy or incorrect. However, I have set my reviews by number and type for ease in reading. If you want a summer series to read, this is a good light read.8 out of 10 Bookends"},{"Title":"Hot Spell","review":"Loved all the strories in this book and the sex was HOT!

Although none of the other stories appealed to me, it was worth buying for that one story. Tarek is not a pivotal character in the Breed series but I sure wish he was. I thought his story stressed how hard it would be for one of the Breeds to live outside one of the Breed compounds. His character was so sweet and hot.If you enjoy the Breed series, I would definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Hot Spell","review":"I received this book in great condition and in a timely manner. Book will make a good addition to my collection."},{"Title":"Hot Spell","review":"I liked this book. I especailly like the Countess Pleasure. It was like a coming of age story and I like those."},{"Title":"Hot Spell","review":"This book was a good introduction of Emma Holly's work. I love the midnight series...Catching midnight, Hunting Midnight and Courting Midnight.. all really good paranormal erotica books. The Countess's Pleasure is not her best work...but is an okay read. I would have bought this book for Lora Leigh's The Breed Next Door. I love this series. Lora Leigh's Breed series is totally hot. I would be all about a genetically altered alpha male that could go for days. Where do I sign up? The Blood Kiss by Shiloh Walker is really a good read. Roman is totally hot and Julianna is a lucky girl. Meljean Brook's Falling For Anthony is a weak read but go ahead and muddle through. It want kill you."},{"Title":"Hot Spell","review":"I like this writer and this book. Just like the title says...It's Hot! Romance fans will not be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Hot Spell","review":"Hot Spell is a terrific anthology with strong writers and sizzling stories.The first entry, \\"The Countess's Pleasure\\", by Emma Holly, is a wonderful world combining British Victorian India and the paranormal. Emma Holly cheerfully introduces her tale with the words, \\"Everyone said what happened in Bhamjran stayed in Bhamjran.\\" A recent widow, Georgiana DuBarry, Countess of Ware, decides to indulge in the pleasures the city has to offer. After witnessing a floor show, Georgiana contracts a liaison with the performer, Iyan Sawai. The author describes what's brought these two unlikely people together and handles what could be a tawdry situation with real sensitivity. The story perfectly fits the short format, but I acknowledge that I was sorry it ended; I wanted more. For those readers who haven't had the opportunity to read \\"The Demon's Daughter\\", this story is set in the same creative world.The second, modern tale is Lora Leigh's \\"The Breed Next Door\\". It stands alone, but the story is part of a series called the Feline Breeds. The hero, Tarek Joran, is genetically engineered. He and those like him suffered considerably in the process of being \\"developed\\". After fighting for their freedom, the breeds resolve to make a place for themselves in this world. Tarek is a sort of bountry hunter, and he's drawn to his neighbor, Lyra Mason. Tarek's enemies attack Lyra in an effort to get to him. The story crackles with sexual tension. Although it may not be as satisfying as her longer novels, it's a great introduction into Miss Leigh's inspired series.The third story, \\"Falling for Anthony\\" by Meljean Brook, is ambitious in scope. It's a complicated combination with quasi-angels, vampires, and a quest. Anthony, who has always loved Emily, is brought back from the dead to protect her and her brother. There's a lovely story here, but it clamors for a longer format.Shiloh Walker's vampires and werewolves are favorites of mine. \\"The Blood Kiss\\", like others in the anthology, is a stand alone although part of her larger \\"The Hunters\\" series. Julianna is the daughter of an evil vampire. She is kidnapped by Roman Montgomery, king of the werewolves. They fall in love and must fight the efforts of her father's minions to recapture her. Mikhail, the father's second in command, plays a small but significant role here. He's a recurring character in Walker's paranormal universe. I'll confess that I wanted more of this story too."},{"Title":"Hot Spell","review":"I would like to give this a 4 1/2 star rating. Three of the stories were great and one left something to be desired.The Countess's Pleasure by Emma Holly was very nice. I liked the imagination of the other race and the mix with Victorian times. It was an unusual choice to put together but it really worked.The Breed Next Door by Lora Leigh was my favorite. It was the shortest but the hottest. I would have loved to see this as a full length novel. Even with the constraints of the short story you got a sense of who and what Tarek was. Leigh was able to make me care for the 2 main characters in a short period of time. This calls for a sequel. Loved it!Falling for Anthony by Meljean Brook was, to me, the weakest of the 4 stories. It is the only reason I didn't give the book 5 stars. I felt that there was too much happening and too much detail to ever develope any feeling for the main characters. I got lost in story at times as there seemed to be so much happening with no follow-through of information.The Blood Kiss by Shiloh Walker was another strong short story. She was able to develope the characters and make you like them and care about them in a very short period of time. This is another story that calls for a sequel because of some of the very interesting secondary characters. Very nice story."},{"Title":"Hot Spell","review":"I came into this book not having read any of the authors before and I had very little background knowledge of any of the series attached to this collection. That said....The Countess's Pleasure was....okay. I never really got invested in the story and when it was over it didn't leave me wanting to look up any of the author's other works.The Breed Next Door was one of the two best in this collection. It left me wanting to read the series that this is a stand alone to. Lyra made me smile and laugh at loud at times. The way Lyra and Tarek enjoyed provoking each other was fun to watch without being over the top. It was fun and I can't wait to read more stories set in this world.Falling for Anthony fell short of interesting. Mixing angel-like gurdians and vampires it left me feeling nothing at all.The Blood Kiss was the second of the two best stories. Julianna is the blood daughter of the Eduard, an old world ruling vampire who just happens to be holding Roman's younger brother hostage. No a wise idea when Roman is the werewolf's King. After Julianna helps Roman free his brother he takes the opprotunity to snatch Julianna. Eduard assumes Julianna betrayed him and declares her to be Blood Prize, an old world law that is just as horrendous as it sounds. It left me wanting to read more but not unsatisfied."},{"Title":"Hot Spell","review":"Upon the pages of this erotically paranormal novel, the combined writing of four authors, will sweep you into their tales of wondrous lovers, and their sexually cultivated hungers.

Berkley's Hot Spell anthology is sure to have something to satisfy every lover of Paranormal Romance!~The Countess's Pleasure by Emma Holly~All the Countess of Ware was seeking was one night of discreet, yet earth-shattering passion. Securing the services of an exotic Yamish dancer seemed just the thing. All Georgina thought she wanted was pleasure, but what she found with Iyan was so much more...I've previously enjoyed Emma Holly's contemporary romance and her fantasy romance, but in The Countess's Pleasure, Holly delivers an intriguing blend of historical romance and science fiction that I found more than pleasing.Iyan's alien race is known for their control, their unwillingness to give in to emotion. Even still, it isn't difficult to see how Georgina stirs him, as his precious control wavers time and again with the lovely widow.Georgina is the perfect match for Iyan, despite being human. Practical and shrewd outside of the bedroom, the passion she exhibits behind closed doors with Iyan charms him as effectively as those other qualities so valued by his people.As can be expected with any Emma Holly story, the love scenes are decadent and plentiful, certain to liven even the most dormant libidos!~The Breeds Series: The Breed Next Door by Lora Leigh~Tarek's current mission places him right next door to none other but his own mate, although he doesn't realize that is who Lyra is to him at first. No, that critical piece of information isn't revealed to him until living next door to her for months threatens to push him past his breaking point. When Jonas Wyatt explains the Breed Mating Heat to him, Tarek is more than eager to claim for his own the sassy little bread-baker who has unwittingly tormented him for so long.But Tarek's mission threatens his new Mate's safety, and Tarek will protect her at any cost.The Breed Next Door is the first of Lora Leigh's Breeds series to really drive home in no small way the fundamental differences in the way the Breeds grew up versus humans. As entranced as he is by the scent of his little Mate, Tarek is equally captivated by the scents of the homemade bread she bakes - something he has never experienced before, and something most of us take for granted.Indeed, watching Tarek enjoy new experiences such as clumsily mowing his own lawn, enjoying the taste of freshly baked bread, and trimming his yard is simultaneously heart-rending and joyous. While your heart breaks for what he has missed in his life, you cannot help but find his zeal for these things infectious.Which is the very reason Lyra finds it impossible to stay mad at him, no matter how bonkers he drives her. Well, that and this crazy attraction she feels for him. Still, Lyra gives him hell every chance she gets, in a way she has no idea turns the incorrigible Tarek on.What Lora Leigh story would be complete without a healthy infusion of love scenes guaranteed to make your own knees quiver in excitement and induce some very sweet dreams for the reader... And Ms. Leigh delivers all of that and more in The Breed Next Door!~The Guardians, Book 1: Falling for Anthony by Meljean Brook~Anthony and Colin have long been best friends, despite their differences in social class. But while those differences do not prevent their friendship, they certainly prove an obstacle to Anthony being able to court the woman he loves, Colin's twin sister Emily.When Anthony is struck down by a Nosferatu, the Guardian Michael offers him the chance to become a Guardian himself. Normally, such an offer means the new Guardian is prevented from returning to Earth for the first hundred years of their service, to avoid any contact with those who knew them before their death. When the Nosferatu that killed Anthony targets Colin & Emily's family for death, Michael breaks the rules, and assigns Anthony to the mission to save his friends.Falling for Anthony is the first in Meljean Brook's The Guardians series, and is very closely connected to both Demon Angel (Book 2) and Demon Moon (Book 4). This novella tells the tale of when Colin (Demon Moon's hero) and Hugh (Demon Angel's hero) met when Anthony, Hugh, and the demon Lilith (Demon Angel's heroine) saved Colin's life and quite possibly his very soul. I read the second and fourth books in this series prior to the first, and regardless of the timeline and connected events, I had no trouble understanding any of the stories.It was very interesting to finally see what exactly transpired so long ago that made Colin what and who he is today.Of course, that bit of Guardian history is juxtaposed against the tender romance between Anthony and Emily. Believing he can never be with the woman he loves the way he wishes, Anthony settles for whatever he can have of her. When fate returns him to her side after his mortal death, he knows he should resist her charms, but finds he cannot, even though he is bound to his role as a Guardian for the rest of her life. But there is always a loophole, isn't there?~The Blood Kiss by Shiloh Walker~When his brother is unjustly held captive by the dastardly Master of the House of Capiet, Roman determines to break him out of the vampire's clutches without delay. He never expects to meet his mate in the process, nor does he expect to find her in the form of the Vampire Master's own daughter, the beautiful Julianna.Kidnapping the lovely heir to the House of Capiet seems the perfect revenge. But doing so not only threatens the outbreak of war between the vampire house and his own werewolf clan, but promises Julianna's destruction at the hands of her own people.I ashamed to admit that while I have owned Hot Spell for more than a year, I have only just read this particular story. My only excuse is that I had just discovered author Lora Leigh at the time I bought it, and my frenzy to read all of her work right away caused me to skip any but her stories in the anthologies I purchased then.Little did I know that a fantastic story featuring two creatures I adore - vampires and werewolves - was languishing away on my bookshelf just begging for my attention. And Shiloh Walker's The Blood Kiss definitely grabbed my attention at page one and held it until I finished the last word in this sexy paranormal tale.In a romance faintly reminiscent of \`Romeo and Juliet', Walker introduces us to Wolfclan Montgomery and the House of Capiet, who have engaged in some barely disguised feuding. Of course, this little story includes some very sexy paranormal creatures and some of the most beautifully primal love scenes between Roman and Julianna.Although the ending to this story left me more than satisfied, I found myself wanting more of this intriguing world and its characters. I will definitely be searching for any related stories penned by this talented author.Connected Books:Emma HollyThe Demon's Daughter (Berkley Sensation)Hot Spell (The Guardians, Book 1) (The Breed Next Door) (The Countess's Pleasure) (The Blood Kiss)(Falling For Anthony)Lora Leigh (This list only includes the Breeds books published by Berkley)Hot Spell (The Guardians, Book 1) (The Breed Next Door) (The Countess's Pleasure) (The Blood Kiss)(Falling For Anthony)Megan's Mark (The Breeds, Book 1) (Berkley Sensation)Harmony's Way (The Breeds, Book 2)Tanner's Scheme (The Breeds, Book 3)Dawn's Awakening (The Breeds, Book 4)Beyond the DarkShifterMeljean BrookHot Spell (The Guardians, Book 1) (The Breed Next Door) (The Countess's Pleasure) (The Blood Kiss)(Falling For Anthony)Demon Angel (The Guardians, Book 2)Wild ThingDemon Moon (The Guardians, Book 4) (Berkley Sensation)Demon Night"},{"Title":"Hot Spell","review":"Four terrific paranormal erotica/romance writers deliver four sexy, unique and wholly enjoyable stories! Short stories that pack a wallop! My favorite (by a narrow margin) was 'The Countess's Pleasure' by Emma Holly; I found the mix of human and 'gentle demon' to be fascinating; the gradual awakening of unexpected love and spicy bedroom action paved the way for the next 3 stories: 'The Breed Next Door' by Lora Leigh, and 'The Blood Kiss' by Shiloh Walker are exciting, full of Alpha Male type action, and sooooo HOT!! 'Falling For Anthony' by Meljean Brook is a beautiful love story with a fabulous ending! Love overcoming all - even death! Don't get me wrong - there is lots of bed play in this as well - (Yes, Virginia, Angels DO know how to have fun - and then some)!I found all four stories to be fresh, engrossing, very enjoyable, and s-s-sizzling hot with lots of classy erotica!

Recently widowed, Georgiana hires Sawai to deflower her after a sexless marriage.***Could be spoilers...but was trying to list what they were about***In Leigh's story, 'The Breed Next Door', Tarek Jordan is a member of the Feline Breed on an undercover stakeout. His neighbor next door is Lyra, who is sweet, bakes, and he thinks is hot. Soon, trouble comes to her house and he is put in the position to take care of her. Neither can fight the attraction when in close quarters. I'm assuming you can guess how the rest of this goes. ;o)Meljean Brook's: 'Falling for Anthony' is the story of a young doctor who is granted the opportunity to come back from the dead as a Guardian, to help the sister of his childhood friend recover from a vampire's bite.Shiloh Walker's: 'The Blood Kiss' is the battle between werewolves and vampires. The prize, Julianna Capriet is the daughter of the Vampire King...but her heart belongs to Roman, the Wolf King.Out of the four stories...Lora Leigh's story was my favorite (of course, I love the breeds). I'd say Shiloh Walker's was my next favorite one. I liked the premise even though I'm not sure I've read much from her.It was the first time I'd read Emma Holly or Meljean Brooks. Seemed to be well-written, but I was just not really very into the stories. The premise wasn't of much interest and neither pulled me in."},{"Title":"Hot Spell","review":"I don't tend to reread books, I have such a backlog of books waiting to be read that I don't normally take the time. This time I was pleased that I did. When I originally purchased this book, I bought because of Emma Holly's demon story, I had read and enjoyedThe Demon's Daughter (Berkley Sensation), so it wasn't much of a surprise that the Countess' Pleasure was my favorite story both then and now. It is exceedingly steamy but there is a sweetness in the romance along with the heat and a vulnerablity in the hero that was unexpected and appealing.The Blood Kiss was fun too. A take on Romeo and Juliet, only their feuding clans are werewolves and vampires and both Roman Montgomery and Juliana Capriet aren't the silly tragic teens, but are strong, stubborn and intelligent.Falling for Anthony is the reason I reread this book. I must admit that I didn't enjoy it nearly as well the first time. Meljean Brooks has a very complicated world in her Guardian series and this story doesn't stand apart from the series well. That said, after readingThe Guardians: Demon Angel (Book 2) (Berkley Sensation)I foung this story very entertaining. It filled in holes in Demon Angel and made portions ofThe Guardians: Demon Moon (Book 4) (Berkley Sensation)more poignant. In rereading this story it was enjoyable seeing Hugh, Lilith and Michael now that we know them so well, since understanding their interactions and motivations made this story more interesting. So from my experience the Guardian series should be read in this order: Demon Angel, Falling for Anthony, Paradise inWild Thingand the Demon Moon.The fourth story the Breed Next Door, will probably please Lora Leigh fans since she seems to have written quite a few Breed stories, but I didn't care for it either time I read it. It starts out promisingly with the hero unsure of his humanity but longing for it and for love and acceptance, after knowing only brutality. But once he gets together with his \\"mate\\" it deteriorates. The language is graphic and repetative, and the love scenes uninspired.For an anthology 3 out of 4 isn't bad, and if you've been reading the Guardian series you will definately want to read this one."},{"Title":"Page boy of Camelot: Original title, Page boy for King Arthur","review":"Like W. Beaudoin, I met this book as a child. My mother, a 6th grade teacher, read it to me. It started a life-long love of reading about this era. As an adult, I realize these stories glorify what was in reality a difficult time to live, even for those fortunate enough to have noble blood. But Arthurian England is wonderful place to which one can escape. I also highly recommend The Once and Future King by TH White. Reading this in high school solidified my romance with the genre."},{"Title":"Page boy of Camelot: Original title, Page boy for King Arthur","review":"In this book, Tor is a village boy whose father, Wain the cowherd, was granted a boon by King Arthur and, knowing that his son wants to be a servant at Camelot more than anything else, asks Arthur to let Tor work at the castle. Unfortunately, Tor, while he tries hard, has a good heart, and performs some very important services along the way, is a somewhat bumbling, inept sort of boy who makes a lot of mistakes and occasionally gets into trouble, and is therefore sent home. However, he encounters Sir Launcelot lying unconscious in the woods. Can Tor save Launcelot, and will he ever be allowed to return to Camelot?There is much to commend about this book. It extols bravery, hard work, obedience, friendship, loyalty, family love, and learning from one's mistakes. Usually when I buy a book to read, I note on the inside back cover any objections (bad language, inappropriate behavior, etc.) that I find. I wrote nothing down on the cover of this book. Unfortunately, it is no longer in print. However, Barnes and Noble lists several used copies available from various dealers under both titles. Anyone who enjoys reading about the days of King Arthur and his knights of the round table will find this book a welcome addition--if he can locate a copy.In the sequel, Squire for King Arthur (published in 1955 by Follett Publishing Company, Chicago, IL), Tor is given the responsibility to watch young prince Odo, son of Arthur's friend King Pellinore. Odo is captured by Saxons who are planning an invasion of Britain. Can Tor rescue Odo and get word to Arthur about the Saxon's plans? The St. Louis County Library had both books. Stone wrote another book about British legend, Robin Hood's Arrow."},{"Title":"Page boy of Camelot: Original title, Page boy for King Arthur","review":"I read this book as a child. For the first time I understood how life was for those wonderful people. I also understood how the king/knight/page/peasant system worked and how hard times were. It filled me with wonder, the story so simple, yet elegant. I have searched for years so I can read this child's story again as an adult. It has stayed with me for over 30 years."},{"Title":"Charmed circle : Gertrude Stein & company","review":"This book gives one of the best overviews of Gertrude Stein and her crowd! When it first came out almost 30 years ago, I read it and have been hooked on Stein and Alice and Picasso and Hemingway and Anderson and Wilder and on and on. Mellow provides very detailed information about the lives of all these greats and some have criticized him for his almost gossipy, \\"Entertainment Tonight\\" style. But what better way to feel a part of this circle of extraordinary people? Had more high school and college English and Art teachers used this book, there would be more readers and fans for this amazing artistic period! Hats off to the publisher for re-issuing this book!"},{"Title":"Charmed circle : Gertrude Stein & company","review":"Following a recent trip to Paris, I was inspired to learn more about the Americans who lived there in the early twentieth century. Some got their first taste of Paris at Gertrude Stein's Saturday night salon at 27, rue de Fleurus; others by being members of Sylvia Beach's lending library and bookstore, Shakespeare and Company. James Mellow in his Acknowledgements to Charmed Circle, says he wants to counter the legend of Stein and present her as an honest woman. I believe that he has achieved his goal. There is a tender side to Stein, being supportive and helpful to young writers and artists; but no doubt she could be arbitrary, rude and mean-spirited to others--sometimes those she had helped earlier. It is fascinating that her best-selling books: The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas and Wars I Have Seen were also her most accessible books, and not the abstruse, repetitive, strangely punctuated books that publishers avoided for years. She and Picasso had a friendship that blew hot and cold over the years and she generally avoided friendships with successful American or English writers. Mellow doesn't spare presenting her warts, but it's clear that she has a creative spark and a hugely independent spirit. The human side of her seems to come out during the two world wars she lived through, especially during World War II when she and Alice lived in the countryside with ordinary French people.A long book: 570 pages of small print in my paperback edition, plus 70 pages of notes and index, but well-written and informative. Also consider: Sylvia Beach and the Lost Generation by Noel Riley Fitch; Paris Was Yesterday by Janet Flanner; Memoirs of Montparnasse by John Glassco; and, of course, A Moveable Feast by Ernest Hemingway."},{"Title":"Charmed circle : Gertrude Stein & company","review":"I am adding this paragraph to thank Henry Holt/Avon profusely for releasing a Kindle version of this book, which I snapped up instantly. I won't claim to have had anything to do directly with the digital version's release, but it's been only a few months since I made the appeal below. I would, of course, love to have a newly republished on-paper copy, too, but for now, I'll be happy with what I can get, without paying the jaw-dropping sum of $100.~ ~ ~ ~ ~Please, please, please -- Henry Holt/Avon, reprint this book again, and end the ridiculous profit-taking that's being perpetrated here where allegedly new copies of this book are concerned!!!I read this book for a Lost Generation lit class in the late '70s (and loved it!), lost my copy and wanted to replace it and re-read it.I was (and still am) horrified that allegedly new-quality PAPERBACK copies of the 2003 reprint edition of this book are being offered with a straight face for $99.99. When the first paperback edition sold for $2.49? What the ... ??? When last paperback reprint is less than 10 years old? Really?? REALLY???I ordered (from an affiliate bookseller, but I'm not here to dish on them) what I thought would be a \\"like new\\" copy of this book. I'm sorry, but a copy from the first paperback edition (1974), with heavily yellowed (closer to brown) page edges (and in some places, entire pages on the verge of turning the same acid-eaten brown) is NOT \\"like new.\\" It is, regrettably, being returned -- I don't do \\"like new,\\" especially if this is an example of \\"like new.\\"And the $99.99 price tag on allegedly \\"new\\" copies is patently ridiculous!!!So please, Henry Holt -- this book is a classic on the subject it covers, and should be on the reading list of every lit class that addresses the Lost Generation.

Gertrude Stein returned only once to the United States as part of a book promotion tour. She stayed in France until her death in 1946 - she is buried at Pere Lachaise cemetery in Paris.She met several people during her life's journey - most of who were connected with the arts like Picasso, Matisse, Erik Satie, F. Scott Fitzgerald - the list goes on. She was also a collector -but she could only afford the Picasso paintings at the beginning of his career. After the First World War Picasso's stature was so high (partially due to Gertrude Stein's publicity) that she could no longer purchase his paintings.I believe that Gertrude Stein's legacy is due more to her talkative gatherings with artists and her collections, than being a writer. She was a compulsive writer; she wrote everyday and kept everything she wrote. As the author states her writings were long-winded, lacked narrative and had a repetitive style. Also as Hemingway remarked of her - she did not believe in editing. She grandiosely believed that all she wrote was a jewel of wisdom and delight. For the most part - except for the \\"Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas\\" - her writings are unavailable today. Her style is similar to James Joyce who she detested, probably due to writer's envy.Mr. Mellow describes well the historical events surrounding Gertrude Stein's life in Paris and France. He is not afraid to attack her rambling writings, her egotism and her lack of political insight (particularly on Hitler and the coming of World War II). I would have preferred less on her literary output (which I for the most part find to be ego-driven diary portraits) and more on her relationship with Alice Toklas. I also would have liked to know how they sustained themselves economically for over 40 years. Gertrude never worked as a wage earner - which is reflected in her writings which lack the common touch.Nevertheless we are presented with a strong and independent person who enjoyed the fellowship and camaraderie of all - whether they were artists, writers, American G.I.'s or farmers residing near her country house."},{"Title":"Charmed circle : Gertrude Stein & company","review":"Mellow introduces the reader to a person and a period of time that makes the book a vacation from our modern world.He introduces us to personalities of the nineteenth and early twentieth century who remain names to most of us.

Coyote seem to require the characters to do a lot of talking. I'm not sure who decided that it was too challenging to write a book without dialogue, but it is a regular feature. This book has the Road Runner family talk in rhyme to make up for that shortcoming. Yes, there's a Road Runner family.Since this was written in 1968, the bad guys point guns at people. My little one has become somewhat tired of seeing mad scientists as villains in all the Big Little books; the bad guys here seem to be industrial spies, although they would be hard to distinguish from actual gangsters.A cute book, we enjoy Looney Tunes books...but then again it was nothing special, and a little dated.

It has nothing to do with the review that yells about how absurd it is that we have to recognize our differences to be happy; the reviewer was probably referring to another Todd book, which is equally as good.

There are good bits concerning how cigars are made, the processes involved and some historical references. It may interest the US reader as the book has a very readable section on the embargo.The section on the cigar brands is a bit confusing and it really refers to the history of that brand as opposed to what the cigars are like and what signature pieces are produced by that brand. If it were to be a historical reference then the omission of names like Davidoff and Dunhill would be a bit remiss.To summarise, it is more of a story book which is very interesting. This is NOT a reference book, nor does it pretend to be! It is very well written and I enjoyed it even if I didn't really learn from it."},{"Title":"Cubans: The Ultimate Cigars","review":"This is a book to be avoided by aficionados, since it is very basic and general in its approach and adds absolutely no new information to that which can be found in previously published books and magazine articles.The author would have done better by presenting this book as a personal diary rather than a book which is supposed to supply information as to why Cubans are &quot;The Ultimate Cigars.&quot;"},{"Title":"Cubans: The Ultimate Cigars","review":"For the most part, my own past cigar-smoking experience was limited to the venerable but pedestrian White Owls and those formidible, &quot;separate the men from the boys&quot; little Italian smokes that looked vaguely like blackish cat scats and rather tasted like them, too. But on a couple of occasions over the years I was presented with a genuine Cuban cigar and found the experience of drawing on it a unique and rewarding one, somewhat like driving a Porsche rather than a Chevy. It is easy to understand why the true Havana cigar possesses an enduring mystique all its own and why cigar afficionados - in spite of all the dire health warnings on smoking of any form - continue to revere, and to smoke them. I've since given up cigars for the pipe, but when I came across this compact little tome on the Cuban cigar I couldn't resist picking it up, if for no other reason than to learn the how's, why's and wherefore's of those fragrant Cuban cigars that I had tasted and enjoyed all too briefly in the past. I was not disappointed by my purchase. Author William P.Mara has clearly done his homework where it comes to the history and allure of the Cuban cigar, its many current incarntions, and the methods by which they are cultured, nurtured and manufactured. The book, although of small format (4 1/2&quot; x 7 1/4&quot;), packs a great deal of fascinating information within its pages, not the least of which is the author's &quot;travelogue&quot; chapter, in which he relates with flair his adventures in journeying to Cuba, today off-limits to Americans by federal decree, in search of cigar fact and fancy and the people who grow and make them. &quot;Cubans&quot; offers a wide variety of topics, including the history of the Cuban cigar industry, the complex process of the manufacture of the smokes, current popular Cuban brands, the effect of the continuing United States embargo against Cuba on the availability of the Cuban cigar, and the ongoing problems of smuggling and counterfeiting. The photographs, all taken by the author, are of excellent quality, and there is a very useful bibliography. In sum, I highly recommend this informative little book to both serious students of world-class cigars and to those readers simply seeking a lively account of just why Cuban cigars have long occupied such an exalted position in the annals of smoking lore. I give &quot;Cubans&quot; - both the Rolls Royce of smokes and the book - five stars - I know you'll enjoy them both."},{"Title":"Cubans: The Ultimate Cigars","review":"A very good book for both the beginner of fine &quot;habanos&quot; as well as the enthusiasts.It's a journey of cuba,its cigars and a man's (Mara) thirst for answers to a cigar lover &quot;taboo&quot;.Easy to read format w/o all the spanish lingo,some may not understand.A quick &quot;must&quot; read for all cuban cigar lovers out there who want to escape to cuba to enjoy a cigar along with the &quot;isla&quot; they come from."},{"Title":"Cubans: The Ultimate Cigars","review":"The part of this book that deals strictly with cigar brands and characteristics of those brands is ok, but could use more detail and more photos. Unfortunately, the author devoted too much space to a very shoddy synopsis of Cuban history. Instead of enlightening the reader, the author made clear his own lack of background in Cuban history; since this isn't supposed to be a history book, perhaps the author could have either left out that section, or had someone more qualified write it. Disappointing."},{"Title":"Cubans: The Ultimate Cigars","review":"Good book and good info. I have kept this book and have it as a coffee table book now."},{"Title":"Cubans: The Ultimate Cigars","review":"WOW! What an unbelievable book!!! I've been a big fan of Cuban cigars for years (on those rare occasions when I can get them), and I really have to say that this is BY FAR the best book on Cuban cigars available. Every topic imaginable is covered-history, making, brands, the embargo, counterfeiting...you name it! And the book only retails for $20.00!!! I hadn't seen a cigar book for under $30.00 until this one came along, and it was better than any of the others! There's also a chapter at the end that details the author's trip to Cuba while he wrote and took pictures for the book, and it's really, really good. Great writing (some times very funny), and very interesting to anyone who loves cigars (or just has a passing interest in Cuba). I read over the other three reviews on amazon before I wrote this one, and I really don't know what the guy from Israel is talking about. He says this book isn't for aficionados, but in truth this is the kind of book that MAKES YOU an aficionado. Like I said at the beginning-WOW!

FitzRoy who was a dyed in the wool believer. It is nicely illustated and well written. The serious student might find it less than what he needs, but to the novice it is an excellent choice that may, or may not, lead him to explore Darwin's conversion further. It will please those with an adventurous bent as well. A satisfying work worth having in your library to be read again and again. Note: the timing matches Dana's Two Years Before the Mast (1844-46), but what a difference in the treament of the crew."},{"Title":"Darwin and the Beagle","review":"Many people know more about Charles Darwin's hypothesis about the origin of species than about how he arrived at his conclusions. Unless you are a devoted scientist, you will probably never read his book, The Origin of Species, his journals, or his autobiography. Alan Moorehead has done a valuable service in providing an entertaining popular introduction to Darwin's work in this book (available now as an audio cassette).Darwin's life is full of ironies, which are nicely developed in this book. His grandfather, Erasmus Darwin, was a well-known physician who espoused some elementary ideas about biological evolution. Is finding evolution a heritable trait?Charles Darwin had been a poor student, and seemed only competent to become a country curate.The position of naturalist on the Beagle was cooked up because the captain was subject to mental illness, and hoped the companionship of another educated person would help him keep his senses.Darwin initially turned the job down because his father was opposed, and was only able to persuade his father to let him pursue this when a relative aggressively intervened.Darwin's main qualification for the position was that his family could afford the 500 pounds it would cost to be on the voyage while conducting this unpaid position.Also, Darwin got horribly sea sick, which meant that he sought out opportunities to be on land as much as possible (this was fortunate for the future of biology).Finally, Darwin was a believer in strict creationism when he started the voyage. He saw his job, in part, as finding evidence for Noah's flood.The voyage of the Beagle lasted five years, and involved circumnavigating the globe. The primary purpose of the Beagle's trip was to map coastlines for the admiralty.Most people know about Darwin's finches (whose beaks developed in different ways in various islands in the Galapagos to reflect the local food supplies), but do not realize that he only spent a few days in the Galapagos.He had many other important experiences in South America and on other Pacific islands that led him to appreciate how geological processes of mountain building and ocean depressing impacted species. The fossils he found in Uraguay and Argentina of extinct animals began to undermine his belief in the literal meaning of the Bible on these points. Finding other fossils from ocean creatures at 12,000 feet high in the Andes further stretched his mind. Seeing extreme volcanic action and the effects of tidal waves in Chile added to the picture.This material would be ideal for a young person trying to find what interests them. It will encourage the idea of being open to new experiences, and learning from what you observe. Many young people would like scientific careers if they ever tried one. High school and college science classes give an incomplete and poor impression of what working in science is all about. This book nicely captures the excitement of field work and trying to figure out what the data mean.I graded the book down for being too popularized and a little too repetitive. Readers can absorb more substantive information than Mr. Moorehead included here.A good way to apply what you learn in this book is to observe a group of animals over time. Take notes on what you see. Find a way to determine patterns from your notes. Then consider reasons why these behaviors could be beneficial to the animals. Then ask yourself what genetic and behavioral influences may bear on this behavior. You have now created a hypothesis. How can it be tested?An excellent book about our modern understanding of Darwin's work can be found in The Beak of the Finch, which is the first published work on how natural selection works in practice from observing many generations of Darwin's finches.Be open to all that is around you . . . to get the most out of life!"},{"Title":"Darwin and the Beagle","review":"This is an edited edition of Darwin's \\"Voyage of the HMS Beagle.\\" A good bit of the original text is left out. But one still gets most of the story and the illustrations help several episodes come to life. It would be an especially good book to give to a child, tween or teen who is interested in Darwin or science in general, but who probably wouldn't have the patience to wade through all his 19th Century prose. I only wish someone would put out a TRUE Annotated version of Darwin's original text, and do it in the much more reader friendly style of coffee-table books today. Now that would be well worth reading, discussing and generally enjoying! There are at least five different English language \\"Annotated Walden's\\" on the market, -- tho' oddly not a single one of \\"A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers\\" -- so surely this classic first work of science and literature by Thoreau's equally famous contemporary, -- a work Thoreau clearly loved and even cites in Walden, -- deserves at least a single annotated edition of its own to gratify all the latter-day, armchair \\"natural historians\\" our nature-obsessed age has produced."},{"Title":"Darwin and the Beagle","review":"Darwin and the Beagle by Alan Moorehead is an illustrated popular history - a spectacular one. This book has an honored place among the history books of my earlier years that were very formative in my decision to become a historian. That said, Darwin and the Beagle chronicles Charles Darwin's voyage at the age of twenty-three in 1831 (before he was famous/infamous for Origin of the Species) on Robert FitzRoy's ship, the HMS Beagle, as a naturalist. The Beagle circumnavigated the world and the Charles Darwin's discoveries along the way were critical in developing the theories that he later developed in the Origin of the Species.The book chronologically follows the ship's voyage as well as all of Darwin's side expeditions into the interior of South America, The Galapagos Islands, and the Pacific Islands. Moorhead takes most of his information from Charles Darwin's personal writings including his \\"Narrative of the Surveying Voyages of the HMS 'Adventure' and 'Beagle' between 1826 and 1836\\" as well has his 'Life and Letters' compiled by a descendant. Not only does the text take extensively from these letters and writings but provides vivid illustrations, maps, and biological diagrams of many of the wonderful species he encountered (pichiciego which are small armadillos, ostriches, giant tortoises, the Argentinian oppossum , yargouaroundi, various monkeys, toco toucans, and an assortment of antediluvian animal fossils). Moorhead stays away from any real controversy and only briefly describes the content of the Origin of the Species and its reception - however, his subject is clearly Darwin's early voyage of exploration and how scientifically important many of his discoveries were (concerning such topics as army ants and the animals of the Galapagos). Of course, mixed in with science is adventure! Tempests and earthquakes etc.The book conveys the powerful message of the wonder of exploration, discovery, and curiosity. This is a WONDERFUL book on a fascinating period of history for a young as well as older audience. Darwin and the Beagle is simply a must find/buy!"},{"Title":"Darwin and the Beagle","review":"Mr. Moorhead's book was included on a reading list I have for a trip to the Galapagos Islands next month, so I thought I would give it a try. I found the book to be very informative and entertaining. It covers the same ground as Darwin's own book The Voyage of the Beagle, but does so in a lot less time. The book also has excellent illustrations.Charles Darwin left England in 1831, traveled to the east coast of South America, down to Tierra del Fuego, up the west coast, over to the Galapagos, across the Pacific, and eventually back to the home country five years later. Along the way he made extensive studies of the natural world and began to develop his radical notions of natural selection. This book will give you an excellent idea of what he encountered during his travels."},{"Title":"Darwin and the Beagle","review":"Alan Moorehead does wonders with the story of Charles Darwin aboard the HMS Beagle. This is a very readable version of the voyage for the non-biologist and the non-sailor. Other accounts of the story (including Darwin's) can be tedious to the casual reader, but this reads like an adventure novel. The book uses many direct quotes and MANY illustrations made during and immediately after the voyage. This text with these illustrations brought together makes a wonderful presentation of one of the most important voyages in history."},{"Title":"Darwin and the Beagle","review":"Perhaps the average reader would not be too inclined to jump in and read Charles Darwin's own accounts of this famous journey of discovery, his master work On the Origin of Species By Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life or his more accessible trip narrative The Voyage of the Beagle: Charles Darwin's Journal of Researches are both splendid works, but Alan Moorehead's approach was to create a book, mainly from Darwin's own words, then richly illustrate it to entice a general readership to delve into the originals. In this objective Moorehead was successful and the book, first published in 1969 was still being re-printed in 2000.The book details not only the actual voyage and the theory that developed from Darwin's discoveries, but his torturous and complicated relationship with the famous Captain Fitzroy who struggled between his deeply held religious belief and acceptance of the obvious logical conclusions of Evolution.The author was an Australian who became a newspaper journalist in England, and during World War II had won an international reputation for his coverage of campaigns in the Middle East and Asia, he was \`Mentioned in Dispatches' (a formal military recognition just short of a medal) and was awarded the OBE. The deserts he fought over drew him back and he began to write history, choosing as one of his earlier themes, the great river Nile that waters those same deserts.While touring Australia to conclude the research for this book, in December 1966, he began suffering from the headaches that eventually precipitated a major stroke. Tragically during the heart surgery, further attacks inflicted brain damage that affected his communicating nerves ... subsequently at just 56 years old this great communicator could no longer speak, read, or write.Only through the efforts of his wife, Lucy, was Darwin and the Beagle still concluded."},{"Title":"Darwin and the Beagle","review":"I bought this as a gift for my husband since we plan to go to the Galapagos next summer.

Unfortunately, the book has far too many errors to be useful. For example, fur trader Daniel Harmon was said to have married an Indian chief's daughter (in fact, he married Elizabeth Duval, a Metis); David Thompson's biography is hopelessly muddled; and the wrong dates are given for the arrivals of both Alexander Mackenzie and Simon Fraser at the Pacific Ocean. Sometimes the text entirely misses the point: the &quot;Massacre at Seven Oaks&quot; chapter fails to give the year of this event, and the definition of &quot;homme du nord&quot; fails to explain which voyageurs received this &quot;highly honored title&quot;, even though the criterion is well-known. (Voyageurs had to spend one winter trading for furs, instead of returning home at the end of the summer.) On the positive side, this book includes nine activities for students, ranging from a fur trade crossword puzzle to a voyageur board game to making mock beadwork from drinking straws. Unfortunately, this small bright spot is far outweighed by the numerous problems with the accompanying text.The illustrations often owe more to Hollywood than to history. I haven't read the other books in the author's series of history texts for young people, but after reading this one, I'm concerned about the others."},{"Title":"Functional analysis","review":"I find Bachman and Narici's book to be an excellent introduction to functional analysis for students who have had a graduate level linear algebra course and some introduction to measure theory. I completed a course in real analysis last year, and I wish I had immediately begun using this book. It seems to me to be somewhat less difficult than the real analysis course, based on Rudin, while reinforcing and building on topics that were introduced in real analysis and other masters level courses. Bachman and Narici's book seems to me to be a bit easier to follow than other functional analysis books, and to bridge the gap between what I already know and more difficult treatments of functional analysis.

In this novel, we may have her clearest portrayal of writer as freedom fighter, fighting to expose the hidden sources of anit-American journalists. There is her usual element of romance, as well as the gifted amateurs who take on the trained operatives, and win. And always I enjoy her carefully crafted writing; she was a lot more than a writer of &quot;action&quot; novels.This book has been less popular than many of her others, but it's one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Neither Five Nor Three","review":"First of all, let me highly recommend MacInnes to anyone who likes spy thrillers. But ... don't start with NEITHER FIVE NOR THREE. It is one of her least appealing works.The problem is that none of the characters are especially sympathetic, even the central hero. She goes about as deeply into the minds of the bad guys as she does in any of her books, and it leaves you with a fairly bad taste in your mouth.Furthermore, the trademark romance plot is kind of stifled. The two characters who would, in most MacInnes novels, have fallen in love are actually former young lovers who have been separated by WW2. Now the woman is engaged to someone else, and the whole thing is more awkward than romantic.Also, the setting is before the cold war was openly being fought, so the battle lines are not as clear as they are in her other novels. After four WW2 spy novels, and then two non-spy romantic novels, this was her first attempt at a cold war story.This isn't a bad novel, but it is far from MacInnes at her best."},{"Title":"Neither Five Nor Three","review":"My first contact with Helen MacInnes was when I was 13 years old and found Neither five nor three in the school library. From then on I have searched for her books in my country in the US and France. I keep rereading my torn copy. In these times the way Helen MacInnes depicts the struggle between communism and democracy may seem out of date, yet the characters, on both sides are very well built, with depth and humor. You can relate to them, feel the atmosphere of those cold war years. One of the things that are more impressing is the fact you feel watched and cornered as if you were deep behind the iron curtain while the novel is set in downtown New York. At the same time, you have your share of humor which give you time to catch your breath. Overall an excellent book which has kept over the years."},{"Title":"Neither Five Nor Three","review":"All Helen MacInnes' adventure/spy novels are as well written as anything LeCarre wrote, but more than that, were based on facts. Her husband was a member of England's MI5, Intelligence, which contributed to her knowledge of the doings of Soviet's Smersh and the implements of death developed in Dept 13. One member of my family thought Smersh was a fiction, was astonished when she learned it actually existed! This particular novel was one of MacInnes' first and the premise on which it is based, is just as true today as when written -- 2 and 2 are still four, neither 5 nor 3 -- as political spinners would have us believe -- never more true than when selling the public on a candidate for office!"},{"Title":"The Oxford Guide to World English","review":"There are two sides to this book. On the one hand, it presents English as a predatory language that endangers other languages. English takes over, influences local languages, anglicises thinking patterns, etc. etc. In short, it has become a world wide imperial language.On the other hand, this book presents English as a vulnerable language, crumbling into lots of Englishes. Several varieties are shown in the different chapters on America, Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe. In some cases the language is taking a course of its own. For example in Singapore, on and off are used as verbs, to on and to off.It is interesting to see the two sides of the argument but on occasions it is not clear what this book really means."},{"Title":"The Oxford Guide to World English","review":"This is the kind of ambitious undertaking that should have been done by someone with deep expertise in the field and *then* checked by specialists in each of the dialects, or written by a team of experts. Unfortunately, it seems to have been written by one person and then not checked by anyone. It's full of bizarre claims and errors; if you speak or specialize in one of the dialects of English that is not shared by the author, you're sure to find a host of linguistic (and sociolinguistic) errors and errors of omission. That is, he states things that just aren't true, and he doesn't mention critical information. Look for another book on the topic--don't get this one."},{"Title":"The Oxford Guide to World English","review":"This is a new subject, because modern linguists accept that the myriad forms of English all over the world should not be viewed as demotic variants of American Standard English or BBC English, but as languages in their own right.This book does it justice, and is an excellent resource for the business expat as such.One learns how silly one sounds when one tries music hall upper clawss English on the Bridget Jones generation, who speak, it seems, \\"Thames Estuary\\" English, a mixture of BBC, Northern influenced glottal stops for zing, Caribbean phrasing and Americanisms, thankfully innocent of any \\"old boy\\"s or \\"I say you chaps\\"s. The old boys were real enough and if American Movie Channel oldies are creditable they really talked like that but one must remember that they have for the most part shuffled off their mortal coil.McArthur does miss the fact that a \\"prestige\\" form of speech does one job rawther well, and that is simple communication to people all over the world. The BBC itself is the prime example. While treating an argot like Bow Bells Cockney with respect, one must also keep in mind that much of it, as McArthur knows, was developed by the lads in order to hide swag from the coppers as in the case of rhyming slang that then removes the last rhyme.Fascism is the limit of identity politics, and, insistence on equal rights for all argots can create bloody nonsense such as the de-hyphenation of Serbo-Croatian. But, as McArthur points out, languages are combining and argots are disappearing, so our task may as well be their preservation.Read thoroughly, but jumping around as one would read a reference book, in search of juicy bits, one is well-rewarded. I now know how to pronounce Australian, for example, like Crocodile Dundee: it is pronounced Strine. This is marvelous economy for a frequent word, reducing Terra Australius down to bite size.I never knew that there is an Antarctic English, used by the international community in \\"the land of ice and snow\\". It deserves a literature, therefore here is my first contribution:A beaker was bareassed on iceAnd said, this is not very niceFor the hairs in me assShall delay me manfood repastFor I have learned that in Antarctica, a \\"beaker\\" is a scientist, after a character in Sesame Street. \\"Manfood\\" is in binary opposition to \\"dogfood\\" and expresses, perhaps, the mutual interdependence of man and sled dog in Polar climes, at least until recently. My \\"beaker\\" uses \\"me\\" instead of \\"my\\" in that Celtic mode characteristic, I believe, of Strines, who are over-represented in the South Pole.I'm not sure about the Oxford Guide's derivation of American Ebonics \\"homeboy\\". It was said to have been derived from men in prison who would attempt to relate to new fish by claiming a common neighborhood. It may equally relate to practice when working people of color would form communities in Chicago and other Northern cities, and integrate \\"boys\\" newly come up North from their own home towns.I was called homeboy by a New York bellhop who I overtipped in 1991 and there is an association of likable naivety which may or may not be taken advantage of depending on the good nature of the homeys already knowledgeable about a new environment.To be chillin, with the homes, is to have established an ongoing pattern of mutual recognition and respect combined with a basic wariness which is the enemy of enthusiasm and naivety. It is an Austinian \\"speech act\\" since it performs the acknowledgement as well as describing a mental state.But the new environment in which I be chillin need not be prison, and, far more American blacks have had, in place of prison, the honest experience of moving to a new city for work and chilling, in the new city, with the homes.Indeed, one wonder why simple work experience is so seldom foregrounded in discussion of language. Instead, for white and European people, their recreations are emphasized while American blacks get to be mentioned in the same context as prison...when, last time I checked, there are a lot of white homeys in jail too.But I certainly understand that language is a political minefield. Its author fails to connect his research with Foucault's account of language as systematic capillary power because for many English, Strine, and 'merican academics, France is a no-fly zone: complementary to its fashionability in literary criticism, where French theory is redundancy, its utility in APPLIED lingustics is neglected.But in general I be chilling with this book, and my homey has done an excellent job."},{"Title":"Arabian sands","review":"This book, correctly available in the Penguin classics range is a non scientific, not overly academic telling of one British chaps journeys with local Arabic people in the \`Empty Quarter' of the Arabian Peninsula. Ostensibly financed to increase biological and scientific knowledge of the area these journeys seem to have been undertaken by Thesiger for vastly different reasons. And it's these cross purposes that inform much of the conversational style of this dry yet at the same time engaging display of man against nature and the rich and varied experiences Thesiger converys.And indeed it must be said that Thesiger is a keen albeit haphazard chronicler. One minute he is imparting explanations of local attitudes and throwing in anecdotes to illustrate them and the next he is giving precise information regarding some feature of the local flora and fauna. While he is busy describing the grinding nature of the journey he is to be found digressing to present some moment of idle whimsy. And all at the same time he is actual giving you a chronological description of his time \`mucking in' with the locals, getting involved in their everyday lives and sparing himself no hardship - in fact he seems to court it like it's a beast to be fought at the most base level. This guy seriously missed his time, he should have been born a couple of thousand years ago in Sparta. I came away not so much beguiled by the writing style or even the physical part of the world this journal portrays but for the all consuming experience the author quite obviously had. Not to mention his stoic and inspiring indestructibility both physical and mental and the reader is forced to consider their own fortitude in the face of descriptions of soul sapping hunger, endless deserts, infinite hardships and debilitating remoteness.Wilfred Thesiger was born with a silver spoon in his mouth, went through Eton etc and is in many respects an anachronistic throwback to a very different time, as are his attitudes to a great many things. But it's important to remember that being born in 1910 he IS from a very different time. And it would be churlish of the reader to expect his writings of over half a century ago to conform to our ideas of political correctness. Not to mention that when it comes to attitude/anecdotes and his conclusions derived therefrom he is perfectly entitled to his opinion, informed as it is by direct experience rather than a preconceived philosophical standpoint."},{"Title":"Arabian sands","review":"I had heard this was the definitive work on the desert country but never had gotten around to reading it. I now have and it is terrific - every thing it's cracked up to be. I had read Michael Asher's biography; I had been in Ethiopia, Oman and Yemen; I traveled in the Hadhramaut -- all of this over fifty years later but still there is the flavor of Thesiger's days. His writing of crossing the Empty Quarter was a precursor of Asher's more recent writings about desert travels. He writes well and keeps the reader completely caught up with his trek. There is a sadness, on Thesiger's part (and mine), that as progress has affected the Bedu life, the stability of the old days is no more. But for a loving report on life as it used to be with the Bedu tribes, I whole heartedly recommend Arabian Sands. (I should not Rory Stewart's introduction was worth the price of the book)"},{"Title":"Arabian sands","review":"This is simply a wonderful book. I actually found myself wishing I could go back in time and travel with Thesiger. This really is one of those books you will not want to put down. It is a great adventure and gives great insight to a time and way of life that is gone forever. Thesiger is definitely one of the great adventurer-travelers of all time. Thankfully, he had the writing skills to put it all down on paper."},{"Title":"Arabian sands","review":"It's a wonder of the human spirit that people can go through the things that true adventurers do and want to do them again. We are lucky that so many of them manage to write about their adventures so well, and Wilfred Thesiger is one of the best. It's inspiring in a world of such violence, nationalism, and tribal wars to read the stories of those who have travelled to utterly foreign places and found themselves to be at home."},{"Title":"Arabian sands","review":"Nice, convenient Penguin edition, with, unusually for Penguin, quite good maps. I am taken by Thesiger's soul baring and his descriptions of all that relates to the Bedouin. The book is short, convenient to carry on a trip and an enjoyment to read."},{"Title":"Arabian sands","review":"I live most of the year in Saudi Arabia and saw this book at a local bookstore. I was attracted by the cover, reviews, inside photography, and the author's opening comments. I purchased it hoping I would get a greater understanding of the world I live in before the influence of Western luxuries/conveniences. I also thought it would be an enjoyable true-life adventure story.Thesiger was drawn to the bedu setting from of his disdain for the onslaught of technological progression which has been infiltrating every corner of the earth. And no doubt, I benefited from the book with learning more about the bedu culture/mentality as well as their relationship with each other and other Arabs and the degree of attention that they gave to Islam (or \\"cultural\\" Islam, not to be confused with Islam as it truly is). But make no mistake, those fascinating points are very SPARSELY scattered throughout the text.Since the book contained rich descriptions and I did learn a few interesting things from it, it would be unfair of me to give only 1 or 2 stars. But why didn't I give it 4 or 5 stars? Of 287 pages, it seemed that nearly all of it consisted of traveling in the sands, occasionally visiting a town to get permission from a Shaykh to travel therein, and then OCCASIONALLY noting interesting observations from his traveling companions. That's what it was, from beginning to end. There was little to no plot, just the author's love for basking in asceticism. However, even THAT is lacking because there is very little personal reflection of life from the author in the midst of his surroundings. We don't have a page where he looks up into the sky and ponders the creation of the universe or anything of that nature. Quite simply, the book is a narrative of dealing with camels, searching for water, and getting dinner invitations. A few times throughout the book he mentioned some important historical points about Islamic history (it's spread and how it propelled Muslims to be the most advanced civilization of their time) and he concludes that this is because of the bedu participation/influence--yet even these observations, if brought together, could not cover a single page. Although the journey was a true-life \\"adventure\\" -- there was danger from thirst, lack of food-source, etc -- and sometimes it seemed that the author, as a Christian, would be in a tough bind, yet none of those scenarios ever greatly escalated, which of course is good for the author(!) but boring for the reader.For those of you who do choose to purchase/read Arabian Sands, my advice is simple: find a cozy spot where you can read it without any distractions or any impending time engagements. If you don't, the pleasant writing style will slip by unappreciated and your enjoyment will be even less."},{"Title":"Arabian sands","review":"Had he been born in the 18th or 19th century, Wilfred Thesiger would have explored the Nile or mapped uncharted territory in North America. His mid-twentieth century journeys in the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Peninsula, related in this book, confirm him as an acute observer of humanity and an untrained but brilliant amateur anthropologist. This book is unparalleled."},{"Title":"Arabian sands","review":"I'm only about a quarter through this book, and I'm enthralled. Takes you back to another world, before oil riches flowed, to a time when conditions were unrelentingly harsh and unforgiving, where the people were hard and austere, accustomed to a life of great demands and hardships, yet also capable of great courtesy and hospitality. The author explains why he was drawn into the desert and living with the Bedu and describes how the time he spent there was the happiest of his life.Thesiger served as a foreign service officer in Sudan for a number of years as a young man before setting off on his 2 crossings of the empty quarter in southern Arabia. He notes the great abundance of wildlife in Sudan: herds of thousands of elephants, an abundance of lions (he shot 70 himself on hunting trips while stationed there). It's such a sad shame that it's almost all gone now after years of poaching, over-hunting, and civil war. Though apparently there has been some return of these animals on a much smaller scale with some degree of peace in South Sudan.It's hard to imagine that a description of desert life--traveling with camels and how important they were to survival, the daily hardships and rituals of endurance that were just routine, the constant danger--would be fascinating, but it is.Even though Thesiger's travels happened only about 60 years ago, they seem taken from a different era, a much different and wild time. It is, for example, jolting to read that slavery still very much exists in Arabia at this time. And the religious fundamentalism is striking too: for example, a Beduoin is taken aback when Thesiger tells him that in England they have weathermen who can tell you when it is going to rain; the Bedu think that is something only God knows and that it is blasphemy to say otherwise."},{"Title":"Arabian sands","review":"I just completed this book. It was recommended as a way to understand the culture I was going to enter. I recently took an assignment in Doha, Qatar.I didn't know what to expect from the book, but I found it enlightening. The Arab culture has been turned upside down by the new found wealth that oil has brought.Thesinger was concerned about the affect of oil on the culture he fell in love with. I would say his fears have come true. The wealth has changed a simple culture of survival to one of entitlement.It is a good read and insight into the closed culture of the Muslim mind now forced to accept the Westerner that brings the technology and business acumen that helps them acheive the benefit this new found wealth provides. Unfortunately, it has created an arrogance in a culture formely proud of its ways.I believe the Arab still sees the Christian as an infidel and only accepts their presence as a necessity."},{"Title":"Arabian sands","review":"This book is a fantastic read for anyone interested in the middle east history.It arrived within days, well packaged and in perfect condition.Reccommended reading."},{"Title":"Arabian sands","review":"The deserts of Arabia cover more than a million square miles. The southern desert occupies nearly half of the total area. It stretches nine hundred miles from the frontier of the Yemen to the foothills of Oman and five hundred miles from the southern coast of Arabia to the Persian Gulf. It is a wilderness of sand, a desert within a desert, an area so enormous and so desolate that even Arabs call it the &quot;Empty Quarter.&quot;Wilfred Thesiger was born in Addis Ababa in 1910 and educated at Eton and Oxford. Though British, he was repulsed by the softness and rigidity of Western life, &quot;the machines, the calling cards, the meticulously aligned streets, etc.&quot; In the spirit of T.E. Lawrence, Thesiger spent five years exploring and wandering the deserts of Arabia. With vivid descriptions and colorful anecdotes he narrates his stories, including two crossings of the Empty Quarter, among peoples who had never seen a European and considered it their duty to kill Christian infidels.Thesiger greatly illuminates our understanding of the nomadic bedouins of Arabia. He loved, admired, respected and was humbled by a people who lived desparately hard lives in the harshest conditions with only a few possessions that might include saddles, ropes, bowls, goatskins, rifles and daggers and traveled days without food and water. Yet these people were unflappably cheerful, welcoming, generous, self-reliant, loyal and dignified. Thesiger explains why the Bedu with whom he traveled refused to forecast the weather (blasphemy against God)or could discern where to find a hare in the sand (only one set of tracks into the buried hole). As a reader I could almost sense I was traveling with Thesiger, could not help but mourn the passing of the way of life he described, and, as he, pondered the meaning of the word &quot;civilized&quot; as we Westerners conceive the term."},{"Title":"Arabian sands","review":"Besides being a wonderful book, as other reviewers have remarked, 'Arabian Sands' is important reading for anyone who wants to understand the culture and history of the Arab countries of the Middle East and North Africa.The Bedu are, and always have been, a small fraction of the Arabs; historically, they have been disliked, mistrusted and often hated by the settled Arabs of the Middle East. In North Africa, the Berbers (a completely different people, with non-Arabic languages) have sometimes been confused with the Bedu. The Bedu way of life is now nearly extinct; Thesiger's book, which describes his travels with the Yamani Bedu of Southern Arabia, is the only careful account of Bedu culture and Bedu peoples I have ever come across. I know of no similarly illuminating study of the Qaysi Bedu of Northern Arabia, not even the works of T. E. Lawrence.The historical importance of the Bedu in the Arab world is that on several occasions from the 8th century to the 20th century, Bedu tribesmen formed the core of armies that swept across the Middle East and/or North Africa. Invading Bedu armies overthrew decadent regimes in North Africa in the 13th century, and effectively destroyed Berber power on the North African coast. Bedu formed the core of the Arab armies that defeated the Turks in the First World War, and were the core of the army which Ibn Saud created that turned him from being a refugee into being the founder of Saudi Arabia as it is today. How did the small number of people who comprised the various Bedu tribes exercise such military power throughout the Arab World? Read &quot;Arabian Sands&quot; to understand this."},{"Title":"Arabian sands","review":"A book about &quot;the spirit of the land and the greatness of the Arabs.&quot;This is a must read for anyone interested in the tribal Arabs of the desert (southern Arabia). I had this book for many months until I got around to reading it and then I absolutely couldn't put it down. The excursions of Wilfred Thesiger (Umbarak) take place during the 1940s. Thesiger loved the Bedu tribes (Rashid)and he writes from the heart, which is why I think the text is so readable. You relive this phenominal experience with him. Thesiger never fit in with his own people of England. He couldn't bare to live amongst the materialistic culture he found in the western world and felt more akin with his Arab friends yet as a &quot;Christian&quot; he could never be one of them. His relationships with two of the Rashid in particular, bin Kabina and bin Ghabaisha and the love, admiration and loyalty he had for these two young men was very moving. Amazingly Thesiger survives many dangerous encounters while traveling in the desert with his Arab companions. How he ever survived some of these excursions is astonishing; between the lack of food, water, heat and cold exposure but mostly other hostile Arab tribes. His companions and he escape being killed by mere hours. By our western standards many people would think Thesiger's companions to ultimately be murderous and barbaric yet I have met very few westerners that held the same unbreakable code of honor that many of Thesiger's Arab companions lived by. Their generosity, faith in god, honor, dignity, strength and endurance is nothing short of amazing. They would give a stranger who stumbles upon their camp the last scrap of food and final cup of water even when starving in the desert for days. As a &quot;westerner&quot; reading this book I realized the immense differences in what we as a culture think is barbaric and immoral compared to these tribes of Arabia. Of course the ease at which they would kill between tribes to settle blood feuds and their &quot;habit&quot; of stealing camels was truly mind boggling when contrasted with their overwhelming personal ethics. As a female reader I didn't miss the lack of discussions about Arab women although I would have been very interested in the various tribal Arab woman's role as mother, wife and sister. What little I did find in the book about women sent chills up my spine. I do feel that female readers would enjoy this book none the less. Many readers will empathize with the author's sentiment as he writes about his dismay and disgust in the way the Western world has invaded the lands of these nomadic people with new mechanical inventions and infiltrated and ruined the unique beauty of this desert tribe (as well as many other indigenous tribes) which are now completely lost and irreplaceable."},{"Title":"Arabian sands","review":"I had the opportunity to meet Sir Wilfred Thesiger while I was working in the United Arab Emirates. He had come to the city of Al-Ain to promote his book &quot;My Kenya Days&quot;. He was about 85 years old at the time and his hearing was impaired. Yet when someone mentioned something about an incident he had written his eyes lit up and his voice got louder, and it was as if he had been taken back to the Empty Quarter amidst the camels and the bedus. I read Arabian Sands and The Marsh Arabs, (which was, in my opinion, better than Arabian Sands), after I met Thesiger, and I was moved to see a country that had changed so rapidly in such a short time. Thesiger is definitely anti-west, anti-development, anti-modern; he has lived a life that far few of us could ever imagine. I think he became anti-modern because of what wealth was doing to the Arabs and how it was eradicating vestiges of a culture that would be hard put to replace (I believe that there are currently one half of one percent of people who would classify themselves as Bedouins on the Arabian Peninsula) It is a kind of life that far few of us would want to live; going for days without water in the middle of nowhere; not bathing, not having any of the 'comforts' of life, it is hard to imagine doing what he did. Yet as I read Arabian Sands, and walked in parts of the desert around the U.A.E, I could hear, almost smell, the life Thesiger came to admire and the life that really he became for him one with the Bedu."},{"Title":"Arabian sands","review":"A truly magnificent book, such an easy pleasure to read in comparison to Doughty's great but exhausting work, Travels in Arabia Deserta. The author is a man in the fine tradition of T.E. Lawrence, a man who resigned from the British Political Service in the Sudan to rejoin the service as a contract officer not eligible for pension on the understanding that he would only be asked to serve in the wilderness. He served in the S.A.S. in the Western Desert, but makes only one oblique mention of that mission in this text. See Thesiger's autobiography \\"The Life of My Choice\\" for the broader picture of this unique life.Wilfred Thesiger writes, \\"I went there with a belief in my own racial superiority, but in their tents I felt like an uncouth, inarticulate barbarian, an intruder from a shoddy and materialistic world.\\" I wonder how many men among us today would agree with Thesiger's deep belief that \\"even today there are experiences that do not need to be justified in terms of material profit.\\"One passage, if even remotely true, bodes ill for our crusade to spread democracy. \\"Arabs rule, but do not administer. Their government is intensely individualistic, and is successful or unsuccessful according to the degree of fear and respect which the ruler commands ... Focused on an individual life, their government is impermanent and liable to end in chaos at any moment ... To these tribesmen security can be bought too dearly by loss of individual freedom ... Here the evil that comes with sudden change far outweighs the good.\\"Wilfred Thesiger closes by writing that leaving the remote Bedu world with which he was obsessed, The Empty Quarter, was to him an exile. It was in the stimulating harshness of an empty land that he found satisfaction. When he began to lose courage in an \\"intolerable\\" state of thirst, hunger, and fear for his life, he asked himself, \\"Is there really anywhere else I would rather be?\\"I have met one solitary Beduwi in my life, a man imprisoned, caught up in a great tragedy. I regret that I had not read Arabian Sands before that meeting. Not that I could have helped, but I would have understood that in his eyes I was a more pitiful creature than he, \\"for he was Bedu and Muslim, and I was neither.\\"I highly recommend \\"Fire and Sword in the Sudan\\" to anyone interested in anything Wilfred Thesiger has written. I sought out that memoir, written by an officer held captive in Sudan for 12 years, because of the new world which \\"Arabian Sands\\" opened to me."},{"Title":"Arabian sands","review":"Thesiger stands in a long tradition of English who found the deserts of the Middle East hospitable. Wilberforce Clarke, Burton, Doughty, Lawrence, Glubb, Philby (Senior) - the list sometimes seems endless.One is tempted to speculate that the Arab world brings out certain facets of the English character, and perhaps it is true. &quot;Arabian Sands&quot; is one of the best travel books ever written. The purported idea behind the book was a chronicle of crossing Al Rub' al Khali - The &quot;Empty Quarter&quot; of the Eastern Arabian peninsula, one of the most barren areas on earth. This central focus of the expedition, and the story, gradually pales as one reads on and the reader becomes caught up in Thesiger's relationship with his Bedouin companions.The Bedouin are admittedly a fringe society in the Middle East. However, the values that their way of life represent have always been seen as having a central place in the Arab view of life, and Thesiger's obvious sympathy for his companions allows us to understand them as humans as few other western books can do. In this sense he resembles T.E. Lawrence, although he manages to tell his story in a lot less words than Lawrence did.This book will stand the test of time as one of the best books in the English language on the Arabs, and it is a rewarding read."},{"Title":"Arabian sands","review":"Having traversed the Antarctic with Shackleton, Scott, and Mawson, the Himalayas with Maurice Herzog and others, and the high seas on the doomed whaling ship, Essex, I can say that for non-fiction adventure, nothing beats Thesiger in the deserts of Arabia, before they were tamed by oil money.Each page is gripping, whether Thesiger describes the desert environment itself, his own adventures, or the Bedu camel herders with whom he lives and travels. This last theme is the most important in the book, and Thesiger's 1940s travels uncover the ways and even the mind of these most Arab of Arabs as well as anyone can. Thesiger understands and praises the Bedu's better aspects, but is not blinded to their faults. He points out the differences among the ways, thought and even religious practices and tolerance of the desert tribes, and their even greater differences with Arab townsfolk.Read it to understand the places we are sending our troops, or read it to be taken away completely from whatever troubles your urban or susburban psyche, but read Arabian Sands."},{"Title":"Arabian sands","review":"I have not been to Arabia, but as an Archaeologist I worked with Arabs in Israel and Palestine and enjoyed their company greatly.

The Arabic mentality is fully explained in this book. Although the incidents occurred more than fifty years ago, the true essence of Arab culture today is still mirror image of ancient times, which was described fully in this book.As an Arab, I can attest to the author's success in understanding Arabs, although from time to time he confuses Islamic tradition with tribal traditions. For example, in one paragraph, the author describes the marriage process as if it's solely an Arab process, while in reality it is an Islamic process shared by every Muslim whether in Malaysia or in US."},{"Title":"Arabian sands","review":"i read so many books and novels about the Arabic world and people..i was trying to figure out how other nations look at us and what they know about our culture and people...but unfortunately..many writers wrote about the surface and didn't describe our culture deeply....and i guess i can say that this is the first book among the ones i read that describes this unique culture honestly.. although i agree with Wendy Kreitzer that it lacked the mentioning of women's role in the Bedu's life...but as an Arabic woman i can tell u Wendy that it was and is still a very great role...it is true that the world that Thesiger described in his book had nearly vanished....but many Bedu tribes are still there...maybe they don't have now to suffer and struggle as before....but they still have the same ethics and beliefs..some of them chose to change their way of life..but some were forced to"},{"Title":"Arabian sands","review":"I just spent 3 months travling in 5 Saudi cities and their surrounding deserts and read the book after having it recommended by a Pakistani Engineer supervising a project I was involved with.

He then served with the SAS in the Western Desert in WWII, being awarded the DSO. After the war he travelled extensively through Southern Arabia, the marshes of Iraq ( the subject of a book on its own) and numerous other African countries. These travels werer always on foot with animals rather than mechanical transportation.This book relates to his five years living with the Beduon and entails his two trips across the \\"empty quarter \\" of Southern Arabia with some smaller trips included.These travels were with small groups of Beduon and camels. Why anyone would want to walk across the most hostile hot desert on earth twice is any ones guess. There is the constant worry about water and food and at the time the very real threat of being attacked by hostile tribes.There are numerous anecdotes regarding the desert life of the tribesmen which is a life of basic subsistence.The thought of being that thirsty that you would drink camels vomit or camels urine to survive is not something that crosses your mind these days, but I suppose you'd do what you had to, I suppose maybe.............A fascinating read first published in 1959. The only travel writing I have found more harrowing was Apsley Cheery-Garrard's \\" The Worst Journey in the World\\" and he had to walk through the Antarctic Snow to live, he didn't do it because he felt like it."},{"Title":"Arabian sands","review":"Arabian Sands is an intriguing, extremely well written work that chronicles a journey across the Arabian desert with the Bedu (Bedouin) tribes who inhabit it. Wilfred Thesiger describes in fascinating detail his arduous journeys into and across the Empty Quarter - a parched and for the most part lifeless area of the desert. As the reader travels with him he describes the interactions amongst the Bedu, their culture, habits and beliefs with intimate knowledge and honesty. He crossed the desert at a time when Saudi Arabia was literally on the brink of drilling for oil and deplores the inevitable loss of the traditional way of life in the name of greed. Anyone remotely interested in the Arabian world, the Bedu, or the trials and tribulations overcome by a man whose sole passion was to conquer the Empty Quarter will find this book compelling."},{"Title":"Arabian sands","review":"Great story.

Wow!"},{"Title":"Arabian sands","review":"There was a line in Leans Lawrence of Arabia to the effect that \\"only an Englishman could love a desert\\"; Thesiger is another in the line of desert loving Englishmen. After a life which had already been filled with more adventure than most men would dream possible, in his early thirties Thesiger was offered the opportunity to live and work as locust control officer amongst the Bedhu of the Arabian peninsula in the late forties. In Arabian Sands he records his experiences in Arabia, twice crossing the Empty Quarter, travelling to the Quicksand of Umm al Samim and visiting Oman while it was still a medieval feudal kingdom. But more importantly he records his experience of living and travelling with the Bedu, before their culture was destroyed by the influx of oil money. What he presents is an image of a people who have become perfectly adapted culturally and physically to survive in one of the harshest landscapes on earth. It is a tale told with much sadness from Thesiger's view point, as he comes to love and respect the Bedu and their way of life yet is painfully aware of the oilmen from the west who mark the end of old Arabia.As Thesiger observes \\"No man can live this life and emerge unchanged. He will carry, however faint, the imprint of the desert, the brand which marks the nomad; and he will have within him the yearning to return, weak or insistent according to his nature. For this cruel land can cast a spell which no temperate clime can hope to match\\""},{"Title":"Arabian sands","review":"In thisslender book Thesiger recounts several of his journeys though the Peninsula including the two crossings of the vast deserts ofthe Rub-al-Kahli. A fascinating tale, this book not only manages to skillfully capture our attention about a bleak and desolateregion of the world, but it also brings our attention to the people who live in these lands. Inhabited by fierce, fanatical, and aggressivewar-like tribes, the feat that Thesiger managed to achieve -- that of cris-crossing this bleak region -- is further accented by the fact the hewas Christian traveling through a fundamentally lawless region ruled by a series of very suspicious and ruthless sheiks. Add to this thatThesiger was a Christian, and you can appreciate the great efforts he took to disguise himself and use elaborate cover stories.Thesiger spent many months travelling with the Bedu and over time became accepted as one of them among the tribes. Along withMarsh Arabs and the first part of his autobiography, My Life, My Choice, he paints what is best described as a human but oftensterotypical picture of the Arab world. While he is quick to dismiss many of the myths associated with the Arabs, he still uses theharshness of the desert to keep impressing upon you the hardships and the bleakness of the terrain and how he still manages to surviveit all despite terrible and grating thrist."},{"Title":"Arabian sands","review":"What can I say that hasn't been said by others here? This is a terrific read, detailing Mr. Thesiger's trips through one of the most notoriously desolate places on Earth. It's a great adventure and one that should have killed him. Remarkably, the combined forces of heat, dehydration, bandits, hostile imans, hostile tribes, snakes, quicksand, starvation, and King Ibn Saud himself didn't manage to do it. Fortunetely for us, we're left with a wonderful, illuminating account of the Bedu people and their landscape - that while harsh and hostile - begins to take on an intoxicating beauty when seen through Mr. Thesiger's eyes.You'll be glad you read this one."},{"Title":"Arabian sands","review":"What a challenge! Living for years among the Arabs of old. Thesiger was one of the few westerners who made the experience. And he seems to be the last one who can claim to have lived as an Arabian nomadic tribesman. In our days it is difficult to find an opportunity to repeat such a feat as there are hardly any nomads left who give you the unspoiled experience. What kind of difficulties the author must have faced when travelling through the ever hot endless sand dunes of the Empty Quarter, can be very well suspected by anybody who travel on a camels back for just a few days through a sand desert and got exhausted by it.The narrative is much more than just a travel report. It contains many anecdotes of a real nomad\`s life in the deserts. But much more than this it is an ode about and to the Arabs, it is indeed all about the Arabs, the Sand is nothing more than a staffage.No doubt the author is an adventurer par excellence but I have a problem with him which other readers might share. He is just relating what he lives for, he is an observer, interesting enough, but where are the more sophisticated observations? It is not fair to claim from all great voyagers to be an Alexander von Humboldt who puts travel in and gets a depiction of cosmos out. But going through an \\"Empty Quarter\\" of southern Arabian sand deserts without emptying to a remarkable extent the never filling quarters of the human mind, is -sometimes - tiring on the long run.No, Thesiger is not a philosopher, he has no \\"wisdom\\" to offer, except to let the peoples live their traditional lives, whether they include killing out of revenge or insult or treating women in the Allah\`s angel given method or whatever.Thesiger is not very critical with the Arabs; he admired them. \\"I knew the essential decency which was the bed-rock of their character, their humour, stubbornness, and self-reliance. I knew that if called upon they could adapt themselves to any kind of life, in the desert, in the jungle, in mountains, or on the sea, and that in many respects no race in the world was equal.\\" Which is true for any race. So Thesiger was a racist? No, he is not constantly over-stressing romanticism. He is of the kind, I presume, who would have emphasised the preferences of any human tribe.Thesiger seemed to have himself such qualities he praised of his chosen customers, no wonder that he got along with the Arabs. He was just lucky not to fall victim of any representative of Arabs who assault, kill and forget to ask afterwards for the merits. Of course Thesiger is not blind to this: \\"Always reserved in front of strangers and accustomed on formal occasions to sit for hours motionless and in silence, they are a garrulous. Light hearted race. But at the instigation of religious zealots, they can become uncompromisingly puritanical, quick to frown on all amusement, regarding song and music as a sin and laughter as unseemly. Probably no other people, either as a race or as individuals, combine so many conflicting qualities in such an extreme degree.\\"Everybody who wants to get acquainted with the real Arabs, as we would like to have them, should read this book. And sweep the sand away with an iced drink!"},{"Title":"Arabian sands","review":"An excellent travel adventure through the Arabian deserts in the early part of the 20th century. For anyone who wants to understand the Arab mind/viewpoint or who just loves tales of far away places and exotic locales this book will make an excellent read."},{"Title":"Arabian sands","review":"Agreed, this is a top notch book if you want to know what \\"the \\"Bedu\\" life was like sixty years ago in what is now Saudi Arabia. In that respect, I'm in complete concurrence with the other glowing reviews. But, as another reviewer has brought up, there's something missing here: Thesiger. Having read this book, I feel I know much more about camels, Bedu culture and desert travel. I even feel I know and like Thesiger's Bedu companions very well. But Thesiger himself? A bit of a mystery.Yes, Thesiger mentions his dislike of machines and modern society. But, I don't really get a \\"feel\\" for what he's all about here. I suppose his perspective as presented here could best be denominated Stoic (although another reviewer speculates masochism may play a part). But, even then, Thesiger is no Marcus Aurelius, and any meditations or introspection are scant as the desert brush. -Can any reader imagine Thesiger meditating like M.A. on such questions as, \\"What is life but a warfare and a stranger's sojourn?\\" - Reflections, or at least the disclosing of them, are simply not his gulp of brackish well water.Others are obviously quite content with a narrator about whose inner life they know next to nothing. But I was left after reading this book with a listless, arid feeling, with any sense of \\"INNER cosmography\\" (to borrow from Thoreau) remaining unmapped."},{"Title":"Arabian sands","review":"The Rub Al Khali, the Empty Quarter, or as the Arabs called it, The Sands, is one of the most inhospitable places on earth, and one of the least populated as a result. Like Mt. Everest, or the South Pole, each of which became the obsession of some men, sometimes costing them their lives, the Empty Quarter became an obsession of Wilfred Thesiger. He was not the first Westerner to cross it, Bertrand Thomas was, in the \`30's, and then Harry (Abdullah) St. John Philby after him, but Thesiger is deservedly the most famous, due to this wonderful account that is difficult to put down. His birth and childhood in Abyssinia, in 1910, the son of the first British Ambassador, seems to have marked him for the \\"path less traveled.\\" To fully appreciate \\"Arabian Sands,' it helps to have read \\"The Life of My Choice,\\" his autobiography.The first part of \\"Arabian Sands\\" covers his youth in Africa, and his initial desert trips in Dhaufar, and in the Danakil country. The end of the book involves his travels in then \\"forbidden\\" Oman. The heart of his story though, is his two epic crossing of The Sands. Unlike other Westerner explorers, he was unsupported in his efforts, by other Westerners, save for the financial support of the British Anti-Locust Board. He had to live by his wits, establishing firm and trusting relationships with his beloved Bedouin (Bedu) who were the essential element in his success. In so doing, he developed an understanding of the conditions of their very harsh life, and enthusiastically emulated them. In addition to coming to terms with the \\"ship of the desert,\\" the camel, and adapting to the rhythms of desert travel with such transport, he also had to stay one step ahead of central authorities, and deal with the tribal politics, which invariably meant that some tribes would be hostile to both him, and his traveling companions solely for tribal reasons. Furthermore, since he was not a Muslim, he had to deal with those individuals and tribes who were hostile due solely to his non-adherence to their religion and beliefs, but Thesiger was wise enough to realize that much of the hostility resulted from the fact that all the other Westerners who were exploring were looking for oil, and the natives feared a loss of their land - it was hard for them, or even most Westerners to understand his motives of doing it solely \\"because it was there.\\" After his second crossing he was arrested in the town of Sulaiyil by adherents of the Ikhwan, the fundamentalist brotherhood that very well may have made an \\"example\\" of him, \\"to encourage the others\\", and executed him. It was only the direct intervention of his friend, Philby, with the Saudi king, Abdul Aziz, which secured his release.The book contains numerous excellent maps, which outline his trips, as well as the tribal areas. It also includes some excellent black and white photographs, many of them of his traveling companions. On a personal note, he inspired a passion to visit Yabrin, on the northern edge of the Empty Quarter, and I was able to see it develop into a significant town, over a 23 year period, a far cry from the absolute absence of people at this oasis when he passed through in 1948.I couldn't give the book a 5-star however. As one other reviewer indicated, it would help if we looked a bit at the man himself, and his reference frame. The book was written around 12 years after the events, and he admits to not maintaining accurate notes, so how much was changed in his memory? Certainly he experienced \\"comradeship,\\" like men do in war, but does that mean we should have wars for this experience? It seemed that he unduly romanticized the hardship, and bemoaned that the bedu would loose their remarkable way of life with the coming impact of the modern world. And there is no question that there are only a few real bedu left on the Arabian peninsula, as they have enthusiastically embraced the conveniences of the modern world in the subsequent 60 years. It should be noted that Thesiger carefully picked the timings of his travels, to do so only in the winter. If he had spent a couple of summers with the bedu, I strongly suspect that much of his romanticism would have evaporated, and the hum of an air-conditioner would be much appreciated. Also, there may have been more than an aversion to the modern material world behind his passion for the remote areas of yore - throughout his life, including his days in Kenya at the end, there was always a youthful companion with him.Setting aside these caveats, and realizing that the prism may be distorted, his achievements are remarkable, and we are fortunate to have an enthralling narrative of this vanished way of life."},{"Title":"Arabian sands","review":"A rare look at the empty qaurter of Arabia by a seasoned adventurer who obviously loved his subject both place and people. His assesment of Arab honor and harsh Bedu life give great insight on the Mideast today. One becomes attracted to the silence and vastness of the unknown deserts of the world."},{"Title":"Arabian sands","review":"Thesiger's background and his detestation of the modern world (just after the end of the Second World War) made him uniquely suited to live and travel with the Bedu. It is astonishing that so few Westerners should have traveled to some of the places that Thesiger visited, until one reads of the difficulties that he had to overcome. I found his book to be a thoroughly enjoyable description of a fascinating people and an intruiging part of the world."},{"Title":"Arabian sands","review":"Not only a magnificent travelogue chronicling travels in in a harsh, surreal landscape, here we see the age-old yearning of the explorer to discover the things which cannot be found among the comforts and conveniences of civilization,chief of which is a knowledge of what kind of man he will prove to be when tested to his utmost. Though Thesiger never promotes his undertakings as spiritual experiences,it becomes evident that surely they have as much right to be called so as any other avowedly represented accounts. His fascination with the ascetic lives of his Bedu companions with their fierce nobility and many customs of traditional Arab culture shows the desire of a searcher for meaning transcending the materialism of the modern West. It is a tribute to his integrity that, despite his admiration, he also realizes he is bound to his own heritage and could never be truly one of them. His descriptive powers are outstanding,both of people and places. This is the best adventure/travel book I have read to date."},{"Title":"Arabian sands","review":"After you read this, you'll never think the same of the \\"Empty Quarter\\" which encompasses much of the south of the Arabian Peninsula. First of all, you'll find it's not so empty, with the nomadic Bedu plying the dunes and oases of the region as they have for centuries. In fact, this story is primarily about the Bedu who are incredibly tough but also incredibly principled. Their moral code could teach us a lot. Their love for their camels, who literally enable them to live in their hostile geography, and for their fellow man is humbling. The author, an intrepid explorer of these desert sands, does an outstanding job of bringing the Bedu culture to us. If you want to more fully understand the nomadic Arab mind, you could do much worse than to read this outstanding book."},{"Title":"Arabian sands","review":"Wilfred Thesiger spends 5 years in the desert of Arabia in the company of the Bedu. This book is very well written and gives us a glance into a life that doesn't exist anymore. The Marsh Arabs is equally interesting, A life of my choice a little bit less. If you like Thesiger try also The lost world of the Kalahari by Laurens van der Post."},{"Title":"Arabian sands","review":"I thought this book was great. Thesiger was an interesting and somewhat enigmatic man. He claimed to disdain intellectual matters, yet his formidable intellect is obvious. He claimed to seek solitude, yet he obviously craves the companionship of the young men of the desert. He was among the last of the great explorers and understood that contact with the \\"civilized\\" world would destroy the culture of the people he traveled among. After distinguished service in World War II, he determined to cross the \\"Empty Quarter\\" of the Arabian Peninsula and he did. Twice! ARABIAN SANDS tells the story of these crossings. Certainly the trips were dangerous. He faced death from starvation and thirst, a hostile climate, hostile governments, hostile fauna (snakes, spiders, and scorpions), quicksand, and fanatical desert Muslims who considered it an honor to kill Christians. There is adventure in this story, but the parts that impressed me most are the introspective moments when Thesiger ruminates on such matters as the beauty of camels and the extraordinary generosity of the desert tribes. There are also some descriptions of circumcision rituals that are not for the squeamish. He claimed to be asexual, but he is obviously smitten with a couple of the young men in the book: \\"This boy was dressed only in a length of blue cloth . . . and his dark hair fell like a mane about his shoulders. He had a face of classic beauty, pensive and rather sad in repose, which lit up when he smiled, like a pool touched by the sun. Antinous must have looked like this, I thought, when Hadrian first saw him in the Phyrgian woods.\\" Thesiger's descriptions of the desert and desert life are quite vivid and poetic: \\"We had unsaddled beneath some acacia trees, where the wadi widened out. Soon, Arabs appeared from the pool staggering under filled water-skins, which they had laid out in the shadow of the trees. The skins lay there in the thin shade wobbling slightly like giant slugs, bloated and curiously obscene.\\" I found this an exciting, yet thoughtful book that I found much easier to read than SEVEN PILLARS OF WISDOM. Highly recommended. Five stars."},{"Title":"Arabian sands","review":"The exotic Near- and Middle-Eastern lands of the Levant and Arabia Felix were as unknown as possible for the average British or American citizen. But Thesiger was born to the expatriate breed. Familiar with the culture and fluent in the language, he was prepared to undergo any hardship to traverse the forbidding &quot;empty Quarter&quot; -- the vast desert in south Arabia. His narrative, travelling incognito and sharing the dangers and very simple pleasures with his guides, portrays a now-lost vista of dunes and camels from the REAL Arabian nights."},{"Title":"Arabian sands","review":"Excellent travelogue by Thesiger. Thesiger was one of those 'desert-loving English' guys. He traveled across the Empty Quarter (southern Saudi Arabia, northern Yemen, Oman) with members of several different Beduoin tribes. You get a great feel for how the Bedu lived and survived in such a harch environment, and you'll have a different perspective on the origins of today's conflicts with extreme muslim fundamentalists when you're through. Thesiger wasn't out for glory; he loved the Bedu way of life and the desert, and it shines clearly through in his writing. Interesting from beginning to end."},{"Title":"Arabian sands","review":"I have read many book on Arabian travel, and this is the best. (Bertram Thomas' account iS #2.)

I am now off to read the rest of his books and the Asher biiography of Thesiger."},{"Title":"Arabian sands","review":"When I was a kid I dreamt of being an explorer. Never mind that I had never been out of New England and had no possibility of doing so. Discovering new lands and peoples seemed such a great job. What I couldn't figure out was how you got BE an explorer ? What, did you take a course someplace ? Once, in talking of other things, my father happened to remark that there must have been parts of the Maine woods where nobody had ever set foot (I don't think he was considering the Indians). Yes, I thought, first I would explore Maine and then, maybe some other, more distant lands. As I grew older, I realized the awful truth. Unless you wanted to freeze in Antarctica, dangle from icy rocks on a few mountains, or chop your way through insect-ridden, steamy jungles, there were no places left to explore. I was a slide rule in a computer age. Ah, well.....Wilfred Thesiger was born in more fortunate circumstances for an exploring life. His father was not a small businessman in New England, but the British ambassador to Ethiopia in the days when all parts of that country had not been visited by Westerners. The first part of ARABIAN SANDS describes the author's adventures travelling in wilder parts of Ethiopia. After Middle Eastern service in Sudan and elsewhere during WW II, Thesiger signed on as a locust hunter in the Arabian Peninsula, trying to locate the then unknown breeding grounds for the dreaded insect. He did it purely to be able to travel through the most unknown parts of the region, the Rub al-Khali or \\"the Sands\\"; Oman, the Hadhramaut, and the southern reaches of Saudi Arabia. He travelled with small groups of Bedu (Bedouin) on camelback, always barefoot and dressed in Arab clothing. He faced thirst, hunger, cold, the risk of serious accident, arrest by Saudi and Omani authorities, and death at the hands of raiding tribesmen. With no available maps, Thesiger relied completely on the guiding skills of various Bedu whom he hired. He had no radio, no global positioning whatevers, and no chance of a helicopter rescue.ARABIAN SANDS tells the story of Thesiger's travels in the Arabian deserts in the years 1945-1950, before Big Oil changed the lives of everybody there. An interesting pair of books to read to get an idea of the old world and how it changed would be this one plus Abdelrahman Munif's novel \\"Cities of Salt\\". Thesiger hated modernization and cities and would have preferred that the Bedu remain in their poverty, but in a state of desert purity. I feel that he romanticized the Bedu and the desert environment to an extreme because of his own character. Nevertheless his descriptions of Bedu life, their culture, and behavior are fascinating, as are many of the events that took place over the course of his long travels. If you are at all interested in that part of the world or in adventurous travels before the world became entrapped in visas and metal detectors, you must read this one !"},{"Title":"Arabian sands","review":"If you like true adventure (not fiction), have a spot in your heart for nature, different cultures and personal hardships and challenges with a goal of self improvement and introspection, then this book should be in your personal library. If you don't have the above, you will probably find the text slow and boring, and put the book down before the half way mark.The author goes into some detail that is minutia, irrelevant, and tedious, and then all of a sudden, you find yourself re-reading the same few sentences several times in order to fully grasp the magnitude of what he just said. Amongst all the sand that he describes in the book, he'll also provide golden nuggets of insight into the human soul and spirit, and done so very elequently, just like an Oasis in the midst of a bleak desert. That is to say, it's worth the effort to get there.This is not a book with a &quot;plot&quot;. It's a personal account of an individuals travels with the Bedu. You can read into it Protagonists and Antagonists, but again, this is not a fictional work. Nonethless, you find yourself rooting for &quot;Umbarak&quot;, as the author is called, and worrying about other Arabs who would kill him given the chance, and there are many chances and near misses.Surprisingly, there are also bits and pieces of insight into the Arab world that help put into perspective some of the tensions we see today in the Middle East. While that is certainly not his intentions, he does touch on some things that are relevant today in respect to the Muslim attitudes towards Christians and Jews.This is not a book that can be glossed over and read during TV commercials, on the bus, or while the kids are screaming up and down the hallways... you need to focus and concentrate, and if your heart yearns for nature and adventure, you'll find it well worth the effort."},{"Title":"Arabian sands","review":"An extraordinary book, by an extraordinary man, about an extraordinary people - the desert arabs (Bedu) - before the outside world encroached on their way of life. Thesiger travelled through that inhospitable desert between the Yemen, Oman and the south of Saudi Arabia (\`The Empty Quarter') in the 1940s, most of it then unmapped.He account of exploring this unknown hostile territory, against a background of tribal raids and blood feuds and tensions where many tribes would have considered it an act of merit to kill the foreigner \`infidel', gives these travels an additional level of drama beyond the excitement of new exploration.The harshness of the Bedu life amid the driven sands with its intense cold, heat, and blinding glare in a land without shade or cloud is the everpresent backdrop to these travels and adventures between scant and bitter wells. Sometimes travelling for up to 16 days between wells, death was often a palpable presence at the very edge of the camel's endurance.The book is also a valuable anthropological log of these tribes, and their differing customs. The men is his party come alive in the sparse prose and a narrative pace as steady as the unfolding days. Thesiger's companions live in the anecdotes and black and white photographs. Listening to their talk the reader comes to love and admire those \`ships of the desert' (camels) for their patience and endurance and individuality, and to marvel at the simplicity and standards of honour of the Bedu tribes.This is one of the truly great books of exploration. It is even more significant however as a journal of human encounter, and a unique and tenderly perceptive record of a people whose way of life, which had endured unchanged for 4000 years, was to become irrevocable changed by roads and the impact of oil exploration.A book that educated Arabs give to Westeners to help them understand the Arabs.

Good reading!"},{"Title":"Arabian sands","review":"I'll admit I've got a deep suspicion of comfort and convenience, probably because they seem so inexplicably important to a lot of people. Sure, we can like our easy chairs; but without a steady diet of raw experience and unprotected (social) intercourse we lose our edge. Thesiger was addicted to living on the edge, and he was lucky and intrepid enough to capitalize on some sweet opportunities. He had the explorer's instinct to be the first one in, the humility to be accepted most places he went, and the intelligence to understand and record what he experienced.After living in Saudi myself, I still look forward to every opportunity I get to go back and visit; but they've got air conditioning there now. I can appreciate the unique-window-to-a-vanishing-culture angle, but at several points in this book I wondered to myself, \\"Why in the world would this guy keep going back to such a hellish place?\\" The desert may seem romantic from a distance, but to be stuck in the middle of one without food or water is truly heinous. Even the solitude he expected from being in the middle of nowhere was hard to find. Not many people today would choose to do what Thesiger did.It's interesting to speculate why Thesiger did keep going back: ego? masochism? love? Or did he want something we've been conditioned not to want anymore? With all the money and psychological expertise that's gone into advertising since Thesiger made his trips it's nave to think our desires haven't been conditioned to some extent, and this conditioning will not have been designed to make us seek out hardship. I worked for three years to recruit people to join my team in Saudi. That experience made me very pessimistic about the sense of adventure and curiosity in people these days.Thesiger shows in his observations that there was genuine curiosity at work. Love, masochism, and ego were probably also involved; but there's a strong possibility that Thesiger really did understand he was preserving a mosaic of cultures the only way he was capable. And it's obvious that the awe he felt for these dying, ancient ways of life placed a heavy responsibility on him that he worked hard to shoulder. Today, this kind of awe seems too often overcome by a strong temptation to bow down to the dollar... or the easy chair."},{"Title":"Arabian sands","review":"A rare look at the empty qaurter of Arabia by a seasoned adventurer who obviously loved his subject both place and people.

More importantly, though, Listener Supported explains how this rare medium ever developed in the first place. This is an especially important book because commercial talk radio, where loud opinion with no credentials reigns, is having a negative effect on reasoning ability.

The book would be more engaging if Mitchell displayed more personal passion and would have attracted a larger audience if he had chosen to dish behind-the-scenes gossip about NPR's on-air personalities.LISTENER SUPPORTED is worth reading just for the story of the machinations of Bill Kling, President of Minnesota Public Radio (a.k.a.

How Bannon deals with these challenges will fill you with delight and admiration. But this story has a deeper significance. Bannon is presented as a hero because he is superbly competent. He is a man who can get things done in the face of unexpected challenges. He is also a man who loves his work. To Bannon, work is not just a job; it is a sacred calling. This exalted view of work is very rare in fiction -- the only other authors I know of who have captured it are Ayn Rand and, in some of his stories, Rudyard Kipling. Calumet &quot;K&quot; is worth reading for another reason: it gives a glimpse of the American sense of life of a century ago: the sense that the world is a benevolent place open to individual achievement, where competence is practical and is rewarded, and where men are free to achieve great things through their work.

This book was originally published in 1901 and is more, I think, a character study than a plot driven novel. That's why I only give it four stars. Ayn said about the story herself, \\"It's style is staightforward and competent, but undistinguished. It lacks the most important ingredient of good fiction, a plot structure. But it has one element that I have never found in any other novel: the portrait of an efficacious man.\\" Praise like that I think explains why Ayn didn't get a lot of requests for \\"blurbs\\" from other writers but hey that's Ayn and that's why we love her. I like the book because the hero, Charlie Bannon, is tasked to build a grain elvator and every time he runs across a problem that would make anybody else quit or drive them off the project he doesn't get upset or snivvel he just sticks to it and gets the job done. Read the book to find out what crap he has to put up with and how he solves things. It is inspiring whenever you have to get a gargantual task done and start to second guess yourself."},{"Title":"Calumet \\"K,\\"","review":"I liked the story myself. It's a little rusty to start, however that does interface somewhat with the goings on, in the story. I'd be interested in reading more works by these authors. I clearly see what was inspiring to Ayn, in this novel. If you like her work, it's worth checking out. It's a quick and easy read. Don't expect alot of plot twists, or a roller coaster ride. There are no big mysteries to get to the bottom of, in this story. With a little plot tweaking, it might make a good screenplay. I had a good time reading this. With an open mind, maybe you will too."},{"Title":"Calumet \\"K,\\"","review":"Webster was a social novelist and this is (I believe) his second book.

This dull, uninspiring tripe about a man trying to get a grain silo built was her favorite book of all time! The only reason this book still exists in print is that her slavish devotees mimic her opinions and tastes to the letter."},{"Title":"The Bedford Incident","review":"A hack photojournalist and bumbling doctor board the Bedford, a submarine-hunting USN destroyer, and find themselves in the middle of a cold-war confrontation. The Bedford's relentless skipper - Captain Finlander - has little patience for passengers, and excludes from his crew anybody who can't help his sub-hunting. In brutal arctic waters, Finlander pursues his elusive - a Soviet sub. Hardly a creation of cutting-edge technology, the red sub employs a diesel-electric drive which limits its underwater endurance. Failure to hunt the sub will bode poorly for the coming age when the west will face Soviet boats running on nuclear power. As the hunt continues, Finlander pushes his crew to the limit, proving as merciless to them as he is to the Russians. Sometimes following, but soon dissenting with Captain Schrepke (who drove U-boats for the Kriegsmarine in the war), Finlander proves a man of singular obsession and fatally poor judgement in a game of brinksmanship at sea.This was a peerless story - the prose may not be memorable, but the book itself is unforgettable on so many levels. As a cold-war thriller (happily apolitical) or simply a story of men at sea, \\"Bedford\\" is largely unsurpassed. The unforgiving polar seas (where even the air seems to freeze), the claustrophobic \\"spaces\\" within the ship, the tension of the hunt - all combine to drive this un-put-down-able book. If you enjoy naval thrillers, and even if you've seen the movie, you must still get this book."},{"Title":"Human Rights, Labor Rights, and International Trade","review":"I needed this for my International Law classes, and I was very happy for finding it in this price.

A lot of great/easy to make recipes for any occasion."},{"Title":"Bob Marley","review":"Bob Marley was clearly a lyrical (not just musical) genius in league with Lennon or Dylan, and it's about time someone did an in-depth analysis and homage to the words of the master. Kwame Dawes is just the man to do it. He's a poet by trade with a very lyrical prose style of his own, making this book a very enjoyable and pleasant read. And unlike Western critics who often miss the point of reggae, Dawes is a native Jamaican who came of age during Marley's most productive era, and even lived in Bob's neighborhood for a time. Dawes uses his homegrown perspective to extremely good effect throughout this book, showing us that Marley's work was not as \\"exotic\\" or even \\"groundbreaking\\" as Westerners usually thought. Instead, it was based solidly in the long-term cultural, political, and musical traditions familiar to real Jamaicans. Dawes also has an even-handed take on Rastafarianism, explaining that it really is a rather undeveloped belief system (even in the eyes of the Rastas themselves), but it lent great strength and willpower to its devotees, most notably Bob himself. Ultimately, Dawes is very passionate about his subject matter, especially in terms of the background and influences that shaped Marley's art. But when it comes to analyzing the lyrics, Dawes is often too passionate.Around 80% of this book is dedicated to the lyrics, and the result is an often repetitive and worshipful over-analysis, as Dawes believes that Bob can do absolutely no wrong. On average, songs receive at least four or five pages of line-by-line analysis that is often overkill, maxing out with a very unnecessary sixteen pages for \\"Concrete Jungle.\\" Dawes often digs deeper into word-by-word coverage, and even syllable-by-syllable in \\"No Woman No Cry.\\" The problem is that his analyses rely on the unproven assumption that Marley actually put the utmost care into every single word as if he were a straight-ahead poet, rather than a songwriter who also had to worry about rhythms and melodies. Dawes' contention that every single aspect of a song's lyrics had the utmost deep meaning really starts to weigh this book down. He even assumes total meaningfulness in the pop/rock clich&eacute;s of lighter-weight songs like \\"Waiting in Vain.\\"There is also regular conjecture and opinionating on the biblical or cultural references that inspired Marley, and as usual, their weighty significance. This backfires with at least a few noteworthy songs, like the strangely short analysis (just three paragraphs) for \\"Three Little Birds.\\" In the booklet for the Songs of Freedom box set, Marley is quoted as saying that this song really was inspired by three little birds on his doorstep, but here Dawes unconvincingly makes references to the Trinity with no evidence. Dawes is clearly qualified to tackle this analysis of Marley's art, but his lofty conceptions of constant significance in the lyrics often threaten to collapse under their own weight. Imagine if someone did an in-depth word-by-word analysis of Dawes' poetic works. He would surely appreciate the student's efforts, but would he necessarily agree with that person's opinions on every single word? [~doomsdayer520~]"},{"Title":"Bob Marley","review":"This book is remarkable in a few ways. It's one of the few books on Bob Marley that is written by a Jamaican. It's one of the few books on Bob Marley that's written by a black person. And it's one of the few books that actually pushes the envelope of what we thought we knew about Bob Marley. I have a healthy appreciation for a 'home-grown' perspective and I'm grateful to read a black Jamaican's interpretation of Marley's art and life. There are contributing factors in Marley's world that are shared by others in similar conditions and of similar make-up. These 'others' are best equipped to speak on the cause-effect relationship of life to expression. Unfortunately, the myth of \\"objectivism\\" lends more credence to a total outsider's perspective to the detriment of a more intimate account. This author lays that to waste. He doesn't shy away from discussing Marley as a black man, as a member of a global black identity, as a Jamaican, as a musician, as a Rasta, etc.Kwame Dawes is an excellent writer and he strikes me as someone I'd enjoy sitting down to talk with. This is dense subject matter and it easily could have turned into an encyclopedia. He condenses a lot of background and tangential relationships into this examination of Marley's poetry, and he does so skillfully. I did feel that the book was a bit rushed near the end, and the last chapter seems to lack some of the polish of previous chapters, but other than that, I have no complaints.I consider myself a fairly good student of The Wailers, and I feel capable of exploring the references and cross-references with others, but I have to submit to Mr. Dawes' superior insight. There were cases where I disagreed with his lyrical interpretation on minor points, or his overlooking of \\"Bend Down Low\\" and \\"Bad Card\\" (one of my favorite Wailers songs) but for the most part I found myself paying closer attention to ostensibly small nuances of the lyrics and the delivery. I even found myself digging back into my long-forgotten copy of Kaya to re-evaluate my relationship with that album.The most valuable aspect of this book, for me, is it's ability to extract even more mileage from Marley's considerable legacy. The arrangement of the book into Marley's musical \\"periods\\" while associated with Island Records is quite interesting. I didn't buy it at first, but the author presents a strong case. His analysis of Confrontation was equally compelling. His ability to reposition 'posthumous' releases into earlier periods gave me a lot to think about and reconsider.We need more books like this, for example, the poetry of both Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer deserve equal treatment.If you are a Marley fan, do yourself a favor and buy this book, read it cover to cover. Write in it. Mark it up. Disagree with it. Keep it for reference. Then read it again. The only thing that would have improved this book would be an accompanying website for public discussion of the material."},{"Title":"Bob Marley","review":"I think this book is great so far.

As if \\"FREEDOM\\" meant \\"freedom to live in terror of the Paris mob,\\" or indeed, \\"freedom to participate in the random, vicious slaughter of innocents ALONGSIDE the Paris mob.\\" But in this book, there is no such thing as an \\"innocent\\" aristocrat. The aristocracy concept itself is oppressive, and must be rooted out through violence in pursuit of a \\"pure\\" France of poverty, random dismemberment, starvation, and despair.In this book, Paine considers ALL the authority of the past illegitimate -- all of it. All structures from family to piety to duty to honor must fall ... supposedly because it is \\"enlightened\\" to think so. Paine thinks the only thing holding people back from becoming truly transcendant beings (heaven on earth again) is those moldy old conventions. If this sounds like Pol Pot and Mao and today's \\"pragmatic\\" politicians, it's because revolutionaries from that age to this have borrowed these words in pursuit of their true goal: POWER. They've also borrowed the methods of the French Revolution -- terrorizing their own people and destroying their own nations.SO, my big question is this: Is it because of Paine that Jefferson failed to comprehend the evil of the French Revolution?How could Paine, who championed the American Revolution (a war to UPHOLD the long-standing British principles of natural rights and common laws, which were being violated by the Colonial governors) have written this book so soon on the heels? Was Paine secretly paid by the National Assembly to produce this? Did he instead revel in misery and bloodshed, was he a real sicko? One must wonder.The person to read on the French Revolution is Governeur Morris, the American minister to France after Jefferson's stint there -- his journals reflect the reality on the ground, and he roundly conveys his disgust.Gentleman Revolutionary: Gouverneur Morris, the Rake Who Wrote the ConstitutionEnvoy to the Terror: Gouverneur Morris and the French Revolution"},{"Title":"Rights of Man","review":"On time, and as promised. It's an excellent perspective on our ancestors point of view."},{"Title":"Rights of Man","review":"well, i finally got around to reading thomas paine's \\"rights of man\\". his sentences, like in \\"common sense\\" are run on in nature. but, to be fair, many writers of that period wrote quite lengthy compound - complex sentences. i found a number of errors, no, not the changes in language over 200 years. basically, i found nearly all of his ideas to be reflections or regurgitations of rousseau or hobbes or any of the other great political philosophers of the era and that which preceded it. the feature, perhaps unique and thus most worthy of reading paine's work, is the combination of logic with his flair for passion and motivation of the people to unite and insist on government's respecting their rights. written after the united states bill of rights had been penned, it clearly wasn't an effort aimed at the people of the united states. by the time this book was written, the people of france were beginning to get restless and beg for democracy and civil rights. paine, having moved to france, might have had some contribution in implanting the seeds of democracy in france. the conversation of the book wanders. it is composed of numerous documents and writings. overall, in order for the reader to capture the flavor of the unrest of the day, this is a well worthwhile book."},{"Title":"Rights of Man","review":"This book is important for the historian who wishes to get a glimpse into the workings of the mind of an important figure in American Revolutionary history, but it doesn't stand on its own. It is written almost entirely as a response to Edmund Burke's \\"Reflections on the Revolution in France\\", so I would not recommend reading this one until and unless one has read that one. Otherwise, it is impossible to judge the fairness of the rebuttals of Burke's points, as one only sees them through Paine's perspective, and Paine is far from a fair and impartial debater; he misses no opportunity to belittle his opponent's arguments, and even his opponent himself. I would not be at all surprised to discover that he gives an inaccurate picture of what Burke had to say, particularly given that history speaks rather better of Burke's misgivings than of Paine's panegyrics. Both books were written before the Reign of Terror that resulted from the revolution in 1793; the second part of this book came out in early 1792. Also, history shows us just how silly some of Paine's claims for a Republican, representative government are: 200+ years of representative government in the US have hardly banished wars, or the high taxes associated with them, even though the world as a whole is far more democratic than it was at his time. He makes some good points, and certainly it is hard to stand up against him in favor of hereditary monarchy, but it is apparent that he failed to see that not ALL \\"democratic\\" movements were necessarily benificent, even if it would be hard to have much sympathy for the autocratic regime that they overthrow."},{"Title":"Rights of Man","review":"This book, above all others, reveals the breakdown of classical (libertarian) liberalism into the statist liberalism of today. Although the first part of the work, being a refutation of Edmund Burke's silly nonsense, is stellar, and is well worth reading. Regardless, the second part, the chapter on &quot;Ways and Means&quot; in particular, is composed of the most despicable, anti-liberty doctrines that one can find. What Paine basically proposed was a late 18th century form of the welfare state, replete with progressive taxation, subsidies for child birth, and other fine statist amenities. Thus, as all of these things are, in his words, to be claimed as rights, the title of this book comes to mean nothing whatsoever. It is indeed sad that Thomas Paine has gained such an enduring legacy as a friend to liberty. In truth, he is actually one of its worst enemies, as he combines a just zeal for resistance to oppression, revolution, and reason, he sabotages his entire political philosophy."},{"Title":"Rights of Man","review":"The Rights of Man is a riposte to Edmund Burke's criticism of the French Revolution. Its message is the superiority of reason, in the form of Republican government armed with the Declaration of the Rights of Man, over despotism which holds populations in ignorance. With the American and French revolutions fresh in his mind, Paine was writing in a world on the threshold of freedom and that comes through in his forceful and forthright style. That said, and most important for the reader to appreciate, much of what he has to say still applies today. Paine in scathing in his critique of hereditary monarchy and privilege. He says &quot;the idea of hereditary legislation is.......as absurd as an hereditary mathematician, or an hereditary wise man.&quot; He rejects the notion of government laws being justified by tradition and therefore irrevocable. His argument against Burke's defence of the 1688 revolution in England is perhaps the best in the book. Paine argues that the only thing that is truly hereditary is the Rights of Man : &quot;The Rights of men in society, are neither devisable, nor transferrable, nor annihilable, but descendable only.&quot; The book is a superb polemic when both understood in its historical context and applied to world politics today. His arguments for reform of the House of Lords strike a particularly pertinent note. He expresses liberal doctrines that many people take for granted but in our own genocidal times Paine reminds us that many of the topics that impassioned him should continue to impassion everyone with an interest in humanity. The style of the writing may put off a few as many themes disappear and reappear throughout the book instead of being dealt with in a coherant whole. The fact that it was written in two parts and that he is one of the greatest pamphleteers of modern times should compensate for this minor irritation."},{"Title":"Rights of Man","review":"Thomas Paine's &quot;Rights of Man&quot; is truly a classic defense of self government and reprsentative republicanism. Paine copmletely demolishes Edmund Burke's defense of aristocracy and monarchy as outmoded and absurd institiutions. Paine shows the immorality of monarchy and the plunder that it commits on it's own people through high taxes,unjust property laws,and priveleges for the nobility. Paine shows the virtues a representative system has over the monarchial form. He denounces aristocracy and monarchy as &quot;frauds&quot; and based upon tyranny. The first review by Will Murphy critsizing Paine as a sort of statist is way off the mark. Paine did recommend many ideals of the welfare state. It must be remembered he was speaking to an age where a large wealthy aristocracy ruled alongside the monarch, living in luxury off the high taxes drained from the middle, lower and working classes. Paine was one of the formost defenders of freethought in religion,speech, and ideas.To imply Paine was a sort of 18th century fascist is utterly absurd and ahistorical. Paine was not an enemy of property, just an enemy of aristocracy,who in his day did not obtain property by hard work. Usually property rights in monarchial nations were written to favor the wealthy and powerful, and grant them priveleges at the expense of the populace. Paine completely destroys the ideal that a chosen few were meant or ordained by God to rule. If you love freedom, you can't go wrong with the &quot;Rights of Man&quot;."},{"Title":"Rights of Man","review":"\\"Rights of Man\\" (1791-92) is Thomas Paine's famous response to Edmund Burke's \\"Reflections on the Revolution of France\\" (1790). Although it helps have read Burke's essay, a general background is sufficient to understand and appreciate Paine's basic and groundbreaking arguments.Paine and Burke were originally allies; Burke not only supported self-rule for the American colonies, he also supported the emancipation of the House of Commons from monarchical control and the independence of both Ireland and India. Many of his allies, then, were bewildered by his fervent opposition to the French Revolution; Burke drew the line between territorial autonomy from a distant or aloof government and the total overthrow of existing monarchies and institutions. For Burke, humankind's real enemies were drastic change and \\"unsocial, uncivil, unconnected chaos,\\" and he proved himself a staunch defender of the status quo, of precedent, and of gradual reform.Jerry Muller, in his recent--and superb--book \\"The Mind and the Market\\" asserts that Burke's denunciation of the French revolution is \\"the single most influential work of conservative thought published from his day to ours.\\" (This, of course, depends on what one means by \\"conservative.\\") Yet Muller and likeminded historians inevitably cherry-pick Burke's more attractive economic and philosophical arguments and foreground Burke's critique, in Muller's words, \\"of the revolutionary mentality that attempts to create entirely new structures on the basis of rational, abstract principles.\\" (Muller doesn't even mention Paine, much less the example of the United States.) Such a focus inevitably sidesteps Burke's brief for the supremacy of European monarchical institutions and of the landed aristocracy. And that's where Paine comes in.With his usual acerbic wit and extravagant rhetoric, Paine, in the first part of his treatise, makes mincemeat out of Burke's sillier statements. For example, he finds especially unspeakable Burke's claim that that \\"the English nation did, at the time of the [1688] Revolution, most solemnly renounce and abdicate [the right of self-rule], for themselves, and for all their posterity for ever.\\" Paine correctly challenges the primacy of a decision made by members of that generation over desires of other generations, questions the right of any generation to surrender the rights of their descendants, and notes that \\"government is for the living, and not for the dead, it is the living only that has any right in it.\\"He also chastises the English for a system of hereditary government that virtually guarantees unfettered rule by children, madmen, idiots, and foreign-born pretenders (and he certainly has plenty of examples from which to choose), many of whom led their realms into chaos and terror without the help of radical revolutionaries. And Paine argues that wars would cease with the promotion of democracy and the cessation of the selfish interests of absolutists. His critics rightly respond that the rise of democratic institutions has hardly stopped wars, although one might pose the counterargument that, relatively speaking, democratic governments go to war with each other much less frequently.In the second part, Paine proposes a radical agenda for an overhaul of the British government. Although his anecdotally based statistics and figures must be viewed with skepticism and a few laughs, the prescience of his proposals is startling: poverty relief, social security, public education, maternity care, homeless shelters, workfare, veteran's benefits, and progressive taxation. His is the agenda of the idealist: \\"When it shall be said in any country in the world, my poor are happy; neither ignorance nor distress is to be found among them; my jails are empty of prisoners, my streets of beggars; the aged are not in want, the taxes are not oppressive . . . when these things can be said, then may that country boast its constitution and its government.\\"Paine, of course, had the nascent United States to cite in support of his proposals, but he and Burke were debating these matters before the onset of the Jacobin Reign of Terror, which dismayed Paine and seems to have realized Burke's worst fears. Yet, throughout history, for every Robespierre or Lenin, one can find a Mandela or a Walesa; monarchies too were no strangers to upheaval. Paine hardly argued for \\"mob rule\\" or even \\"majority rule\\"; the French Revolution failed in part because it violated the fundamental tenet that the citizens of each nation have a right to choose whatever rule they please, even \\"a bad or defective government, . . . so long as the majority to not impose conditions on the minority, different to what they impose on themselves\\"--a caveat we all should take to heart in today's political climate."},{"Title":"Rights of Man","review":"Paine wrote RoM while in France, during the early years of the revolution, in response to an antirevolutionary pamphlet from his previous friend Burke. There is lots of polemics going on, and the crux of the matter is that Burke makes light of The Declaration of the Rights of Man, which was adopted by the French National Assembly in August 1789, after the storm of the Bastille. The Declaration, written by Lafayette with some input by Jefferson, is a brief and concise document. It became the preamble of the constitution of 1791.Here a shortened version.1. Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions may be founded only upon the general good.2. The aim of all political association is the preservation of the ... rights of man. These rights are liberty, property, security, and resistance to oppression.3. The principle of all sovereignty resides essentially in the nation. ...4. Liberty consists in the freedom to do everything which injures no one else; ... These limits can only be determined by law.5. Law can only prohibit such actions as are hurtful to society. Nothing may be prevented which is not forbidden by law, and no one may be forced to do anything not provided for by law.6. Law is the expression of the general will. Every citizen has a right to participate personally, or through his representative, in its foundation. It must be the same for all, whether it protects or punishes. ...7. No person shall be accused, arrested, or imprisoned except in the cases and according to the forms prescribed by law. ...8. The law shall provide for such punishments only as are strictly and obviously necessary, and no one shall suffer punishment except it be legally inflicted in virtue of a law passed and promulgated before the commission of the offense.9. ...all persons are held innocent until they shall have been declared guilty ...10. No one shall be disquieted on account of his opinions, including his religious views, provided their manifestation does not disturb the public order established by law.11. The free communication of ideas and opinions is one of the most precious of the rights of man. Every citizen may, accordingly, speak, write, and print with freedom, but shall be responsible for such abuses of this freedom as shall be defined by law.12. The security of the rights of man and of the citizen requires public military forces. These forces are, therefore, established for the good of all and not for the personal advantage of those to whom they shall be intrusted.13. A common contribution is essential for the maintenance of the public forces and for the cost of administration. This should be equitably distributed among all the citizens in proportion to their means.14. All the citizens have a right to decide, either personally or by their representatives, as to the necessity of the public contribution; to grant this freely; to know to what uses it is put; and to fix the proportion, the mode of assessment and of collection and the duration of the taxes.15. Society has the right to require of every public agent an account of his administration.16. A society in which the observance of the law is not assured, nor the separation of powers defined, has no constitution at all.17. ... property is an inviolable and sacred right ...Paine contrasts this brilliantly utopian text with England's lack of a constitution.But there is not just the matter of principle, there is also disagreement over matters of fact.Burke had denied not only the French right to revolt, but also the reason to revolt, as the current holder of the throne was not known to be a despot. Paine's point is that the revolution was not against the king as a person, but against a despotic system, which divided and sub-divided in 1000 steps and acted by deputation. Popper's concept of the \`open society' comes to mind. The \`declaration' quoted above aims at an open society. That is not a question of the personal quality of an individual ruler.(I can't help thinking laterally, about a special country, which right now also has a reasonably mild and rational government, within the limits of the system... What is the leader of the revolution over here quoted as having said when asked about the French Revolution? It is too early to tell. Well, that seems to be apocryphal.)Government, wrote Paine, arises out of 3 sources:a)superstition (priest craft, think of Islamic or other religious states),b)power (dictatorships, one party rules), orc)reason (which i.m.o. is synonym with secular).Unfortunately we know from history that many cases which started out from reason went into some kind of hybrid state, down the road. Or worse, we see the effect of the \`dialectics of enlightenment': reason itself becomes embodied in power and perverts itself.The order of the day for us, today, is to struggle for the survival of reason in existing governments, or for the growth of reason where it is lacking."},{"Title":"Rights of Man","review":"In reading Tom Payne it is best to go right to the horse's mouth.

JIM"},{"Title":"Rights of Man","review":"gave this audio to my husband for a birthday present. He listens to this over and over again. Thanks so much."},{"Title":"Rights of Man","review":"The book is a response to arguments made by Edmond Burke that were critical to the constitution and behavior that resulted from the French revolution. Edmond Burke believed in the English constitution and the structure of the government in Great Britain. Mr. Paine argued the British did not have a constitution, the government was tyrannical, not efficient, a poor economic system, and not democratic. The sporadic alterations in the general design of the English government was not designed by the people voted on by the population in Great Britain, so it cannot be considered a constitution. The purpose of this work is to make an argument why the constitution set up by the French revolution is superior to the pre-Revolutionary French government and the current British government at the time of publication. No constitution cannot be established but through referendum.Thomas Paine argues that the equality of man is established by his very nature. His arguments come from the bible and other religious resources. The rationale for the rights from man come from God, but the author does not believe an individual religion has a monopoly on the truth. Pain believed in freedom of association and the organization of individuals in the making a political argument. He believed people of opposing thoughts could come to accommodation while they walked this earth. Anyhow he believed in the arguments of different world views could be made to come to the conclusion all men equal in his natural state.Paine argued government is formed either through Superstition (Religious manipulation) Power (war, conquering a people) and those that arise out of society (constitutional government). Constitution must occur before the government. The United States and France were his examples of governments coming from society. Governments that exist out of power or superstition produce a hereditary government or government ruled by a certain association not from the population or society. Edmond Burke defended the nobility. Mr. Paine made a distinction between government privileges inherited based on birth and the wealth obtained through inheritance. Titles are nicknames of legal sanction to have authority over others in the population. Consequence is not just unfairness, but a less competent government and the lack of fairness in governmental decisions. Distinction between people must be determined by the person's utility. Does the person improve society by holding a specific position of trust. The sovereign and legislators should be determined by the vote. Transmission of ideas through debate will improve the government. Debate is formed through association. People should be encouraged form into groups in order to form alliance to their point across. Society and Civilization, the wants of the people can be pursued more efficiently when a structure exists where ideas may be debated, thoughts learned, and more may seek participation. Some men have abilities that other do not posses. Society therefore the individual function better under structure but that does not mean all governments are equally as effective. Thomas Paine did not want the rights of a select few chosen through heredity protected at the expense of others. Men seek a fair government where their concerns are heard.Thomas Paine believed in the Universal Right of Conscience. Man does not worship man, but God. The mortal worships the immortal. Government should not presume or regulate how man worships the immortal neither should government define who the immortal is. - If man is free to judge his own faith his beliefs will hold what is to be true. - If man is free to judge another's faith he will hold or believe the idea of another God to be false. Thomas Pain makes the argument government corrupts religion. I have no argument here. But when he argues that government is the cause of religious intolerance that argument is absurd.The author saw the forces of history on the side democracy. Thomas Paine saw democracy as a major factor in developing the free enterprise system. He saw the United State as a major example of democracy and prosperity. Man was set free to go after wealth in so doing creating more wealth. He presumed France would soon follow the United States. Thomas Paine argued government sanctioned Charters (monopolies for the Aristocrats ) hindering ingenuity and the betterment of man. The more efficient the trade between people and nations the more wealth is produced.The author goes into great length to argue for less regressive taxes. Taxes on products hit the poor the hardest and increase the need for more in the population to receive aid to be able to survive. Thomas Paine was an advocate of a more progressive tax. He also argued for more government to those in aid by taking returns of investments and taxes on the wealthy.."},{"Title":"Rights of Man","review":"This book was written in 1790 and 91. It was written in two parts. It started out as a rebuttal to Edmund Burke's book on the French Revolution, but as it developed Paine ended up discussing the whole aspect of democracy and goes in quite detail into the ills of a monarchial government. Paine was an ex-patriot Englishman who lived for a time in the United States. His time there coincided with the American Revolution, and Paine was a contemporary of George Washington and Ben Franklin. Paine was an idealist and that comes out clear in this important work. He also made a lot of enemies in England with his radical viewpoints. His was not an easy life, but he certainly lived at a crucial time in world history, and his viewpoints are actually quite valid in some respects even today. Not an easy book to read, but an important work to make the effort to do so."},{"Title":"Secrets of Successful Negotiating for Women: From Landing a Big Account to Buying the Car of Your Dreams and Everything in Between","review":"I gave this to my wife for Christmas, she loved it.

The earth is being covered by a massive flood, which prompts scientists to build several \\"Arks.\\" This story primarily covers the characters in the first Ark. Concepts about making decisions on morality have given way to exploring decisions based on the \\"greater good.\\" For example, one character was a real screw-up, yet he was the only one who knew how to fly and land the space shuttles so he wasn't killed for the crimes he committed. And when they do find a planet on which to start a colony, they have to make hard decisions on who goes and who stays on the Ark.My boyfriend got it for me because it had a space ship on the cover. I really don't even read science fiction, but this book was an exception. It was very believable and has a great plot and characters. Even though there is a lot of reference to scientific ideas concerning the flood, the warp drive engines on the Ark and so on, it is written in such a way that its all understandable by anyone.\\"The Ark\\" is a sequel to another book called \\"The Flood.\\" I happened to read \\"The Ark\\" first and in my opinion, \\"The Ark\\" was a more interesting story. After reading \\"The Ark\\" it is hard for any other book to follow it. You do not have to read \\"The Flood\\" first to enjoy \\"The Ark,\\" although it does explain things about some of the character's pasts."},{"Title":"Easy Prey","review":"Before getting to the meat of my review, I must begin with the global warming controversy surrounding this book. Personally, I am a skeptic in this matter and shied away from the novel for some time due to my perceptions. Rest assured this is NOT a \\"man made climate change\\" disaster story. Oh, its pretty obvious Baxter is sympathetic to such theories, but he has not written this as a cautionary tale. Mr. Baxter leaves the issue open to each of us to decide.With that out of the way, I've read a number of interstellar colonization novels and short stories over the years. The typical story I sampled has a well engineered and fully stock ship heading off to the stars with one or perhaps two speed bumps along the way. Baxter's Ark goes way off the beaten path. Because of various political, resource and time constrains, Baxter's Ark is a God awful mess. The launch method is less than optimal, the crew is very small, the ship's command structure is (in my opinion) imperfect, crew dynamics are a mess, the ship itself has a Rube Goldberg feel to it, little is known about the target planet, etc. But oh how these imperfections make for a great tale!I did find some problems. Most importantly, the first third of the story concerns the contruction of the ship and the mission along with following the collapse of civilization as dry land disappears. I found all this interesting, but at times was chafing for Baxter to light the candle. Also, there are some issues surrounding the ship Baxter never really explains. A minor one that irked me was the Ark coffee-holic navigator who seems to have a multi-decade supply of instant coffee! Where is all this being stored?Other than some small blemishes, this is a novel worth picking up."},{"Title":"Easy Prey","review":"Baxter comes through with yet another page-turner. As long as he keeps writing, I'll keep reading. He's my favorite current author in any genre, unless Stephen King counts, but the King fiction I like best is 30 to 40 years old.Funny to say this about a 520-page book, but what I liked least about it was that it was too short. I finished it last night and now feel a sense of loss that I won't find out what happens next tonight!As another reviewer said, there's a lot of fertile ground for sequels to this one, and I hope Baxter is working on one."},{"Title":"Easy Prey","review":"Some of the science in the book really does spark the imagination. But the characters are so uninteresting and the story leaps forward in time so often and so much at a time, that it's impossible to care what actually happens to the people in the book.One theme Baxter sticks to is the difficulty of passing ones values on to new generations when the world changes around them (because the planet floods or they're born on a spaceship). He seems to be arguing that children are more products of their environments than their parents, which is interesting to contemplate.But other themes are tossed aside at a frenzied pace. Early in the book, he hints (repeatedly and loudly) that the United States has started euthanizing the elderly and that one character is being sexually molested. When these things are revealed with fanfare halfway through the book, you think \\"well duh\\" and expect to find out \\"well, what about it?\\". But nothing comes of them; they're completely gratitous. (You don't have to be molested to develop paranoid schizophrenia).Also, at the very end of the book, a shipload of reportedly brilliant characters realize they're short of something. That such characters wouldn't have seen the final plot twist coming a decade in advance is just silly.Interesting \\"science\\"; lame fiction."},{"Title":"Easy Prey","review":"I, for one, couldn't wait to crack open this book after reading \\"Flood\\". There are some very dark moments throughout this story, but I felt some optimisim from Baxter on this one. The ending certainly leaves room for more books. Baxter has already spun a couple novella sequels out in Asmiov's Science Fiction Magazine (Earth II & Earth III). I sincerely hope he continues to write stories in this universe."},{"Title":"Easy Prey","review":"After the interesting Flood comes the gripping sequel from Stephen Baxter, Ark. The world is mostly underwater, with a small number of areas left afloat. There is the Himalayan region, as Russia, Asia and India fight for a dwindling piece of land; a small portion of the Alps is all that remains of Europe; and there is a portion of the Rockies in Colorado. The Ark ship is starting to age rapidly, as the world fights for a very limited number of resources, as the years go by. Through a terrorist attack, the ship is blown to pieces and from then on the characters from Flood must create their own ships of refuge and leftover, floating pieces, with little hope of change or improvement in store for them. Holle Groundwater, daughter of one of the hostages in Flood, is left in Colorado and becomes part of a very select and &eacute;lite team for another Ark project - a spaceship to travel to the stars and find Earth II.The first part of the book is spent covering this team's training, development and education from children to skilled personnel, as Baxter jumps from character to character around the world, revealing the true state of things. The rest of the book is spent covering this Ark's trip to the distant planet far away, which takes decades to reach. Along the way the population goes through ups and downs, as they are put through the stresses of living and existing in this confined environment. Ark becomes more of a commentary on where humanity could be headed under certain conditions, as we are brought down to our \\"base instincts\\" at certain points. The result is a compelling novel of science fiction that will have the reader questioning many things about humanity, along with a multitude of \\"What ifs?\\"Originally written on July 24 2010 Alex C.

Stephen Baxter used to be an excellent author when it came to technology but a little on the light side concerning people. He has improved a lot.Ark is a very captivating follow up book. It took a few moments to get back into the storyline but once you identified the main characters you were caught up in the drama. Of course you have to buy the scenario that the Earth is flooded by underground oceans but that is the case with almost all Sf. If you don't buy light sabers, don't watch Star Wars.There is a lot to wish for when a disaster like this strikes but the way the struggle on Earth was painted out was from my point of view realistic if maybe a little on the positive side. How can you describe a world were almost everyone is dying and not be graphic? The struggle surrounding the starship was obviously inspired by the US withdrawal from Saigon in the Vietnam war.Life on the starship is also handled by Baxter in a way that I find realistic even if I fail to understand why no one made an serious effort to teach the children. The way people reacted and interacted, including the sex, could have been part of any isolated island story.The Ending of the book keeps you hanging there wondering if any of these now four different groups will ever make it beyond the next few years. Clearly there are more books to write in this series. I will definitely buy all of them."},{"Title":"Easy Prey","review":"Let me start off by saying I am a huge fan of the sci-fi genre, alas, Space ships and warp drives do not a good sci-fi novel make. The story is borderline hilarious and it feels like one of those incredibly corny sci-fi channel B movies: a flood mysteriously begins to take over the land mass of the earth due to VAST underground lakes suddenly leaking their contents up into the world's oceans. All of this beginning in the year 2012... come on, Mr. Baxter. Feeding off the apocalyptic paranoia that has sprouted over the years and mixing it ever so slightly with Global Warming he has created this mediocre story that doesn't seem to go anywhere for a good while.The story begins in the year 2040 and leaves you there for a couple pages and then sends you back in time to get the back story on the main character, Holle Groundwater... sounds like a name out of a novel filled with dwarves and dragons, but that's beside the point. The chapters that serve as backstory do not serve any real purpose other than to list a bunch of names of people you are supposed to get to know, in the few lines the speak and the very few actions they have. I could not sympathize with or empathize with ANY of the characters except, perhaps Holle. And the random scene of a young teenager rubbing one out for the pedophile teacher... could have done without that too, seeing as how it was already alluded to that there was molestation and underage sex going on. - no I do not have repressed issues, because I see comments about this from hecklers coming, it's just weird to have that scene randomly thrown in -Contrary to another reviewer, I do not believe that this author hates babies: the theme is about babies being the future of mankind, so it only makes sense to allude to the dangers posed to them on the journey and to have the characters deal with these events. I do not think Ark is some type of political garbage heap about Global Warming and whatnot, it's just a very mediocre story.Events moved by much too fast, and I feel that the entire backstory would have been much more entertaining and meaningful if the entire novel had been dedicated to it... so instead of racing through the lives of the characters at break-neck speeds, we could have taken the time to get to know them and actually feel something for them rather than just be indifferent towards them when they die or get left out of things, or get the daylights beaten out of them. The entire story could have been a trilogy: Flood, Ark, and then another novel that comprised the after-backstory element, as it stands \\"Ark\\" feels like one bad story with another 'could have been better' story quickly thrown in and just as quickly thrown out. And I chose to give it 2 stars because 1 and a half was not an option and I feel sorry enough to scale up rather than scale down.If you're going to read it I suggest you either: take it out of a library, buy it at a bookstore and then return it after reading, or just buy the book used because it does not hold up well enough to be read again and it is not something that anyone who calls themselves a sci-fi fan would want to have on their shelf. Final words: should have been made into a sci-fi channel movie of the week because it's just as easily forgettable and it would have saved a lot of resources being wasted on its printing."},{"Title":"Easy Prey","review":"Great theme for this book, building and launching a star ship and Baxter goes out of his way to describe a possible 'star drive', but the scope of the theme ended up being too much of a reach for the author.

In \\"Flood\\", the Earth's sea level begins to rise catastrophically in the late 2010s due to a release from subterranean stores. That novel is concerned with the \\"end of the world as we know it\\", in the 2010s-2040s. In \\"Ark\\", Baxter backs up a bit to 2025 and tells the story of a last-ditch effort to save something of humanity by building a faster-than-light starship that will take 80 specially selected and highly trained young adults to a new planet. The main character (although there are actually many) is Holle, daughter of one of the billionaires who help underwrite the project.As with all of Stephen Baxter's novels, the science in the science fiction is great and the verisimilitude that comes from having a Ph.D in aerospace engineering is much in evidence during the entire novel. The first half is about the preparation for the launch of Ark 1 and the second is about the star trek itself. There are several unexpected plot twists, and a number of very realistic and unexpected problems that crop up at various times. Although I enoyed the book very much, I have to admit that in a couple of places I was very strongly reminded of scenes from \\"When Worlds Collide\\", both the 1932 book and the 1951 movie (both of which were outstanding and highly recommended if you like Ark).There are several interesting characters (a few from Flood make small cameo appearances) including the crew's warp drive expert who turns out to have a unique psychological make-up, and several others who we get to see age from young candidates for crew selection to grandparents. There were a couple of plot problems - 80 people do not have nearly enough genetic variability to create a sustainable colony-, and there is one real baddie who would have been ripped limb from limb by the rest of the crew in real life I think, but who gets off better than scott-free here, but these are not fatal.All-in-all, an exciting and well done (if not entirely original) sequel that surpasses its predecessor.J.M. Tepper"},{"Title":"Easy Prey","review":"The unabated Flood spreads rapidly across continents with only the highest elevations of land remaining. In America, the Rocky Mountains is the last stronghold not under water, but that is turning into an archipelago. In 2025 as six year old Holle Groundwater and her dad make it to Denver, the last great American city, scientists predict total submersion in the next couple of decades. Their hope to save humanity resides with an Ark traversing to a New Earth II. Some oppose this as a waste of resources with only a select few leaving. Nathan Lammockson pushes creation of geodesic dome habitats on earth that will save so many more.By 2041 time has run out but Ark One launches with an elitist crew targeting Earth II with a faster than the speed of light technology. On board is frightened Holle who is trained as an astrophysicist and military strategist. She proves her choice is correct, as she contributes over the next four decades. Life inside the Ark One is miserable, but as Holle knows Darwin is right; cut throat survival of the fittest is all that matters to mankind's remaining few.This is an exciting science fiction thriller that initially follows up directly from Flood (worth reading first to better understand how humanity got here and what happened to the seas though Stephen Baxter does a nice job with the back-story) before soaring into space. The story line mostly focuses on life inside the Ark over four decades. Considering \\"necessity as the mother of invention\\" and being scientific-illiterate, the underlying theories seem reasonable. However, the use of resourcing to construct an Ark that if all goes right starting with the launch and a stop at Jupiter will save a few seems off kilter. Still placing aside the plausibility of opportunity costs, Ark is a terrific exciting outer space character study as those inside at times feel like sardines packed in oil.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Easy Prey","review":"I am not sure if the 5 star reviewers and I read the same book.

I wish I could give half stars it didn't quiet earn 3 just 2 1/2 in my mind but it was a good read. I was constantly wondering what was going to happen next. Mostly this book made me want to play the game Star Ocean: The Last Hope so bad it wasn't funny. My final thoughts is if your looking for a good sifi read that is in space go for it. Happy reading"},{"Title":"Easy Prey","review":"After having read flood, which was a very unique and engaging novel, I downloaded this to my Kindle. Ark is a sequel in a way to flood with some of the same characters appearing and the background premise being at play, namely that the world is slowly flooding. However, while the previous novel dealt with the discovery of the flood phenomenon and some Earthbound characters' attempts to deal with it, this novel covers an attempt to escape the planet and send a viable group of colonizers to another habitable planet. The story begins with the selection, training and construction process and follows through the launch and mission itself which covers many decades. I am not sure how realistic it is to think that a completely untested warp ship could be built and launched while society is crumbling under an relentless flood, but that aside, this is a very interesting tale of what it might be like to embark on a journey to a relatively nearby stellar destination. While most of the action surrounds the Ark, or spaceship, there is some reference to events back on Earth which gives a bit of closure to the previous novel. Of course this book ends by leaving open the possibility of further sequels involving both the people left on Earth as well as those who traveled to another planet. I don't read a lot of science fiction, but I do enjoy an engaging and well-written tale from time to time and this book fits the bill."},{"Title":"Easy Prey","review":"cannot wait to see what happens next. i hear there are two follow up books to be released next year."},{"Title":"Easy Prey","review":"This is the delightful sequel to \\"The Flood\\", also by Stephen Baxter. Set in the near future, mankind is facing the end of civilization as the world floods and every piece of land will soon be under water. The ARK is a government project to build a special spaceship to take a hand picked group of young people to a \\"near-bye\\" star that probably has a habitable planet orbiting it. From my vantage point there is a lot of solid science in this novel. I also enjoyed the characters as they moved forward dealing with one crisis after another. They are believable as well as likeable. I had a hard time putting it down."},{"Title":"Easy Prey","review":"Baxter has some reasonable sci-fi ideas but they're wrapped in such cardboard characters that the whole book is in danger of collapse. He has only three basic characters: brilliant young female scientist; bitter and angry young female; and GI Joe strongman. If you've read the prequel \\"Flood\\" you can just interchange Lily for Holle, and Thandie for Venus. The line of Helen Gray (three or four generations?) are all just the same character reborn again and again. One or two minor characters sometimes exhibit some interest but are usually killed off or disappear quickly as the novel leaps through the years.Baxter simply cannot write believable human characters. They're laughably poor, and those people giving this book 5-stars I summise must either not care about true human interaction, or have never read sci-fi by authors who do know how it's done.And why does Baxter insist on every launch, boarding, move or journey take place at the last possible moment? Again and again in Flood and Ark we have the \\"mad scramble at the gate\\". If you know the old sci-fi movie \\"When Worlds Collide\\" you can picture the cheesy action scene before the Ark lifts off.SPOILER ALERT ! ---------------And then there's the science. I've read the Book \\"Project Orion\\" on which Baxter bases his lift-off technology. It would have been interesting if Baxter had of taken to heart two of the main points of this project: 1) By far the biggest engineering problem was exactly how to get the bombs under the pusher plate. Some creative thought by Baxter here would have extended the Orion concept rather than just lifting it. But more significant is 2) because of the huge thrust, payload was never a problem. The Orion engineers imagined a huge ship full people & equipment.This leads to the question of why only 80 people? Eighty is too small for a viable human colony. Most geneticists put the minimum colony population start number at 500.A far more logical technical plan would be to immediately put people on the Moon (or perhaps Mars), establish a base of a few thousand people, keep shooting resources at the base for as long as possible, then construct an interstellar ship from there. Compare that to the plan where everything rides on a series of massively risky failure points:1) Every human aboard a single launch vehicle2) A one-year construction phase at Jupiter, reconfiguring the ship in orbit!3) A single remote probe gathering anti-matter using untried technologies with no hope of repair or replacementThe whole idea is ridiculous. And let's not even mention the by-the-way technology that's also suddenly (and simultaneously) invented that allows a sub to survive depths of 100,000 metres. Again that colony is pitifully small and certainly non-viable.No engineer would ever endorse a plan with so many potential catastrophic failure points.Finally, the starship crew. If they were any more wooden they'd all be called Pinocchio. You can't empathize with any of them because none of them feel like authentic people, just robot actors moving from scene to scene with no interior logic. It's totally unbelievable that they'd split into three; absurd that Kelly would decide to return to Earth; odd that after all their technical triumphs they couldn't solve the final landing problem; unbelievable that Holle could impose such iron discipline; and above-all depressing that not one of the colonies would stand any chance of surviving.I think Baxter should write half as much but take twice as long. A little more craft please."},{"Title":"Easy Prey","review":"The story was slow at some points, but it kept the reader interested. I wish that there would a sequel! Worth the buy."},{"Title":"Easy Prey","review":"Another tip, this can be a stand-alone book. You don't need, \\"Flood,\\" and, \\"Flood,\\" doesn't need, \\"Ark.\\" But I did way less skimming with this book so it's better than, \\"Flood.\\" It's not fabulous and it's not entirely realistic. I mean, if your life depended on it, you'd find a way to get along for years in a spaceship. Scientist had these people as children. They could have been raised more Japanese, of course, then the author would have to think about Japanese social structure and stresses. I guess it was easier to do the base behavior of the typical American at his worst. Ignore their children, become pedophiles, think only about themselves.And I think the ending was a cop-out. Oh, it's a red sun but when they get there, it's visually white so everything's fine--for those who will be landing. One the broad spectrum, I liked seeing how hard decisions must be made during a time of survival. I didn't like that a man who knows so little about human nature has decided to show us how absolute power corrupts, how you can't please everyone even when you're making the very best decisions to save people, they'll hate you anyway. I dunno, just seemed like he was exorcising his own inner demons on that one. A little too thinly veiled psyche payback.But it was better than, \\"Flood,\\" and I might read it again. I don't think I'd recommend it to people though. What I have done is said, \\"You might like this book, but it's not that great,\\" and shrug."},{"Title":"Easy Prey","review":"Let's return to the world of _Flood_ when the oceans had only risen 70 meters or so. A group of people get together and decide that there is only one way out of this mess and that is to move to another planet. Things are getting dicey at this point but there is still plenty of room for the refuges from the deluged coastal cities.SPOILERSThings are getting totally out of hand when the oceans have risen 1,000 meters. The government comes in and takes over the project and forces a reality check. The project gets rebooted and actually launches the 4,000 ton interstellar space ship using an Orion drive (totally cool !) while refugees are over-running the launch site in active gun battles. The 78 kids actually make it to the target star, split and some come back, some stay and half go on to another star.The book actually covers 50 years of building the space ship, launching it and travel to two stars. Well done !I have several questions for the author:1. the only two major failures of the spaceship are fires intentionally set by the astronauts ? I find that hard to believe since I am firm believer in Murphy's law.2. why does the FTL drive only go 3X light speed ? Why not 300X ?3. why do none of the children born during any of the microgravity periods exhibit bone brittleness or extreme height due to lack of gravity ?4. why not give the shuttles launch capability using Orion drives ?"},{"Title":"Easy Prey","review":"I'm suprised no one compaired this book to \\"Lord of the Flies\\"...in outer space.But all in all it is a book any lover of hard SF will love. Some reviewers here thought that the warp drive technology was far fetched. But in my opinion what is even more hard to swallow is the launch of the ARK spaceship using nuclear bombs to lift off the earth. I'm I the only one who read this part? To think that the ship itself would not be vaporized by an exploding nuclear bomb right underneath it is pretty far fetched I think. But aside from this, this is a book that is very hard to put down, in more ways than one!"},{"Title":"Easy Prey","review":"Written in a concurrent and future time-frame to Flood, Ark explores the pressures on a select group of young candidates as they train for and execute a daring mission to spread humanity beyond a flooding earth. Stephen Baxter pays homage to a couple of favorite old SF stories and incorporates to good effect Project Orion, a fascinating cold war atomic rocket propulsion proposal that thankfully never got off the ground. Conveniently, the effects of radiation on the crew were omitted, but that is in keeping with the book's primary focus on human interactions in unfamiliar circumstances. The technological innovations (while well described and interesting) are only a means to this end. For those interested in greater detail on Project Orion, there are references in the book's after-word, plus I can recommend viewing George Dyson's TED video, which includes a graphical representation of the Ark crew's launch experience, along with tables showing transit times to the outer planets.As other reviewers have noted, this is a dark or perhaps more realistic assessment of how a highly ambitious mission to the stars would eventuate. The characters' strengths and weaknesses are developed to good effect, making this more believable, if somewhat chilling entertainment as incidents with roots in the candidates' formative years impact the Ark's mission.I enjoyed Ark more than Flood, despite the fact that Ark has left several threads frustratingly open. While it seems to take forever before the interstellar journey commences, there is always plenty happening and the book could definitely have been longer without dragging."},{"Title":"Easy Prey","review":"In the future, a massive flood swamps Earth, covering every last bit of land. Scientists see this coming, and even while the military tries to safeguard the last pieces of high ground in the United States, groups of wealthy intellectuals are busy building secret solutions to the flood problem. Some scientists decide to build a spaceship.Ark One is an incredible piece of machinery, relying on technology that is invented even as the ship is being built. It will take on a crew of 80 young twentysomethings, Candidates who have mostly been groomed since childhood to be the future of mankind. Ark One's mission first takes the crew to Jupiter, to collect enough energy for a warp jump into the universe, where they will travel for decades to reach an Earth-like planet.Tensions are high before the launch, as Candidates struggle to solidify their positions on Ark One. Things get even more difficult as the mission continues and this group of very different people are forced to work together in an environment with no privacy and no escape from each other.The very idea of this story is terrifying, but I thought the way the people aboard Ark One interacted was fascinating. I loved reading about the subsequent generation of children and the cultural evolution that occurs amongst those born into such a restrictive and unusual environment.I thought that the major conflicts that ended up doing so much damage to the crew should have been better anticipated, though, especially in a group of people who spent all of their time together and should have been keen observers of each other."},{"Title":"Easy Prey","review":"There are a few weaknesses and plot implausibilities that make this less than Baxter's greatest work (Vacuum Diagrams, Flux, Exultant, etc) but this is still a great piece of science fiction. Offers a compelling portrayal of human exploration amidst an apocalyptic backdrop. Most notably, in addition to nuts and bolts on designing the mechanical components of the interstellar ship, a lot of thought has been given to human behavior and organization in such a closed environment. Not surprisingly, much significant problem develops in this, and Baxter offers some engaging analysis on the operation of systems of thought as being themselves mechanistic constructs, such that changes in leadership are competing patterns of hierarchy rather than just a 'good leader' as against a 'bad leader'. Also has an overview on the uses and problems of religion for social motivation that's vastly more complex than the usual SF treatment.This is a very useful book for thought. It's not necessary to have read Flood first, although it does help, and the earlier piece is a rewarding book in its own right."},{"Title":"Easy Prey","review":"One thing is absolutely certain about this book. Stephen Baxter knows how to write a good science fiction story. \\"Ark\\" is the successor novel to \\"Flood\\" where an apocalyptic sea level rise, first becoming apparent in 2012 eventually covers all the continents within 50 years. It seems that there are vast underground stores of water which suddenly decide to come to the surface. Whether this could happen is doubtful but it makes a pretty good \\"end of the world\\" story.In \\"Ark\\" a decision is made to build a star ship (the ark) to take a select few people to another solar system to escape the flood and begin a new life. There is also reference to a second ark but the location of it doesn't become clear until later in the book. The scenario is outrageously implausible, of course. We are currently in a situation where even returning astronauts to the moon in the next 15-20 years seems unlikely. To contemplate building a star ship with exotic technologies such as a pulsed nuclear engine to get off the earth and an anti-matter fueled warp drive in a shorter period seems unlikely to say the least.This is science fiction, however, and if you ignore the impossibility of the concept, it's a pretty good story. The description of the journey to the stars is very well handled. Some of the crew become psychotic and almost destroy the ship in the process. Various on-board factions develop and the children born on the way seem to be almost developing into a new species. While all this is going on the surviving humanity on the earth is also developing in new ways. Character development is very good, as in most other Stephen Baxter novels.There doesn't seem to be much hint of another sequel but you never know. A few things are left undeveloped so perhaps that might be the basis for another book. In general I quite enjoyed \\"Ark\\" but I didn't think it was quite in the 5 star category."},{"Title":"Easy Prey","review":"I believe flood and ark together constitute some of the finest works of not just science fiction but literature that I have come across in a while. The interesting thing is that in reality one could easily replace the flood with any number of global natural or man made disasters that could challenge humanity's existance as we know it, resulting in all too similar outcomes as portrayed in the storylines of both books. This realization hit me, and hit me hard. Needless to say I have had a very profound realization of just how fragile what we consider civilization is on account of this work. Great job Mr. Baxter. Hope there will be a book 3, or perhaps more in the future...somehow the story seems unfinished."},{"Title":"Easy Prey","review":"I am more than three quarters of the way through Baxter's 'Ark'. I am reading it slowly now, and with rather less enthusiasm than when I turned the first pages. Baxter is certainly a good story-teller (and I don't mean that in any condescending way). His ambitious 'Evolution' was convincingly gloomy but also fascinating, and scenes from that book will stay with me forever.One problem with 'Ark' may be that I had not read its prequel, 'Flood' (essentially 'Ark' part 1), but I don't think reading that book would have altered my main quibbles with this one. I enjoy both 'hard' SF and the more speculative kind, and 'Ark' is a mixture of both. I also prefer SF stories set in the near future, a world one might be able to imagine oneself inhabiting, and again, 'Ark' ticks that box. The threat of a global rise in sea-levels is one we already face of course, and it is interesting to speculate about what would/will happen when ALL the ice (in glaciers and the poles, permafrost, etc.) vanishes. I seem to recall (in a National Geographic article) that the rise would be in the region of a 100 meters. In 'Ark' the waters are rising rapidly, and humanity's desperation (the overwhelming masses of refugees from flooded cities and countries, and the brutal measures with which they are contained or deterred) is well described.But in order to create a truly apocalyptic scenario, Baxter has the waters continue to rise, higher than would be possible. The reason given is underground lakes containing huge amounts of water which get released, seemingly spontaneously, and add so much to the volume that it gradually becomes clear that every trace of land will eventually become submerged. Here was my first problem with the story. Do (or might) such huge subterranean lakes (effectively oceans) actually exist? Perhaps they might. But what makes them suddenly discharge all their water? Are they triggered by the sea level rise? How? It just seems too obviously a plot device. Not a problem if the book is more soft SF/Fantasy/adventure than hard, practical nuts & bolts SF, but Baxter's is clearly the latter.My second, and bigger, problem is with the think-tank (that hoary old panel of experts) and their eventual decision to stake so much money, time, resources etc. etc. gathering a kind of elite team to research (and eventually build and crew!) what is effectively, at this, near-future stage of our technological development, impossible: a space craft which will take its crew to a star system over 20 light years away. What will they use for fuel? Eureka! Antimatter, which can be harvested from Jupiter and will allow them to construct a 'warp bubble' and so travel at faster than light-speed. The building of a craft that might be able to harvest this stuff and the actual structuring of the warp bubble (never mind the warp-bubble-enclosed starship itself) would deserve at least one separate novel. After all the exhaustive scene-setting, the desperation and the hard politics of the encroaching flood, it seems weird that the hard science involved in the making and launching of the starship are really glossed over. The technology involved is far less believable, to me, than James Blish's 'spin-dizzy' or, for that matter, the 'double, double, toil and trouble' of Shakespeare's Three Weird Sisters.I have no problem with SF about humanity heading for the stars (Blish's 'Cities In Flight' for example), but if the novel is set in the near future, and is obviously attempting to be as believable as possible, then technology such as warp bubbles and antimatter should be handled with caution, if at all."},{"Title":"Easy Prey","review":"Baxter, as usual, out does himself in exploring the twilight of humanity. Multiple character viewpoints weave together to form a tapestry story which stands up to scientific scrutiny & demonstrates his outstanding ability to extrapolate both history & psychology over generations.A must-read for Baxter fans & a worthy addition to 'Flood'."},{"Title":"Easy Prey","review":"***Spoiler Alert***Utterly depressing. The stuff of nightmares. Read it only if you want to be haunted by the doomed. The only levity was in the Brit-speak vocabulary of the so-called \\"Americans\\" who were always saying things like \\"mind you\\" and \\"on the hop.\\"And how could the author be so cynical as to let the colonists of Earth II disappear without a trace---not even a few final paragraphs about their probably-terrible fate? Flood was great, even with the thought of humanity starting over on plastic rafts. But this sequel, the hopeful resolution we all deserved, was just more of the same. Without the fish."},{"Title":"Easy Prey","review":"I really enjoyed this novel having read most of Baxter's other works including \\"Flood\\". As other reviewers have mentioned, you just have to except the plot device that we could actually develop a faster-than-light starship within the next generation. Much like \\"Flood\\", this is a very dark story following people living out their entire lives in the most dismal of situations. Like his novel, \\"Titan\\", Baxter portrays space travel as a very miserable and uncertain endeavor. It's not a complete downer, however, with an overriding theme that human ingenuity can conquer all, albeit a little implausibly sometimes. The novel leaves open room for at least 3 sequels following the continuing stories left open in this universe."},{"Title":"Easy Prey","review":"Having read several other Baxter books, I found this now two-book SF series to be quite refreshing considering how other series he's either fully authored or co-authored. What I do like about the future Baxter paints in both Flood and Ark is that technological advancement seems to freeze in a not too far future, making this personally for me very believable. Although some of the technology presented later on (such as the collection of anti-matter, creation of the warp bubble and superluminal interstellar flight) may seem a little far-fetched - yet! - the author uses much of older and recent scientific research and discussion as background for his book. In other words, he has blended imagination and science in a very successful way.Unlike another customer review here, I actually do think you should read the previous book, Flood, to understand Ark. Flood sets the desperate, gruesome and gloomy mood of the everflooding Earth and an apparent dying humanity. Ark represents the faint hope that is presented at the very end of the first book. I feel the stories are inextricably intertwined and equally important to understand the series.The only reason why I don't give this book 5 stars is that I found it too short (!) and that it was a tiny bit less exciting than Flood.But if you like a believable story about exploration of exo-planets, a play on how we might escape the solar system with a semi-current level of technology well mixed with a good human drama - Ark is for you."},{"Title":"Easy Prey","review":"Let me enter into ARK by noting some minor difficulties that Baxter is not able to overcome. The sheer number of characters involved threatens to leave them undifferentiated. Some of the dialogue from Gordo, the old NASA right stuff archetype, and from President Vasquez might be interchangeable, for instance, and Vasquez herself is a model for most of the old women who surface and disappear in this ongoing catastrophe, but this novel is one of those rare works of science fiction that transcends genre, nearly the equal of more traditional literary forms, and it took my breath away from sheer relief to find someone who is a master of his science, with plausible if unlikely scenarios to dog our heels as we travel onward into this century.Liu Zheng's sacrifice as the aeronautics engineer who left an entire life behind in China for the sake of his belief in a spaceship sanctuary, brought the magnitude of the flood crisis home to me with particular force, but the entire novel is grounded in a disaster that could happen, and Baxter rightly spares us little about the price tag for our own lack of humility and gratitude for this stable terra firma planet.I also find ARK a telling political allegory about the end of American Exceptionalism, and the mythology deployed to sustain it for so long, and the hidden ugliness beneath our so-called civil convictions. This is without a doubt a masterwork, one which I hope to continue to enjoy as I buy up the prequel FLOOD, and Baxter's other spin offs in the franchise."},{"Title":"Easy Prey","review":"I have to give Baxter credit for the amount of research done on this novel and much of that becomes quite evident throughout the book. It will certainly keep many a science/scifi fan on the hook based around the theory and science alone. However, this simply didn't redeem the book for me and his disjointed writing style, where the book constantly skips months, years, etc ahead, is just not enjoyable for me. This time leap becomes especially problematic towards the end of the book when the jump period becomes larger and larger to the point where the reader is asking, why not just jump to the end already?In addition, we really have two novels slapped together in one book; the pre launch novel and the post launch novel. Much of the magic of the book was insufficiently teased out of the pre launch novel where the real drama was situated; this notion that millions upon millions were dying and beating each other to try to save themselves. There was something horrific and equally fascinating about the years of the approaching flood and there was an entire novel in there, just waiting to be written, that fully explored these events. This pre launch novel was where much of the excitement and interest was for me and I lost a significant amount of that soon afterward.The other major thing that the book never sufficiently addresses, why not just build a massive raft, platform, etc? It seems so obvious and stupid while reading the novel that engineering a massive floating city would be far easier than building an interstellar spacecraft. Sure, a spacecraft makes for a far more interesting story, but let's be honest about which option will save more lives, is less risky and has a much more viable chance of succeeding."},{"Title":"Easy Prey","review":"I just read and reviewed Flood awhile back so when the hardcover of Ark arrived I picked it up and dove in. I was already familiar with the flooding earth presented in the previous book and ready for the anticipated trip to the stars. When the book opens the earth is still in the process of becoming inundated. A few characters from the previous book allow the reader some continuity but many new characters soon become the focus as they train and compete to become the crew of the Ark, to be sent away from Earth on a multigenerational journey to a new planet. This beginning portion of the book reminded me of Ender's Game as we see those known as the Candidates through the training and selection process. As the years pass and the waters rise the designers of the Ark struggle to overcome the engineering problems associated with such a long mission spanning decades and light years. Here Baxter's use of modern technologies and some perhaps which are just on the horizon shines. The crew of the Ark faces many years together trapped inside the narrow confines of their spacecraft. The human drama that unfolds is certainly hard to look away from as children are born, accidents happen, tough decisions are made, and psychological pressures mount. As the best Sci-fi does, the human condition is explored under the microscope afforded by the years spent in close confinement. As I read this book, I felt more connection to the characters than I did in Flood. The use of modern science in planet finding and such I also found pretty interesting. Overall I enjoyed this book a bit more than Flood. I cared more about what happened to these characters and felt like there was some hope for their survival.*WARNING*I am docking the book a star due to the overly explicit depiction of pedophilia. While these actions had consequences for the characters, I think one particular scene was too graphic and not really necessary to get the plot where the author wanted it to go. I would strongly encourage the reader to simply skip this scene as they see it approaching and enjoy the rest of the book."},{"Title":"Easy Prey","review":"After the disastrous FLOOD (pun intended) i was holding my breath for the sequel. My initial pleasure was probably relief that it was not another FLOOD. And the story WAS interesting, the tale of the two arks, their separate missions and separate journeys. FLOOD reminded me of \\"THE DAY AFTER\\" in its fast paced global disaster tone. ARK is different, no instant crash but a slow downward drift, casting off hopes along the way. This story shows better structure and characters and yet many of the same problems persist.First and foremost in any novel are the characters and again, we are disappointed. As other reviewers have noted, none was likable or realistic. What does it mean when the most interesting character (by far) is insane? One can follow the lives of Venus, Holle, Grace, etc (only the women were even partially interesting) without empathizing or liking them. Of course it's utterly absurd that we faster than light travel in one generation. Predictable and yet implausible.Baxter just can't decide what kind of story he wants - a disaster story, space opera or survival tale. So he mixes all three with pretty good results. A follow-up about Earth II, Earth III and the still-traveling ship would be nice but I imagine they will be as depressing as these. I would also like to see how the alien signal figures into one of the new Earths (if possible). My grade - B-"},{"Title":"Easy Prey","review":"I read and enjoyed \\"Flood\\" and purchased this sequel with high hopes. However, where \\"Flood\\" was a page-turner, \\"Ark\\" was a long slog through deep mud.The story branches out into a number of substories that are more filler than anything else, and have nothing to do with the main storylines. I admit that I skimmed the second half of the book, and I'm glad that I did. The payoff was absolutely not worth it.Read and enjoy \\"Flood\\" (which despite what some reviewers have written, has nothing to do with global climate change), but I suggest avoiding this unnecessary sequel."},{"Title":"Easy Prey","review":"I really enjoyed this book because it contains my favorite aspects of Sci Fi: Hard science fiction and deep space travel. The characters were well developed and the story moved along pretty well. All in all, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Easy Prey","review":"I think this book was a phenomenal read, and was an interesting blend of science fiction with actual physical scientific theory. The book was a very fast paced read, with some kind of action and plot development happening on every page and being expanded upon. The book definitely has a lot going on, and has a highly multifaceted story line, with several different stories converging, splitting and changing constantly. The book combines phenomenal sci fi writing, with astro-physical, string and quantum physical theories, as well as with astronomy. The book is brilliantly written and kept me wanting to keep going. My only complaint with this book was that there was a 3 way split in the main plot and the author sufficiently follows up on 2 of the 3 separate subplots, but only hinted towards the outcome of the third in a manner that is very subtle and hard to miss (It is indirectly mentioned by a one liner, in which it can only be inferred to which that is the reference). The third subplot is not spoken about and is completely ignored... that seriously irked me.. if you start something.. finish it!The book shows a vision of earth between 2020-2070, in which global warming, melting ice caps and general environmental degradation has led to world-wide flooding. Additionally, civil war (religious vs secular), mass population displacements and an out of control government plague the United States. Lastly it should be mentioned that the world itself is ravaged by resource and land disputes and warfare as major swaths of land go underwater. The book focuses on the \\"candidates\\" for a special project designed to create an interstellar spaceship in order to find a new home world many light years away. As the book progresses political favoritism and social desperation cause violence and hatred within the main group. Part 2 of the book follows the flight through space and many of the internal issues aboard the space ship. The remaining portion of the book chronicles internal fighting, social hatred, jealousy, crime and psychotic breaks of the crew. I will not go any further with the plot details as if I do, I will ruin the book. Parts 3 & 4 offer some real thrills and real surprises.The book is a great read, and is very fast, additionally it is fascinating and the theories behind it are beyond interesting. I definitely recommend this book, it has a great ending and the entire book makes you wish there was another follow up novel."},{"Title":"Easy Prey","review":"It's hard for me to find a place to start my review for \\"Ark\\" because there really isn't much to say about it. I mean, how can I find the words to truly describe, what is, in my opinion at least, the best disaster novel in the last 10 years?There is no doubt that this is Stephen Baxter's triumph, the novel that he will never be able to top.Don't let the negative reviews fool you with their talk of unlikeable, unbelievable characters because that is a flat out lie. I don't think I've ever become so attached to a group of people in a novel since Stephen King's \\"It\\". Holle Groundwater, Zane Jerzy, Venus Jenning, you can't help but feel for them and their plight, both on the flooding planet Earth and about Ark 1.And there is yet another fantastic element to \\"Ark\\". It's totally engaging, captivating, and yes, even a scary plot. Think about it. How scary is it when mother Earth turns against you, flooding even to the absolute highest mountain, covering every living thing? You can't escape that, you can't go anywhere. Baxter has written the horrendous, almost gut wrenching details in a way that is so realistic, so captivating that you cannot, and I absolutely mean that word, CANNOT put this book down.After waiting 9 LONG, grueling, agonizing months (although that pales in comparison to the 40 years the crew of Ark one spent spinning through space) for this book to finally be released in paperback, I engulfed the whole thing (kinda like the rising flood waters in this book) in 3 days, just under 72 hours, eschewing friends, conversations, even a social life, so completely taken I was by \\"Ark\\" I'm not kidding when I say It is that good.Don't believe me? Give it a try. Not a single paragraph, sentence, word, or even punctuation mark is misplaced or misused. Nor is there ever a time where the science gets too difficult to understand or the epic lengths covered too long to get through. With an uncanny and incredible skill, Baxter has proven to be the absolute master of actually readable, and even more importantly, believable science fiction (and this coming from a guy who prefers zombies and bloodshed over alien species and galaxies light years away)."},{"Title":"Easy Prey","review":"This story has the complexity and development of both plot and characters that are to Baxter's credit. As a devotee of hard sci-fi as opposed to fantasy, I have to downgrade my rating of this book owing to the author's apparently deliberate ommision of how time dilation is effected by superliminal travel. A similar series of events in real life could not possibly unfold as they do in this book. Ironically, Baxter correctly, and with great effect, employed the time dilation factor in his book, Exultant. To elaborate further might spoil things. But if you're not bothered by relativity issues, this book will entertain."},{"Title":"Easy Prey","review":"I've long been a fan of Baxter's work, especially the earlier stuff, despite his cardboard cutout characters, because the science carried the day.In this book, the science is strong, but Baxter has been trying for a few years to do drama well, too, and he just can't hack it. I started getting a little repulsed while reading Manifold: Origin after the fourth graphic and brutal baby murder.You see, Baxter doesn't REALLY know how to write human drama, being a science nerd, but he's trying to be a more well rounded writer and so he shoehorns it in anyway. I applaud the attempt, but he's a one note horn in this aspect. Count up the number of tense dramatic scenes in Ark. Now count how many of them involve a baby in dire jeopardy or a baby being killed (at least graphic depictions are left out this time for the most part) or a baby crying or implied danger of physical harm to a baby. My guess would be that the ratio works out to something around 97%.We get it, Steve. You hate babies. Man, that's OK. As long as your violent anger toward babies remains in the pages of your manuscripts and out of your real life, I say go for it. From abortions, both real and \\"simulated\\", mothers deliberately abandoning their babies, babies being thrown over fences, babies being blown up, drowned, etc etc etc in your manuscripts it's CLEAR that you've got some issues to work out, dude. We get it. Lay off the babies now. Message received. Come up with a new plot device, or better yet, a couple dozen new plot devices for conveying human tension in your work. You're a better writer than this, Steve. Calm down on the babies.The plot is well conceived, the characters actually have some depth which is an improvement over earlier works. I'd give 2 1/2 stars if I could, but two will have to do because of the contrivances Baxter keeps throwing at us. He may as well have just included a photo of himself holding up a placard that says \\"You should feel tense right now. This is a tense story event.\\" instead of constantly hanging babies out to dry."},{"Title":"Easy Prey","review":"ARK provides a fine, satisfying sequel to the flood-of-the-world novel FLOOD from 2009, this set in the year 2041 when the oceans are covering the earth.

However, The Mystery of the Screaming Clock is in many ways even better. While Silver Spider was full of great action, this book is more cerebral and intellectually stimulating. In terms of pure logic, deductive reasoning, and plain old &quot;smarts,&quot; this book is masterful--the puzzles left by the mysterious Mr. Clock would challenge even the great Sherlock Holmes. Oh, how I would love to have been (or be now) Jupiter Jones. This whole mystery starts when Jupiter finds a screaming clock in the salvage yard and sets out, as a pure intellectual challenge, to find out who made this clock scream and why. Quickly, the boys are involved in a far-reaching mystery involving stolen paintings, an innocent man framed and imprisoned for the theft, an entire room of screaming clocks, dangerous thugs, and the singular international art thief Hugenay, first encountered in The Mystery of the Stuttering Parrot. I wanted to try and figure out the coded messages myself, to see if I could match the wits of Jupe, but the book was just too interesting for me to put down long enough to test my own deductive skills. On a final note, this book contains the funniest line of the series so far when Jupiter finally gives in to Pete's needling to stop using so many big words and says, &quot;Like, it blows my mind to the outer reaches of our galaxy.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Screaming Clock","review":"This is a great story! Like all the first dozen Three Investigators books, it's a whole heck of a lot of fun and makes you want to be the Fourth Investigator.Its also very retro kitsch to its era, but I think young readers that go for quality, plot or content will see beyond that the way one does when reading classic literature, Ian Fleming or Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.You adopt the attitude \\"who cares about their mode of transport or communication device, it's the story.\\"And it's a heck of a lot more fun that classic literature!The kids always get placed in a serious tight spots like being kidnapped, caught in revolutions in third world countries, captured by villains, left in sea caves with tides rising, a midst bank robberies, or almost run off cliff highways, but they get out of it by action and Jupiter Jones clever wit!I admit when I heard the title of this one, I was thinking \\"dud\\" and \\"how the heck are clocks going to scream or even be interesting as a plot device?\\" But it subtly under promised and WAY over delivered. The story is clever, moves quickly, places them in tricky jams, and allows them to use their wits to get out.After you read a few Three Investigators books, you know some of the plot devices and the writing formula, but they are all good and its like saying you know what comes after dinner--dessert--that's not a bad thing, or that James Bond will get the bad guy in his film--that's why you went to the theater, to see him do it.I was a Hardy Boys fan until I found Three Investigators books. I flat out love reading these books and credit old friend, Shane Black (screenwriter Lethal Weapon, The Last Boy Scout, Long Kiss Goodnight, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Last action Hero), for introducing me and getting me hooked. If anyone knows telling stories, he does. I can't recommend the series or this one enough.I would read the first 12 in order, but strongly recommend the Mysteries of: the Terror Castle, the Green Ghost and the Skeleton Key, as well as the Silver Spider which had one minor slow point before it went roller coaster.I also recommend getting the titles when Hitchcock was still involved as a plot device (intro and conclusion) and one can usually pick up decent editions in Ebay or Amazon used for $7.00 to $15.00 for a respectable and readable hard cover copy (only get the hard covers).Side note: If you enjoyed the Three Investigators books back then, now, or for your kids, I suggest you check out \\"The 7 Scouts And The Mystery of The Commie Spies\\" here on Barnes & Noble which draws inspiration and homage to the Three Investigators books among others then and now. It could be likened to the Three Investigators books present day and has been described as \\"the Hardy Boys meets Ocean's Eleven and Mission: Impossible\\" or \\"the Goonies meets the Bourne Identity.\\"Happy reading!"},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Screaming Clock","review":"&quot;Mystery of the Screaming Clock&quot; was one of my very favorite Three Investigators books.

Of course, I would never disclose the ending, but let me tell you, it's a shocker!"},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Screaming Clock","review":"I read this series as a child and am now turning my kids onto it.

The action is entertaining in the tradition of the Hardy Boys and is generally a bit more cerebral in nature than what takes place in the Hardy Boys.Jupiter Jones, Bob Andrews and Pete Crenshaw are three teenage investigators and they are based in Rocky Beach, California, as short distance from Hollywood. In this episode, they are investigating the theft of a set of valuable paintings and their prime suspect is A. Clock, the alias of actor Ben Clock. Clock's expertise was in making chilling screams for radio mystery theaters and one of his screams has been captured as the alarm sound of a clock.The investigative team is based in a junkyard where access to their abode is via \\"secret\\" tunnels, an aspect that will warm the heart of all adolescent boys. There is a series of coded messages of limited difficulty so that the reader has a good chance of decoding at least part of them. After reading the book, I found myself regretting the fact that the \\"Three Investigators\\" series was not a part of my youth. In some ways they are better than the Hardy Boys, a fact that I would have enjoyed."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Screaming Clock","review":"This book is great for all ages. I am not young but found it fascinating and intrigging."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Screaming Clock","review":"I enjoyed reading this book.

I recomend it to any Three Investigator fan."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Screaming Clock","review":"Item shiped in a timely manner and arrived in the described condition. Would use this seller again."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Screaming Clock","review":"This book is the ninth in the Three Investigator series. \\"The Mystery of the Silver Spider\\" precedes this book, and \\"The Mystery of the Moaning Cave\\" follows. As we learned in previous books, The Three Investigators are Jupiter Jones, Pete Crenshaw and Bob Andrews. Jupiter is the intelligent, sometimes inadvertently arrogant member of the group. Pete Crenshaw is typically the muscle of the group. Pete is usually quite fearless. Bob Andrews works at the library and handles records and research for the group.This mystery begins on the first page of chapter 1. The Jones Salvage Yard, owned by Jupiter's aunt and uncle, received a box of stuff, including an electric clock. Jupiter plugs the clock only to have the clock scream. Since the Three Investigators (We Investigate Anything!!!) are currently not engaged in a mystery, Jupiter decides to investigate the mysterious clock.The clock takes the three boys to the house of Mr. Hadley, though the boys thought the house belonged to Bert Clock. The boys discover a mother and her son Harry Smith living in the house. Their husband and father, Mr. Smith, is in prison for stealing valuable paintings. Also in the house is renter Mr. Jeeters. Mrs. Smith and Harry try to convince The Three Investigators that Mr. Smith was wrongly accused and Harry eventually asks The Three Investigators for help in getting his father out of prison.The boys soon discover that Mr. Hadley and Mr. Clock is the same person. The boys also begin to suspicion that Harry is indeed correct in telling them that his father did not steal the paintings found in their house. The mystery continues to deepen as the boys track down messages left by Mr. Clock to help locate a treasure. Others are also seeking the treasure and the boys encounter those others more than once, including being captured! The boys also learn that Mr. Jeeters is interested in the mystery of Mr. Clock and his treasure.The action intensifies until the boys eventually encounter an international criminal they have seen before! Will the boys find the treasure left by the mysterious Albert Clock? Will the boys be able to prove Mr. Smith's innocence? What is the meaning of the room of screaming clocks left behind by Mr. Clock? Where has Mr. Clock gone? Will The Three Investigators be able to decode the mysterious messages left by Mr. Clock? There are many mysteries for a reader to learn the answers to!This mystery is yet another of the better books in this series. The clues and their solution are interesting and potentially solvable by an astute reader. I recommend a first-time reader begin the series with \\"The Secret of Terror Castle,\\" the first book in this series, but this book will also interest most first-time readers of The Three Investigators.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"With God in Russia","review":"I read With God in Russia after receiving a recommendation from a friend. It is a very readable book, which I had trouble putting down to do necessary chores. I highly recommend it to anyone who takes the spiritual life seriously. This book tells the story of Father Ciszek's life in Russia, while his book He Leadeth Me gives the spiritual side of the experience. I was totally moved by his ability to abandon himself to God in the midst of the tremendous difficulties he experienced. I am sharing this book with friends, so they can see how much more fortunate we are here in the United States.Ann B"},{"Title":"With God in Russia","review":"Both of Father Ciszek's books ring in the truth of a 'spiritual awakening' versus our pretense at holiness via the intellect. His premise, that we must endure suffering in order to 'let' God's presense into our life to guide us, is the bare bones reality of a spiritual life. Or as Oswald Chambers states we must come to the end of 'ourselves'. Father Ciszek came to the end of himself after years of 'stubborness' and one ups manship with his NKVD interrogators, and realized the spiritual nuance of being guided by God versus being guided by ego.I feel I need not read anymore, but just experience my life as it unfolds moment to moment. These books along with Eckhart Tolle's books are essentials.'He Leadth Me' is the best of the two in that he wrote it after his experiences in Russia had a few years to synthesize----both are brilliant and humble.The Way of a Pilgrim is also a terrific book, but it was not written nor translated by Father Ciszek. He wrote an Introduction to the translation.In short all three are necessary reads for a Pilgrim."},{"Title":"With God in Russia","review":"This book is the incredible story of a Jesuit Priest who was Ordained in Rome in the Russian Rite, was assigned to a parish in Poland in 1938, and the following year after the Nazis invaded Poland, he and two Jesuit colleagues applied to get into Russia after getting permission from their Jesuit Superior and from the Archbishop.In 1940 they entered Russia under assumed names and altered backgrounds to disguise the fact that they were Priests. Fr Ciszek became Walter Lypinski, a widower from Poland, but he was subsequently discovered, arrested and sentenced to 15 years at hard labor for being a 'Vatican spy\\". His life in the prison camps was one of great suffering and of heavy manual labor. Early on he was imprisoned under the worst of conditions, thrown in with criminals and thugs before he was sent to Siberia to work in a labor camp. He arrived in Siberia in July and it was snowing and all he and the other prisoners had to wear were thin summer clothing which soon turned to tattered rags under the harsh conditions. He worked in coal mines, in an infirmary, then to the factory, then worked on various construction crews building the city of Norilsk above the Artic Circle on the Tundra. Then it was back to the coal mines and more exhausting work. During most of his time in the labor camps he still carried out his priestly duties: saying Mass, hearing confessions, baptizing, conducting funeral services, giving last rites, and even performing Marriage ceremonies. He said Masses in both the Latin and Oriental Rites. Through it all he never lost his Faith in God and he placed all his trust in the Lord's hands. Yet, rarely did he complain, indeed he felt he was where God wanted him to be- tending to his flock. This is the mark of a true Jesuit missionary. Even after he had finished his 15 year sentence the KGB still continued to hound him but he continued to tend to the needs of his flock. Eventually after nearly 8 years of behind the scenes diplomacy in America and Russia, his sisters and the American State Department managed to get him released in a tense prisoner exchange with the Russians. In October 1963 he left Russia, blessing the country even as he was flying out of it. He was truly a man of God, full of courage and Faith, living out a living martyrdom. He made many converts to the Faith in Russia and helped to keep the spirit of religion alive in Russia. Recommended for all ages."},{"Title":"With God in Russia","review":"Fr. Ciszek is from my Diocese. Our Bishop, John Barres, encouraged people to read his book, He Leadeth Me. I felt that I wanted to read about what Fr.

He relied on God to help him through those years not expecting to ever be a free man again.

He had the worst case of historical myopia this reviewer has ever seen, but such a trait may have been required to lead him to his prison ministry. He gets a fixed idea that he must minister in Russia. In seminary in Poland when the Russians overrun it, he decides on his own to enter Russia, obtaining reluctant approval at the last minute. When does he enter? You guessed it - after the Germans invade Russia. He picks a Polish pseudonym and heads for the front! Naturally, the NKVD arrests him for espionage, but after thorough investigation are totally stymied by the good father. They offer him a ministry at the front, but he turns it down, at a time when 40 million people are dying and the Russians are fighting for the right to exist at all. So, he goes to the camps. There he keeps the flicker of faith alive among the hopeless.

Fr. Ciszek endured the rigors of intense interrogations followed by five years of imprisonment in cells, both isolated and crowded, within Moscow. He endured another ten years in worker camps inside the Arctic Circle.In spite of the hardships, he managed to minister to a captive audience supplied by the Russian authorities. He heard confessions and said Mass with provisions supplied by the prisoners themselves, such as fermented raisins for sacramental wine, and a paten made of nickel.There were some minor disappointments. He had his picture snapped at Lenin's tomb days before he was airlifted from the national prison Lenin founded. For all the suffering he endured out of love for the people of the Soviet Union, I overlooked his touristy affectation. Besides, he DOES offer a prayer for Lenin's soul: &quot;He was a man, after all, . . . and he may be in need of more prayers than he's getting here.&quot;Also, I would have appreciated a few pages relating how he readjusted to life back home.This memoir should sit next to other prison crucibles, such as &quot;The Gulag Archipilago by Alexsandr Solzhenitsyn, &quot;When Hell Was In Session&quot; by Jeremiah Denton and &quot;Against All Hope&quot; by Armando Valladares."},{"Title":"With God in Russia","review":"This book is an illustration of unshakable faith.

In this book, Father Ciszek does not go into much detail about what he learned from his ordeal. He mostly gives a chronology of all the events that took place during his 23 years in Russian work camps and prison camps.In his other book \\"He Leadeth Me\\", he goes into detail all the spiritual lessons that he learned during his difficult years of imprisonment in Russia. His spiritual insights are very edifying and enlightening. He provides alot of hard earned spiritual lessons and spiritual direction in his other book \\"He Leadeth Me\\".So, while I would recommend this book, in my opinion it is not as good as his other book.Glenn Dallaire"},{"Title":"With God in Russia","review":"FATHER WALTER CIZEKS BOOK IS THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ IN MY ENTIRE LIFE BESIDES THE BIBLE.

I read all the time but rarely enjoy a book as much as I did this one. I was continuly amazed at Fr. Ciszek's faith and trust in God and ultimately how he even managed to survive such harsh conditions. The humility he displayed was inspiring and I wanted to read more after the book was finished. Definitely recommend this book!"},{"Title":"With God in Russia","review":"With God in Russia is an amazing book. One of my professors learned that I was interested in the Soviet Union and he suggested me this book. At first, I scoffed at it thinking that it would be several hundred pages of preaching to me with bits of history sprinkled in. I was wrong. This book tells of the life of a Soviet prisoner with incredible detail. This book isn't only a vivid description of a history that was erased and forgotten, but a story of how a man's hope, faith, and determination led him through a dark time in his life. I don't like to use clich&eacute;s but, this book is a must read. Once I got past page 50 or so I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"With God in Russia","review":"Even though Fr Ciszek tells his story in a matter of fact and emotionless manner, the story is deeply moving. Fr Ciszek's trust in Divine Providence notwithstanding his 5 years of interrogation at the Lubyanka and his 15 years in a labour camp is an extrordinary manifestation of the grace of God. His story gives an important insight into the madness of the communist regime - its obsession with the \\"rule of law\\" (far from it!), the strange politness at times of the KGB - a monumentally evil and irrational regime which somehow tried to cover itself in a veneer of law and reason but which was ultimately rotten to the core. Thank God for Fr Ciszek's witness to the faith in the midst of such inhumanity. AMDG!!!Incidentally, to get the full picture, one really needs to read the companion book: \\"He leadeth me\\". In this later book, he gives a commentary of his time in Russia and the hard spiritual lessons he had to learn (particularly in the Lubyanka) in order to learn to trust in providence. Without this later book, one might be tempted to just see Fr Ciszek as a man of unbelievable natural strength and see his faith as a gloss but in the later book he makes it crystal clear that at all times it was his trust in God that sustained him. God bless you, Fr Ciszek!"},{"Title":"With God in Russia","review":"This is an inspirational true story. I wish it were required reading for Jesuits today. They sure don't make priests like this anymore."},{"Title":"With God in Russia","review":"This book was really just so-so for me. As you already know, it tells of his 20+ years in various Soviet prisons and labor camps. I wanted to read this due to his being a priest and to experience it from that perspective, but he only touched on that, relative to simply telling what happened in a matter of fact type of narrative. While touching on his life as a priest he really doesn't extrapolate much on the spiritual nature -- he leaves that to his much betterHe Leadeth Me, which I do recommend. Since that is the case, you are left simply with a narrative of what he went through over those years, and that is why was just OK for me. After readingOne Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich,The Gulag Archipelago Volume 1: An Experiment in Literary Investigation (P.S.), and evenMemoirs from the House of the Dead (Oxford World's Classics), the tales told, as crazy and terrible as they were, start to run together."},{"Title":"Race in the Jury Box: Affirmative Action in Jury Selection (Suny Series in New Directions in Crime and Justice Studies)","review":"Very informative and view-altering book.

The book also covers the different forms of the selection of \\"fair\\" juries and discusses why affirmative juries are needed in the United States."},{"Title":"The Rebel Angels","review":"There are two narrators in THE REBEL ANGELS. The first is Maria Magdalene Theotoky, a 23 year old grad student at a Canadian university with professional interest in Rabelais. The six sections of this novel that she narrates are headed \\"Second Paradise\\", which may be a reference to her transition from being a brilliant student with a crush on her mentor to woman happy in marriage with another man. As she makes this transition, she is helped by three older men who are academics. These are Maria's Rebel Angels who, individually, \\"take something of a woman's innocence as he leads her toward a larger world and an ampler life.\\"This novel's second narrator is Simon Darcourt, an Anglican minister who teaches Greek at Maria's university and becomes interested in writing a new version of Aubrey's \\"Brief Lives\\", which Wikipedia tells me is a gossipy on-the-scene glimpse of prominent Englishmen who lived in the late seventeenth century. The chapters Darcourt narrates are called \\"The New Aubrey\\" and they certainly provide an insightful view of nasty rivalries, arrogance, and raunchy proclivities in academia.These two narratives push the story of TRA forward in different fashions. When Maria narrates, we learn of her interaction with her rebel angels, as well as with her gypsy--yes, gypsy--mother. When interacting with her professors, the young Maria has the unbelievable voice of an erudite middle age male, not a young woman learning her trade. When interacting with her mother, she is the dependent and bewildered daughter of a \\"cultural anachronism\\" who believes in tarot cards, curses, and spells, and carries on a shady trade with rare violins. In TRA, Maria is supposed to be exploring both the \\"crown and root of her tree\\"--that is, her academic future and her gypsy heritage. But she seems to exist primarily to enable Davies to make brilliant arguments via several characters/mouthpieces. It's high-level stuff but not persuasive.Meanwhile, Darcourt, a decent fellow, begins his narration in a world of professional expertise and then leads the reader through satires of scientific research (its subject is excrement) and novelists and publishing. In Darcourt's narration, there is also a dash of professional treachery, a gay sex fantasy, a murder, and nearly 20 pages of tedious (but brilliant I suppose) academic chit-chat at a dinner party, which is his New Aubrey. Once again, there are great lines and insightful and lyrical moments. But the great talents of Davies and his weird obsessions overwhelm his characters.Strip away its satires and philosophical disputation and TRA is mostly about Maria and her search for a mate. But this occurs primarily among wordy middle-aged professors who are happy as scholars and bachelors or are outr&eacute; gay. These males, in other words, are never suitable potential mates or plausible options, especially for Maria in her gypsy mode. The upshot is that TRA is a romance without any true passion or narrative momentum, with Davies moving his story from this to that and ultimately ending with a contrivance.Rounded up to four stars."},{"Title":"The Rebel Angels","review":"It has been a while since I read this so this review is long overdue and may be a bit vague but I am on holiday and I don't really care.The Rebel Angels by Robertson Davies is the first inThe Cornish Trilogy. Not, as I had assumed for the several years the books sat on my shelves, anything to do with Cornwall; the title instead relates to Francis Cornish, a rich philanthropist and art collector who conveniently dies at the beginning of the book, thus setting in motion the bleak, dark comedy that is to follow.His collection is a rambling mess, piled up in a dusty apartment, and the job of sorting through it falls to three of his friends, all professors at The College of St John and the Holy Ghost. They will allocate the works to the various museums and galleries to which they have been donated and can, for their efforts, select one item each to keep themselves.Which leads to a clandestine and competitive search for a lost Rabelais manuscript supposedly hidden somewhere within the piles.This background story is embellished with the goings on at the college itself. One of the professors is coping with the aftermath of an illicit encounter on a sofa with a student. And by coping, I mean pretending it never happened. She, on the other hand, is in love with the old duffer and spending every hour she can helping him in his offices.But then Brother Parlabane turns up. An ex-faculty member now a monk who has gone off the rails, he acts as the catalyst for all manner of goings on. His appearance gives the various story strands a kick up the arse and sends them off in a number of dramatic, comic, rather rude and tragic directions. He appears to be an eloquent yet bumbling eccentric but you sense a cruel heart beneath it all. He reminded me of Bunny inThe Secret History, and The Rebel Angels certainly has the same sense of campus community, gossip, secrets, rivalry and slight other-worldliness of Donna Tartt's modern classic.The book is also populated by a fine supporting cast of characters such as Cornish's nephew - a businessman with seemingly no interest in art at all - and a mad professor squirreled away in his laboratory studying the science of, well shall we say, poo.The Rebel Angels is both intensely serious and delightfully silly at the same time. I opened the book with zero expectations as I really knew next to nothing about it and ended up sailing through it in a couple of days and relishing every opportunity I had to spend time with it. There are two more books in the trilogy and I will certainly read on. The second in the series,What's Bred in the Bone, was shortlisted for the Booker Prize which I am taking as a good sign.I have also subsequently picked up some more books by Robertson Davies. He is one of the (few?) giants of Canadian literature and I suspect I will be reading a lot more of his work."},{"Title":"The Rebel Angels","review":"This is a very literate book, full of a great deal of philosophy and academic intellectualism. It is also witty and well written and tells a fascinating story through the voices of two narrators: Maria Magdalena Theotoky, a graduate student, and Simon Darcourt, a university professor and Anglican priest.Darcourt and two other professors--Clem Hollier and Urquhart McVarish-- are given the task of sorting out the collection of the recently-deceased Francis Cornish, a great collector of valuable art, books, and manuscripts.Hollier knows that among the manuscripts is one by Rabelais that he wants very badly to get his hands on, to work on with his student Maria. The manuscript, however, is not among the collections. Hollier suspects that McVarish has it, but he denies it.Hollier becomes obsessed with getting the manuscript, and even tries to enlist the aid of Maria's gypsy mother to put a curse on McVarish.Meanwhile, John Parlabane, an old friend of Hollier and Darcourt, turns up on the doorstep, having run away from the monastery he had joined after decades of debauched living. He proceeds to sponge off the two men, as well as Maria, \\"borrowing\\" money from all of them, but never seeming to improve his lot in life. He sets out to write a great novel, and when it fails to interest publishers, he comes up with a fiendish way to get the book published, as well as to help Hollier and Maria.It's definitely intriguing and makes one eager to read the next two books in this trilogy."},{"Title":"The Rebel Angels","review":"I was at my favorite second hand bookstore, and picked The Rebel Angels up on a whim. I had been looking for something that I could not find. I honestly no longer remember what I was originally looking for-- nor do I know what possessed me to pick this little Davies novel from the shelf. I can only tell you that I am glad that I did.The Rebel Angels is everything I like in a novel. Academics, art, philosophy, history and romance-- all tied up in a witty and well-written package. I would call it a cozy for intellectuals, but that would be unfair and making it sound a little bit more trivial than it is. Still, there is something to the description. It made me feel good to read it. It manages to convey experience without ever falling prey to cynicism. This is no mean feat.When Parlabane comes back, Maria Theotoky is not quite sure what it is going to mean for her and her desired romance with her professor/advisor Clem Hollier. She only knows that once she meets him, she does not like him, and she does not trust the influence that he will have on her future.The Rebel Angels is told by turns from the point of view of Maria and Reverend Simon Darcourt. Although the shifting voices took some getting used to, the device worked well and by the end of the book I found nothing jarring about the transitions.Highly recommended, particularly if academic fiction is one of your interests."},{"Title":"The Rebel Angels","review":"I had to give this wonderful book 5 stars even though there are some flaws in the plot that are especially evident toward the end of the novel. HOwever, it is a delightful read, full of history, and philosophy, and base instincts wrapped up as academic intellectual whimsey.The beautiful, brilliant and wealthy Maria Theotoky is a Ph.D. graduate student who becomes involved in an interesting academic power struggle for both her affections and for a discovered manuscript from the Middle Ages. He major professor, Clem Hollier; another professor who narrates much of the book, the Reverend, Simon Darcourt; a renegade gay dope-addict monk, Brother Parlabane; and a bright young billionaire, Francis Cornish, all compete for her mind, her attention, her love and finally, her hand in marriage.Clever, witty, intelligent, absurd, and insightful are the odd mix that describes this book. It is Jungian in it symbolism but also very knowing of university politics and ambitions. It is amusing and thoughtful, entertaining and stimulating. It is a winner."},{"Title":"The Rebel Angels","review":"It took me a couple pages to catch on to the way Davies constructed this novel. It's written in six sets of chapter couplets, which made for a really unique storyline. Two narrators take their turn in describing the current thread of the story... one is the beautiful and brilliant student of Comparative Literature, Maria Theotoky. The other is Professor Simon Darcourt who teaches New Testament Greek. He is not the only professor of the University who acknowledges that Maria is among the &quot;scholarly elect&quot;... Darcourt becomes enamored of her, but she has already become the special pet of Professor Hollier. His impetuous seduction of her leaves her a bit bewildered, for rather than the continued intimacy she desires from this man she greatly admires, he becomes distant. When his eccentric longtime friend John Parlabane returns for a visit (which never ends) the relationship between Maria and Hollier becomes even more confined to that of professor - research assistant.Meanwhile, a wealthy art collecter (Arthur Cornish) passes away and leaves his estate to be settled by three executors, all of them being professors at the University. They are Hollier, Darcourt, and a true nut by the name of McVarish. As they go through the mountain of Cornish's priceless items, Hollier becomes obsessed with the recovery of a manuscript of Rabelais which he is convinced McVarish once purloined and never returned. McVarish denies ever having borrowed the papers from Cornish, but Hollier will not give up. His obsession is motivated and fueled by the fact that the authentic document would greatly advance Maria in her own doctoral work on Rabelais, and he longs to do something tangible that will atone for his earlier seduction of her.Without ruining some of the comic turns in this story for those who haven't read it, I will hint that it is ingenious how Davies knits the eccentricity of Parlabane and the extra-curricular nightime perversions of McVarish together in a way that becomes the ONLY way the above dilemna (of the missing manuscript) could be solved. And not before Hollier himself has degenerated into a superstitious nut in his own right. Being a bit of a nut myself made this book all the more enjoyable!"},{"Title":"The Rebel Angels","review":"In a tranquil Canadian University a voice spreads: Parlabane is back! Cave!Cave!, Molesworth would say. Cerebral and celebrate scholars, fascinating student girls, modern-style mecenates and unconventional researchers will soon find their lives upset by the most Rebel of the Rebel Angels. A disgraced teacher,Parlabane is philosophically contradictory, insolent, taking everyone for a ride in his absolutely anarchic world, and is the pivotal personnage of this wonderful novel. His ex-colleagues are also involved in the inventory of an inherited literary and artistic treasure, from which an important Rabelais' manuscript is missing.A literary puzzle that will be solved in a very bizarre manner.All is wonderful in this novel: the irony, the depiction of theacademic world, the charachters beautifully detailed like Beerbohm caricatures, the great arcane erudition of Robertson Davies, and a marvelous story whose unpredictable end is absolutely unique. A gem of a book, whit an exquisitely arcane flavor"},{"Title":"The Rebel Angels","review":"I've resisted this writer for years out of a silly bias against academic novels. This one has converted me (to Davies, if not the genre). The exaggerated eloquence of his characters goes down smooth, and the breadth of his erudition is breathtaking--from Gypsy violin repair practices to Gnostic gospels to human scatology to Rabelais. Further, the characters are truly memorable and likeable, beyond their lofty ideas. I find myself thinking often of Maria and Simon Darcourt and even the dreaded Parlabane. There are excesses--Urqhart's after hours activities are a bit much, and the bit about publishers and Parlabane strains credulity, but overall a wonderul, engrossing, edifying story. Excuse me, I have to go look up that Sophia person..."},{"Title":"The Rebel Angels","review":"If you have never read Robertson Davies don't worry, it's not too late. He is one of the wittiest, intelligent, erudite authors I know. Don't let the word &quot;erudite&quot; worry you into thinking that this is some impenetrable work written by some dusty sage for other academic literati. This, like all of his books, is a wonderful, wild ride through the weird world of academia, peopled by characters we would love to meet, set against a backdrop bejewelled with sparkling prose. I like to read Dick Francis and usually consume one of his novels in one sitting, I adore to read Robertson Davies and recently reread this whole trilogy during a single trans-world flight without sleeping. This story is a tale of lust, envy, deceit &amp; hate scattered with gems of humour and highlighting again Davies' astonishing breadth of knowledge. A breathtakingly brilliant book, and fortunately, the first in a Trilogy. Do yourself a favour, buy the trilogy. Save time &amp; money."},{"Title":"The Rebel Angels","review":"Book 1 of a triliogy since dubbed &quot;The Cornish Trilogy&quot;. When I read it, I didn't know this -- which made picking up the next book so delightful, because some of Davies's warmest and most endearing characters grace the pages of this book. Although you have the feeling of the plot driving forward, and share the viewpoints of three different characters, when you stop to think about it, nothing much really happens. Lots of dialogue, another Davies trademark -- once a playwright, always a playwright."},{"Title":"The Rebel Angels","review":"The Rebel Angels starts off Robertson Davies's Cornish Trilogy by introducing us to a cast of characters and a mood that are the raw material of the collection of related stories. Davies is an author who utilizes a palette of archetypes, applying them again and again in successive snippets and passages. This first book of the trilogy serves as a kind of under-painting for the books that follow. It sets the stage and lays a foundation. But, like all under-painting, it is incomplete in itself. It needs the detail that comes from what follows. In a sense, then, this book is not truly complete apart from the other components of the trilogy. But, that said, in no way should the reader be dissuaded from reading this novel, for the rewards are deeper than the limitations.Davies gives the reader a rich feast of characters and experiences, heightened and exaggerated, but never untrue. His pages welcome us into reflection upon the common chords of life found mirrored back to us by somewhat uncommon people in somewhat unusual places. A few of the characters stand out. Parlabane, for instance, gives us an annoying villain who is both disturbing and likable. Sometimes the tidy fence between goodness and evil seems to melt away in this story, leaving the reader a bit unsettled by the dark shadows within him or herself. This is, however, merely a minor - not too jarring - revelation of what we attempt to hide from ourselves. Robertson Davies gives us, in The Rebel Angels, an uncommon window upon the common human experience. If you are like me, you will find that you remember less of the details of this book than you feel that you have been reminded of the characters and experiences of your own life that sometimes too easily pass from notice.I highly recommend this book; but only for those who are willing to commit to reading the whole of the trilogy. Without the other volumes, you will feel cheated. But with them, you will find yourself greatly enriched by having read The Rebel Angels."},{"Title":"The Rebel Angels","review":"Having been assured that the Deptford Trilogy was Davies &quot;best&quot; work, I steered away from reading anything else until someone recommended &quot;The Rebel Angels&quot;. What an utter delight! Once again I was drawn in by Davies exquisite use of language, obvious expertise in a thousand obscure subjects, and meticulous attention to detail. I meandered along for several chapters, satisfied, until I came upon the one chapter that knocked me on my heels! It is that way with Davies. You wander along through a perfectly good story and then he interjects a chapter of such brilliance and sweet surprise that from then on you can barely put the book down. How did a gypsy girl get into this thick story of the intimacies of University pedants? The Rebel Angels is another Davies triumph of surprising coincidences, exotic characters and lyrical writing. It is every bit worth the time it takes to discover it's secrets"},{"Title":"The Rebel Angels","review":"The author crafts the words very elegantly and delicately to make you aware of the simple pleasures provided by knowledge for the sake of knowledge. When a lost manuscript that Ravelais wrote to Parcelsus reappears in the state of a Millionaire, just to be immediately stolen, the reader might believe that the recovery of such document, is the core of the drama. Not really, it is a little element that puts the novel in motion, so that the writer can display very eloquently, why the existence of wit and humor depend on the tendency of human nature to mess up any type of idea, be it a complex issue such as the existence of God, or the if a particular color is fun to wear."},{"Title":"The Rebel Angels","review":"_The Rebel Angels_ is one of Davies' absolute finest novels, and a personal favorite. Davies, who at the time of writing was headmaster of Massey College at the University of Toronto, chose for the setting of the book that very campus (though all names have been changed to protect the innocent). The book is a lively romp through a sort of surreal parallel world of academia : defrocked monks, gypsy spells, corpulent priests, seductive graduate students, feces research, bawdy medieval humor, and an enormous dose of Davies' wit and wisdom. The book is a real treat."},{"Title":"The Rebel Angels","review":"I can't decide which I think is the best of Davies' novels: FIFTH BUSINESS or REBEL ANGELS. I was delighted by both stories and the wonderful wandering asides Davies takes into such unusual subjects. In the REBEL ANGELS, he tells his story through two characters - a beautiful young lady whose academic interests focus on Rabelais, Paracelsus, and other medieval writers, yet whose background is gypsy; and Professor the Reverend Simon Darcourt, a plump, middle aged priest turned college professor. Davies' shows the pertinence of the scatalogical element in our lives and his discussions are both tasteful and humorous. There is plenty of mystery and intrigue in the story to keep the reader's curiosity alert and the characters are most colorfully entertaining. Excellent reading."},{"Title":"The Rebel Angels","review":"It's the best satire ever written on academia. I was loving it, guys. LOVING it. Every word."},{"Title":"The Rebel Angels","review":"Robertson Davies is a Candian literary icon. His genius imbues all his writing - this most of all. With a wonderful narrative told from three characters perspectives, he weaves a story of the banality of academia (it reminded me of Umberto Eco's Foucault's Pendulum in this manner) along with characters that are both lovable and disgusting somehow.Except for Maria. She is the beauty of the story, the woman who must endure the silly old academic men, but who herself needs to learn about who she is and to find her identity in the midst of insanity. Davies does not fully create a completely believeable female character in my opinion, but he comes close.His humour is unmatched. Davies writes with a biting wit that cuts with razor sharpness. He uses an ironic narrative that will always not only make one laugh, but laugh thoughtfully. He makes us think of life and love. You can't help but be made to think.This is one of Davies best, from one of the best writers Canada has ever produced.Read and Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Rebel Angels","review":"It's rare for a novel to be both thoughtful and rather light and frivolously entertaining--&quot;Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&quot; comes to mind, and this book's got the same sort of attitude. At root it's a funny, erudite, gross and at times mean satire of academia as only an ex-academic could produce--the style is (I'm sure purposefully) reminiscent of Rabelais, who's mentioned herein so frequently. On the other hand, it's a charmingly not-too-serious meditation on the variety of paths to wisdom and ways of knowing. I was rather amused by the observation of one character that (I paraphrase) medieval thinking was a mix of muddled religion, folk belief and superstition, while modern thinking is a mix of muddled science, folk belief and superstition. Perhaps the best aspect of the book is the sheer wildness of its imagination, what with Gypsy instrument-stealers and all; it's not at all surprising that Davies was a theater ham as well (there's an indulgent nod to someone I presume is a real-life actor pal of his in here).On the personal level, I think if I'd read this book at around age 18 it would've had enormous impact on me, both for the academic satire and for the gaining-wisdom thing; I would have taken both aspects far too seriously and probably have been obscurely burdened by the whole experience. Now it's just mostly good unclean fun.--J.Ruch"},{"Title":"The Rebel Angels","review":"The Rebel Angels immediately entered my personal canon of favorite works of literature. Could it be the perfect novel? It features astounding characters, well defined and memorable (especially the unforgettable John Parlabane, almost as singular a character as Liesl in Davies' Deptford Trilogy). It features a page turning plot. I was initially hoping for a literary mystery, along the lines of Eco, when the &quot;lost manuscript&quot; is introduced. The plot doesn't exactly lead that way, but creates its own twists and turns, both comic and tragic.Davies' fine novel is an erudite display of knowledge, philosophy, emotion. There are no blacks and whites, nor even shades of grey. Each character is peppered alternately both black and white...each an incredibly real person encompassing friendship and selfishness, good and evil.This is the kind of novel you feel better for having read. It impressed me on each page; a great work of literature as well as a very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Rebel Angels","review":"About a quarter of way into the reading, I was reminded of Canada's other famous funny man, Saul Bellow, especially Humboldt's Gift. As I delved deeper, I saw a definitive difference: Bellow was more exuberant, and Davies wiser, more a deadpan. Just an aside, not meant as a comparative analysis.As I read, I was swept off the floor by Davies's erudition and insight. While I understood that the disciplines described in the book were his own field of academic study, and I should not feel too badly for myself if I didn't know much about Mediavel culture, Rabelais, and Gypsy lores, however, the way Mr. Davies pulled them together is nothing short of magic. Regardless of your knowledge and scholarship, to make medieval stuff fun and funny is no small talent. Even for those who do not share Davies's sense of humor will not come out empty-handed, as the tidbits of knowledge and myth can sure serve one well in cocktail conversations. This is the positive, treasure box side.Now the complaint. Despite the acclaim that the novel is a ground-breaking depiction of the ivory tower of academic pursuit, Mr. Davies failed to give a true, or truly inspired account in this regard. The characters are, by and large, two-dimensional caricatures, and in the case of female protagonists (Maria/Mamusia), not even fully a one-dimensional line. While Mr. Davies was unquestionably talented in seeing and playing off Academic Man's eccentricities and neurocism, he was not as good in injecting him with the proper counter dose of humanity, to make him truly three dimensional. Simon Darcourt is the best of the ilk, but even he does not compare in vivacity and believability to similar characters (e.g. Humboldt of the aforementioned Bellow). I find the carricaturization a severe flaw.However, an author who can give us characters (carricatured as they are) as unforgettable as John Parlabane deserves his kudos, to say nothing of the many cultural gems and masterful command of language to serve as a model of good writing."},{"Title":"The Rebel Angels","review":"There is a sort of sub-genre of literature that might be called the Academic Black Comedy. Kingsly Amis' &quot;Lucky Jim&quot; certainly falls into this category, as do many of David Lodge's books- &quot;Trading Places&quot; and &quot;Small World&quot;, to name two. Back in my high-stress grad school days I devoured these books. They portrayed academia as I saw it; that is, a strange, irrational world, not subject to the ordinary rules and mores of life.It was during this time that a friend- a philosophy student widely regarded as the worst teaching assistant on campus- gave me a copy of &quot;The Rebel Angels&quot;. I started reading it that night and carried it with me all the next day, and the day after, reading it when I should have been doing other things.&quot;The Rebels Angels&quot; is part mystery, part bawdy medieval tale and part academic satire. There's a mysterious and beautiful gypsy woman, a missing manuscript of Rablais (that may or may not actual exist), a gang of gypsie violin theives, and a cast of venal and backstabbing academics- some fighting for the manuscript, some for the girl, and some for both, perhaps.Wonderful entertainment- especially for anyone planning on going into academia. There's more truth in it than many academics would like to admit."},{"Title":"The Rebel Angels","review":"Canada, being a small nation, hasn't produced that many first-rate literary minds, but among those she has Davies leads the pack. He was a Shakespearean actor, a playwright, a newspaper editor, a professor of English, a busy novelist, and head of a graduate college in Toronto, and it's the latter two semi-careers that figure most in this first volume of a satirical trilogy. (Davies did a number of trilogies.) There are three narrators who take turns leading the reader through events and we see each of them through the eyes of each of the others, which makes the whole story exist in multiple dimensions. Maria Theotoky is a Ph.D. candidate in medieval literature possessed of a formidable intellect and job-dropping beauty; she's also half Hungarian Gypsy and a very sympathetic character. She's in love (or thinks she is) with her mentor, Clement Hollier, a paleo-psychologist who attempts to understand why people in the past believed the things they did -- a fascinating approach to history. Hollier has a line on a lost manuscript of Francois Rabelais and his possible possession of it is making him a little crazy. And there's Simon Darcourt, an Anglican scholar-priest, inclined to stoutness, and an honest assistant warden of the college. Into this comfortably satisfying academic world comes John Parlabane, professional philosopher, failed monk, intellectual con-man, certifiable genius, and possibly a force for genuine evil. He has a knack for winkling money out of everyone he knows and of making others doubt their own abilities and beliefs. Among the other key characters are Urquhart McVarish, Renaissance scholar and thief, and Maria's mother, a Gypsy wise woman of the oldest type, a maker of exquisite violins, and a talented shoplifter. And then Francis Cornish, wealthy collector of art and books and manuscripts, dies and leaves most of his accumulation of rarities to the university. Hollier, Darcourt, and McVarish are to be his literary and artistic executors, assisting his nephew, Arthur, whose subject is money (at which he is very successful). As the three of them wade through this treasure trove they also must try to deal, each in his own way, with the vampirish Parlabane, who has acquired a hold on all of them, against their better judgment. And Maria must try to sort out her feelings for Hollier and Darcourt (both of whom are \\"rebel angels\\" of the gnostic apocrypha) while also fending off Parlabane's attempt to seduce her intellectually. And Hollier has to find that missing manuscript, which now has been pinched by one of his academic rivals for thoroughly unworthy motives (and he knows who it is). And Darcourt has to come to terms with his own developing feelings for Maria, which are raising questions in his mind about his own multiple avocations. If all this sounds complicated, that's because it is -- but Davies relates the story in a delightfully smooth prose with a knowing smile and raised eyebrows that will hold your attention completely. He's also a master of the extended dialogue, by which the members of the Senior Common Room several times paint a stimulating group portrait of life in a university and of the unending search for wisdom. And his own Rabelaisian wit will frequently leave you gasping. You will want to have the sequel, _What's Bred in the Bone,_ close to hand when you finish this one."},{"Title":"The Rebel Angels","review":"Rarely have I read a book that is so dead-on in its depiction of the petty concerns turned to obsession and often ingrown, self-righteous &quot;worldly&quot; provincialism that is higher academia. Robertson Davies has perfectly captured all the head spinning egotism and resulting humor (so ready for those not wrapped up in themselves or their work to discover) that is always lurking within its ivy-covered halls.At its core, &quot;The Rebel Angels&quot; is the story of the trials and joys that a student assistant to a medieval literature instructor goes through as she works with &quot;the great man.&quot; Most of these trials (and a couple of the joys) arrive in the form of John Parlabane. It is Parlabane's return that sets off the action of the plot. It is his departure that sets off its resolution.&quot;The Rebel Angels&quot; is one of those rare books that has a plot so intricate, and characters so unique that I do not wish to spoil it with too much elaboration here. Instead, I'd rather sing the praises of Davies as an author.Davies is, first and foremost, a master of the English language. His turns of phrase are wonderfully expressive. They always hit the mark perfectly. Rarely has such a wit walked the Earth. In my opinion Davies is the greatest example of the classical definition of a &quot;wit&quot; since the time of Pope and Dryden. His mastery of language and wit make &quot;The Rebel Angels&quot; a dangerously funny book. He had me laughing at some pretty awful things.Yet, inspite of some of its more juvenile moments, &quot;The Rebel Angels&quot; also contemplates some of the deeper things. The whole book serves to challenge our very modern, very empirical worldviews. Is all knowledge exclusively progressive? It'd be mighty vain to think so. &quot;The Rebel Angels&quot; takes us to task for doing just that.This is a great book. I give it my full recommendation."},{"Title":"The Rebel Angels","review":"This is the first book of the Cornish series, and the worst of the three in most respects. The context of the story is set at an academic institution of higher learning, wherein all the vagaries of human personality are on display in the various faculty members and adminstrators. I suppose the purpose of this book, other than providing an entertaining story (which it definitely does) is to showcase some of the foibles associated with academics, and the politics that develop through the interactions of egos who consider themselves to be intellectually superior, but, once dissected, look much like anyone else. The setting of the book is a rather antiquated notion of a university, where professors live in their offices and shut themselves off from the real world. The strongest aspect of the book is the writing style, of which Davies is a master. On the flip-side the characters are rather one-dimensional (especially compared with the later two books), as the story focuses on merely one aspect of their personalities while losing sight of the entire essence of being. It's also not uproariously funny, as compared to other academic satires, such as Amis' Lucky Jim, Lodge's Small World, or Edwards' The Land-Grant, but still has a comic edge more of the black-humor variety. Still, negatives aside, the story is definitely entertaining and written in a high-minded style, with a strange ending that few will guess is coming."},{"Title":"The Rebel Angels","review":"Robertson Davies' The Rebel Angels is an engaging and energetic novel with a vigorous sense of humor. The novel reads quickly and never feels weighed down by ideas or seriousness. This is deceptive.Davies give us a novel populated by Medieval and Renaissance scholars. Their intellectual landscape is thus not unnaturally populated by Paracelsus and Rabelais, two constant figures in the dialectic of the novel. Of the two, Rabelais seems the most significant. He is a figure frequently claimed by both sides of the numerous arguments in the novel. He provides a lens through which we see into the characters a bit more deeply than they might hope. Parlabane and McVarish make him a model of vulgarity and misogyny, or perhaps more accurately, misanthropy. To Hollier, he represents an object for his own academic ambition. For Maria and Darcourt--and Davies--he is a model of the best sort of scholar, as we hear from Maria:Rabelais was gloriously learned because learning amused him, and so far as I am concerned that is learning's best justification. Not the only one, but the best.It may be wrong to include Darcourt here--as a priest scholar, his greater reference is St. Augustine:\\"Conloqui et conridere et vicissim benevole obsequi, simul leger libros dulciloquos, simul nugari et simul honestari.\\"In Maria's translation:\\"Conversations and jokes together, mutual rendering of good services, the reading together of sweetly phrased books, the sharing of nonsense and mutual attentions.\\"This erudite amusement is a hallmark of everything I have yet read by Davies, and it is tempting to think that the best part of what Davies gives us in this novel is Davies, himself. Davies is more wise than a mere intellectual, and more alive than a modernist. He brings with him the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, and with these life fuller than which we are accustomed today.What we get from Davies is not a hair shirted historicism, but a sense of wholeness for a consciousness which is fermented in the broadness of human experience. Maria says of Hollier that he studies the Middle Ages because they are truly middle--a vantage from which he can look backward to antiquity, and forward to our post-Renaissance present. This dynamic of looking backward and forward, contrasting each with the other, is at the very heart of The Rebel Angels, a book which makes attractive Paracelsus' \\"second paradise.\\"\\"The striving for wisdom is the second paradise of the world.\\""},{"Title":"The Rebel Angels","review":"Perhaps the defining challenge of most national cultures in the second half of the 20th century (and the 21st) has been to find a place in a global culture increasingly dominated by American cultural products, particularly Hollywood. Literature has had an easier time of this than the visual media, but it is still an issue, particularly in English-speaking nations. The challenge for Canadian literature has been particularly acute, given Canada's proximity to the American cultural juggernaut. Surveying the Canadian literary scene in the second half of the 20th century, one could persuasively argue that Robertson Davies was the greatest presence (Margaret Atwood being probably the other main contender, and certainly the most prominent author now living). Davies' writing career spanned the 1950s to the early 1990s, with his most prominent works being two trilogies of novels (\\"The Deptford Trilogy\\" and \\"The Cornish Trilogy\\"). \\"The Rebel Angels\\", first published in 1981, is the first entry in the latter cycle.If one were to compare Davies to other writers, one of the comparisons that springs to my mind would be a Canadian or English-language Umberto Eco. His novels have the same literacy, meaning, the same way of conveying the breadth of the education and erudition of the author. Davies' novels have this moreso in some respects, since his fiction is set in the present. A university professor by profession, \\"The Rebel Angels\\" is particularly pronounced in this regard, as it is set in the history department of a Canadian university (allegorical to the University of Toronto's Massey College, where Davies finished out his career). The plot, like Eco's, revolves around complicated academic issues, in this case not even dressed up as a mystery plot (as Eco's \\"The Name of the Rose\\" was). This is quite interesting to read, though part of me thinks that this wouldn't be nearly as interesting (perhaps even dreadfully boring) to anyone who hadn't attended a university (particularly graduate programs). Nonetheless, the novel has proved very popular, so perhaps this is not the case.Unlike Davies' past works (particularly his famous \\"Deptford\\" books), this book includes a female narrator (one of two). The novel is split between the perspectives of one Maria Magdalena Theodotky (her chapters being titled \\"Second Paradise\\") and Rev. Simon Darcourt (\\"The New Aubrey\\"), the former a graduate student and research assistant, the latter a professor of theology. The plot, such as it is, has two separate catalysts: the death of one Francis Cornish, an art collector, who bequeaths to Darcourt and two others the task of handling his collection's dispersal; and the return to the college of Dr. John Parlabane, a truly strange former professor and eccentric, who has recently abandoned an attempt at monastic life. Maria is in love with her professor, Dr. Hollier, while virtually every male character at some point considers her desirability. It's rather too complicated to explain in a summary, but sufficed to say that Davies offers up his usual meditations on a wide variety of topics. You feel smarter after having read a book like this (and, unlike Eco, Davies never leaves untranslated foreign languages to niggle at your mind). Davies was something of a Renaissance man: actor, novelist, scholar.If there was one really notable criticism, it would be that Davies' writing style has a certain limitedness to character voice. Everybody sounds rather alike. Maria, for example, is a 23-year-old Roma/Polish-Canadian woman, but she sounds more like an erudite 60something English-Canadian novelist (that is, Davies himself) trying to give voice to the thoughts of a 23-year-old Roma/Polish-Canadian woman. Nevertheless, it's a very articulate and readable novelist voice.Recommended."},{"Title":"The House on the Mound","review":"I had lived in Prairie du Chien yrs. ago and had been interested in this book, but ... had never made the time to acquire and read this book, until recently.

I have always found myself calling her \\"Shell\\" for short, to no surprise. My copy of The Seashell Oracle is one of the originals, and I have laid eyes on her childhood journal of incredible seashell drawings and notes. This is not your run-of-the-mill \\"just another card and book set.\\" You have in Michelle Hanson someone who deeply and without quite understanding it all herself KNOWS the seashells on an \\"oceanic\\" level. She could as easily stand in front of a grade school class and teach the manners, movements and ways of each seashell creature as she could sit with you in private and tell you the deepest movements in your own psyche, using the seashells to do it! Michelle has a rich, scientific mind and loves detail, combined with a deep unconscious knowing that mirrors the ocean itself. She will hunt to the ends of the earth to find this seashell knowledge for you and to ensure it is accurate and complete. She taught me it is best to let the shells speak to you, versus trying to ask very specific questions of the shells when using this as an Oracle. I have been in one of Michelle's classes on the seashells and their stories are both romantic and heroic. You would be amazed! To know that this one area of nature, as vast as it is, is only one area and it operates so intelligently, so marvelously -- is to stand in awe. Get this gift for yourself and take time with it. Use it. Don't rush through it. You will be rewarded. I will tell you a secret that may make you smile. My friend \\"Shelley\\" is not necessarily a great ocean-goer.

Massachusetts this Fall(year 2004). Her extensive scientific background and her passion in dealing with the sea creatures who inhabit and/or adapt shells immediately connected with me. I have always loved the Ocean and am a Master Scuba Diver who has been on dive trips aound the World. When under water I had time to observe the behavior of the mollusks and other shelled creatures.After meeting with Michelle and purchasing the Ocean Oracle set I found I could not put the cards or the book away. I enjoy alternative therapies and the guidance which a variety of cards have been able to give me over the years. But I never resonated to such a degree with any other book or card set as I did with the Ocean Oracle. The behaviors of the animals certainly are directly related to the behavior and problems of those people who have come to me for card readings. I use them myself daily and would recommend them highly, especially for anyone who feels a strong connection to the Ocean....Greg Downs Attorney, Reiki Practitioner, Diver...East Sandwich, Massachusetts"},{"Title":"Ocean Oracle: What Seashells Reveal About Our True Nature","review":"I have an affinity for the ocean and seashells, and I own several Tarot decks. However, I had not quite found a deck that \\"spoke\\" to me, until I personally met Shelley Hanson and was introduced to Ocean Oracle. After talking with Shelley for just a few minutes, I realized that she had incredible expertise in the area of seashells, and that it was her life's work. I knew I had to have Ocean Oracle, and I bought one on the spot (I now own 3 boxed sets).Ocean Oracle is eye-catching, and for anyone who is fascinated by seashells, it is almost impossible to put down. And yes, it is an incredible tool for divination. However, as I started to review the book and cards, it occurred to me what a great educational tool this boxed set is. Shelley has assigned meanings to all of the shells used in Ocean Oracle, largely based on scientific fact, in four categories: behavior, interaction, name and appearance, and intuition. Many of us don't realize or think about the fact that an animal once inhabited any shell we see! The stories and history recounted in the explanations are so fascinating that they are easy to remember. In all cases, I find that the meanings are educational, and the meanings based on intuition had me coming up with my own explanations, which is a fun exercise in itself!Ocean Oracle is a great tool for personal growth many levels - you can become quite knowledgeable about mollusks and seashells, gain personal, intuitive knowledge about yourself, learn how to interpret meanings and behavior in the world around you, and use your imagination. Best of all, it's FUN! As far as divination goes, I am a beginner, and the \\"keys to interpretations\\" and sample readings make it so easy - there is no \\"wrong way\\" to use it.

What I do know for certain is that we live in a vast Universe and that everything and everyone of this Universe is connected. We have a connection to the Ocean and all the life held within it. This book helps us understand this concept by explaining the relationship we hold through the \\"Language of the Shells.\\" When I am drawn to a particular shell that I have come across on the beach or even in a store, I know that it is speaking to me in some way. I use the Ocean Oracle to look up the meaning and explanation of this shell and learn what it is trying to tell me... What is going on in my life right now that has attracted me to this shell and what can I learn from its wisdom? Several times now I have received requests from my friends to look up the meaning of a particular shell that they have come across in their travels. It is fun, exciting, and most revealing to delve into the wealth of information that Shelly has spent her entire life accumulating and interpreting for us.Another interesting use of the book and cards is to have a small gathering of friends. Display as many types of shells that you all own and have an informal reading. Each person selects a shell that they are drawn to and then the interpretations begin. You will be surprised how accurate the readings are for each individual. It is a great opportunity to express with friends and share a collective connection to Mother Earth and her Ocean Kingdom."},{"Title":"Ocean Oracle: What Seashells Reveal About Our True Nature","review":"Shelley, the Shell Lady, has produced an attractive and colorful book that captures your imagination.

Amelia had quite resigned herself to a lifetime of loneliness and isolation when a series of horrific murders begins to plague the neighbourhood. Because of William's condition, Amelia lives in daily fear that someone will try to pin the murders on William. And her fears are confirmed when an anonymous tip links a young man fitting William's description to the latest murder. Fortunately for Amelia, her neighbour, the mysterious and enigmatic Sebastian St. Ives, is at hand willing to offer assistance and comfort. But Sebastian also awakens in Amelia heady feelings that she had thought she had buried. Will her feelings for Sebastian get in the way of her resolve to protect her brother?Chosen by the Great Counsel of Vampires to protect Amelia (one of the maidens whom Nefri had given part of the Medallion to), Sebastian St.Ives had thought that his task would be rather simple: keep an eye on Amelia, and to make sure that she came to no harm. What the scholarly Sebastian had not counted on was Amelia's valour, her determination to protect her brother at all cost, and the strong attraction he would feel for her. Now, faced with a cunning foe who has figured out exactly how to bring Amelia down, Sebastian will have to be twice and clever and twice as ruthless. But can he do this feeling as he does for Amelia?&quot;My Lord Immortality&quot; finishes the vampire trilogy that revolves around the three vampires who had been ordered by the Great Counsel to protect the three maidens who each possessed one-third of a powerful medallion. The Medallion had been used by the powerful and wise vampire Nefri to create a reality -- called the Veil -- where all the vampires had retired to in order to spend their time in study and at peace. Now, however, a few renegade vampires have left the Veil, hell-bent on retrieving the Medallion thirds in order to destroy the Veil and to make themselves all powerful. On the whole, the trilogy ended on a good and satisfying note. The authour does a rather good job of depicting the attraction that simmers between Sebastian and Amelia, as well as of the frustration that the scholarly Sebastian feels over the unexpected twists that his mission has taken thanks to his feelings for Amelia. I especially enjoyed Debbie Raleigh's strong character portrayal of Amelia's courage and loyalty, and that she made Amelia intelligent as well -- a feisty heroine with more hair than wit would have been too much to bear! And if I didn't exactly have much patience for Sebastian's lack of subtlety and patience, the swift pace of the novel made this cross easy to bear. Rather nicely done though was the unexpected plot twist (even if it didn't actually amount to very much) that the authour provided us with so the &quot;My Lord Immortality&quot; didn't become the totally expected and unsurprising read it might otherwise have been. So that all in all, I'd rate &quot;My Lord Immortality&quot; as an enjoyable 3 star read."},{"Title":"My Lord Immortality (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"Despite the fact that I think I'll scream if I have to read the word &quot;maiden&quot; again anytime soon, &quot;My Lord Immortality&quot; had a lot of good things going for it. Amelia is an excellent heroine--intelligent, perceptive, loyal, and brave. Sebastian is interesting as a true scholar with fewer social skills, especially with the ladies, than either Lucien or Gideon. His awkwardness and hesitancy are keys to the romantic tension in the novel. Nevertheless, the attraction sizzles between these two, perhaps more than with the couples in the two previous installments. Indeed, this book is slightly more sensual (though still pretty innocent) than the others. Moreover, Sebastian is that elusive male all women want: one who knows what they want deep down without having to be told.Sebastian, while he's willing to risk his life to protect Amelia, doesn't actually do that much to stop the villains -- who are perhaps the most villainous of the set -- so that somehow seems something of a letdown. Moreover, the surprise twist is not given enough attention and background; I think it directly related to Lucien's book in particular, but nothing was mentioned about that. One thing: so, um, what happens to the Medallion now? The fate of the Medallion and the Veil is not dealt with.A generally pleasant ending for the trilogy."},{"Title":"My Lord Immortality (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie Tales.Quick & Dirty: The quest for the Medallion places Amelia and William Hadwell in harms way with only Sebastian St. Ives set to guard them with his life.Opening Sentence: The cottage set in the thick copse of trees was a dark, cramped affair.The Review:Like many of you I often judge a book by its cover and often find that my fears or joys have been misplaced. To be completely honest, I didn&#8217;t hold out much hope for this book based on the cover. Admittedly this cover dates back from 2003 but contained all of the tropes that go along with the inclusion of vampires. You know the ones I mean like full moon, red cape, and heroine offering her neck up. However, the book is a pleasant novel to read while away on a lazy afternoon.One of the most notable additions to this book is our heroine&#8217;s younger brother who is mentally challenged. Amelia&#8217;s care for William is a beautiful picture of her character and gives the reader significant insight into her character. She has given up Society and all of the parties in order to care for her brother and ensure that he stays with the family.Sebastian St. Ives entrance into Amelia&#8217;s life occurs after she witnesses a murder and while the murderer is trying to convince her that he is harmless. Sebastian has spent his long life wanting to become a scholar but was chosen for this special assignment of guarding not only Amelia but the Medallion that has been bonded to her.This is a charming book that I was loathe to see the last page turned. For all of you wondering whether you can jump into the 3rd book in the series and enjoy it, I did and I&#8217;m sure you shall as well. Also, Amelia and Sebastian&#8217;s story is told in a manner that I would not be afraid to recommend to a reader who enjoyed paranormal romances with hardly any cursing and no sex. So if you are looking for a clean paranormal romance then this book comes with high recommendations from me.FTC Advisory: Zebra/Kensington provided me with a copy of My Lord Immortality.

I think Anne Lindbergh was a good writer, but whether a book survives the test of time is the question. I am not sure this book does. Mrs. Lindbergh is philosophical at times in her travels from Washington to Canada to Alaska to Russia and thence to Japan and China. The book is very readable about her interactions with people along the way. It does not give much insight on her husband.This is an OK read on the early age of airplane travel. I found some interesting stories in this book.

The author has a very bad habit of leaving out important information, as well as quoting anonymous &quot;authorities&quot;. Be wary of his annoying habit of quoting Catholic documents and personalities out of context. He also likes to use the infamous &quot;...&quot; deception method to weed out information that would contradict his argument. If you are a Fundamentalist, who already believes that the &quot;Church of Rome&quot; has apostasized, then this book will help solidify your current beliefs.For those of you who would really like to know the &quot;secrets&quot; of &quot;Romanism&quot;, you would probably be wiser to purchase the Catechism of the Catholic Church, which details the teachings of our Faith. One quick point...refering to Catholicism as &quot;Romanism&quot; is not a good way to make friends with your Catholic neighbors.For those Catholics involved in Apologetics with Fundamentalists, this book provides a perfect example of the argumentation used to misrepresent the Faith.I would have given a book like this a higher rating, assuming the author was engaged in honest dialogue, but I can't endorse a dishonest representation of the Catholic faith. An ex-priest is not necessarily an ample authority, any more than an ex-policeman is necessarily a shining example of the police force."},{"Title":"Secrets of Romanism","review":"I first encountered this book over forty years ago. If Joseph Zacchello ever was in reality a Catholic priest, he evidently paid scant attention to his seminary lessons. Unlike today, back in the day of Zacchello the Seminarian the Catholic Church actually taught Roman Catholic doctrine in its seminaries, witness the exponential growth of the Church in America and elsewhere during the reign of Pius XII, a fact rebuking the lamentable post-Conciliar record. Zacchello's ignorance with respect to the doctrine and customs of the Roman Church is embarassing. An example: use of the ancient ecclesiastical custom of speaking of the Roman Pontiff as 'Our Most Holy Lord the Pope' is construed by Zacchello as proof that Catholics believe the pope is God Himself. This kind of illiteracy is barbarism, and the book is filled with it. Its hatreds and lies are violent, even disturbing. The author spits rather than writes, and never more disturbingly than in the vitriol he concocts against the historical mother of Jesus. Polemics, after all, has standards; even the most convinced anti-Catholic person will find nothing here but the decayed spiritual death of the hater. It is mortifying to know this book is still published and available to the public, while so many valuable worthwhile books are out of print. What a comment on the culture we live in! The only secrets you'll find in this book are those that mock the reader to his moral peril."},{"Title":"Secrets of Romanism","review":"A unique explanation of Roman Catholic doctrine and beliefs. Written by a former Catholic Priest the book is based on fact presented in a noncontroversial form.The Chapters are divided in first in brief analysis of the Catholic Doctrine then an analysis and refutation with references from authorized St. Anthony Guild &amp; Douay Versions.It's presents the facts proving Roman Catholic doctrine and practices are not Christian, but actually derived from pagan traditions and practices only using the essence of Christianity to deceive the masses.The book lists Catholic practices with dates of institution, Scripture references and detailed index.Great book for Christian Apologetics"},{"Title":"The Pirate","review":"This novel is not only about Arabs, it is about Life whether you being a American, Israeli, iraqi or Arabian national, its about loving one another, you never know your enemy who you always try to fight could end up being a long lost Son, Brother, Cousin or Uncle.A jewish man gave up his son to an Arab man due to circumstances beyond his control, that son becomes one of the most powerful man in the arabian community not knowing that he is jewish, he is persuaded to finance a terrorist group against jews which he refuses , mean while his daughter joins these terrorist OrganizationAt the end Father and son meet together again to save Grand Daughter and fight terrorism , one as a Jewish General and the other as a Rich Arab PrinceOne fact remains at the end \\"Allahu Akbar\\"--> There is only One God"},{"Title":"The Pirate","review":"This book was one of those books that you will read and never want to stop reading.

Tarik believe is honor and obey. Tarik and Carolyn spend a great deal of time together, and they are also attracted to one another. What Carolyn does not know is that Tarik has 'arranged' for his sister to marry a man that she does not love in order to merge the two family companies.

The textbooks aren't loaded with trendy, full-page color photos and lots of wasted space. They are brief, to the point, and simple for any child to understand. The entire system is similar to the methodology used by Asian children and it's a different way of looking at math but a very efficient and unambiguous one. Once the student grasps the concept--which should take no time at all--he/she moves on to the next concept, which is built upon previous concepts. You cannot go wrong with MATH-U-SEE!The conglomerate American textbook publishers would hate to have the Math-U-See program used in the public school system. Hundreds of millions of dollars would be lost in the corporate textbook industry and school budgets would be trimmed to manageable proportions. (Sigh).

And we live near the Crockett Tavern and 45 minutes from his birthplace.We were exploring our Appalachian hertiage and I introduced 17 kids to the king of the wild frontier. They were mesmerized.This book reads easily and follows a narrative format, so it's a great read aloud. We followed it up with a viewing of the classic Disney series starring Fess Parker, and then compared the two heroes.We also determined that despite the song lyrics, he was not born on a mountaintop, but rather the foothills.While I have used it with kindergarten and first grade, this book would also work wonderfully with older students and provide opportunities to compare and contrast, discuss exaggeration, the hero myth, and American History."},{"Title":"A Picture Book of Davy Crockett (Picture Book Biographies) (Picture Book Biography)","review":"In the recent theatrical film \\"The Alamo\\" we were told that Davy Crockett preferred to be called \\"David.\\" One of the elements of that particular movie version of the battle is how in the end the real David Crockett has to die as the legendary and bigger than life Davy. While the title of David A. Adler's juvenile biography of Crockett is entitled \\"A Picture Book of Davy Crockett,\\" Adler calls the subject \\"David\\" throughout this colorful and informative introduction to the American icon's life. Adler's point is that the real David Crockett was a great frontiersman just like the legendary Davy Crockett.Illustrated by John and Alexandra Wallner with attractive line-and-watercolor artwork this book starts with the legendary birth of Davy Crockett and then provides the historical details. The focus is on key events, such as being hired out to a Dutchman who taught David how to shoot a long rifle, serving as a scout in the Creek War, and being elected to several terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. Young readers will learn as much about Crockett's two wives as they will about his falling out in Congress with President Andrew Jackson and his final days at the Alamo. Adler provides both of the conflicting accounts of Crockett's death at the Alamo without making a choice as to which is more likely to be true, which gives you an indication of the level of information the book provides (how the artwork erroneously suggests the mission of the Alamo had a roof from which defenders were fighting, when actually the roof was never completed until years after the battle in 1836).Many of the quotations attributed to Crockett in this book are taken from his autobiography, \\"Narrative of the Life of David Crockett,\\" first published in 1834. The Crockett story ends with the publications of the \\"Davy Crockett Almanacs\\" that first appeared around the time of his death and which contained the useful information you would expect in an almanac plus a collection fo tall tales (e.g., Davy was born weighing over 200 pounds and had a pet bear named Death Hug). \\"A Picture Book of Davy Crockett\\" provides a solid introduction to his life for young readers who will find more of his history as well as the tale tales in lots of other books. This book is one in a series of two-dozen picture book biographies on famous persons by Adler (almost half of which are illustrated by the Wallners) from George Washington to Martin Luther King, Jr. and from Simon Bolivar to Florence Nightingale."},{"Title":"A Picture Book of Davy Crockett (Picture Book Biographies) (Picture Book Biography)","review":"Wanted a book that would give our grandson a bit of history that we enjoyed as children.

It is a true gem! Thank you Dan Millman!"},{"Title":"The Laws of Spirit: A Tale of Transformation","review":"Many of you will know Dan Millman for his Way of the Peaceful Warrior, or perhaps one of his other many books. I've read a good number of them myself. But for its easy reading, its graceful approach, and its universal laws condensed, The Laws of Spirit is my favorite of all his titles.Standing in line with that ancient tradition of sharing truths through fable, the book tells of a fantastic Millman adventure; with his family away for a few days, the author heads out for a day-long hike into the nearby hills, and there he meets with a sage who extends his intended time away. In the course of a few days, she shows him all the most important laws of Spirit, and makes them real for him through immediate experience.These laws begin and end with the important principles of balance and unity; but they also cover so many others that can transform lives: choice, process, presence, compassion, faith, expectation, integrity, action, cycles, and surrender. They're all here, and explained with humor, and with real art - this is the most beautifully written of all Millman's work!I'm also a fan of the short and sweet - something people can use in our hurried world to slow themselves down just a little, and to get a real gem out of reading in those spare moments. The book itself is a lightweight champion, easy to keep on hand; each chapter is about eight pages, simple to tackle over breakfast, on the bus, wherever. It sort of kicks our excuses in the rear. Each chapter is poignant, and really filled with wisdom - almost like a book of wise quotes, so focused is the writing. But meanwhile, one enjoys the tale itself.Written as a tale like this, I believe it is also a book that would be well received by those who are looking for Spirit, but who don't want to be shocked by the more outrageous or risqu&eacute; ideas available. So if you have a friend that you'd like to share some beauty of Spirit with, this could be your title. Wonderfully written, entertaining, a real gem among works. The Laws of Spirit is one for everybody's shelf."},{"Title":"The Laws of Spirit: A Tale of Transformation","review":"My search for a kind of unfiltered universal truth is over after reading this masterpiece. The author, Dan Millman, has written a work for the ages. Never have words from a book jumped out and expressed so much in so few pages.I have never assumed religion and truth to be necessarily synonymous (although they could be). This book has nothing to do with religion and yet is everything about truth. I was consciously aware that my normally cynical attitude on matters spiritual was literally being reshaped with each turn of the page. For example, The Law of Faith really hit home for me when the Sage says to the Traveler, &quot;What if you suddenly knew with certainty that a higher intelligence was working through you and everyone else for the highest good of humanity--that there is indeed a purpose for every pleasure and hardship?&quot; and the Traveler says, &quot;If I knew that, it would make a difference.&quot; The Sage responds, &quot;The Law of Faith doesn't require you to believe this, Traveler, but it guides you to live your life as if this were true; in other words, on faith.&quot; Later adding, &quot;Faith is not the opposite of reason. Applying the Law of Faith is one of the most practical, reasonable, constructive things you can do to live an inspired life.&quot;The book seems to literally crescendo towards the final law--The Law of Unity: &quot;Whether we are One or many depends more upon our perspective than on any objective reality. Conventional knowledge tells us that we are separate; higher wisdom informs us that we are One. We are all the same Consciousness, manifesting in different bodies, the way leaves are part of the same tree. Later, &quot;The Awareness that looks out through a billion eyes is the One Consciousness of infinite Love and Wisdom that we call God, who watches life unfold with mercy and compassion, and who is life itself. . . . As you begin to see friends and adversaries, loved ones and strangers, through the eyes of the One Being, then all dilemma and conflict are dissolved, all wounds are healed, and all paradox is resolved in the light of this essential truth. This is the end of all seeking, because you are everyone and everywhere. It is the end of all fear, because you grasp as living truth who you are--that pure Awareness which never dies.&quot;I dedicate this review to my wife who gave me The Laws of the Spirit as a gift. I am buying several copies as Christmas presents to my closest friends and relatives."},{"Title":"The Laws of Spirit: A Tale of Transformation","review":"\\"The Laws of Spirit\\" is a wonderful tale through which the author has woven 12 essential laws to live by - laws that, when brought to our awareness, and utilized, can literally change your life!The story is based around a man who has recently begun both a physical & spiritual journey, and the sage he meets along the way. This sage teaches him about each of the 12 laws, providing wonderful examples & showing him how to apply each one to every-day life.I love that each \\"law\\" is explained in \\"down-to-earth\\" language and that, due to the examples given, it becomes quite easy to see how they can be used to better our lives on a day-to-day basis.\\"The Laws of Spirit\\" is a relatively small book, as it can easily be read in 1 or 2 sittings. However, I would suggest either keeping the book handy so that you can re-read it, or taking some notes so that you can easily be reminded of the many insights given. (I chose to take notes, so it took me a little bit longer to finish the book - but I now have the info. I need to put into practice all that I learned).Overall, I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in spirituality & personal growth. It's an easy, interesting read, that is jam packed with wonderful insights."},{"Title":"The Laws of Spirit: A Tale of Transformation","review":"I have believed in the Laws, as put down my Dan Millman, for a while now - ever since I hit rock bottom and realized many of the simple lifechanging truths contined in this book, like living in the moment instead of chewing on the past and worrying about the future, not judging people and realizing we all do best we can, energy follows thought hence our thoughts shape our reality, or one of my favorites - people rarely ever fail, they just stop trying. However, the simple and graceful way Dan Millman put it all together in this enchanting little book makes it one of the best books I ever read. Certainly one of the most inspiring."},{"Title":"The Laws of Spirit: A Tale of Transformation","review":"No other author has inspired positive change in my own life as much as Dan. Like most, I'm still feeling my way around, trying to learn how to live my life to the fullest. For those who are also questioning their everyday experiences and searching for a better way to live, this book is an excellent source of wisdom. Its main feature is its small size. The wisdom is as direct and condensed as possible without a loss of meaning. Very very convenient for busy people like me. I actually read one chapter for a period of time, and use it in everyday life, then return for the next &quot;law&quot; when I'm ready. Not a bad way to go.Laws of Spirit gets only four stars, however, because Dan truly has written better books. Way of the Peaceful Warrior impacted me the most of all his books, as it has for millions of readers around the world. It is an adventure story, but unlike Laws of Spirit, it is not corny, and it is mostly true. No Ordinary Moments is the other book I can testify to.. it is the guidebook version of Way of the Peaceful Warrior. They both were published in the 1970's, and therefore speak directly without flattening out the powerful philosophy into &quot;layman's terms.&quot;Dan's books are set apart from the other philosophies on my shelf because of this: he speaks in terms of actions. Lots of books give you great spiritual food for thought, but the wisest authors involve excercises or life examples that put philosophy into action. Thinking about something you read is useless- action is the only means by which positive change occurs."},{"Title":"The Laws of Spirit: A Tale of Transformation","review":"A great book for anybody who, like me, is still grappling with the concepts of &quot;faith&quot; and &quot;belief&quot;. Millman puts a unique perspective on how one can set aside the scientific notion that &quot;seeing is believing&quot; in order to be able to whole-heartedly accept the theory that &quot;believing is seeing&quot;. A good book for someone who needs a reason and explanation for everything, down to having &quot;faith&quot;!!"},{"Title":"The Laws of Spirit: A Tale of Transformation","review":"I read this book after reading \\"Way of the Peaceful Warrior\\" and \\"Sacred Journey of the Peaceful Warrior.\\" I highly recommend both of those, but the thing that I like a lot about this book is that it presents it's message in a shorter form than the two mentioned above. I really like how this book is organized into 12 sections \\"Laws\\" so that you can look any specific one up as needed.Each chapter begins with The Law that will be presented, a short verse pertaining to it, a quote relevant to the topic, then it's right to the story/example/point of the lesson in understanding the \\"Law\\". It's along the same lines as \\"Peaceful Warrior\\" books in that the lessons are learned from a sage through different experiences. Some of the experiences are extreme, -but useful in that - so often, are the life experiences that awaken us extreme.There is a lot of good information in this little book that we need to help us as we continue to grow in our spiritual path. This is a book I will keep on my 'favourites' book shelf. The shelf where I go back and run my fingers along the book spines and pick just the right book to remember/refresh and read again."},{"Title":"The Laws of Spirit: A Tale of Transformation","review":"This book is a parable, like Millman's &quot;Way of the Peaceful Warrior,&quot; but unlike that book, it distills many spiritual truths into a small space.Give this book a read if you are unhappy in your current life process. You will gain understanding by reading this book; you will gain wisdom by applying its simple and beautiful truths.It is not a real-life story, but as Dan Millman himself says, &quot;All stories are true, and some are factual.&quot;You will find powerful guidance in his words.If you like this book, try &quot;The Life You Were Born to Live&quot; and &quot;Everyday Enlightenment.&quot; Your life will be enriched."},{"Title":"The Laws of Spirit: A Tale of Transformation","review":"I read this book back in 1997. Loved it, loaned it out and didn't get it back. A few weeks ago it called to me in a bookstore so I bought another copy and read it again.Dan Millman has a bedrock sort of understanding of Universal Law. He teaches it in a format that seems simple, but the format helps the reader to get it. It's a valuable teaching. I teach Yoga. Yoga applies to our daily lives, and also keeps us fit, physically and mentally. This book is like Yoga.There's no such thing as a book that intends to teach or \\"self-help\\" us, unless we find a way to apply the principles taught to our lives. I think that Dan Millman understands this and has applied this in his writing.Kids can read this book and understand it. Well done. A lot of the writers teaching New Thought, expand beyond what most people are willing or even capable of stretching to within the advice of a book. This is a good starter book for those that are interested in New Thought.I've read all of Millman's books and this one is my favorite."},{"Title":"The Laws of Spirit: A Tale of Transformation","review":"Dan Millman has written a fine little book that is full of simple but powerful truths.

It is a quick read with good information."},{"Title":"The Analyst","review":"Anne Osborne fills her first book with many memorable characters, but major and minor. Three generations of the Kingman family, all the characters from Isabel's past, Paul's past, the minor but well described characters of the various hospitals, and most amusing of all, Marcel Block, give the novel depth.The story, while told in out of order sequences, is easy to follow and the order actually spurs the reader on. I felt various emotions toward Isabel: Pity and pain after her experience with Byran, then hate and anger at the way she treated Paul, and then pain again at her depression due to her mistreatment at the hands of Paul's father, William. At the end, I was happy for Paul the he was in love, and cheered him on when he stood up to his powerful father and uncle.All in all, a well-written story about money and how people deal with it and live up to the expectations of society and their family, and how, in the case of Paul and Isabel, don't deal well with it, but manage to come out alive and smarter."},{"Title":"Pregnant Too Soon","review":"The painful decision whether or not to give up your baby for adoption if you are a pregnant teen, is discussed.

It's based on the diary of the editor's great-grandfather, a member of the high-casualty 11th Mississippi. But the editor has fictionalized it. It's impossible to tell what was originally there and what has been added, and of course all the authenticity of the authorial &quot;voice&quot; has been lost. Does Wilkins' diary really contain one of the best first-person accounts of Pickett's Charge out there, or has Ellis made that part up? I'd love to see an edition of Wilkins' diary permitting him to speak in his own voice. The tiny quote in the introduction only serves to tease.

Although the actual dialogue is fictionalised, the facts portrayed in this book are all true. Tithes of Blood presents the War Between the States from the Southern private's point of view. It is not overly moralistic but conveys very well the feelings that may have been experienced by the common soldier, from the excitement of first mustering out to the fear and dread that accompanies battle. The unique perspective of the author, having received much of his information through the oral histories of his family, add a personal dimension to the book that many authors with no connection to the subject matter cannot acheive.

It gives tips on how to encourage development in the different areas, too, which I found helpful. It has a very &quot;positive parenting&quot; feel to it!"},{"Title":"Ages and Stages: A Parent's Guide to Normal Childhood Development","review":"For both the newly becoming and experienced parent alike, this book is a gem for those wishing to learn what to expect of their children as they grow through developmental ages from birth to nine years. Of significant interest to those parents eager to prepare for a more all-rounded Baby-Impact developing baby, rather than simply a feed-and-grow Gymboree or BabyGym physical-activity based development, Schaefer and DiGeronimo provide a treasure box of tips and techniques for building a child's social, emotional interpersonal and cognitive skills. Guiding the reader through each of their twenty chapters using the same five component growth behaviour indicators, clustered into divisions of four age range stages (0-18 mths, 18-36 mths, 36 mths to 6 years, and 6 years to 9 years), the component sections of each age range include emotional health, cognitive development, family and peer relationships, personal growth, and character formation.Beginning each stage with a brief extract from a \`mother's diary', the empathy of the reader is quickly enhanced, as each relates typical observations of a child's natural growth and behavioural demonstrations from a parent's perspective. Schaefer & DiGeronimo would appear to have designed this \`guide book' especially for parents who are having their first baby, and are much concerned with discussing infant and child development in the context of outlining normal achievable milestones, only thereafter hinting at ways for individual milestone enhancement and/or interventions with regards the same normative behaviours. For example, tantrums are excellently discussed, explained (and yes, baby tantrums are quite \`normal' too !), with practical tips provided for coping/dealing with them, as and when they occur.With the working parent also in mind, Schaefer & DiGeronimo also aim for this book to be both very functional and simple to explore. In this they surely succeed, and the reviewers believe that most parents will be able to readily acquire the general concepts of (and thus foster appropriate expectations concerning), the formation of normative human infant and child behaviour, whilst also gaining significant parenting advice. For those unable or unwilling to spend many hours reading the text from cover to cover, pay keen attention to the do's and don'ts sections of each chapter (which they label \`parenting/consider' and \`avoid' respectively). We thoroughly recommend studying the \\"avoids\\", (and listing them on your kitchen notice board !) for absolute gems of child-rearing wisdom, at least in the case of the majority of them.For those with the leisure and luxury to more deeply appreciate the rationales underlaying their advice, Schaefer & DiGeronimo provide further references to the more technical/scientific literature, and occasional additional content concerned with the theoretical and academic basis of their claims. This might require an above average level of knowledge in order to be fully appreciated, though their inclusion of \`science to take home' sections will inform adequately for most readers. All told, this book is far more accessible and informative than most previous volumes with similar titles, and will thus suit the parent looking for a well-written and balanced account of what they might expect (and when), from the normally-developing child. One gripe for some readers might be felt in reading the rare occurrence of the occasional Christian-ethic undertone driving some of the moral-development sections, but the discerning parent can simply replace the terminology as appropriate to their own faith(s) - the advice is nonetheless pretty sound. And, if uncomfortable with the seemingly negative advice of a \\"don't\\" - remember that an \`avoid' can always be changed to offer the same advice in the positive sense as a \`do' (by simply avoiding the word \\"avoid\\", and remembering the latter exemplar part of the sentence only!). Enjoy, and be honest with yourself and your child(ren), this book is a gem, as can be every developing baby when watched closely over their formative years, with such knowledge to hand as this book provides.Dr. Tony Dickinson and Fiona ChanAcademic Research Laboratory, Worldwide Psychometric Solutions."},{"Title":"Ages and Stages: A Parent's Guide to Normal Childhood Development","review":"As a new parent, I have found this book helpful - especially since I haven't spent a lot of time around other children.

I wish I had looked at it before. The content isn't overly long and it gets right to the point about what you can expect developmentally at certain ages. It also gives straight-forward ideas if there is an area that you want to focus. After one evening of reading I was full of all kinds of ideas of things to try. Some things will hopefully help areas where we are running into trouble (like not wanting to go to preschool, which he loves when we are there). Other suggestions are simply things that I never thought to try, but as soon as I read about them, I knew my son was ready and would probably enjoy (like simple daily chores)."},{"Title":"Ages and Stages: A Parent's Guide to Normal Childhood Development","review":"Okay, if you are completely clueless about kids, this would be a good entry level book to read. But, most of the advice is on the obvious side... for instance, this is some advice in the examples for 6-9 year olds. \\"Put safety first. If your child wants to do something that you believe he does not have the good judgment to do safely, don't hesitate to say no. First-graders, for example, rarely have the ability to cross busy streets safely by themselves.\\" Uh-huh. And don't let your 5 year old juggle knives either, they might not be able to do it safely.There is a lot of advice along these lines in this book. Also, you are told to hug your child whenever they want to be hugged, give them lots of reassurance that you love them, and other lines like that. Well, no kidding! There is some good info here if you can deal with being talked to like a completely clueless parent. For that, I give it 2 stars. I was hoping for more info on what to expect during each stage, in terms of social and physical and emotional development. Instead of buying this, look at Babycenter articles online instead! Cheaper and much more good information. This one has been sitting on my shelf pretty much since I started reading it and had to stop in disgust. For parenting advice, my favorite is \\"Easy to Love, Difficult to Discipline\\" by Becky Bailey. I loved that one during my older daughters terrible 3 phase; good reminders to calm down and look at motivation and stage of emotional development.

The author attempts to \\"spin\\" nuances of Greek grammar to somehow aid his position, noting that the Greek word \\"kai\\" translated as \\"and\\" in the Bible is sometimes also translated \\"even.\\" So his main argument is that the Epistles' introductory remarks like \\"Grace to you and peace from God the Father AND our Lord Jesus Christ\\" really means \\"God the Father EVEN the Lord Jesus Christ.\\"This futile attempt is thoroughly dealt with in Gregory Boyd's book \\"Oneness Pentecostals and the Trinity.\\"The theological presentation and scholarship of this book is on par with the Jehovah's Witness Watchtower publication \\"What does the Bible REALLY teach.\\""},{"Title":"The God of Two Testaments","review":"I read this book by Brent Graves a few years ago, and found the scholarship very poor.

Its a cross between a comic book and art book. When you thumb through Mizuno's work you begin to understand what a prolific artist she is and that she has a message to communicate. Her illustrations of the female figure combine many elements, a cute anime look, yet a transgressive maniacal twist in some scenes (blood rain, butcher knives), tender at times, vicious at others. Mizuno communicates the many aspects to female sexuality in a way that elicits a reaction in the viewer--confusion, laughter, fear, disgust, awe. Definitely a unique point of view and a unique book. I'm happy to own a copy."},{"Title":"Junko Mizuno's Hell Babies (Japanese Edition)","review":"I LOVE Junko Mizuno, and this book is EXACTLY what I was looking for! It's ALL pictures!

This is a book I'd keep on hand for a quick pick-me-up since the antics of each clever hero are sure to make you smile.My one complaint is that some of the stories took on too much of a modern colloquial air, which detracted from their folk-tale feel (but this is a minor detail since it never interferes with the overall point of the story).Read this book... it's a lot of fun!"},{"Title":"The Barefoot Book of Trickster Tales","review":"These are wonderful stories. Claudio Munoz is one of our favorite illustrators and Richard Walker is one of our favorite story tellers. With these 2 collaborating, how can you go wrong?

From its famous front cover - a giant, twisting black Chinese dragon on a rich red background, facing Tintin and Snowy as they hide in blue vase patterned with a bird and flowers, the images lit by a pale green lantern - every frame is a detailed artwork in itself. Set largely in Japan and European-occupied Shanghai in the early 1930s, every frame painstakingly evokes the Oriental setting: every wall-covering, item of clothing, ornament, building, street, poster, vehicle. Some of the landscapes and silhouettes are etched with the complex simplicity of a wood-cut by Hokusai, Hiroshige or Taige. The eye-dazzling colour is complemented by a much higher proportion of night scenes than previous Tintins. The deep, sombre colours give the story a melancholy (as do the peeling walls found everywhere behind the prettily picturesque Orientalist scenes). This sadness is matched by the plot's events, not just the violent expansionist plans of Japanese fascists or the culpability of European colonialists, but a world where brave sons turn mad, and orphans nearly drown by sheer chance. Herge's storytelling has also matured significantly since his early efforts: his pacing and variations of tone, his crosscutting and fragmenting of narrative, his sustaining mystery - all come together with superb mastery.And for the first time, because the fictional world created is so believable and historically rooted, Tintin takes on the contours of a genuine hero, much more than a mad marionette endlessly dodging melodramatic villains. His genuine nobility, loyalty and courage, his touching friendship with the orphan Chang, all bespeak fading values in a world crashing towards totalitarianism. A beautiful, urgent book."},{"Title":"The Blue Lotus (The Adventures of Tintin)","review":"This is probably the most exciting and the most interesting of all the 25 Tintin adventures. Considering it was written early in Herge's career (c. 1930s), the level of proficiency and artwork is extraordinary. In this adventure, really the continuation of \\"Cigars of the Pharaoh\\" but able to stand on its own, Tintin travels to China to root out an international drug-smuggling gang. During his stay in China, Tintin gets enmeshed in the politics of the time, when the Japanese were secretly creating pretexts for extending their occupation of China. At a time when the European powers were practicing appeasement towards Japan, this adventure is a daring stance in solidarity with the underdog - here being the Chinese. Much of the day-to-day events of the time are interwoven seamlessly with the action of this adventure comic. Neither is the opium trade (the centerpiece of this story) that the colonial powers pushed on China far removed from reality.What is perhaps the most amazing thing about this creation is that Herge never traveled to China, not before nor after this story (though he did go to Hong Kong much later in his life). For information about China, he relied on magazine photos and articles, and on the information provided by a friend and roommate Chang Chong Ching, who played the role model for the Chang Tintin befriends in the story (and whom we encounter later in Tintin in Tibet). Chang is the one who wrote the myriad excellent specimens of Chinese calligraphy ornamenting the book. All the Chinese signs in the adventure are meaningful inscriptions, from simple restaurant signs \\"Foods\\" and advertisements for international companies \\"Siemens\\" to anti-imperialist and anti-Japanese slogans grafittied on the walls. These signs paint a realistic portrait of the Chinese environment at the time. All my Chinese friends who have read this adventure swear that the depictions of China are realistic and cannot believe that Herge never visited that country!This comic story has all the components for a great piece of art/literature. The artwork is masterful, the settings and scenery realistic, the plot and action entertaining and suspenseful, and the characters well-developed and possess considerable depth. In addition, while the ending is happy, the story is not free from life's tragic moments that bring tears to the eyes. A definite must-read for all Tintin lovers, as well as for those wishing to learn something about China and its recent history."},{"Title":"The Blue Lotus (The Adventures of Tintin)","review":"Herge, The Blue Lotus (Methuen, 1936)Herge here continues the story arc that started in The Cigars of the Pharaoh, with Tintin and Snowy headed off to find the antidote for the madness-inducing poison that played such a prominent role in their last adventure and, of course, finding themselves in even more danger than they were the last time. This is still early work for Herge, and newbies to the series might want to start with one of the later volumes (anything published during World War II will likely make you a fan for life) and come back to this. And, of course, you don't want to read this one without having read The Cigars of the Pharaoh first, or a number of references will make less sense than they otherwise would. ***"},{"Title":"The Blue Lotus (The Adventures of Tintin)","review":"The Blue Lotus is a sequel to Cigars of the Pharaoh, in which Tintin struggled with an international gang of smugglers in north Africa and India. In the current volume, the intrigue with the smugglers takes Tintin from India to Shanghai where his life is constantly in danger as the smugglers try to stop him from finding a cure for their secret poison of madness. There is a racial bias in this volume in favor of the Chinese of Shanghai over the British and Japanese who are portrayed as scheming and self-centered. Herg&eacute; must have sympathized with these colonized people who were being threatened by rising Japanese aggression.Tintin's friendly adversaries, the twin Thompson brothers, detectives, make their appearance in this volume and there is a very funny scene where they try to disguise themselves as Chinese in pre-reform costumes and become the center of attention.The heroes of the book are the elderly Wang and young Chang, two remarkably clever and resourceful allies.This series is great at portraying the world between the two great wars in a way that is simple yet respectful. The adventures are well crafted and the color illustrations are sumptuous in detail.

What I find to be true in his best books is the belief that never dies which is that there is some point of contact possible between the relationships you pursue in your lifetime and the external world or the events and history of earth herself. This illusory point of contact is kept alive, we keep hoping for it, because Tintin is undefeatable since he never makes the mistake of loving."},{"Title":"The Blue Lotus (The Adventures of Tintin)","review":"Written in 1936 , The Blue Lotus is the sequel to the colourful Cigars of the Pharaoh.

It picks up from the end of \\"Cigars of the Pharaoh,\\" and Tintin is seen making his way from India to China after getting a message from a mysterious stranger, who only manages to tell him that he is needed in Shanghai before he succumbs to Rajaijah juice, the poison of madness. In Shanghai he meets corrupt Westerners and evil Japanese, Snowy is poisoned, and Tintin is kidnapped by patriarch Wang Chen-yee who enlists him to help fight corruption and foreign invasion. Using the house of a Chinese gentleman and scholar as a base, Tintin seeks to bring terrorists, opium smugglers and anti-government agents to justice. He gives the bad guys a good thrashing, while also witnessing the disgraceful Mukden Incident of 1931, a major military and diplomatic incident between China and Japan that set off Japanese imperial expansion into the rest of Asia. Tintin evades authorities in the international settlement trying to bring guilty parties to justice. He is captured, nearly executed, he saves the life of and befriends a young Chinese called Chang Chong-chen, a character based on Herge's real-life friend Zhang Chongren (Chang later reappeared in Tintin in Tibet and is mentioned in The Castafiore Emerald). There is a great scene where the two men exchange notes on their various cultures' mutual prejudices and the generalisations of each's respective culture towards each other. Of course Thomson and Thompson show up in disguise, where they fool no-one.

This has not been updated to remove such references and is therefore not suitable for children."},{"Title":"The Blue Lotus (The Adventures of Tintin)","review":"Belgian artist Herge wrote \\"The Blue Lotus\\" as an adventure for his cartoon hero, the young journalist Tintin, in the early 1930's. Of the many Tintin adventures, this one cuts the closest to historical events, capturing a moment in time in which China struggled with civil war, with the intrusive presence of Europeans, and with a Japanese military invasion. The context supports an intense story in which Tintin battles a drug-smuggling conspiracy with the help of a secret Chinese society.As the story opens, we find Tintin in India, where we left him at the conclusion of \\"Cigars of the Pharoah.\\" A Chinese visitor, who goes mysteriously insane before he can pass more than a few words of a message, prompts Tintin to travel to China with his faithful dog Snowy. Once in China, Tintin's willingness to stand up for the Chinese makes him both friends and enemies, and puts him on the trail of an opium smuggling ring.Tintin will be hunted by the Japanese Army, by a corrupt police chief in Shanghai, and by the drug smugglers themselves, whose leader will turn out to be an old enemy. He will be befriended by a young Chinese orphan and by a secret society of Chinese patriots; the story will circle back on itself to a thrilling conclusion.\\"The Blue Lotus\\" features a first-rate storyline. The artwork isn't quite up to Herge's later standards, and Herge deals in some blatant stereotypes of the period, but those minor blemishes need not deter dedicated fans of the series. \\"The Blue Lotus\\" is highly recommended to Tintin fans of all ages."},{"Title":"The Blue Lotus (The Adventures of Tintin)","review":"Tintin's fifth album (counting Tintin in the Land of the Soviets as the first), is Herge's first mature work. Lotus is actually a sequel of the Cigars of the Pharaoh, but it can be read without having read the previous book, and is miles apart in terms of maturity. Also, the book transpires in a very definite time and place: Shanghai in the 1930s, as different powers (the japanese, the western countries) struggle for influence. Tintin takes the side of the suffering chinese people, in the form of his friend Tchang (inspired by a real life chinese friend Tintin met in Belgium, also named Tchang). For the first time, he chastises colonialism and the westerner's treatment of non western people (see page 6 and 7 in particular). Paradoxically, the japanese are the really bad guys in this story, personified by the evil Mitsushirato, Tintin's nemesis in this album. I suppose this was the view that many people in the west have of the japanese during that time. This is a complex, multilayered book (hardly the stuff one think is directed at children), and I suppose this was the reason why it was only translated into english in the 1980s, decades after most of the other albums."},{"Title":"The Blue Lotus (The Adventures of Tintin)","review":"After a few days in royalty in India, Tintin is summoned to a new mystery in China.

Continuing the story of Cigars Of The Pharoah, the book portrays Tintin discovering the Oriental. Along with a well constructed plot and beautiful illustrations, the book accurately displays the prejudices that Occidentals felt for Orientals at the time, and the harships that the Chinese faced.

I would read it a thousand times, and all of Herge's books. They are wonderful classics. :)"},{"Title":"The Blue Lotus (The Adventures of Tintin)","review":"The Blue Lotus installment is one of the best stories in the entire series! A must-read for anyone interested in TinTin!"},{"Title":"The Blue Lotus (The Adventures of Tintin)","review":"\\"The Blue Lotus\\" is the richest in substance of all Tintin books. It is based on real-life political events: The Japanese occupation of Manchuria in the 1930s and later invasion of China. Continuing from \\"Cigars of the Pharaoh,\\" Tintin combats the opium trade. \\"The Blue Lotus\\" presents one of the most intricate plots of the series.Herge's artwork here is also intricate - it is excellent. In addition to providing a great scenic backdrop, he captures so well all that is Chinese: people, clothing, buildings and residences, and Chinese designs and artwork. Herge had been introduced to a young Chinese sculpture student in Brussels who helped him portray Chinese culture and artwork. This is in stark contrast to the simple and stereotypical portrayals of things in \\"Tintin in the Congo\\" and \\"Tintin in America.\\"The consummately corrupt and evil Japanese operative Mitsuhirato is perhaps Herge's most compelling villain. Tintin measured against Mitsuhirato is the apotheosis of representations of good and evil in the Tintin series. Herge's portrayal of the Japanese was not well-received by them, but before Pearl Harbor he compensated for this to some degree in \\"The Crab with the Golden Claws.\\" Note that Herge, the occasional social commentator, also takes a shot at Western arrogance in \\"The Blue Lotus.\\"Tintin's relationship with his friend Chang Chong-Chen and the other Chinese people in the secret society that combats the opium trade is very poignant. Within the series, it represents the most compelling display of teamwork: Tintin is heroic as always, but he also receives considerable heroic help. China is a huge country, as was its struggle against the occupying Japanese. Tintin's nobleness, courage, persistence, and emergence as a hero are uniquely grandiose and melodramatic in this story, clearly one of the best in the series. Quite interestingly, it is No. 18 on Le Monde's list of 100 Best Books of the Twentieth Century."},{"Title":"The Blue Lotus (The Adventures of Tintin)","review":"THE BLUE LOTUS is much more than the sequel to CIGARS OF THE PHARAOH. This is the watershed from mere comic strip to outstanding cultural phenomenom. One can say it is the first graphic novel. In it, Tintin not only battles -and defeats- an opium ring in China, but Japanese militarism, Western imperialism, and most important, his own ignorance, prejudice, and comfort zone. Tintin -which is to say Herg&eacute;- would never be the same after that. Neither will comics.I've read this album countless times since my distant childhood. It never fails to entertain, surprise, and move me as if it was my first reading. It is not alone in my list of best Tintin adventures; it's just up front."},{"Title":"The Blue Lotus (The Adventures of Tintin)","review":"The Blue Lotus, the sequel toThe Adventures of Tintin: Cigars of the Pharaoh (Adventures of Tintin (Facsimile Edition)), is where the Tintin series gels and truly comes into its own. The book was originally written and drawn in 1935 and subsequently reworked and represented in 1946. Indeed, the story flows well, the illustrations are concise and expressive and both Tintin and, especially, his genial Snowy are a joy to follow and behold.What is even more interesting is the firm grasp of the Orient author and illustrator Herg&eacute; displays in this 62-page book. While riddled with the customary lucky breaks and coincidences of the series, The Blue Lotus nonetheless features an intriguing plot greatly enriched with historical accuracies, cultural manifestations and informative details none of which the artist could have directly known given how he had not travelled to the region. Once again, it bears repeating, the original comic strip stems from 1935.Tintin is in India and still bedevilled by the mysteries of the Cigars Of The Pharaoh. With a maddening poison at work and messengers awry he and his dog travel to Shanghai, in occupied China, to get to the bottom of the matter. A professor is kidnapped, a Western financier reappears, Snowy is poisoned, a local boy is rescued and Tintin even pretends to partake in opium in a den called The Blue Lotus.Unlike previous books The Blue Lotus additionally makes better use of cultural stereotypes by largely abandoning a biased Western point-of-view in favour of a more level handed approach towards the natives (Chinese), occupiers (Japanese), aristocracy (Indians) and the Westerners in their midst. In fact, at one point Tintin and his new friend Chang Chong-Chen go through several stereotypes and refute them. Admittedly, the Japanese are not portrayed very well here and probably rightly so. The ever-confused Thomson and Thompson are here too having been introduced in the prequel.The artwork is simple, yet immaculate - just look at the cover and the strategically positioned dragon - as is the cultural references as mentioned. The intrigue is thick and the fun palpable. My book came with a lower quality thicker paper than my copies of the preceding titles and a sticker proclaiming it as, \\"Classic Colour Edition - available in English for the first time!\\" which is odd given the next sentence.If my experience is anything to go by whether ten or tenfold this book is a fun read at any age. It is fun, fast-paced, charming and one might learn a thing or two historically as well."},{"Title":"The Blue Lotus (The Adventures of Tintin)","review":"Historically very good, and an entertaining read. My two boys, ages 10 and 9, LOVE Tintin!"},{"Title":"The Blue Lotus (The Adventures of Tintin)","review":"Picking up where its predecessor Cigars of the Pharaoh left off, The Blue Lotus (the fifth installment in the Adventures of Tintin series) chronicles boy reporter Tintin's adventures in Shanghai. It is notable for many reasons, particularly in that it introduces the character of Tintin's Chinese friend, Chang Chong-Chen, who is to figure prominently in an installment of the series much later on.Masterfully drawn and beautifully suspenseful as always, The Blue Lotus is arguably the most chilling of the Tintin stories. He and Snowy seem to be in more peril here than in any other story with the possible exception of Tintin in America (the threat of their heads being chopped off rears its, uh, head more than once). Possibly not a bedtime story, this one, but it's a fantastic read.There are two more notable things unique to this story. First of all, readers will most likely notice that Herge re-drew the first few pages (most likely to jive with the ending of Cigars of the Pharaoh, which had also been redone), and that Tintin undergoes a conspicuous metamorphosis from his later-edition, cuter self into an earlier, rounder-headed, pinprick-eyed version. Second, this story features Thomson and Thompson in Shanghai what they believe to be local street wear, and if for no other reason, one should peruse The Blue Lotus just for those few panels!"},{"Title":"The Blue Lotus (The Adventures of Tintin)","review":"We were so excited to get this in the mail, but the beautiful color illustrations are missing - with the exception of a few full-page color illustrations, this book is all black and white."},{"Title":"The Blue Lotus (The Adventures of Tintin)","review":"As you might or might not know, most early Tintin was originally published in B/W format, with old style drawing. Yes boys and girls, it wasn't the colour edition we have now in hands. The first 9 titles are sceheduled to be released in English. This Blue Lotus is one of them.Most early Tintin might look very old to us. The drawing weren't that smooth, compared to the later coloured edition. If you're a die-hard Tintin fan, I'm sure you really wanted to know what the book originally looked like. You will notice that the panels also changed. Not just the size, but also the sequence. Some panels were even edited or deleted. Some panels are added. In short, you can compare both editions.The book was carefully printed and packaged. From the looks, people would already guess that this book (and also the others) is a lux book. The paper was good. The hard cover was good. The binding was good. The printing inside was also good. What more can you expect? Here the book also provided several pin-ups or covers in colour. It's a very nice gift!If you feel you're a die-hard fan of Tintin (and Herge) then no doubt you must have all these 9 B/W original editions."},{"Title":"The Blue Lotus (The Adventures of Tintin)","review":"The book was good, it's a book. I would read it because it's a comic book. There was nothing I didn't like about it because I like reading these kinds of books. My favorite character in it was Tintin because he was the main character and he is good, sneaky and quick, plus he's sly. The best part I liked was when he was talking to that kid about what people think of the Chinese which was all not true. This is a book I would read, or read every book in the collection.The Blue Lotus was an okay book; it was one of the best books I've read out of three books. I like how it hooked you in and made you wonder what was going to happen next. Plus I like how Tintin was on the run from the Japanese, because he didn't know why they were chasing him. It almost made you not want to stop reading it.This was the first book that I have read of the adventures of Tintin and I really enjoyed it. I love how the author captivated historical events and figures. My favorite part was when Wang's son was about to cut Tintin, Wang, and Mrs. Wang's heads off. Then Chang and his helpers stopped it and foiled Mr. Mitsuhirato's plans. I give this book 5 stars and 2 thumbs up.Tintin & the Blue Lotus was a very well written graphic novel. There were a lot of historical moments and events going on in this book. I did like the constant trickery by Tintin and him making a fool of Mitsuhirato and the authorities. Throughout the entire book there was never a dull moment. Of the plethora of characters present in this book, I like Mr. Wong the most. He was a very wise, honorable, and helpful man in this story. All in all, this book is a great read and has a fun page turning plot."},{"Title":"The Blue Lotus (The Adventures of Tintin)","review":"My son and daughter always enjoy Tintin books.

This should not cause people to shy away from this book or from giving it to children. Things are not so terrifying.

Custer is a witty and prolific writer. She also gives little-known insight into everyday happenings in life on the prairie and how women survived the journey. Particularly interesting are the dynamics of relationships between women when living literally in the middle of nowhere, surviving the harshest of climates, with few friends, the same friends, for extended times. Also interesting is the relationship between people of color and the white soldiers. Custer is an enigma, and readers should read this book but also others (&quot;Son of the Morning Star&quot; is the best thus far) to get a glimpse at the man. Libby Custer falls into poetic verse at times, but this can be refreshing - there are not many writings of women in these times available."},{"Title":"\\"Boots and saddles\\" ;: Or Life in Dakota with General Custer","review":"This is the first of three books George Armstrong Custer's widow Elizabeth Bacon Custer (EBC hereafter) wrote about her life with the General. It begins with Custer and the 7th being assigned to North Dakota, and ends with the expedition which led to the Battle of the Little Bighorn. EBC is a good writer within the limitations of the \\"style\\" of 1880s-1890s nonfiction. One has to allow for the fact that for her, G. A. Custer was the tallest, strongest, smartest, wittiest, bravest and most omnicompetent man alive. [It's worth pointing out that she often also describes all the troopers riding with Custer as \\"physically perfect, absolutely splendid specimens of manhood in its prime.\\"] Also following the style of the period, EBC almost entirely omits the names of those she writes about. But otherwise her word-portrait of the life of an officer's wife in the utter desolation of the frontier forts during the Plains Indian Wars is effective, vivid and often moving.There are so many good stories here I don't want to spoil any by hinting at them. The most famous is EBC's account of \\"Old Nash,\\" a Mexican laundress who earned several small fortunes with her expert sewing and tailoring, was much sought-after as a marriage partner despite her dark complexion and broad shoulders, and who turned out to be the best midwife around... despite....A few of the many things that impressed me with EBC's powers of observations--- When the great chiefs and warriors of the plains came to visit Custer, she noted that they (contrary to modern stereotype) were physically almost completely undeveloped, with geek-like pipestem arms... and she understood the reason: that males among the Plains indians did essentially no physical labor whatsoever. Another fine passage involves the relationship between Custer and his favorite indian scout, the famous Bloody Knife. According to EBC Bloody Knife was relentlessly sarcastic concerning the skills and abilities of white men, and Custer in particular. When on a hunting expedition with Custer, Bloody Knife would keep up a running narrative of belitting remarks concerning Custer's unfamiliarity with and incompetence with firearms. As soon as Custer got off a good shot, Bloody Knife would fall silent and express his admiration with a brief smile, which Custer obviously treasured far more than many sentences of insincere and overdone flattery. It reminds me a bit of a comment supposedly made by Wyatt Earp about his great friend Doc Holliday: \\"He can always make me laugh!\\"There is no gossip about Custer's notoriously poor relations with many of the other officers and men of the 7th Cavalry. EBC defends this by saying that Custer deliberately did not tell her of feuds and enemies, because he wanted her as hostess to treat all members of the 7th with equal courtesy. However, this excuse is contradicted within the book by extracts from letters written to her by Custer, which refer to feuds and enemies in ways that would have made no sense if EBC were not fully informed,Recommended for anyone curious about the life of Cavalry officers, troopers and their families on the \\"rim of empire\\" in the 1870s."},{"Title":"\\"Boots and saddles\\" ;: Or Life in Dakota with General Custer","review":"There are so few well written and personally lived books about the people of the northern great plains, but this is one of them.

Reich (Review by Laura Brose) c. 2008At first glance, the title, \\"The Greening of America\\" can lead one to believe that this is a book about ecology, or landscaping, or perhaps both.In this case, however, while the increasing public consciousness of environmental conservation and ecological issues which would emerge in the 1970s is discussed in the book, this phenomenon is cited as only one of the sea changes in society and culture being wrought by the divergent mindset of the emerging generation then in their teens and twenties, the erstwhile Youth with a capital Y, now known as the Baby Boomers, now no longer chronologically and physically youthful. In the context of the title and the book the \\"greening\\" of America is an encompassing renewal of public values in many different sectors of society from participation in government taking new forms and new importance (protests, the Peace Movement, and the vote given to 18 year olds as the spoils of the Vietnam war, the Draft and the War having become issues which were personally relevant to a then-growing category of the population) to changes in fashion (the common usage of casual clothing and growing social acceptance of jeans as appropriate garments for all ages and sexes making freer and more casual behavior possible).This renewal is credited to a shift in individual consciousness, known in the book as Consciousness III.\\"Consciousness III is an attempt to gain transcendence. This becomes apparent when we compare Consciousness III to Consciousness I and II. I and II are more alike than they are different. They both represent the underlying form of consciousness appropriate to the age of industrial development and the market economy, beginning in the eighteenth century. Both subordinate man's nature to his role in the economic system; Consciousness I on the basis of economic individualism, II on the basis of participation in organization. Both approve the domination of environment by technology. Both subordinate man to the state, Consciousness I by the theory of the unseen hand, II by the doctrine of the public interest. Both see man as basically antagonistic to his fellow man; neither has any theory of a human community except in terms of consent to law, government, and force. Both deny the individual's responsibility for the actions of society. Both define man's existence in material terms, and define progress similarly. Both define thought in terms of the premises of science. Consciousness II differs from I mainly in that II is adjusted to the realities of a larger scale of organization, economic planning, and a greater degree of political administration.The new consciousness is utterly different. It seeks restoration of the non-material elements of man's existence, the elements like the natural environment and the spiritual that were passed by in the rush of material development. It seeks to transcend science and technology, to restore them to their proper place as tools of man rather than as the determinants of man's existence. It is by no means anti-technological, it does not want to break machines, but does not want machines to run men.\\" (307).Consciousness III is attributed as common to those who were just coming into chronological adulthood at the time of the printing of the book, but could also be found in scattered individualist individuals of other chronological ages:\\"The task of the new generation is to see the humanity in all men, and to work for the renewal, the rebirth, the return to life, of all men. The new generation must bridge the gap that separates parents from children, and the still greater gaps that separate worker from student, white-collar professional from those who are young and liberated. They must realize that \\"youth\\" is not chronological age but the state of growing, learning, and changing, and that all people must be helped to regain the condition of youth. The new generation must make their revolution by the yeast theory; they must spread their life\\"(261).A lot of the back-to-the-land communes and \\"experimental communities\\" described in this and other books of the time soon withered for lack of money and political will (surely many participants were not long in discovering that largely unrewarded labor and physical hardship are anything but personally fulfilling). Alternative living arrangements of another sort (those without benefit of clergy) grew in numbers, but so did the numbers of those working for The Man. Many of the supposedly enlightened generation grew up to be much like their parents and to produce a world with many of the same drawbacks (even if there is more casual and comfortable clothing), often with the rationale of personal and familial well-being if not fulfillment. The \\"hippie ideals\\" seem at first blush to the children of the Flower Children to be as ridiculous the \\"Hippie\\" Halloween costumes widely available these days, emblazoned with peace signs but made of the plastic products that contribute to environmental pollution, petroleum resource wars, and extractive corporations and governments. Like the plastic Halloween costumes, much of what is believed and portrayed about hippies, the peace movement, and related phenomena are falsities and misunderstandings, some of which are promoted by those with an axe to grind or a profit to make.The biggest falsity of these is that the ideals both humanistic and humane are as outmoded and irrelevant to our times as Nehru collars and bell-bottoms. Organic foods distributed in mainstream supermarkets and restaurants, \\"Green\\" business processes, alternative energy source promotion, and electronic recycling drives organized by individuals who may have never worn bell-bottoms, are all survivals of the Consciousness III ideals in somewhat changed form, as is the increase in the so-called \\"helping professions\\"; teachers, social workers, shrinks. It sticks in my memory that on the 1980s TV show Alf, paterfamilias Willy explained to his hairy cat-eating resident alien houseguest that although he no longer lived and dressed as he did in the 1960s, his current career in social work was a way to allow the survival of those ideals he embraced back then while supporting a family and living in a straight-looking suburban home. Landscaping and ecology are not necessarily mutually exclusive."},{"Title":"Primary Whites: A Novel Look at Right-wing Politics","review":"When I bought this book I was expecting nothing more (or less) then a good, fun, comic romp.

As a biography, it is an easy read, a real page-turner.Paine was in the middle of everything in revolutionary America. He is sometimes dismissed in high school history courses as a mere \\"pamphleteer.\\" He was much more than that and had influence that transcended class and borders.Paine was something of a lout personally. He fought with Washington and Hancock and, if memory serves me, Jefferson too. He almost lost his head in the French Revolution. Except for a last-minute quirk, he was headed for the guillotine.Oh, yes, he also had a weakness for blonde, 18-year-old prostitutes on both sides of the Atlantic.It's an engrossing read, out of print now, but well worth the time to track down and read. Amazon has copies for sale."},{"Title":"Rebel! A biography of Tom Paine","review":"I saw a 12-part documentary on the American Revolution, and it mentioned in passing, that Thomas Paine was too radical to be classified a \\"Founding Father\\" and it piqued my curiosity.Paine then, was considered \\"revolutionary\\" even moreso than the other revolutionaries who established an independent nation.This so fascinated me that I set out to discover biographies on Thomas Paine.This one, \\"REBEL!\\" by Samuel Edwards, was one of those which emerged just prior to the growth of the Internet, so there are no reviews for it; but if you can get a copy, you will be surprised at the biographer's expertise and erudition.Biographies are not so cut and dried as a reader may generally suppose. A biographer is primarily, an editor, and an editor of history at that. His own experiences and talents will filter all of that which he examines; and believe me, that are hack biographers. Samuel Edwards turns out to be one of the better Biographers.I knew I had struck paydirt when I read the first pages. Here is a brief example of Edwards at his craft...\\"Even in his own time Thomas Paine was regarded throughoutthe Western world as unique, and so complex that neither friendnor foe could classify him. Was he a true humanist, dedictated tothe cause of freedom; or was he merely an iconoclast whoadvocated revolution for its own sake? Was he a deist or an atheist?Was he a philosopher whose thought was a natural extension of thework of John Locke, or was he an intellectual charlatan?Men could agree only that his pen was mighyty behond compareand that his eccentricities fascinated, amused, and repelled them.\\"---p. 4,\\"REBEL!: A BIOGRAPHY OF TOM PAINE\\" by Samuel Edwardsby Praeger Publishers, Inc., 1974..I find myself identifying with Thomas Paine, since a wise priest had informed me one evening of a critical fact about human experience, when he said; \\"There's not just ONE WAY to be.\\" I have never forgotten that wisdom; and so I find thatThomas Paine reflects that. Thus, it may be that some human beings do not exhibit a limited personality, which at best, articulates only a single talent or feature. There may be some men, who transcend conception, as far as being limited to say, Philosophical Pursuits, or Financial Gain, or Generalship, or characterized primarily by either a Virtue or a Vice.Some human beings, at least theoretically, may exhibit most if not all of such features, and moreover, may combine such characteristics in combination with an uncommon visceral power, in which their Mind is connect to their Feelings, so as to produce a person of great discernment, who cannot but have a powerful impact upon mankind..This seems to have been the case with Thomas Paine. He is a man who literally, transcends the limitations of his own cultural foundation, who cultivated the capacity to articulate universal truths in language that it could stir men's Souls...Thomas Paine was actually an Englishmen whom made the acquaintance in England of Benjamin Franklin, and conversed with him over many dinners as a guest of the famous American. Ben Franklin say great potential in the opinionated Paine who was then 37 years of age. It was Franklin who lent Paine the money for an October passage to New York, and a letter of recommendation which helped Paine get settled with employment in Philadelphia as Editor-In--Chief of a new American paper, entitled \\"The Pennsylvania Magazine\\". At this position, Paine's natural talents as a writer interested in Philosophy, Politics, and Science put him at the forefront of American thinking, at a time when the advocacy for American independences was becoming a factor in the 13 English Speaking Colonies.By the way, to understand what is happening in American Politics to day, it is possible to acquire a deep insight into these \\"Tea Party\\" affairs by reading about Thomas Paine, and studying his thought in his popular works such as \\"Common Sense\\"."},{"Title":"Survey of 300 A+ Students","review":"Kenneth Green has written a practical, entertaining book. 300 A+ Students would be a great gift for a college student.His book is cleverly organized: for instance, the section on test-taking is divided into before, during, and after tests, and covers everything from the importance of getting enough pre-exam sleep to bringing Black Forest gummy bears for a break during a long test.

It was amazing what some of these people went through, but when they got the Chicken Soup books it helped them think positively and get there feet back on the ground. This is reccommended for teenages, but also adults. Their are many parts in the book that deal with parents. It helped me get closer to mine as well. After this book, and reading all about how good they were, I went and got the Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul 1, 2 and 3. They haven't arrived yet, but I'm waiting.Great book!

It is my favorite book of all time. It has alot of wonderful stories, letters, poems, and quotes. When people say that it is supposed to heal the soul, it really does. Some of the stories I could relate to and I knew how the young author felt in this situation. One of my favorite stories was the one titled \\"My Sister's First Love\\". It was about a teenage girl who had recently went through a horrible tragedy. Her first real boyfriend was experiencing certain symptoms and he often didn't feel well. He went to the doctors and learned that he had a tumor in his brain. He went through many tests. He died a while later on Valentines Day. It was a story that made me think. Some of the stories in the book were sad. After I finished the book, I thought about alot of things in life. It is a great book and it really does heal the soul.

He has a commendable distaste for unsubstantiated anecdotes. It includes both significant biographical material as well as many fine games not usually found in the main game collections (which are highly recommended by the way), and often with Capa's own notes.Winter has also unearthed some very interesting game annotations by Capa, including the Lasker-Schlechter match, a famous Spielmann loss to Tarrasch, a Janowski brilliancy, etc. There are also fascinating reports by Capa on tournaments such as his greatest victory, New York 1927, and the Chess Olympiad in Buenos Aires, 1939, where Capa made the best score on top board.The chapters on his World Championship negotiations and matches with both Lasker and Alekhine make fascinating reading.There also clear B&amp;W photos of Capa at all stages of life."},{"Title":"Capablanca: A Compendium of Games, Notes, Articles, Correspondence, Illustrations and Other Rare Archival Materials on the Cuban Chess Genius Jos&eacute; Ra&uacute;l Capablanca, 1888&#8211;1942","review":"This book is basically a biography via the subject's own writings and papers. Winter does, in fact, include plenty of his own (excellent) prose, but the meat of the book is Capablanca's own writing, much of it new to me, and I've read quite a bit on Capa through the years.Especially interesting are Capa's thoughts on contemporary players and his early game annotations when he was writing for various chess magazines early in his career. For example, he annotated every game of the epic Lasker-Schlechter match, and they are all included here.Although Capa is infamous for writing less than virtually any other World Champion, he still penned quite a number of articles, all of them of interest, and all, or nearly all, of which are collected here.Winter is known for being a stickler about documentation, so you will not find a lot of unfounded gossip or apochryphal stories or legend here. This is a refreshing dfference from the large majority of chess biographies, including other books on Capa. Capablanca's career is full of enough true mindboggling stories to need to make anything up.This book is a splendid achievement by Winter, and I had a difficult time putting it down. I plan on going back to it again and again as a reference, and, of course, to play over the games which Capablanca had annotated."},{"Title":"Capablanca: A Compendium of Games, Notes, Articles, Correspondence, Illustrations and Other Rare Archival Materials on the Cuban Chess Genius Jos&eacute; Ra&uacute;l Capablanca, 1888&#8211;1942","review":"As a big fan of details and facts, Winter is always for me. He\`s the best chess historian by far, and this may be his best book to date. Even if you\`re not a serious Capablanca fan, this book will keep you entertained with those little special events that make life so interesting (like including a section of an article by Sergei Prokofiev about his playing in a simul against Capbablanca). I also didn\`t know until reading the Capablanca writings from articles included in this book that the World Champion really did have a nice sense of humour. Engrossing, filled with facts, all attributions in order... but by no means is it dry.

Groth's attitudinal survey of Holocaust survivors (including a sub-sample of those who managed to escape from Nazi control during the war) provides a wealth of information about the survivors' assessments of their ordeal and those responsible for it. The survey itself is well constructed with a sample of respondents closely representing the Jewish population in Europe in 1939. Especially interesting are the survey's findings regarding Jewish perception of potential danger before and during the Holocaust, assignment of blame for their experience, and empathy toward victims of similar activities in Bosnia, Rwanda, and Cambodia. The results serve as a springboard for Groth's critique of prominent examples of Holocaust scholarship, e.g., Arendt and Goldhagen, and a pointed reminder of broader responsibility for the events that transpired."},{"Title":"Holocaust Voices","review":"Dr. Groth's work is unique in holocaust studies. It is by a survivor who interviewed survivors to gain statistically valid insights into their experiences, knowledge, and attitudes both before the holocaust and after. Dr. Groth's approach is sympathetic but scholarly and objective. Of particular interest is his own assessment of the scholarship of others in this field. Although he recognizes, of course, the brutality of many Germans, he rejects the Goldhagen conclusion that the German people as a whole were particularly conditioned and prepared to perpetrate the holocaust."},{"Title":"Holocaust Voices","review":"As a Holocaust survivor with of similar background as Dr.Groth, I appreciate the fact that he examines survivors' personal , social, and political attitudes from numerous perspectives, including their prewar lives. His research crosses the boundaries of sociology and psychology, giving clarity to the complex influences on survivors' world view. After reading this book, Survivors and their families will gain a better insight into the forces that shape our attitudes. This book is not just for those interested in Holocaust literature, it can easily serve as a model of analyzing other populations that have lived through traumatic experiences."},{"Title":"The 21 Most Effective Prayers of the Bible","review":"Really efectiveThey will be of a lot of help when you are looking for confortable ways to motivate your self"},{"Title":"The 21 Most Effective Prayers of the Bible","review":"Sometimes when we are living through difficult times we pray asking for peace and support, this book will give you that and the words you might not find when worried and in need, and help you strengh your faith."},{"Title":"The 21 Most Effective Prayers of the Bible","review":"Both my husband and I read this book and it brings a biblical view into today's life.

If it were as simple as that,then surely allhumanities problems would have been solved,and we would all be living heavenly lives. the truth of the matter is, such oversimplified prayers will work if there is the secret of powerful spiritual techniques behind them. for example, the kabbalists try at least to give people a means of achieving this by revealing the sacred names of God which can release spiritual power to back prayer statements like those made in the book.a verse in psalm ninety one states,''when he calls to me i will answer him because he knows my name,'' this statement indicatesthe need for the deeper sacred knowledge which,it is my conviction ,the spiritual masters of the bible had.again, the statement by christ that''not every one who calls me lord,lord will enter the kingdom of heaven''implies on a deeper level that those who know the secrets of the sacred knowlege of divinity will qualify. that is the problem i find with most christian ministries,there is a lot of quotations and story telling which often generates no powerful help for people.i believe it is now extremely incumbent upon church leaders today to seek out and give to thier flock some of the sacred words and power which lies hidden within power bases of divinity.Dr.Dave Early,the author of this book narrates the story of Elijah,and the prophets of Baal,and sites the prayer suppossedly used by Elijah to send down fire from heaven to consume the offering,as ''answer me.'' if it were as simple as this why can't this dramatic episode be dramatically emulated today by the average or established ministeries? i say,it's because there was ,and is more to it than meets the eye. Elijah and the biblical masters,in my view, were keepers of potent and sacredtradition which is not revealed in the bible,only the stories and incidents are told. to write a prayer book without some of the basic spiritual technology to empower the prayers,and to make it genuinely work in peoples lives leaves people dissapointed,and disillusioned.i would like to refer readers to a book called,''christianity with power''by charles craft who deals with why a lot of christian ministeries today operate without true power."},{"Title":"The 21 Most Effective Prayers of the Bible","review":"This is a beautiful sample.

Lasker, Advertising, and the Election of Warren G. Harding","review":"This is a book not to be missed by those wanting to understand why Harding was elected. Harding, viewed by several political bosses as the \\"best of the second-raters,\\" had many on-going adulterous relationships that needed covering up, not to mention his inability to really connect with the public. His tendency to, in his words, \\"bloviate\\" when speaking, was, in reality, speaking without substance. Albert D. Lasker was brought in by the Republican Committee to fix that, with his public relations and advertising expertise.Lasker was the past-master of what became known as \\"reason why\\" advertising, celebrity endorsements, and pre-emptive claims. All of these techniques were used in the Harding front-porch campaign.Albert Lasker is usually never mentioned by Harding biographers, but if you want to know how Harding, our worst president, could get elected, this book answers that question."},{"Title":"Stop Rising Healthcare Costs Using Toyota Lean Production Methods: 38 Steps for Improvement","review":"I'm skeptical of a lean book when there is a glaring defect on the spine of the book.

I don't care for the way it is organized, \\"38 easy steps\\" isn't very inviting. There isn't a 38-step sequential process you can go through for lean.I'd recommend that healthcare people instead read \\"Lean Thinking\\", \\"The Toyota Way\\", and the excellent Harvard Business Review writings of Steve Spear.

In the 1920s and especially during the Great Depresssion of the 1930s, dance marathon fads played on this morbid fascination we have for people with hard-luck stories, people down on the luck, people at the end of their rope.With uncommon depth and insight, Frank M. Calabria analyzes audience responses to these weird spectacles, the painful agony of the competition, and the abusive treatment by walkathon show organizers and their emcees. This 1993 book also includes a wonderful collection of period photographs. As a former psychology professor, Calabria is qualified to present what is surely a unique analysis of the increasingly tortured conditions of contestants' emotion state as a dance marathon progressed.Reading Calabria's book, I suffered from an interesting paradox: throughout the descriptions of sleep-deprived, hypnotic exhaustion endured by the wretched &quot;dancers,&quot; I found myself alert and eagerly turning to the next page."},{"Title":"Knife Edge","review":"Not my normal type of read but she definitely delivers gripping stuff.

My concerns were needless as it is every bit as good as the first.The Noughts and Crosses trilogy is a daring and wildly imaginative concept which has been brilliantly realised by a fantastically talented writer.I thought that this book was excellently written and an exceptionally enjoyable read. Checkmate really captures the imagination from the first page. It is a rollercoaster of a book, taking the reader through a whirlwind of different emotions. The turmoil that Callie Rose endures as she grows up is particularly well portrayed.This book is a fabulous end to an amazing trilogy. Malorie Blackman is one of the finest writers i have had the fortune to come across!

Her husband, Callum, was a Cross but was murdered for taking part in the Liberation Militia. Then there is Jude, Callum's brother, the one person who is blaming Sephy for the death of his brother. However, Callum's mother isn't holding a grudge against Sephy.The one thing on Jude's mind is to get revenge for his brother. And his first step is to get rid of Sephy.Along the way both Jude and Sephy fall in love with other people: one to get access to money, while the other is just in contempt. But also along the way, both of their lives become even more complex, and even more damaged.One will be helped, one will be betrayed, and only one will be overwhelmed by their current distress and do the unthinkable.Dark, emotional, and extremely alarming, KNIFE EDGE gets us an inside look at a world separated by color and where hatred and violence flourishes.

I looked over all of the questions I had gotten wrong on my first go-around with the book on the Thursday bfore the test.

I would recommend this book to anybody wishing to increase their score with a concise, concentrated workbook.Unless your score is very low on the Math section, a book full of basic skills and tricks will probably not help you. Using this workbook could be the difference between a mediocre 640 and a pretty-durn-good 720 (and only in two weeks).Good luck!PS: On the SAT, there was a problem that even used the same numbers as one of the questions in the Kaplan book!

The book does not teach concepts like the Barron's book, but through doing the questions and reading the explanations you can extract the concepts and the train of thought. The only part where the book is slightly flawed is that some of its questions, towards the end of a question set, titled &quot;hard,&quot; really require more thinking than is required on the real exam.

It covers most math topics on the SAT with one notable exception: functions, which is unfortunate since this topic represents the \\"new\\" content since the test went to three sections. Most of the problems are similar to SAT problems and are at an appropriate difficulty level. However, the practice tests at the end have problems that are too similar to the problems in the book, making them easier. This means the score the book predicts is higher than what you will get on the actual test. The problem explanations are hit or miss.

Although this book has a nice selection, some of his greatest poems are missing from this collection, notably &quot;Mending Wall&quot; and &quot;Fire and Ice.&quot; Still, if you just want a few selected poems to carry you back to another era into a New England woods on a snowy evening you can't go wrong here."},{"Title":"The Road Not Taken and Other Poems (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"Frost, like no other poet, captures a moment that we all have experienced at one time in life. He paints a picture with such vivid strokes of literary imagery that the mind brings the reader back to a moment in time, almost feeling the sensations of past experiences.For example, I recently made a decision where I was torn between family and career interests. To ease the anxiety of a lost professional opportunity, I reasoned that the chance would present itself again someday, maybe. Thinking of Frost I realized that he captured that very self-rationalization in the Road Not Taken. \\"Oh, I kept the first for another day!

The \\"Principles\\" is a grand work which a group of distinguished psychologists described in 1969 as \\"the most literate, most provocative, and at the same time the most intelligent book on psychology that has ever appeared in English on any other language.\\" The \\"Principles\\" proved greatly influential on many philosophers, notably Edmund Husserl and Ludwig Wittgenstein, as well as on psychologists. Because of the length and depth of the \\"Principles\\", it proved unsuitable for classroom use by undergraduates. Thus, working rapidly in 1891, William James substantially revised and abridged his masterpiece, resulting in his \\"Psychology: Briefer Course\\" published in 1892. For many years, this book was a standard textbook in psychology, and it remains eminently worth reading as an introduction to the discipline and to James's own thought.The \\"Psychology\\" is about one-third the length of the \\"Principles.\\" It consists of approximately 40 percent new material, most of which is in the opening chapters of the book on sensation and on anatomy and physiology. The remainder of the book is an abridgment of the earlier work, with philosophical discussions, quotations from other authors, and polemical material deleted or sharply curtailed.The \\"Psychology\\" is an accessible and endlessly fascinating book on at least three levels: first, for its insight into the science of psychology; second for the suggestive character of its discussion of the relationship between psychology (and the natural sciences)on the one hand and philosophy and religion on the other hand; third, for the eloquence of James's writing and for his passion for the ethical and active life.I will say a short word in the following three paragraphs about each of these.At the outset, James defines psychology as \\"the description and explanation of states of consciousness as such.\\" He also finds that psychology and mental activity are neurologically and physiologically based. In other words, as James writes, \\"the immediate condition of a state of consciousness is an activity of some sort in the cerebral hemispheres.\\" An illustration of the physiological basis of James work is his theory of the emotions, called the James-Lange theory, in which he argued that human feelings and emotions were rooted in actions and efforts rather than, is is still frequently supposed, the other way round. Everything that James writes has an empirical, physiological cast; and yet his work is far from reductionist. For all its emphasis on physiology, James analysis of the mind begins in chapters 9 and 10 with his discussions of the \\"stream of consciousness\\" and of the nature of the \\"self\\". He uses what he describes as the analytical method to analyze the fact of consciousness into habit, emotion, instinct, reasoning, attention, and the like. He does not take a Lockean/Humean approach by attempting to derive consciousness by compounding from simple sensation.James distinguishes the scientific approach of psychology from the questions of metaphysics of philosophy while showing their interrelations. Scientific studies are partial and rely upon evidence, while metaphysics involves an attempt to think globally. With an appealing humility, James stresses how little is fundamentally known about psycholgy, an observation that may still hold true today. James emphasizes the limited reach of human cognition and the selective character of all human perception. In a memorable passage, he describes the mind's attempt to abstract from reality, which he characterizes as \\"one big blooming buzzing Confusion.\\" I found a Kantian tendency in much of what James says about human knowledge in the Psychology. James also emphasizes, as did Kant, the deterministic character of scientific observation and study. But James does not find the physiological character of human effort necessarily inconsistent with human free will or with the power of the individual with effort to control his or her destiny.With all its scientific learning, the Psychology has an ethical, exhortatory tone as befitting its proposed use by students. James can be a magnificently inspiring writer. The Psychology concludes with a discussion of the will. James writes about the need to hold to the possibility of the free will in order to make an individual's life meaningful and significant. He writes at the conclusion of his chapter on the will:\\"Thus not only our morality but our religion, so far as the latter is deliberate, depend on the effort which we can make. \\"Will you or won't you have it so?\\" is the most probing question we are ever asked; we are asked it every hour of the day, and about the largest as well as the smallest, the most theoretical as well as the most practical, things. we answer by consents or non-consents and not by words. What wonder that these dumb responses should seem our deepest organs of communication with the nature of things! What wonder if the effort demanded by them be the measure of our worth as men! What wonder if the amount which we accord of it were the one strictly underived and original contribution which we make to the world!\\"The edition of the \\"Psychology\\" I am reviewing here is the authoritive edition of \\"The Works of William James\\" published by Harvard University Press. Certain other editions in print omit the early chapters on sensation and should be avoided. The best source of this work for the interested reader is in volume 1 of the writings of William James, 1879-1899 published by the Library of America. It includes the Harvard text of the Principles as well as several other works of James and sells at at economical price.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas: A Pop-Up Book","review":"This book...is a must for any Nightmare collector.

So when an old flame calls and needs some help, McGee quickly leaves balmy Ft. Lauderdale for the colder climes of Chicago in John D. MacDonald's One Fearful Yellow Eye.Glory Geis is the widow of renowned neurosurgeon, Fortner Geis. When Geis dies after a long illness, Glory discovers that his $600,000 inheritance (much bigger money in the 1960's) has gone missing. It turns out that Dr. Geis liquidated all his assets over the course of the last year of his life. Glory is left without very much money and her stepchildren accuse her of foul play. So Glory begs McGee to find out what happened to the inheritance. Of course, Travis discovers that the good doctor has more than a few skeletons in his closet, and there are a number of suspects.The plot in this 8th book is a little thin, and I figured out fairly early who the blackmailer was. But I still gave One Fearful Yellow Eye four stars as the writing is sharp and crisp and as good as any previous McGee. Two favorites include:\\"Take her home. Boat her, beach her, bake her, brown her, and bunk her. You too are a sucker for busted birds, starving kittens, broody broads.\\"or\\"There was no color in the world. Gray sand, gray water, gray beach, gray sky. I was trapped in one of those arty salon photographs of nature in the raw, the kind retired colonels enter in photography contests.\\"In terms of philosophizing, this book is MacDonald at his best. Also, while I tend to like McGee better in his native Florida, Chicago is rather a good setting for him.This is my 8th Travis McGee and I'm a long way from being tired of him. I'm anxious to start number nine-Pale Gray for Guilt."},{"Title":"ONE FEARFUL YELLOW EYE","review":"Travis McGee leaves Florida to help a friend in wintry Chicago in this brisk, economic adventure that's no shorter than the other installments but still feels more compact.The classic MacDonald asides are all here: McGee offers up commentaries on Christmas, modeling, art, homosexuality, toilet paper and sex, among other things.And there are some really good scenes -- Trav's extremely unsettling visit to the Farley farm, an ominous encounter in a windstorm, a creepy moment in which mysterious figures get the better of McGee (though MacDonald fumbles this by underplaying it afterward), and one seriously wacked-out climax in a retirement community.This isn't great McGee -- it just doesn't have the complexity, level of menace or vivid characters of yarns like \\"Bright Orange,\\" \\"Amber,\\" \\"Pink\\" or \\"Lavender.\\" But if you're looking for a quick MacDonald snack, \\"Yellow\\" is where it's at."},{"Title":"ONE FEARFUL YELLOW EYE","review":"Like a fine local wine, Travis doesn't travel well. His lack of enthusiasm for the Windy City is boundless, and willy-nilly, this is where he must be to assist his latest lady in distress. The architecture, politics, and citizenry are bad enough, but my God, the weather is freezing!\\"One Fearful Yellow Eye\\" is an intricate tale of \\"where's the money?\\". Brilliant, kind, and wealthy neurosurgeon Dr. Fortner Geis had converted all his assets into cash before his death, and left his young wife Glory in a precarious situation. The cash was not to be found and Glory not only faced the prospect of being poor, but heavy suspicion as well.This is an intricate tale with an excellent whodunit complement. MacDonald is sure enough of his Travis creation by this time to let Trav display a fine self-deprecating sense of humor as well as the usual speed, strength and purity of purpose. The many threads to the story are all kept well in hand and dovetail neatly into a grand final&eacute;. The two stereotyped ungrateful stepchildren turn out to be not so typical after all. The leading ladies have a hard time in this book, emotionally and physically. My only complaint is that widow Glory was a bit much with her oh-so philosophical bravery and fawning adoration of Trav.This is superior McGee-good pace, characterizations and a very twisty story."},{"Title":"ONE FEARFUL YELLOW EYE","review":"I really enjoy the Travis McGee series and especially like this book. Much as I enjoy reading about his exploits in Florida, the change of scene to Chicago is an interesting change of pace. Perhaps more than average number of twists and turns in this plot, and a little more &quot;cringe factor&quot; from the violence than some of the other McGee books.As the title of my review indicates, I really like this series as a whole. They're among the books I go back to again and again when I'm restless and want something fun to read. I always learn something, whether it be about how to maintain a houseboat or how to kick someone's hide in a fight. :-)And I have some laughs doing it."},{"Title":"ONE FEARFUL YELLOW EYE","review":"I've been reading the Travis McGee series in order, and this book, 8th in the series, is nowhere near the quality of the preceding books. The plot is okay, not great, it feels like it was pieced together as MacDonald went along. There are many portentous remarks of the 'had I but known' variety, and the McGee/Heidi sexual psychiatric healing scenes are pure undiluted bilge water. Up to now I felt MacDonald painted a McGee who was fairly honest about his (McGee's) sex life, but in this book Travis comes off as a real Gary Stu character. Even his detective work was so so SO easy. Granted, one of the joys in reading these books is that Travis is just that bit more quixotic, more reflective, more sun-soaked than anyone in real life, but in this book Travis is so much more of everything, and it really got my gag reflex working. Now, having said this nasty stuff, this book is not bad enough to put me off McGee for life. I'll go right ahead with the next book and hope Travis regains his form. And if he never does, those first seven books were still worth the price of admission."},{"Title":"ONE FEARFUL YELLOW EYE","review":"This is one of the McGees that I end up not rereading as much, because for me it doesn't hold up quite as well. I realize that in this decade, LSD was a completely different thing than what we know it to be now, but it still throws me off guard; plus I am a little harsher on the perfect Dr. Fort Geis than the book would like me to be. If you're a T. McGee fan, read it and it may hold up better for you, but if you're new to the series, it probably won't make the best starting point."},{"Title":"ONE FEARFUL YELLOW EYE","review":"The eighth installment of the Travis McGee series takes place in Chicago rather than in Florida, and thus most of the usual cast, save for McGee himself, is MIA. It is not a book that would have endeared MacDonald to the Chicago Chamber of Commerce. The author was obviously not very fond of the Chicago, and through McGee makes some fairly cutting comments about the Windy City and its inhabitants.For those unfamiliar with the series, McGee is a self-styled \\"salvage\\" expert. If someone is defrauded and has no legal recourse, McGee will use his considerable talents to recover what has been lost. His fee is fifty percent of the recovery; expenses come off the top.In these books there is always a fragile woman who has been badly treated, sometimes physically, sometimes emotionally, and often both. In addition to recovering what has been stolen by the bad guys, it will be McGee's job to restore the poor woman to a state of health and physical well-being--unless, of course, she manages to get killed along the way.In this case, one of these previously broken birds (the book's description, not mine), Glory Doyle, turns to McGee for help a second time. Her husband, a respected Chicago physician, has recently died and Glory discovers that during the last year of her husband's life, someone had managed to bleed him of his entire fortune. McGee comes to Chicago to chase down the money and punish the evil-doers. Along the way, of course, he will have to rescue a beautiful but frigid blonde who has no idea why she hates sex. Can McGee cure the poor woman and turn her into a sexual dynamo while at the same time he deals out justice to the bad guys? Is the Pope Catholic?Along the way, we also get a heavy dose of McGee's philosophy as he ponders the mysteries of the universe and the failings of his fellow man. He's particularly hard on Chicago legend Hugh Hefner and the Playboy lifestyle.This was in its day, one of the most popular mystery/suspense series ever written. But sadly it has not held up very well over time. One naturally expects that a book that was originally published in 1966 is going to show its age, but these books now sound positively archaic and re-reading them is almost always disappointing. When I first discovered the paperback reprints of these books back in my youth, I devoured them and couldn't wait to find another. Now, every couple of years or so, I pull one off the shelf, hoping to rediscover some of the magic that first drew me to McGee and his adventures. Unhappily, I haven't found it again in a long time. But that won't stop me from trying again in another couple of years."},{"Title":"ONE FEARFUL YELLOW EYE","review":"McGee and LSD became popular about the same time, but the typical bright-eyed MacDonald sense of humor stops there, for One Fearful Yellow Eye is probably too sad a story for all but the most serious fans of the series.Fearful Yellow Eye's plot revolves around a certain 600 grand bequeathed to survivors of Dr. Fortner Geis, a generally well-liked and well-respected Chicago doctor. But when the 600 grand does not turn up following the good doctor's death, McGee is hired onto the case.His investigations lead him to Chicago, Glory Geis, and then the twisted tale of Glory's daughter/love-rival Heidi Geis.Remarkably, McGee finds himself attracted to the broken-winged Heidi, and ultimately the novel is hers. Because it is she that must get past her family's dark secret, and it is she that comes through at the novel's end as a much stronger character.There are moments of poignancy in One Fearful Yellow Eye, and McGee's approach to Heidi's disturbing LSD overdose may be worth the price of the ticket alone, but generally I'd have to recommend several other McGee novel's before One Fearful Yellow Eye. Cinnamon Skin, thusfar, is my favorite.Stacey Cochranauthor ofCLAWS: A Suspense Novel"},{"Title":"ONE FEARFUL YELLOW EYE","review":"This entry of the T. McGee series was not up to plot or craftsmanship found in most of John D. MacDonald's work. To me, it seemed at times to be almost a parody of the usual McGee...too much TALK of broken birds, and just not enough of the rough and tumble action we have come to expect from Ol' Trav. But don't worry, things are back on track in the next one, PALE GRAY FOR GUILT. I've wondered if there wasn't something going on in JDM's personal life to make this entry seem so lacking?"},{"Title":"ONE FEARFUL YELLOW EYE","review":"John D. MacDonald was a brilliant, gifted and witty author. He created in the early 1960s a character named Travis McGee, a \\"salvage expert\\" who lived on a houseboat (won in a poker game and subsequently named the Busted Flush!) in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Over nearly 30 years, MacDonald wrote 21 Travis McGee Mystery novels (typically a murder is involved). One Fearful Yellow Eye was published in 1966 and probably written in the same year, as MacDonald was very industrious in the 60s. The novel takes place in Chicago and its environs as Travis McGee helps out his friend Glory Doyle by investigating the death of her husband, Dr. Fortner Geis. I do not wish to spoil the story by giving any more details except that the ending will stun you! MacDonald was a very gifted observer of people, a commentator on society and a marvelous and captivating storyteller! The Travis McGee Mystery series holds up very well some 40 years later and does not suffer at the hands of time. All of his stories, particulary this novel, (my favorite of all 21 McGees!) is a riveting page turner, an immensely satisfying reading experience. I have read it numerous times and it never fails to awe, amaze, and engross me! MacDonald is skilled at getting into the minds of the characters and he views society and individuals through the eyes of Travis McGee with wisdom and wit that leaves me breathless for lack of a better way to describe it! I highly recommend this novel and all the other 20 McGee novels as well as MacDonald's other mysteries! Here are some links to other MacDonald works. Other favorites areBright Orange for the ShroudandA Tan and Sandy Silence (Travis McGee Mysteries)The first novel wasThe Deep Blue Good-by. The last novel wasLonely Silver Rain (Travis McGee Series)All the McGee novels contain a color in their title. MacDonald passed away in 1986. He was a huge influence on many writers such as Sue Grafton and Dean Koontz just to name two."},{"Title":"ONE FEARFUL YELLOW EYE","review":"One Fearful Yellow Eye is installment number eight in John D. MacDonald's highly successful Travis McGee series. It's interesting to note that the first eight entries were all published within a very narrow time frame, between 1964 and 1966. Though somewhat flawed, this book like its seven predecessors displays a number of strengths.John D. MacDonald was a talented novelist and that talent is evident in One Fearful Yellow Eye. The brand of prose he uses is both original and highly evocative. The dialogue he writes for his characters is authentic sounding and the characters themselves often quite believable.Readers familiar with Travis McGee know he is not shy when it comes to expressing his opinion on any number of topics. Many times these opinions are rather exasperating and become annoying when MacDonald insists on laying it on too thick. Consider this Travis McGee gem found near the end of chapter 4 in One Fearful Yellow Eye:\\"......the creative work of the homosexuals tends to be so glossy and clever and glib that it has a curious shallowness about it, as though the inability to share the most common human experience of all makes it all surface and no guts...\\"Did John D. MacDonald himself really believe such claptrap? I for one would be quite interested in finding out whether MacDonald held such patently false and offensive beliefs or whether he purposely incorporated that kind of flawed thinking into McGee's persona.In any event, One Fearful Yellow Eye takes place mostly in and around Chicago, a city Travis McGee seems to hate with a passion. He allows that there's a pretty good pipe shop across from the old Palmer House. But other than that, Chicago is a complete blot on the North American continent. He has been summoned there by an old lover, Gloria Geis, who is now the grieving widow of a prominent neurosurgeon. It seems that when Dr. Geis died after an extended illness, $600,000 representing the bulk of his estate came up missing. As McGee attempts to find out where the money went, he uncovers a sordid and overly convoluted saga of blackmail and twisted familial relationships. The kind of story you might expect Ross Macdonald to write.The novel ends on a rather bizarre, shocking note. Some may find the ending far fetched but there is a certain internal logic to it. With a little more attention to the finer points of plot development, One Fearful Yellow Eye could have been one of the most sensational detective novels ever written."},{"Title":"ONE FEARFUL YELLOW EYE","review":"I'm a huge fan of the Travis McGee series, but I urge you to be careful with this one. For the first 250 pages, McGee makes solid choices and dodges all the bullets. However, he makes a fatal blunder at the end that any reader could see coming a mile away. I was powerless to stop it, solely at the mercy of MacDonald's writing. McGee's blunder gets the main girl hurt really bad. I suffered from borderline post-traumatic stress for the rest of the evening after finishing this book. Be careful, and know what you're getting into before investing time in this book."},{"Title":"ONE FEARFUL YELLOW EYE","review":"I have liked the other McGee books, but this one was sickening. The novel suffers from the ponderous exposition, as other reviewers noted. And the ending--without spoilers, I can say that it was so over-the-top violent and deliberately disturbing that I wonder about the author's mental health. And the solution came on what was a clumbsily-written deus ex machina. Get another McGee book--any other McGee book--but not this one. This is one of the few books I've wished I could un-read."},{"Title":"ONE FEARFUL YELLOW EYE","review":"At the moment, due to Amanda's excellently written complete trashing of Travis McGee in her &#9733; review of MacDonald's DARKER THAN AMBER (she may have even called it Book Rape, I forget), a cautionary note to potential female readers may be appropriate.[...]ONE FEARFUL YELLOW EYE is Copyright 1966. Travis McGee's views on women are anchored in the Sixties. Travis easily makes my Top Ten List of favorite literary characters, but savvy 2012 women are going to have \\"issues.\\" So, please Ladies, if you really want to pretend to be a hulking macho 6' 4\\" male animal for a few hours, may I suggest a nice Spenser by Robert B. Parker? Just not the first one. In THE GODWULF MANUSCRIPT Spenser commits the penultimate PC boo-boo by having sex with both his client and his client's mother. Go for one of the later novels where Spenser is dating the shrink, and can put a politically correct spin on everything he is thinking and doing.Also, in ONE FEARFUL YELLOW EYE the scene where Travis stumbles upon a dead guy who had been tortured for information so freaked me out that this may be the only one of the twenty-one Travis McGee novels that I have only read once. So far. Cut me some slack; Travis was also freaked out.Some elegant plotting in this puppy near the end when it's clear that the good gals and guys have won, things abruptly tumble into hopeless disaster.Book Reviews are almost obsolete in the post-Wikipedia era when copious details about any book can be accessed by anyone with just a couple of effortless mouse clicks. I don't know what to spill and what to hold back. In this one, McGee is again doing a favor for a friend. Although, there is a bit of loot to be recovered, if Travis can compose himself enough to stop looking at and thinking about that fearful yellow eye. @hg47"},{"Title":"ONE FEARFUL YELLOW EYE","review":"I would recommend this novel, but be forewarned: it's not the typical Travis McGee adventure.I looked at the other reviews. A mixed bag. Some thought this McGee novel was one of MacDonald's best. Other's thought it was one of his lesser undertakings. As I read the novel, from start to finish, I think I came to understand the reasons for this polarity.My opinion? After having read this story twice, I would say that One Fearful Yellow Eye might be both: one his best stories, but also one of his weakest McGee stories. But please know that my final opinion rests on the side with those reviewers who liked this McGee novel. I liked the change in pace.This is the eighth volume in the Travis McGee series. Up until this volume, the locations have been southerly and predictable. The tone of the first seven volumes has been quite Florida'ish, the Busted Flush somehow playing a role in the events, the Florida characters mingling in the events as well, etc. etc. Seven volumes which firmly established McGee, his Florida/Bahamas/Bermuda lifestyle, his philosophies, his Florida friends and neighbors, and his methods of earning retirement income. And then here comes the eighth novel in the series and the location and tone is completely different.This story takes place in Chicago in the winter, the antitheist to McGee's balmy home territory. But that's not the problem. The problem is that McGee hates Chicago and throughout the novel throws in various soliloquies and many snippets which reveal his distaste for the Windy City. The reader can't help but wonder if MacDonald was expressing his own opinions, which would then border on author intrusion, something that many readers prefer to not notice. In addition, if the reader feels aligned to Travis McGee, which might be the expected outcome after reading seven of his stories, then the reader is also predisposed to dislike what McGee dislikes.As a side note, I think MacDonald made an authorial mistake in disparaging the city of Chicago. MacDonald may have, in fact, totally disliked Chicago personally, but that's not reason enough to make McGee dislike it as well. Why tell a whole story in a place that constantly gets negative comments from the storyteller. It seems so counterproductive to me. I actually think the reviewers would've responded more favorably to the story had McGee not been so critical of the city in which it took place. Especially since MacDonald had worked so hard to make readers love McGee's Florida existence, which tells me MacDonald knew the strengths and advantages of having the location presented positively and appeal to the reader. If I ever write a novel, I will make sure that I don't present the main location of the story in a negative light.Back to the story. It's a mystery, more so than any previous McGee novels. A pretty good whodunit. One of the reviewers said s/he figured out the \\"who\\" right away, which made the rest of the story anticlimactic. I'm not sure I would agree that it was so easy to figure out. There are clearly 4-5 good suspects, plus one or two remote suspects. Any amateur Sherlock Holmes who reads mysteries usually tries to figure things out and makes a guess. When there are only four possible suspects, every guesser has a 25% chance of being right. But even along those lines, I have to register a complaint. It's not kosher to introduce an important impact character late in the narrative, and this is what happens in this story. So while the reader is trying to put together the clues right along with McGee, a huge clue is left out until the very end. It sort of spoils the fun for an amateur sleuth.But in the end, if you are a fan of Travis McGee, then I think this volume is worth reading. Maybe even a must read because it breaks the mold of the previous volumes and gives new insights into McGee's character that otherwise would never be revealed in the sunny regions of Florida and the Caribbean. It's different, and I enjoyed the difference."},{"Title":"ONE FEARFUL YELLOW EYE","review":"Glory Doyle wants to find the truth outabout her husband..why 1/2 million $$is missing and blackmail.

MacDonald and surly Travis McGee make for uneasy company in \\"One Fearful Yellow Eye,\\" a 1966 mystery novel in the McGee series that struggles with too much attitude even as it works you through an inventive plot.McGee's latest \\"salvage\\" operation is one Glory Doyle Geis, widow of neurosurgeon Fortner Geis who discovers her late husband had drained his own financial holdings lock, stock and barrel in his last year of life. The result leaves Glory about to lose her home and her stepchildren suspecting Glory of dirty tricks. McGee knows Glory wouldn't do such a thing, so he pokes around and discovers a lot of dirty laundry in Dr. Geis's past, much of it apparently left in the wrong hands.\\"A man will let his money be taken only when the alternative is something he cannot endure,\\" McGee muses.It's a solid set-up. Right away you sense MacDonald's in a good place with an amusing intro featuring \\"tight-sphincter time\\" aboard a rattling jet flying McGee to Chicago. Glory's sad situation is something we instantly relate to in a sensitively-rendered backstory, while the plot as it quickly unfolds features a nice array of shifty characters with intriguing backstories and likely motives for doing something bad.Then McGee goes off to question the suspects, and things get icky. First, he visits Geis's haughty daughter, an amateur painter in the modern style, which allows MacDonald to pontificate about the hollowness of modern art in the guise of channeling McGee's thoughts. Just when you hope art class is over, MacDonald has McGee lecture young Heidi on just how bad an artist she really is, even challenging her to draw a cow. Instead of throwing the guy out and ending his investigation on page 30, she actually breaks down and realizes this McGee guy knows of what he speaks and may be worth getting to know better. (Nudge, nudge)Then he goes with Heidi to an art show, where he impresses her by shoving another artist into one of his sculptures, ruining it. If you want an investigator who doesn't act like a bull in a china shop, don't call McGee.With another witness, Heidi's rich and bisexual ex-husband, McGee begins by calling him \\"double-gaited\\" and finishes by laying him out in front of his friends. Somehow McGee not only doesn't get arrested, but makes progress as person after person realizes this hard guy means business. Sure, these people are snobs who kind of deserve the rough treatment. But McGee comes off in this one as a bully and a clod, until he coaches Heidi to unlock the gates of her womanhood, which exposes him as a ridiculously successful sexual dinosaur, too. He warns her their affair can never be serious, as he can never commit to just one woman. Being the 1960s, she not only understands but is thankful for his patience.I don't mean to bust on \\"One Fearful Yellow Eye\\" too much. The shame is it really works as a story, most of the time. Up until the ending, which is annoyingly implausible albeit still rather exciting, you get a fast-tugging mystery that grows deeper after every interview. McGee works his way through the Chicago upper crust while getting help from unexpected sources. Some of it is a trifle too convenient, but I read it mostly with the kind of pleasure I associate with the better McGee books. If only this were one of them."},{"Title":"ONE FEARFUL YELLOW EYE","review":"I am rereading John D. MacDonald's Travis McGee books in order and am having a wonderful time.

It wasn't as good as &quot;Deadly Shade of Gold&quot; and I'm sure there are others that are better also.It's worth the time just for the rant on why Americans should carry their own paper towels and toilet paper.

Verse by verse, Carter presents this key gospel as a counter-narrative shaping the followers of Jesus as an alternative community, resisting the authorities of both synagogue and state. Highly recommended for students of New Testament studies, Matthew And The Margins reveals and documents how the Gospel anticipates the time when Jesus' return will establish God's reign over all -- including the imperial powers of the state."},{"Title":"MATTHEW & THE MARGINS","review":"Matthew and the Margins: A Socio-Political and Religious Reading by Warren Carter is a stupendous book that I would recommend reading for anyone looking for greater depth than Mel Gibson's movie The Passion or Rick Warren's pop book The Purpose Driven Life, both of which are in vogue as of the writing of this review. The book is a verse by verse introductory commentary to the Christian Gospel of Matthew and could appeal to believer, nonbeliever and agnostic alike, although it is written from social scientific and religious viewpoints. The focus of the book is on the social marginality, or alienation, of the Christian figure Jesus as depicted in the book of Matthew. By marginality, Carter means living on the fringe of society rather than being a part of the political and religious established center of society. The author, I believe rightly, contends that the book of Matthew is a book of resistance against th Roman imperial control and the Jewish synogogue leaders of the day, although certainly not the Jewish people. The author avoids being a know it all and admits he doesn't know who wrote the book or who Matthew was. Unlike most relgious commentaries on books of the bible, this book is highly readable. Even if you just want to gain a better appreciation and understanding of the Christian story without necessarily becoming a believer, I would commend this book to you. Nonetheless, Carter points out that the book of Matthew was originally written for &quot;consenting readers.&quot; However, Carter doesn't write what he believes his audience wants to hear - which he calls &quot;cheap assent.&quot; True to the social marginality theme, this book probably won't be a best seller like some of the pop Christian books currently in vogue (Prayer of Jabez, Purpose Driven Life, etc.), nor will it gain the acclaim or wealth to its author such as a movie like The Passion, but it is an indelibly &quot;experiential&quot; book just like a good movie is. I highly commend this book to skeptic, agnostic, and believer alike. As this reviewer likewise aspires to a marginal role, I have elected to remain anonymous to hopefully allow the interested reader to find this intriguing book on his/her own possibly through this review."},{"Title":"MATTHEW & THE MARGINS","review":"I find myself using this commentary during the A (Matthew) Cycle of the Lectionary. It is very enlightening and challenging. The author shows a remarkable familiarity with non-Gospel (especially Roman and Greek) sources which offer some perspective on the text. He also is continually exploring connections with the Hebrew Scriptures. The footnotes and bibliography show a familiarity with extremely wide and diverse sources. The theme of marginality comes through in many different ways. The Kingdom of Jesus is truly in opposition to the dominant Roman kingdom and those allied with it, Herod, the chief priests and the scribes. The subtitle of the commentary is \\"A Sociopolitical and Religious Reading\\". Both of these aspects are amply fulfilled. I would recommend this book highly."},{"Title":"Poems","review":"It's hard to know how to review this book: Prynne has been for several decades now the most important &quot;unknown&quot; poet in the English language, his work earning a reputation for its sybilline authority &amp; beauty. A nutshell description would be: imagine a collision between Charles Olson, William Wordsworth &amp; Paul Celan--&amp; if you don't have quite Prynne's work, you'd have a rough idea of its excitement &amp; its extraordinary summing-up of an entire poetic tradition. Whatever you think of the poetry (&amp; if you're not sometimes frustrated or bewildered by it, you're probably an unusual sort), it cannot be ignored: Prynne is a major figure in the last century of poetry.Prynne's career has been an unusual one. His first book, _Force of Circumstance_ (1962), was written in mostly conventional verse-forms (rhymed quatrains, blank verse, etc.) &amp; was informed by the work of Donald Davie &amp; Charles Tomlinson. (Prynne has suppressed this early book in the volume under review.) Then there's a gap--the next three books, _Kitchen Poems_ (1968), _Aristeas_ (1968) and _The White Stones_ (1969), are the first example of the &quot;mature&quot; Prynne. Unlike _Force of Circumstance_ (published by the trade publisher Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul), these three books came from two &quot;underground&quot; presses (Ferry &amp; Grosseteste) &amp; one underground press recently gobbled up by Jonathan Cape (Cape Goliard). The writing shows that there's been a complete switch of allegiance to the poetry of Ed Dorn &amp; Charles Olson; it is dense, impassioned, politically-aware &amp; informed by recondite investigations into archaeology &amp; anthropology. The urgency of this work is still stirring: many of the poems appeared as &quot;news items&quot; in the ultra-obscure worksheet _The English Intelligencer_, &amp; their sense of participation in a community of poetic discovery &amp; inquiry can still be heard.What next? Well, that's a good question: the work after this, beginning with _Brass_ (1971), is an a startlingly different style: if you're familiar with the work of Celan, this might give some idea of the mysterious quality of the later Prynne. But it's not hermetic work: its bewildering array of linguistic registers offers startled recognition at every turn--from quotations from the poetic tradition (one poem in _The Oval Window_ [1983], for instance, weaves back and forth through a passage from Shakespeare's _All's Well That Ends Well_), to the jargon of science, politics, computers &amp; economics, to demotic utterance. Most of these books came out in the most fugitive editions--_Bands Around the Throat_ (1986) for instance is a stapled chapbook of poems spat out of the author's wordprocessor, while _Word Order_ (1989) is a gorgeous rust-coloured book printed on an old-fashioned printing press. The author, meanwhile, scrupulously abjured from &quot;explaining&quot; his work (unlike in his old _Intelligencer_ days: Prynne has since the 1960s published very little prose--just a few lectures, letters &amp; afterwords). He's also scrupulously avoided the engines of poetic publicity--for instance, preventing his work from appearing in most anthologies of contemporary poetry. (There are a few exceptions: check out _A Various Art_, a collection of work from the Ferry/Grosseteste poets; or _Poems for the Millennium_, vol. 2, an anthology of world modernist poetry.) The appearance of this volume from a &quot;mainstream&quot; publisher is unexpected, and welcome. I'll end by quoting one poem from _The Oval Window_ (1983), which might give some idea of what Prynne's like: [I'll have to double-space it to avoid its getting formatted like prose!]Standing by the window I heard it,while waiting for the turn. In hot lightand chill air it was the crossing flowof even life, hurt in the mouth butexhausted with passion and joy. Freeto leave at either side, at the fold linefound in threats like herbage, the watchis fearful and promised before. The yearsjostle and burn up as a trust plasma.Beyond help it is joy at death itself:a toy hard to bear, laughing all night."},{"Title":"Poems","review":"I personally think that being a lyric poet is just about the strangest, most redundant thing to be in this day and age. The poetry sections of our bookshops are crammed with volume after slim volume (Slim Volume: Cowboy Poet) consisting of little but short-winded, doggedly high-minded whinging about utterly trivial events in the poets' lives. If, like me, you are terminally bored by people setting down this or that evanescent perceptionin a seriesof barely rhythmicalsyllabic groupsthat would seem intolerably boringif the poets'd botheredto write them outas prose sentences,then you're probably the kind of person who'd appreciate J.H. Prynne.Prynne is the most illustrious of a fairly small number of English-language poets (others include Barry MacSweeney and Iain Sinclair) who still cleave to a sort-of modernist idea that poems ought not to say things that can be said any other way, but instead are verbal artifacts unto themselves, with all the hazards of connotation that that implies. His early work is in a shabby, low-rent Four-Quartetsy sort of mode, but during the late Seventies he really hit his stride. His best works are glossy, sexy, sardonic, thoroughly worked-over verbal machines that do what few other poets have dared to do since the death of Pound. Prynne is not _primarily_ interested in communicating some amazingly primal and/or psycho-sexual-cultural-political-transcendental experience, he's interested in the glint and spark of words put together in a certain way, and this saves him from being either kitschy (as the worst work of Ted Hughes can be) or trivial (as, well, pretty much most poets usually are.) His work is a wonderful corrective to the linguistic slackness and sentimentality of so much modern poetry. Give him a go. This is definitely a desert island book, if only for the sheer amount of allusion and density Prynne is able to pack into a short poem - even at his most recondite, he's pushing you towards the world you've vainly tried to leave behind."},{"Title":"Poems","review":"Poems is an inspired and inspirational collection of Britain's leading late Modernist poet J.H.

She also includes a useful list of equipment to take along and some good tips on what to do if you become lost.This book is small enough to take along with you out into the backcountry, but you might want to put it inside a plastic bag if you do so because (unlike some other survival manuals) it's not written on rain-resistant paper.This book does a good job of helping you to learn what you will need, how urgently you will need it, and how you could get it in an outdoor survival situation."},{"Title":"Wilderness Survival: Staying Alive Until Help Arrives","review":"\\"Wilderness Survival\\" is well written and an excellent book to motivate you to study further (and the author encourages this frequently), but as an instruction manual it is severely limited.

It describes in a clear and succint manner how Christ's suffering and death on the cross relates in our lives in 17 ways. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"His Cross in Your Life","review":"I live with daily chronic pain from damaged nerves and this book taught me and reminds me that pain is a gift, a cross from the God who asks us to fill up with our suffering what He did not endure Himself. Based on sound Catholic theology, this book is a needed antidote to the silly philosophies of our day, those that teach that suffering is ignoble or purely a useless evil.One of the reviewers thinks Fr. Weaver lost momentum in the final chapters, but I think they are needed to keep focus on the One who suffered for us more than we can know on this side of the grave. Also, the chapter on Mary's suffering is really appropriate. She was fully human, a creature, not divine and human as Jesus was. But she is God's greatest creature. Why? She was almost hidden in Scripture and certainly laid no claim to earthly power or wealth. I think some of her greatness lay in her conformity of will to suffering. She was poor, she lost her Son for three days when He was only twelve; she lost her husband, St. Joseph, and so endured the mockery, torture and brutal death of her Son without the support of her husband, an eyewitness who had to will what God had ordained for Jesus from all eternity. Her chapter should maybe come at the beginning of the book, because she is a perfect model of grace under affliction.There is much to contemplate in this beautiful little book and it bears re-reading many times."},{"Title":"His Cross in Your Life","review":"Fr. Weaver presents wonderful things to meditate on including: how to know if you are doing the will of God, what a spectacle it must been for the angelic hosts to gaze upon our Lord on the cross, how the Creator of the things of this world rejected the things of this world and many more.This is a must read!"},{"Title":"His Cross in Your Life","review":"His Cross in Your Life is a remarkable book. This book is about the role of suffering in our lives and how we should look to Jesus on the cross for hope and strength. I found the message of embracing our own cross and learning to suffer with Christ to be a powerful one; it is very relevant to today's world."},{"Title":"His Cross in Your Life","review":"First printed in 1961, \\"His Cross in Your Life\\" is still as relevant today as it was back then. In his marvelous treatise, Father Bertrand Weaver relates the cross of Christ with nearly every part of life: times of sadness, times of joy, life expectancy, prayer, and even relationships.In nearly every chapter, Fr. Weaver finds an aspect of spirituality and/or humanity and then relates it to the cross. And, even though the pages dedicated to each chapter are few, they contain words that are loaded with information. By the end of the book, my understanding of the cross in many aspects of my own life was much greater; not just during suffering, but also during successes, failures, and the periods in between.To use Fr. Weaver's own example, Fr. Weaver's book is a mine with a wealth of information stashed within...the only work required to mine it is simply reading the book, which isn't much work given that it's easy to read, enjoyable, and only 112 pages long.And now, the downside. Starting in chapter 14, Fr. Weaver loses his momentum and spends more time describing the cross of Jesus and less time relating it the readers' crosses. This continues through chapters 15 and 16, with 17 being a very good chapter and 19 being a very good conclusion. However, in chapter 18 Fr. Weaver goes off topic and relates the cross to Mary's life. It's not a bad section, but it's out of place. I would rather have seen chapter 18 as an appendix.It's this loss of steam that keeps this book from being perfect. The prose, the logic, and the conclusions are all easy to follow, easy to read, and very wonderful.

He felt he was waging a war against the crude and unfeeling Western materialism of the day; he was battling what he saw as a holy war. While authors like Turgenev and Tolstoy regarded the expanding West with (fairly) open arms, Dostoevsky feared it would cause a religious crisis, where faith in Christ was extinguished and ignorance, vanity, and greed would overcome.This is a towering, exciting novel--perhaps not as great as &quot;Crime &amp; Punishment&quot; or &quot;Brothers Karamazov&quot;--it contains some of his most penetrating insights into religious faith, human compassion, despair, and insanity. Prince Myshkin is of course one of literature's great characters, a Christ-like young man caught up in the treachery of the aristocratic lives of the Yepanchins. The other two main characters, Rogozhin and Nastasya Filippovna, along with Myshkin, form a powerful triangle that, despite their being &quot;off-stage&quot; for much of the novel, drive this novel to its tragic, unavoidable climax.I do not, however, recommend this book to first time Dostoevsky readers; that should be &quot;Notes from Underground&quot; or &quot;Crime and Punishment.&quot; The ideas Dostoevsky explores here need some context and understanding; they may leave the inexperienced reader a bit confused. At least that was my experience! After understanding him and his concerns, this novel cracked wide open. It is a darkly spiritual work, as are all of his; it is also quite disturbing. When young Ippolit describes the Hans Holbein painting &quot;Christ in the Tomb&quot; that adorns the cover of the Oxford edition, we see into the darkest reaches of despair and hopelessness. Indeed, the painting is a Christ that is unresurrected, one that is rotting flesh and cannot, in Dostoevsky's scenario, save humankind. This thought terrifies Rogozhin, Myshkin... and Dostoevsky himself.What a stunning achievement this work is. I am in awe of it. Simply: Read it."},{"Title":"The Idiot (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"It should be known to most students and readers of Dostoyevsky that he suffered most of his adult life from a severe condition of epilepsy. The seizures from this disease can vary in intensity from the mild to the point where it is so intense, that the individual's heart will simply stop from the violent convulsions. Those afflicted with this condition have commented that after an attack, calmness washes over them and a feeling of deep clarity prevades. A few individuals, including the great Russian writer have claimed that they experienced something akin to a spiritual awakening, only lasting a few moments and sometimes a few hours. The protagonist in The Idiot, Prince Myshkin, also suffers from epilepsy, and therefore has earned the cruel nickname of \`Idiot' from his circle of friends and acquaintances. The novel centres on this man and the profound affects he has on those he comes in contact. The Idiot is a nineteenth century thriller, an expos&eacute; of Russian aristocracy, intense, unrequited love and spiritual redemption. A semi-autobiographical piece that is one of Dostoyevsky's better novels.Prince Myshkin's simpleton demeanour, his almost child-like view of the world - nave, terribly honest and soft good looks - projects to other characters in the novel as someone with saintly qualities, an almost Christ-like aura surrounds him that most perceive when they first meet the man. Having had epilepsy from birth, he has been raised under very controlled circumstances, to finally move into the world without societies basic prejudices and biases. The Prince lacks because of his innocence, the decorum of the then Russian aristocracy. He also has a gift. The Prince has great intuitive insight into the souls of the people he meets. And because he lacks in the social graces, he more often than not will blurt out what he feels with uncanny accuracy, embarrassing the people present. Although he has great insight, there is a dark side, and a price he will eventually have to pay.The female protagonist is a fascinating woman. Nastasya Filippovna is a person with an incredible strength of will that she uses for her tacit manipulations of the numerous fawning, stumbling men that constantly grovel around her. This woman's mere presence, her stunning beauty all combine to make a very powerful woman. However, below this persona of strength, is an extremely insecure little girl, who only requires love.Rogozhin is the novel's psychopath, a rogue and scoundrel of the first order. Everything that we could possibly mistrust in a person, Rogozhin personifies as he, without conscience, hurts and manipulates those around him with adept skill.This is a beautiful novel as it communicates our spiritual concerns though represents our darker natures in insightful ways. The Idiot is a dramatic tragedy, a satire on Russia's aristocracy and a reflection about our dual natures, possessing the capacity for so much good, but also capable of so much evil.This is a novel written with vividness and extreme passion as only this Russian master can give us. Excellent."},{"Title":"The Idiot (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"This is the novel where Dostoevsky's ability as an artist to create fascinating characters reach it's pinnacle. How can you read this novel and not love the Prince Myshkin, with his childlike innocence juxtaposed against his complete mastery into the inner psychologies of people, or not fall in love with Aglaia, the sensitive and mercurial soul that protects herself behind a wall of cynicism and pride? Dostoevsky somehow casts his spell, whereby the the reader is lead into another world populated with seemingly fantastic and insane characters, who nevertheless seem absolutely real. His uncanny insights into the depths of psychology are incredibly trenchant and almost super-human. Nietschze said of Dostoevsky that he is the only psychologist whom he ever learned anything from. So absolutely true! Who else wrote with such insight about people with self destructive tendencies(Natashya), subconscious desires, and the irrational contradictions of the conscious and subconscious. If you read this novel and do not come away with new insight and a better understanding of the psychological workings of others around you, either you are Freud come back from the dead or incredibly dense!"},{"Title":"The Idiot (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"The Idiot is often unfairly compared to Dostoyevsky's other masterpieces and, even though The Idiot usually comes out on the short end of any comparison, it is certainly my favorite. Although the narrative of The Idiot may ramble more than do some of Dostoyevsky's other books, I feel it is ultimately more profound.At its core, The Idiot is a character/society study although it also encompasses many religious and political aspects as well. The central character, Prince Myshkin, provides the contrast for all the other characters and is definitely a &quot;Christ-like&quot; figure, a man who embodies most perfectly the Christian ideals of selflessness and love.Prince Myshkin is a man who has suffered from mental illness since childhood. This illness has the curious effect of causing him to respond from his heart rather than from his head. In addition, Myshkin also suffers from a form of epilepsy that causes him to launch into tirades regarding the social ills of the day. As a Christ-like figure, Myshkin is in direct contrast to the other characters in the book who are all worldly and sophisticated, though somewhat cynical, aristocrats. Myshkin's extreme goodness also causes him to become entangled in various political and personal intrigues.Although completely good, Prince Myshkin in a fully realized character. One of the marvels of this novel is that Dostoyevsky managed to present Myshkin as a serious, rather than a comic, character. His goodness is not something we want to laugh at. There are many comic moments in the book, however, and most of them are provided through various financial and romantic entanglements.Although Prince Myshkin is the thread that links all the characters and aspects in the novel, he is not the only fully realized character; the others are also extremely well drawn. Dostoyevsky was fond of using real life incidents in his books and his notes tells us this is something he did in creating the characters that populate this book.Ultimately, The Idiot is a tragic book. Politically, it ridicules the shallow ideals of the Russian aristocracy, and, while Prince Myshkin's ramblings may seem comic, they are actually harsh criticism.Prince Myshkin was more than &quot;a positively good man.&quot; He was a man who could see into the future and know what lay in store. Dostoyevsky's deep insight into the character of man makes The Idiot one of literature's most profound and timeless works."},{"Title":"The Idiot (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"It is said that if you take a zillion monkeys and set each of them clacking away at a typewriter then eventually one of them will produce the complete works of William Shakespeare. Well to produce such a book as &quot;The Idiot,&quot; you would need to employ in place of the monkeys, a similar number of brilliant authors - genuises no less - and maybe, just maybe a book as excellent as Dostoyevsky's &quot;The Idiot&quot; might be produced.If some of the duller parts of the Bible are supposed to have been written under the guidance of divine inspiration, what then are we to suppose of a work like this that glows with spiritual power?"},{"Title":"The Idiot (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"The Idiot is Dostoevsky's second novel. The book is a hybrid of biographical sketches and anecdotes of the writer. The protagonist, Prince Myshkin, bears traces of his creator in his suffering of epilepsy. Dostoevsky often deviates from the main plot and voices his perspectives on pain, suffering, capital punishment, and moral goodness.The notion of suffering incessantly sifts through the novel as if true suffering plays a key role in purifying the protagonist and granting him the overriding power to the [evil] society in which he seeks to gain acceptance. However excruciating and painful it might be, physical suffering and bodily agony would distract the mind from spiritual suffering. That is, the physical aching deprives functioning of mental thinking. The worst suffering, as Prince Myshkin contemplates, are the knowledge and the inevitable truth of one's imminent death, the invincible parting of soul with the body. Being mindful of one's death would only perpetuate suffering. Readers should grip this idea and bear in mind.Morally upright, magnanimous, forgiving, humble, loving, honest, virtuous and mindful of others needs, Prince Myshkin embodies all human virtue and goodness. He is almost like God, or perfecting to be like God. He is a man capable of an ideal. He is stuck and torn between the love of Aglaia and Natasya upon his return to Russia from medical treatment in Switzerland. Myshkin's self-stigmatizing, humble, and diffident element often agitated Aglaia whose love for him manifests to the full in her passionate recital of a poor knight poem. She shows desire to marry him despite the wonted taunting. She assures that Myshkin is more honorable than anybody is and nobody is worth his little finger let alone his heart and soul.Out of volition and obligation, Myshkin believes he is responsible to rescue the vile, [evil] Natasya from her deranged mental state. The cause of his love for her was more than just the bewitching, demonical beauty: it is rather eagerness on Myshkin's part to be of service to his country after being abroad. He has long set an ideal and having faith in such ideal empowers him to give up his life blindly to it. Though Natasya is surprised at Myshkin's discerning words that she ought to be ashamed and that she is not what she pretends to be, she tortures herself by not falling in love with him lest to disgrace and ruin his life.In her importunate letters to Aglaia, Natasya implored and coaxed her to marry Myshkin as she did not wish to besmirch him. But destiny plays a cruel joke on them. Myshkin bears such tender spot for the afflicted, disgraced women in Natasya. However pertinacious not to love him, Natasya acknowledges his irresistible impact on her and regards him as the first and only man she has met in her whole life that she has believed in as a sincere friend. When Aglaia accuses her being a manipulator, Natasya falls down on her knees and thwarts Myshkin from leaving, who then comforts her and agrees to marry her.Many readers, myself included, would mull at the meaning of the title. It would be impossible to do Myshkin justice by abasing him as an idiot. A simpleton at best? Myshkin is looked upon as an idiot (from Greek meaning private and ignorant) for his not being compromised with the vanity, vices, [evilness], mendacity, and avarice of a vain society. Unyielding as he might be, it is almost like naivete that Myshkin always resolves to be courteous, honest, and trustful with everyone. Such naivete somehow gives way to philosophical outlook and idealism and thus ennobled him. Others harbor the effrontery to inveigle him, to launch a calumny against him in order to usurp his fortune. Maybe his ignorance of the vile and magnanimity for others' wrongdoings create in him an idiot (a private person).The Idiot, as cumbersome and lengthy as it seems, is rather a simple novel in plot. Dostoevsky often deviates from the main plot to reflect (and to reiterate) his philosophy through the prince, somehow bears an overriding sense of mission in the society, if not the whole world. I have denounce some critics' portraying the story as some bitter love triangle, for Dostoevsky has no room for a melodrama. In an epic that evokes Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, Dostoevsky seeks out the most ordinary characters whose ordinary tales (Madame Epanchins' imaginative troubles and whining, Ippolit's nightmares, General Ivolgin's delirious memories of his childhood encounter with Napoleon) lend a special note of verisimilitude in the lives of Russians.Like Crime and Punishment, The Idiot is dim, melancholy, doleful, and somber though the Epanchins, Lebedyev, and General Ivolgin animated, lightened up with a tinge of comic relief. Myshkin's desire to cure Natasya of her madness only relapsed himself into insanity. The Idiot evokes in readers a sense of tenderness and sympathy for the protagonist whose unyielding righteousness impedes him from resolving his own plight. 4.2 stars."},{"Title":"The Idiot (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Fyodor Dostoevsky's \\"The Idiot\\" is a compelling mixture of extremely well-drawn characterizations as well as an adept representation of the author's persistently over-arching world view concerning the \\"perennial questions\\" of human existence. The novel's main subject, Prince Myshkin, is a sublime and unforgettable character. I certainly wouldn't dispute Myshkin's centrality in \\"The Idiot\\" but here Dostoevsky has fleshed out many more distinctive personalities ( Aglaya, Rogozhin, Lebedev, Ippolit ) than ( if memory serves correctly ) in his \\"Crime and Punishment\\" ( another masterwork ), which focused pretty much on Raskolnikov's decaying interior world ( an extension of his \\"underground man\\" from the famous \\"Notes\\" of 1864 ).To speak of the plot would be irresponsible ( I do recommend reading the main text *prior* to reading the scholarly introduction by the translator ) but you can be assured that if you have enjoyed the novels of Joseph Conrad, Nikos Kazantzakis or Thomas Mann, you will appreciate \\"The Idiot\\". Also, it seems fairly obvious that a person who has already read several of Dostoevsky's other works will be interested in this particular novel. I admit that, not having read a 19th century novel for quite a while ( some ten years ), the portrayal of a \\"salon culture\\" elite and the ( at first glance ) melodramatic exchanges between the characters in their frequent soirees appeared, initially, to be somewhat strained. However, it was instructive to meditate on the fact that this was an era ( c.1868 ) without the benefit (?) of our advanced level technological distractions and so, if one was *not* to participate in such gatherings, one would likely be resigned to a life of intellectual solitude. In such a light, the melodrama of the exchanges seemed less unrealistic. And Dostoevsky was, in fact, throughout his early adulthood a frequenter of all sorts of literary gatherings ( this aspect of his life is superbly revealed in the first of Joseph Frank's monumental multi-volume literary biography ). Undoubtedly Dostoevsky drew upon his memories of such social circles when writing \\"The Idiot\\". In any case, whether it was by bearing these historical points in mind or by naturally adjusting to the author's emotional landscape, I did eventually adjust and felt the dialogue to transform into a compellingly realistic vision, at turns exhilarating and sorrowful ( inevitably, the latter mood prevails ). My choice of translation was the Alan Myers/Oxford Press version. I noticed that the Penguin translation was about 60-70 pages shorter. I didn't find that either mentioned \\"abridged\\" ( or \\"unabridged\\" ) but ended up basing my purchase on the Oxford's ( apparently ) longer version. Also, the Myers/Oxford version has a black and white map of St Petersburg and some helpful notes explaining various obscure references. However, having read the novel only once, I'm obviously not in the position to call this version definitive. I imagine the old Constance Garnett translation has some merit ( she's been in print for some 70 years now and that must say something of her abilities ) and the version produced by the widely acclaimed team of Richard Pevear and Larissa Volakhonsky ( having previously translated all the other late novels )is undoubtedly well worth exploring."},{"Title":"The Idiot (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"So many have written excellent, insightful reviews. Let me simply add a few observations. Prince Myshkin, the main character, indeed represents the \\"Christian\\" personality prototype, the \\"child\\" who is welcomed into the Kingdom of God. He lives and relates on a deeply spiritual level, making him unfit for survival in the highly materialistic world around him.The prince loves on a different level, too. The only form of love he is aware of, which makes him ridiculous to many, cares for the truest well-being of the subjects of his \\"affection.\\" His love is non-sexual, though the author goes to great lengths to express the sensuality of the two women with whom his life collides.(I think his rare, negative impression of one minor character, Vera Lebedeva, stems from the seeds of his sensual nature. Vera is perhaps the purest person he encounters a servant with a servant's heart, and fosters within a budding temporal love to which he is a complete stranger. He casts it off.)I find the prince and the leading characters highly allegorical. The various characters - each - yearn for what the prince has managed to maintain, his true humanity. Each of them have traded key aspects of their true selves in order to function in a world centered around fame, prosperity and comfort. The reader comes to pity them in some respects more than the main character, though his plight is well expressed.One idea drawn from the allegory: That materialism is rampant, and that the materialist sacrifices everything truly human to their detriment. The pure Christian soul cannot survive in a world dominated by materialism. \\"Humanity\\" cannot survive without sacrificing deep temporal cravings for the primacy of serving, in love, others.The symbolism behind Holbein's painting? In the setting of the Idiot, steeped in materialism as it is, Christ is dead as a doornail. The world, surrendered to myriad forms of greediness, condemns Christ to permanent death, with no hope of resurrection - no gospel of Christ. The painting's significance, indeed its very placement, represents the hopelessness of the human state as it ruthlessly pursues fulfillment of spiritual emptiness with evanescent sensory pleasure."},{"Title":"The Idiot (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"It took me three months to read \\"The Idiot\\" by Fyodor Dostoevsky, but more than five years to get around to reading it after it was suggested to me by my friend's mother in Zagreb. She told me that she loved Russian literature and when I asked which novel I should read if I only ever read one, she said, without a doubt, \\"The Idiot.\\" It was her favorite by far.My overwhelming impression after finishing it (just minutes ago) is that I feel that I missed a great deal. A Russian friend of mine told me that it is difficult to start Russian literature with \\"The Idiot\\" because there is a great deal of contextual understanding required for it. This version, translated by Alan Myers and published by Oxford World's Classics in 1992, was quite readable and included explanatory notes on the text at the end, which helped to illustrate some of the incidents to which Dostoevsky refers, including literary references and a famous and gory murder by a person on which a main character in the novel was modeled.(I had to pick it up and put it down a lot, which I'm sure detracted from the pace of the plot for me. It would be more enjoyed if one had a great deal of time to focus on it until it was finished, though I did enjoy it a great deal.)I am told \\"The Idiot\\" is very characterisic of a Russian novel, long, with many characters. It also is overcast with existentialism and hopelessness. I will try to summarize the plot of what is really a very psychological novel. (The big moments are emotional, mostly, and one spends a lot of time thinking about what makes various characters, particularly the rival women, do what they do and say what they say.)Prince Lev Nikolayevich Myshkin is the title character, or the idiot. He has an epilepsy-type disorder, which has caused him to be hospitalized and treated in Switzerland for some years. Returning to St. Petersburg on the train, he is in a car with Parfion Semyonovich Rogozhin and Lukyan Timofeyevich Lebedev, which is where he learns of the beautiful Nastasya Filippovna Barashkova, a kept woman whose beauty is infamous. In order to secure an inheritance, the Prince goes to General Ivan Fedorovich Yepanchin, where he meets Gavrila Ardalionovich Ivolgin, his secretary and the general's daughter, Aglaya Ivanovna Yepanchin, another famous, but chaste and pure (but kind of high maintenance) beauty.The first part of the book is incredibly suspenseful, taking place within perhaps 24 hours or so (I can't quite remember), but I found the rest of the book a little more meandering, though not irritatingly so. There are exciting incidents and a surprising ending, though it was foreshadowed pretty well throughout; I should have seen it or something like it coming.The Prince is clearly meant to be a Christ-like figure. My version of the paperback has a detail of Christ's face from Christ in the Tomb by Hans Holbein on the cover. The Prince is always kind and good, he loves without the strictures of the upper-middle-class society that he sees about him, and even when he's made fun of, tricked, attacked and maligned, he continues to love and care for the social group in which he has found himself.The introductory notes state, \\"Yet if Myshkin is a Christ he is a flawed one, and his mission is doomed to failure. His Christian meekness and compassion ... have disruptive ... consequences when practised in the 'real' world of nineteenth-century Russia. ...[I]n Russia the same qualities [innocence and simplicity] breed mistrust, embarassment, and hatred. ... In Russia Myshkin discovers, for the first time in his life, the gulf between ideals and reality and the impossibility of achieving paradise on earth.\\"Recently, I read a book called \\"If You Want to Write\\" by Brenda Euland, published in the 1930s. She praised the Russian writers because she said they imagined their worlds and characters so clearly and completely that they merely had to write down what they saw and describe it. Their texts did not seem made up, or stilted. I would agree with her. From the first sentence of The Idiot, I could clearly see the world in which Prince Myshkin lived.I also did try to prepare for Dostoevsky himself by reading J.M. Coetzee's fictional work about the return of Dostoevsky to St. Petersburg from Germany when his teen-age stepson died, The Master of Petersburg. I think it was a good preparation for the dark, existential pain of this novel."},{"Title":"The Idiot (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"I read this book for the first time when I was 15 or 16, and promptly declared it my favorite book. When I read it again in my 30s, it rang even more true. The society in this book is not so different from ours, obsessed with money, beauty, social standing, celebrity, and so forth. People are restless, flawed, seeking peace, while at the same time self-hating, self-destructive, and seeking out danger. What happens to this perfectly good, loving, honest human being, Myshkin, comes to seem inevitable given what we know about human nature, then and now."},{"Title":"The Idiot (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"This is the first Russia novel that I have read, and must say that it want be the last.

If you're starting on Dostoyevsky, go for the big one, The Brothers Karamazov, or the little one, Notes from Underground.King Dosty creates a fantastic set of characters and gets out his axe grinder; it comes together fairly slowly, but completing the book will be rewarding. Gracing the pages we have nihilists, slavophobes, endearing characters and despicables. Dostoyevsky was attempting to depict an honest, pure man (Prince Myshkin). Chances are all readers will like and admire Myshkin until about 3/4 of the way through, where things start to get really hairy:A scene is delightfully prepared with humor; Prince Myshkin, about to marry a Aglaia Epanchin (a beautiful young daughter of a well-off general) is exposed to aristocratic 'society' at a party. The way Dostoyevsky prepares you is reminiscent of some of Tolstoy's depictions of aristocrats; humorously jibing and illustrating their ridiculousness, yet appreciating the fact that they are human beings. Anyhow, the party is a make-or break opportunity for Myshkin; if he pleases the aristos, the Epanchin family will approve of the marriage and he will live happily ever afer with beautiful Aglaia. All Myshkin has to do is keep his mouth shut (as the Epanchins begged him to do beforehand), but regrettably, he does not. Impassioned, the Prince delivers a few splutterings about religion and Russia's destiny to one of the distinguished aristos. It appears that Myshkin here is really a mouthpeice for Dostoyevsky himself - and not the Ivan Karamazov doubting part of Dostoyevsky, what Myshkin says at this interval is what Dostoyevsky *really* believes. And the beliefs are rather too much for me to swallow: Catholicism is, in Myshkin's opinion, worse than atheism, the nihilist socialists have a deep hatred of Russia, etc.. we see the true extent of Dostoyevsky's reactionary religious beliefs. The aristocrat gentlemen try to mollify Myshkin a little, but to no avail; they leave seeing him as an oddity. The marriage with Aglaia falls through.After reading Myshkin's outburst, I could only blink a few times. Is this what Alyosha K. would say if pressed the same way? Thank goodness he didn't, otherwise Brothers K would have been a bit less enduring...But the book is still not a bad book! At the very least, Dostoyevsky shows how absolutely nutty people can become when it comes to passionate love. This isn't a simple love triangle, its a love quadrilateral!! But beyond the love story, you'll see social criticism, political and philosophical debates, pyschological analysis... in short, the typical complex and awesome Dostoyevsky novel. But, as I said above, its not Dosty at his best. Oh - and its a tragedy. You didn't think the Christ-man would be accepted by the sinful world, did you?"},{"Title":"The Idiot (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"It's strange. I've always felt as if the title of this book was trying to say something to me. Speak, almost...as if it had some great insight into my incredibly complex personality to offer.

This proves without a doubt the eternal mystery of this great Russian author."},{"Title":"The Idiot (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"I just finished the book 10 minutes ago.Oh my Lord. How incredibly tedious.I thought a few of the sections were interesting, like the meeting the Epanchin family, and seeing how the Prince is sized up by people who don't know if he is idiot or genius.It was like a much older version of \\"Being There\\" where simple minded utterances are taken as profound.But it went on and on and on, and you have no idea why they are talking about nothing, and how it contributes to the story.I have taken an interest in Russian literature (because I am doing business with Russians) for the last six months. I have read Anna Karinina, The Brothers Karamazov, Crime and Punishment, Dead Souls, and Invitation to a Beheading.Is this really the best they got? A little bit of it was enjoyable, but it sure seems like they are getting paid by the word. Get to the damn point!!Of course, I realize it is not my culture.

The Idiot's child-like innocence and purity, etc., is just annoying. He seems utterly in bad faith. The fact that we are meant to take him as being in good faith, as genuine, even as sympathetic, is what wrecks the novel for me. Myshkin seems just a foil for Dostoyevsky's ideas about society, conscience, Christianity, and so on. I don't believe in him as a character. I also don't find the themes discussed particularly interesting. And I didn't find any shockers or surprises in this book, all the moves seemed telegraphed in advance. I appreciated some of the subplots, but every scene with Myshkin in a central role was something of a dud. It's a bit like watching the Star Wars trilogy and groaning every time Luke Skywalker comes on screen. _That guy_ is the hero? Sigh... All this blushing and stammering and poses of meekness. I found myself appreciating the flawed characters much more: General Ivolgin, Lebedev, Rogozhin -- they are real characters with passions, interests, drives. Myshkin is infuriating with his passivity, his emptiness, his tiresome idealism."},{"Title":"The Idiot (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"I was \\"The Idiot\\" who was told to grab a novel to write a review for and happened to grab a book with a most suiting title. It teaches of the conflicts of one's self and morality, and how difficult it really is. It does this through Prince Myshkin and his illness as well as with the interaction amongst various other characters in the story. I do, however, have a problem with the length of the novel on a whole. But really, who am I to argue... I was the Idiot that picked it up when I clearly knew that I had ADD.Not recommended for people with ADD, ADHD, short attention span, short tempers, short term memory loss, and long term memory loss."},{"Title":"The Idiot (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"A perfect description of a typical, modern middle-class or upper middle-class family that appears normal but is rotten within. Every member is thoroughly selfish and they manipulate each other, and anyone else within reach, to get whatever it is they feel entitled to at the moment. Into this enters the Prince, who has a purity of soul that inspires both derision and admiration ( often both at once ), and that everyone wants a piece of. His approval ( or \\"blessing\\" ), unbiased, reasoned, and saintly, becomes the most powerful force in this fractured household. And, as a result of being scupulously fair and trying to please every conniving member, he is in constant emotional turmoil. This, tragically, leads him to retreat from the home, and finally, to retreat into his own mind.Dostoyevsky's brilliant take on the idealistic \\"holy fool\\" thrust into society after many years of study and isolation, means as much today as it did then. Maybe, more so. If you liked the movies \\"American Beauty\\", \\"Rushmore\\", \\"Election\\", or \\"Training Day\\", then you will probably enjoy this classic novel just as much as I did."},{"Title":"The Idiot (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"dostoyvsky is clearly, the most powerful and the most challenging novelist in the history. he sweeps the language and metaphor into a dangerous realm. readers could go insane reading this book, its so terrifyingly involving. myshkin is argued as jesus himself, with his lamblike innocence and the arrogance that comes with it. well, i found so mnay layers and so many meanings in the narrative, that i think only a great text could produce such range of emotions and thoughts. the text argues, fights, weeps, sulks, dreams and goes mad with you."},{"Title":"The Idiot (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"A curiously hard to put down book about a society divided and trapped by its own definitions of itself.Daughters trapped in a loving home, which nevertheless makes them into neurotic victims within their parents' boundaries of obsessive control in fear of a cruel society that is so quick to demonize a girl or woman who would dare challenge the social mores.The wide array of mundane personalities, calculating opportunists and manipulators, men and women, looking to latch onto a figure that may become a vehicle for their own peculiar social ambitions.The desperately lonely world of the older members of society, their maddening mirage of a life spent on chasing the illusory achievements that ultimately no one cares about. Can anyone wonder that so many sought then, as they do now, an escape in booze and (today) drugs?And then there's the young, naive hero clueless to the world of adults into which he is thrown having had spent most of his life away from the maddening crowd of adult intrigues and hypocritical customs and conventions, who never learned the \\"art\\" of lies, connivance and underhanded game-playing with the lives of others.Much of the world described in the compelling novel is mostly long gone. Girls and women need no longer fear their sexuality. A smart and enterprising person need no longer depend on powerful and privileged members of society to realize his/her own ambitions. There remains, however, to this day the need to hide one's true persona. Very likely even more today than 150 years ago vis a vis the omnipresent fishbowl of social websites and gradually disappearing respect for one's privacy.Despite are own self-assurances, we are still trapped by social mores invented by and for our own time. Today's Idiot is still a person who cannot see the point in duplicitous behaviour.The more things change, the more they stay the same, I suppose."},{"Title":"The Idiot (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Dostoevsky is brilliant in this fascinating portrayal of an innocent thrust into the modern world. As always, he creates characters so realistic and multi-faceted that they transform into living, breathing, pitiable, three-dimensional people - as real as your own family, by the novel's end.One particularly fascinating passage describes a man's thoughts and emotions as he endures the final minutes before his own impending execution, until his life is suddenly spared at the last moment. Dostoevsky himself narrowly escaped execution in his youth, having been granted a last-minute reprieve. This passage not only sheds new light on his experience, but manages to make the death penalty forever more real for us all.Dostoevsky's insights into what motivates humans to behave as they do, including the insane, the hopelessly in love, the greedy, and the pure in heart, is heart-breaking in its accuracy. A good read that will keep you thinking about it for days and weeks after its conclusion."},{"Title":"The Idiot (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Fyodor Dostoyevsky's 'The Idiot' is - even with such classics as 'Crime and Punishment' and 'The Brothers Karamazov' - a stand-out and major work from his oeuvre.Its protagonist is one of literature's most sublime creations, for sure; a character so remarkable, complex and unique that only a genius mind who has such an elevated understanding of the human condition, such as Dostoyevsky's, could've been responsible for its creation. Prince Myshkin is Dostoyevsky's attempt to fulfill the ideal of the \\"perfect\\" human being and how this ideal collides with the reality of the modern world and in Prince's Myshkin experiences with the world, we get one of the most intricate mirror images reflecting back our condition. In Myshkin we can see a human being who is one with the world despite being at odds with said world. We go along with him in his experiences and their outcome make for one of the many pleasures of 'The Idiot'.Another of its pleasures is its narrative simplicity opposed to its thematic complexity. Dostoyevsky thrives in taking opposites and making them clash and this is where the novel finds much of its greatness and tremendous drive. It can be deeply contemplative one moment and then furiously impulsive the next, very simple and light and suddenly extremely dark and complicated, howling in its hilarity and then tragically sad, pristine and clear passages of direct reality give to moments of almost hallucinogenic unconsciousness.More so than that, Dostoyevsky gives what is probably the greatest indictment against the death penalty and one of the most incisive against the Catholic church, a most heart-wrenching take on mortality, a most intoxicating and fascinating view on the nature of love and compassion, one of the most powerful statements on the problematic of faith in an uncaring world (nearly matching Ivan Karamazov's \\"Grand Inquisitor\\" speech) and one of the most eloquent and perfect statements on the essence of belief. This novel is jam-packed with a greatness of ideas and philosophy.Probably more so than in 'The Brothers Karamazov', in 'The Idiot' Dostoyevsky creates his richest, most deeply human cast of characters and he masters the polyphony of voices to an even greater degree. More than anything, 'The Idiot' is about the way we live and approach the world and its creatures. Dostoyevsky gives us a bunch of people who are deeply flawed as they are diverse and yet contain a very redemptive, humanly recognizable quality; through the Prince's eyes and view, the viewer gets to share what divine love is on earth and with such a view Dostoyevsky's puts us at the crux of the problematic of the human condition. Can we strive, let alone, attain the ideals of Prince Myshkin in a world where selfishness and materialism rule? Dostoyevsky doesn't give us any easy answers and leaves the reader with a paradox until the very ambiguous end. In what is probably the most despairing moment of the entire novel, the character of Ippolit argues in his letter that Christ himself was destroyed by the world and that the way he looked at the moment of his demise could make even the most staunch believers lose their faith. Was Prince Myshkin destroyed by the world at the end of the novel? Was his love too great for him, a man, to bear it? Did he really go insane or he just revealed the insanity of the world? Or is there actually hope for love, hope for life? Dostoyevsky gives the reader a haunting impression of the state of the world and makes the reader ponder about the way they interact with life.Read 'The Idiot' and be illuminated by Dostoyevsky's understanding of life, challenged by his approach to the world and inspired by Prince Myshkin. This novel is definitely a timeless masterpiece and along with Dostoyevsky's own 'The Brothers Karamazov', one of literature's greatest creations."},{"Title":"The Idiot (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"I read this for a paper in high school, and it was really good.

This books doesn't have fireworks or explosions, but the relationships between characters are simply riveting. I turn the page eagerly waiting to see what will transpire next between Natasya and the Prince, betweem Roghozin and Natasya, between Aglaya and the Prince, between Roghozin and the Prince, and so on. This is a brilliant character study, but it also has terrific plot. If you don't like this, then you probably dislike plays, because that is what this reads like--actors performing on simple but fully realized stage sets. This is definitely not Dostoevsky's best novel, but it far surpasses most other novels being published today. Give it a try. If you love Russian novels, you will certainly enjoy this."},{"Title":"The Idiot (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Though this novel may not be as technically clear as /Crime and Punishment/ or /The Gambler/, it is an read indispensable for the true Dostoyevsky fan. More similar in style to Tolstoy, it employs a much greater sweep of characters and time than earlier novels.Some of the characters are absolutely fantastic, such as the Prince Myshkin himself, Roghozin, Ganya Ardalionovich, and Natassya Philopovna, and others are just a little bit too far over the top for my tastes, such as the old General and the mother of the three daughters (whose name escapes me).The Prince can be read both as a golden example of what an ideal person (a true Christian) should behave like, and an ironic comment on the superficiality and decadence of our society and the utter infeasability of the life of such a sacrificial lamb. Perhaps his undoing is his intelligence, if he wasn't so smart, he really would be an Idiot, but as it is, he is both too trusting and too discerning at the same time.Some of the scenes are magnificent, such as Hippolite's monologue, and the final tableau....I won't spoil them, but I must say that even if the entire book wasn't so good, it would still be worth reading to just imagine these scenes.This book, much more than /Crime and Punishment/, serves as a vehicle for Dostoyevsky to deliver his own views on nihilism, the death sentence, and various and sundry other topics. While interesting, he doesn't always manage to make them flow well into the story.For any fans of existentialism, this is a must read, as Albert Camus practically lifted many of his ideas for The Stranger and The Myth of Sisyphus from several sections of this work."},{"Title":"The Idiot (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Dostoyevsky renders a brilliant portrait of the hypersensitive Prince Myshkin, the \\"idiot\\" referred to in the title. It's impossible not to pity the poor guy. The Prince is intelligent, well-meaning, and honest; certainly not an idiot and in fact seemingly normal much of the time. But he doesn't fit in with any of the several social circles he encounters because he's overly naive, sensitive, excitable, and serious. In addition, the Prince has passionate views on religion and politics and espouses them at the most inopportune moments. What happens is that virtually everyone who meets the prince considers him to be very socially inept and makes fun of him behind his back or sometimes to his face. What's worse is that the Prince to a large degree understands his own faults but doesn't try to improve himself.Dostoyevsky does such a marvelous job of characterizing the prince that I found myself thinking of other people I know that are similarly inept when dealing with others. I also thought about myself and times that I'd said the wrong things in front of others. Let's face it, conversing with one or two people is completely different from saying something in front of an audience or in a group / party discussion, even if its a group you know very well. The whole atmosphere changes and you have to be a bit more careful in your choice of words so that everyone understands what you're saying and also so that their attention doesn't wander. Many of us know someone who never fails to make a fool of himself / herself in these kinds of social situations, from being perhaps too talkative, too nervous, taking friendly jibes seriously, drinking too much, or what have you. The Prince is one of those people that can be completely likable as a friend, but a total embarrassment at a party or in a group discussion.I read somewhere that Dostoyevsky was describing himself in many ways while writing about the Prince. No wonder the Prince is so astonishingly rendered; the author already knew him intimately. Dostoyevsky does an excellent job with the other characters too, though none are masterpieces like Myshkin. I particularly enjoyed reading about the hilariously different personalities within the Yepanchin family, level-headed Mr. Radomsky, pathetic Lebedev, the sinister Rogozhin, and others.The story is great, a real page turner. A few other reviews state that the narrative starts out well and then bogs down into disappointment. I didn't think so, I was interested right up to the surprising ending (poor Prince!). I do think that Dostoyevsky need not have concocted the bizarre love triangle that he did; the novel would have been just as effective with a more conventional plot and some other focus for the Prince's compassion and pity, say a family stricken with poverty. It's the characterization of the Prince that makes \\"The Idiot\\" what it is.Btw, I read David Magershack's translation (Penguin Classics). I can't imagine the translation being much better, it flowed so well that I could easily have been fooled into believing that it was originally written in English."},{"Title":"The Idiot (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"This may be the most Christian of Dostoyevsky's novels and deals with how to live a good life and the damage this can cause. This refutes the modern and western belief that the Christian &quot;Abundant Life&quot; means riches and lack of trouble. There are many allusions to Revelations, brought out by the relatively minor character Lebedev. There are apocryphal themes of making money, and the nihilism of the younger generation. This book has the potential to personally impact you depending on how you identify with the characters. The Prince, Prince S, and the various generals present different models of the &quot;good life&quot;. To respond to an earlier reviewer, the cover painting by Hans Holbein is featured predominately in the book. This book may be work for the reader, (as it was for Dostoyevsky to write) and I referred to list of character often, but the work is rewarding!"},{"Title":"The Idiot (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"There certainly will never be another book like The Idiot. As every high school student knows, the central maxim of creative writing is, &quot;Show; don't tell.&quot; Henry James, who criticized the novels of Dostoyevsky as big, lumbering dinosaurs, epitomized this method of literary exegesis. In The Idiot, Dostoyevsky wrote nearly 700 pages of &quot;telling&quot; and almost no &quot;showing&quot; to speak of. The book doesn't really have a plot: though linear, there is little cohesion; in addition, Dostoyevsky takes frequent times outs from telling his story to expound on such philosophical issues as capital punishment, morality, humility, materialism, and the order of chaos. Indeed, the previous subject, or the lack there of, is really the theme and the focus of the book. In reading The Idiot, it becomes quite clear why Christ was crucified. Dostoyevsky portrays the Russia of his time as a mad, chaotic world characterized by an obsession with decadent materialism. In such a swirling mass of &quot;isms&quot;, one struggles to find a rational and coherent foothold; morality and virtue have no place. The Christian ideal -- which now seems to have disappeared from the world, if, indeed, it ever actually existed -- of humility, submission, deference, tolerance, and turning the other cheek, as personified in Prince Myshkin, the novel's title character and protagonist, also has no place. Dostoyevsky saw the Christ-like figure of Myshkin as the only hope that Russian culture and society had: he was Dostoyevsky's redemptive figure. Unfortunately, as Dostoyevsky clearly and vividly portrays in this dark and bleak novel, such a person would most likely never be able to integrate him or herself into a culture as far gone into decadence and negative modes of thinking -- atheism, nihilism, etc. -- as his Russia was. Does this sound familiar, or does it not? The book and it multiple messages are clearly still very relevant today. One literary scholar quite accurately called this Dostoyevsky's most contemporary novel. One senses that it is even more applicable to today's (post-Communist and once again being invaded by capitalism and Western materialism) Russia than to the Russia of Dostoyevsky's own time. The book is not an especially exciting read: there is a multitude of dialogue and very few things (with the exceptions of Nastashya's two big incidents) which can be called &quot;exciting&quot; take place. The novel, as mentioned before, is also very fragmented: it is seemingly not structured at all, and events happen apparently at random and with no connection to each other. This, of course, relates back to the chaos of order -- or, in relation to the novel itself, the order of chaos. The discontinuity of the novel reflects and comments upon the discontinuity of society and the world itself. This is precisely why we still read Dostoyevsky today, and why we should always read him: the anomie of Dostoyevsky is the eternal anomie of mankind."},{"Title":"The Idiot (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"this is a truly harrowing and tragic tale of sick love. love that corrupts and ruins and drives men insane. nastasia filipovna is tormented soul that can only love chirst.

The characters in this novel could come from modern characters in our own lives. We all sacrifice to some degree our hearts in favour of our heads. Prince Myshkin's passion for life, truth, and love are a positive example to us all. The only complaint I have about this book is the title.

Like most his other work, after having set the initial setting, Dostoyevski peels off only a thin layer of civilization to reveal raw greed, insane jealousy and hysteria in most of the main characters.The book's 900 pages are divided in four parts, of which the first part is by far the most engaging. After having set the stage in this first part however, Dostoyevski seems unable to bring the many plotlines to a satisfactory conclusion. The plot gets complicated by the introduction of too many side characters, and the main players lose much of their colour. The book is definitely too long. After part one, the fascinating Nastassia Philippovna is degraded to an abstract background character. Also, prince Muichkine's navet&eacute; is not as pure anymore.Although the book gets tedious at times, there are two flashes of brilliance which makes the latter parts a rewarding read. In part three, Hyppolite gives a captivating account of the motivations of a person who is condemned tot death by his tuberculosis. And in the first pages of part 4, Dostoyevski offers a merciless description of Gania, who combines a burning ambition, a glaring lack of ability and from there on the urge to always blame others for his lack of success. Very recognizable, the analysis still holds today."},{"Title":"The Idiot (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"I'd heard you were \\"supposed to read this book\\", and \\"it's a classic\\". So I went into it with open arms and to tell you the truth I loved Part 1. I couldn't put it down. Part 2 started to wane a little bit and by Part 3 I was forcing myself to go on. I've always felt that a great book, or a great movie should really leave you wanting more at the end, but with \\"The Idiot\\" that isn't the case. I couldn't wait for it to be over. Such a promising start, and such a dissapointing end.I think that because everyone says what a great book this is, we almost feel as if we too should think it's a great book. It's not. He's written much better stuff and so have other Russian authors."},{"Title":"The Idiot (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Don't waste your time reading this book - this book is awful! This book was supposed to be so good, according to the other reviews, and it's definitely not a good novel. In fact, this is by far the worst novel I have read in my life. I think one of the other reviewers hit the nail on the head - most of this book just seems like random writing and ultimately it has no real purpose for carrying forward the plot line. Indeed, it definitely seems like he was just trying to meet a word count for the publisher. The edition of the book I read was slightly over 700 pages, and it could have easily been reduced to 300 without affecting in any way the plot line. Thus the reader is left to swallow 400 pages of pointless writing that just seems like \\"waffling\\" to mention the term used in England to describe writing that leads you no where. Not only that, but the 300 pages devoted to actually explaining the plot are not that interesting anyway. The plot line of the novel is incredibly implausible; a prince who is an \\"idiot\\" but on occasions doesn't seem like such an idiot after all and who suffers from a mysterious illness of \\"idiocy\\" that could not be labelled as an actual illness by modern medicine. Moreover, one of the principal characters in the novel, Aglaia Yepanchin supposedly is madly in love with the prince while at the same time making fun of him in a very rude way right in front of his nose - am I the only one here who thinks this is JUST a little implausible? And then just to make matters worse, and as an appetizer after having to swallow 650 pages of horrible writing, near the end of the novel Dostoyevski puts in the mouth of the prince two full pages of the most outrageous slander against the Catholic religion I have read in my life. Supposedly, according to Dosteyvski, atheism comes from the Catholic religion - certainly Dosteyevski doesn't hide his hatred for the Catholic faith. Even atheists would laugh at such an absurd proposition."},{"Title":"The Idiot (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"I hated this book. Whoever enjoyed needs a life. Read the Lord of the Rings. Tolkien is a fantasy God!!"},{"Title":"The Idiot (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"First of all, I wonder who's bright idea it was to put such a absurd cover painting on The Idiot! Yes, intellectually Myshkin is another version Jesus -(who was another \\"idiot\\" in the Dostoyevskian sense) yet it reflects absolutely nohting about the novel itself. The novel is naive, its beautiful and Myshkin is not dead but well alive during the novel.Prince Myshkin (the idiot) is a naive and good-hearted man, (and also a very sweet and charming man). He has just returned from Europe, where he has been isolated from the world for a period to undergo a surgery. His isolation and his epileptic falls has in his own words \\"turned him into being an idiot\\". His problem is that he lacks a mighty ego, and something material to hold onto in life. In other words, things that makes a man a man today. And interestingly, he don't seem to be in any need for such things. So his story is bound to be tragic and problematic. Still, as the novel deepens it becomes obvious that Myshkin's 'problem' is not that he's an \\"idiot\\" actually, but that he observes things around him with very different eyes. More sincere and humane eyes. He's an idiot in the eye of Holywood heroism. His behaviour is \\"idiocy\\" in the eyes of modernism with its own \\"unique\\" value-structure (money, fame, power, etc.). He conveys a childness that people around him can, at best, pity. Myshkin is the true \\"good man\\", partly Don Quixote, partly Jeal Valjan, partly Dostoevsky."},{"Title":"The Idiot (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"\\"The Idiot\\" is the story of Prince Myshkin, a simple-minded, almost Christ-like figure given to seizures.It's not Dostoyevsky's best novel, and its ending is somewhat abrupt and disappointing, but it's probably better than ninety percent of all the other novels written by any author since. It's brilliant, and it contains some of Dostoyevsky's finest writing. A passage in which the book's protagonist walks into a room and then into a girl's eyes springs immediately to mind, and has stayed with me ever since I first read this book years ago.And, unlike Dostoyevksy's more widely read works, in this book, Dostoyevsky often takes the opportunity to digress from the novel's story and tell his personal opinions on what he's writing about, whether the subject be an event in the story or a particular theme the author feels strongly about. These digressions present a great opportunity for the reader to really get to know this amazing writer.But the story and the characters are reasons enough to give this book a go, preferably after first reading \\"The Brothers Karamazov,\\" \\"Crime and Punishment,\\" or some of Dostoyevky's shorter works.It's a great book, very rewarding, and well worth your time."},{"Title":"The Idiot (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"In my opinion Dostoyevsky's finest novel. Reveals the depths of human compassion and tenderness, unrequited love, and unfulfilled hopes and dreams - such things that can only be accompanied by craziness."},{"Title":"The Idiot (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Another reviewer states that The Idiot should not be a first foray into Dostoevsky's works....which I disagree with....Having first read 'Crime and Punishment' and the dark complexity of a good man driven to tortured madness by having committed an unspeakable act, no matter how well-intentioned it might be...I found this novel lacking in comparison....and might suggest this as a starting point, in order to gain an insight into the writing style and illumination of theme one needs to appreciate such a complex author...Prince Myshkin, the 'good man' protagonist of this novel, is purported by other reviewers to be either a representation of Christ; or a representation of the author himself, a man 'flawed' by his alcoholism and gambling addiction, illustrated as an affliction of epilepsy in the character of Myshkin....a 'defect' which makes him less than desirable to those around him...However, Myshkin's wealth brings him admiration, frienship, even love; in the persons of some unscrupulous and amoral characters who seek him out for their own personal agendas, regardless of his 'idiocy' while Dostoevksy plays out their affect on this 'pure' man as they attempt to corrupt him as well. The characters are vain, ill-tempered gold-diggers and social climbers, and Myshkin's is tasked with remaining 'pure' in the face of such influence on him.The novel is long, yes, and takes some attention in order to wade through the myriad characters and situations; and a bit of adeptness at 'reading between the lines' in order to recognize the theme that the author was exploring. However, though I do find it lack-lustre in comparison to C&P;, it is a worthwhile read and deserves its place in the annals of classic literature."},{"Title":"The Idiot (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"The Idiot is one of the finest novels in history, perhaps the finest. In this novel, the enigma that is often referred to as \\"THE RUSSIAN SOUL\\" is variously dissected through the different characters and more so by the hero of the story Prince Myshkin. In its simplest explanation, it is a soul with good intentions but faulty in executing the intentions. It is a soul in conflict, driven by the zest for life and a search of its meaning. Certainly the most Christian of Dostoyevsky's novels, THE IDIOT portrays how disastrous a good life can be. Rich in characters, this classic centers mostly on the good Prince Myshkin, a recovering epileptic with a rich soul who is easily perceived as an 'idiot' by the casual observer who focuses on his child-like manners especially in expressing himself and his naivety in dealing with people. But then a closer look reveals that his manners are the reflections of his honest soul, the wealth of his big heart and the broadness of his mind.And only in deeper engagements does it become evident that Myshkin however has superior understanding and expression, which makes him modest and intelligent rather than stupid. His simple, honest and decent life is succinctly conveyed in his interactions, generating both love and resentment. The saintly Myshkin however struggles to deal with a materialistic world which has no place for the virtuous, and to reconcile his passionate and compassionate love for two women. But the love of the women corrupt and drives men out of their minds. Nastasia Filipovna whom Myshkin has compassionate love for is a tormented soul that can only love Christ and in Myshkin she found that Christ-like figure. Her rival Aglia has Myshkin's heart but failed to understand Myshkin's serene love for her and abandons him to the destructive love of Nastasia.This is great intellectual work that we should to take seriously in general, a book to read with a serious mindset. Then you will understand the unique nature of Russia which our western minds have difficulties to comprehend. This strange land called Russia that has a bigger soul than any other is explored here in this story in a way that only Dostoyevsky unveils. Read it and you will finish it enriched. The Idiot is a thoroughly enjoyable novel of ideas that explores the nature of man and society and gives you a better idea of man and his actions. You shouldn't find it strange that the characters are philosophical, impulsive, introspective, energetic, colorful, and extreme in their passions. That is Russia, a land of extremes. This book is likely to impact you. It is one of the few of our times.

I suggest C&P instead, or the Brothers Karamazov if you have the time."},{"Title":"The Idiot (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Prince Myshkin is one of the most pure, childlike, beautiful, yet nave figures in christian literature. He is beautiful simply because he is ridiculous at the same time, despite his always good intentions. In almost every respect, he is very similar to the still famous Don Quixote. The reader can't help feeling compassion for Servantes' hero's unawareness of his own worth and his ridiculousness at the same time. Dostoyevsky's hero arouses the reader's sympathy for pretty much the same reasons. He certainly is not the main protagonist of this novel, in the sense that being almost an onlooker, he's an understanding listener, allows himself to be drawn to a complex underground intrigue he stepped right into, and that unwillingly, he attracts around him all the characters of this book and lends his ear to their confessions and revelations. He commiserates with those who try to lie to him, cheat him, mock him, and throughout the narrative he remains an outsider, an \\"idiot\\" in the classic meaning of the word. And in this respect the reader may find him somewhat irritating. Sometimes. At least I do.Dostoyevsky dispatches Myshkin back to Russia as a redeemer, and to me, precisely this messianic content of this novel is in glaring contradiction to the content of all his other major novels. In him, one can see how Russia is reflected. The prince is not a bearer of a philosophy of any kind whatsoever. His function is not to act in any way, or to alter the course of the action by the continuity of his deeds. His function is simply to disseminate the aura of a new state of being, and let happen what may happen.\\"The idiot\\" is Dostoyevsky's book of salvation, and Prince Myshkin, just like Christ, tried to save without overcoming the implacability of destiny. There is no other character in russian literature quite like him. He is the personification of the highest potentialities of the russian spirit. And his motherland, whom he wants to save, is in total disarray at the time of his return. To save through compassion, the highest form of christian love: that's what he wants to achieve. And as soon as he arrives, he realizes the hopelessness of his mission. He can not simply save through compassion alone. This grim fatalism begins on the very first page of the novel, when the prince, on his way back home, meets Rogozhin in the train. And they are both here together at the beginning, just as they will be at the very end of the book. Myshkin hovers above the fatal pursuit of Nastassya Filippovna by Rogozhin like an angel wringing his hands over the Crucifixion. In the end, he embracing Rogozhin, the murderer by the bedside of Nastassya's lifeless body transforms the killing into a ritual sacrifice.A lot of long passages and even whole pages throughout this novel seem to have been written by a restless, uneasy, sometimes even feverish mind. I learned that Dostoyevsky was epileptic only immediately after having finished this novel. To be honest, I wasn't surprised that much.\\"The idiot\\", like all the books the great russian writer has ever written, is certainly not an easy read at all. Sometimes, it requires rereading certain passages again and again. \\"Crime and punishment\\" has always been my personal favorite Dostoyevsky novel. Yet, I think \\"The idiot\\" is an extremely well-written novel in which we see ourselves, and the world the book is about happens to be ours too."},{"Title":"The Idiot (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"The three books that have had the greatest impact on my life are The Bible, The Idiot and Les Miserables. The tragedy of Myshkin's innocence and yet its ability to shake to the core this aristocratic society (plug in any era you wish) is both a supreme goal and warning. This is not a book to read for literature (although it certainly is a great example) but for questionning what it means to be in the world and not of the world."},{"Title":"The Idiot (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"The Idiot, when I first read it years ago, seemed nothing less than the Christ sacrifice re-enacted, relocated to a spritually corrupt Russian upper class society, representing our contaminated world. Prince Myshkin, (the title in Russia is not 'royal,') immediately suggested Prince of Peace, the Saviour.Years later when I reread the book, that interpretation was also true, but insufficent to the dense story.This time around, the Idiot, was funnier, less seriously driven by a divinely sparked moral perfection. Holiness takes a lampooning, along with the canon of social superiority, and those that would be servitors of justice. (Hadn't FD afterall, been imprisoned by their likes?)The Idiot, it suddenly leaped out to me, is none other than the author, condemned like Myshkin by a malfunctioning switch in the brain. Epilepsy in a severely religious world, was imbued with the evil/spirit blame factor, and implied weakness as well. Moreover, Dostoevski, carried what he undoubtedly felt as a moral failure within himself, a compulsive gambler lives in chronic, progressive despair. Hadn't he, as Myshkin, committed himself to a way of righteousness, only to fail to resolve or improve the sufferings of his fellows? How often, would you imagine, he, like other addicts willed to quit, and could not stop? The moral choice to be compassionate, in an almost Buddhist sense, is correct, but will not be repaid in any betterment to the giver or the receiver. Prince Myshkin was good, compulsively so. He was also a buffoon, exploited by immoral others, and condemned by an impaired mind. Righteousness, is insufficent for liberating our lower order, deficient bodies.Funny? Yes, the matriarch, of a pre-feminist culture, is the comic relief of an otherwise heavy and often inscrutable, long novel. The pecadillos of the 'respectable' gentlemen, immobilized by greed and sexual desire, the various flopped attempts at love, and friendship, serve comic purpose. There are many, many gambles, and a non-stop game of roulette/life.The only other gambler aka Idiot, is of course, God. Dostoyevski's intense relgious ambivalence and inevitable return to faith is also a crap shoot- maybe the greatest of all. Is there, or isn't there, take a chance. God bet on the world, then sent his son to redeem us, was that a win? God bet the jack of hearts, was it an ace that took the pot?In Karamazov, the holiest man, in death, left an unbearable stench, the last scene in the Idiot, also involves a similar image. Are we again, confronting holiness in the sense of foul?The Idiot, is one of the finest novels in history, many would say the finest. It is incomplete and uncertain, as any human creation must be."},{"Title":"A Viscount For Christmas (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"While &quot;A Viscount For Christmas&quot; is a little more somber and angst-ridden than is the usual Zebra Christmas fare, it still proved to be an interesting and compelling read -- even if things became a tad too complicated towards the end.Miss Olivia Faraday is near the end of her tether: her father's mental health seems to be slipping faster than ever, they practically have no money left, and now her widowed elder sister, Susanna, and her two sons are about to turn up. How is Olivia to stretch the budget in order to house and feed three extra people, especially when Christmas is around the corner? But the crowning worry comes in the shape of Lord Jack Harrow. Olivia's father used to be the consulting agriculturist for Lord Harrow's now deceased uncle. Now Lord Harrow has inherited Littleton Park, and Olivia cannot help but fear that Lord Harrow will retire her father. What would the practically penniless Faradays do then? And where would they go? The very thought that the fate of her family lies in the hands of a care-for-naught fribble like Lord Harrow is enough to make even the most optimistic of women feel bilious! But Olivia has a plan. She will make the useless man see that her father still has a lot to contribute and that he is on the road to recovery. So what if it will mean that she will have to spend an inordinate amount of time with the man? But when Lord Harrow proves to be kind, generous, intelligent and self-effacing, Olivia cannot but fear that in her zeal to prove her father's worth, she has left herself open to a different kind of threat...What makes this novel good is the manner in which the authour allows us to see the changes in Lord Harrow -- from the careless fellow in the first few chapters, to the more responsible landlord at the end of the book. Ms Blair also does a wonderful job of depicting all the worries and angst that Olivia feels and experiences. It is true that Olivia is a bit sour and harsh for most of the book, but factor in all that she's coping with and going through, and I do think that most readers will forgive her her less than sunny nature. The subplot involving Olivia's sister, Susanna, was rather interesting too. And if I had one complaint, it was that things got a little too complicated towards the end of the book, with Lord Harrow and Olivia talking at cross purposes and the whole missing money bit. On the whole though, &quot;A Viscount for Christmas&quot; was a thoroughly satisfying and enjoyable read, with believable and engaging characters facing real problems.

Flynn, the author of \\"The Roosevelt Myth\\" and other classic texts of the \\"Old Right\\", writes simply, but says it all."},{"Title":"While you slept (All-American Book Digest)","review":"Between the covers of John T. Flynn's excellent book, \\"While You Slept\\", the discerning reader will find a key to one of history's greatest mysteries: how Asia was lost to communism. For herein, Flynn reveals the machinations of the many communists and communist sympathizers within the government of the United States, and the print media who so shaped American government policy that China tragically fell to the Soviet onslaught.I had the good fortune to read this important and excellent book right after having read Whittaker Chambers' \\"Witness\\". And it is remarkable how we see the similar characters playing leading roles, such as convicted Soviet agents Alger Hiss and Harry Dexter White. It is stunning that these Soviet agents played such key roles within the government of the United States. And it is equally remarkable that their roles have been so little discussed by our court historians, who have no real and plausible explanation for the fall of China.Flynn writes beautifully. The book is a wonder, and a joy. We strongly recommend it to all who would know justice and love mercy, while yet there is time."},{"Title":"While you slept (All-American Book Digest)","review":"John T Flynn was a business journalist who originally covered graft and Wall Street scandals in the 1920s and 1930s. Originally a supporter of the incoming Roosevelt administration he came to believe the New Deal's support of compulsory cartels under the NRA was a betrayl of tradtional 'trust busting' liberalism. He believed the administration's massive reliance on public borrowing and deficit spending, rather than fiscal reform, was dangerous. He was a former Nye Committee investigator. Nye exposed the role major banks and munition makers played in President Wilson's march to war in 1918. Flynn believed the failure of the New Deal to bring jobs would see FDR turn to military spending as an economic cure. This prediction was soon justified and Flynn became a leading spokesman for the America First Committee and, after the war, wrote one of the first exposes arguing FDR had prior knowledge of the Pearl Harbor attack. Flynn remained a committed isolationist after the war, believing the same pattern of was re-emerging in the then new Cold War. Interestingly enough Flynn became a strong supporter of Senator Joseph McCarthy, perhaps in part because he, like many pre-war isolationists, had been smeared as pro-Hitler traitors, often by communists and their 'dupes', who originally strongly opposed intervention but who overnight became pro-war super-patriots once Russia was attacked.This book comes from Flynn's \\"McCarthyite\\" period but don't let that label fool you. It is a lucid, logical and well presented analysis of how the US \\"lost China\\" in the immediate post war years. I would argue it is a flawed and ultimately incorrect analysis but it in many ways it highlights aspects more conventional accounts brush over. Flynn starts at the top and places the blame with the leading Roosevelt / Truman diplomatic officials. He argues that where FDR berated Stalin as a tyrant for the two years of the Nazi-Soviet pact, once Stalin joined the allies a major PR \\"makeover\\" campaign was attempted by the administration to make the Soviet Union a more acceptable ally to the American people. This proceeded through books, movie and radio which Flynn documents. Riding on the tail of this campaign was a subsidiary effort to paint Mao's Chinese communists as 'agrarian reformers' superiot to 'the Old China' represented by Chiang Kai-shek. Throughout the war the US administration sought to create a \\"shot gun wedding\\" between the Chinese Nationalist government and Mao's communists. Chiang Kai-shek was prepared to accept the communists as a political party into his coalition and communists as recruits into his army, but he was not prepared to accept an armed political party. Flynn examines the alleged pro-communist sympathies of most books written on the issue during the period and the role of left leaning book reviewers, what today we'd call \\"gatekeepers\\", in creating the anti-Chiang Kai-shek atmosphere. He find the same forces at work among senior State Department officials both in China and in the Asian affairs desks in Washington. He argues that the main US negotiators and generals on the ground in China, in particular General \\"Vinegar Joe\\" Stillwell and General George C Marshall were poorly served by these left leaning advisors. This is the background to the \\"loss of China\\" and the bloody confrontation in Korea that followed.Flynn argues his case logically and well and he is an excellent writer. Good writing makes for easy reading and Flynn delivers that. I think this book has much to recommend it, if only as a means of \\"getting inside the head\\" of the American right's \\"China Lobby\\" . It helped explain the 'strange bedfellow' alliance between the China Lobby and McCarthy on one side and the 'Old Right' in the late 1940s / early 1950s, and the oddities of Senator Robert Taft's, otherwise a strong advocate of diplomacy and international law, pro-Korean War position. After all the traditional isolationist position applies as much to China as it did Europe. It was Old Right and isolationist spokesmen who opposed the growth of 'the Imperial Presidency' both in FDR's \\"secret war\\" against Hitler pre-1942 and in Truman's unprecedented \\"police action\\" war by executive decree in Korea. On the face of it neither group has much in common. The first being Asia interventionists and the second, isolationists. The 'loss of China\\" was seen as an extension of Yalta and the \\"loss of East Europe\\". The evidence of high level treason was used to explain and link both. However wrong headed that argument was, the isolationists were correct to see these two great \\"losses\\" as plainly invalidating the high blown neo-Wilsonian rhetoric used to sell the FDR / Truman shift to American globalism.Flynn's argument is ultimately flawed. Yalta had less to do with high level treason, although there definitely were rats in the ranks, than FDR's desire to complete the Wilsonian project and get a working UN \\"off the ground\\". FDR believed, and as Robert Nisbet has demonstrated in his book \\"The Failed Courtship\\", that \\"nobless oblige\\" towards Stalin was the way to long term peace. Ultimately Truman would backpedal from this position but he was unprepared to openly repudiate his predecessor's failed vision. FDR regularly bypassed his most senior advisors, whether they were pink or blue made no difference. Much of the criticism of Chiang Kai-shek itself came as much from Wilsonian as pro-Marxist tendencies. And Dean Acheson is more easily pigeon holed as an anglophile than as a 'red dupe'. This angle is relevant and only briefly touched on by Flynn. America's \\"old imperialist\\" allies, notably Britain, keen to hang on to Hong Kong were not so keen on Chiang Kai-shek. They were thus more willing to come to a mutual accommodation with Mao than the Nationalists. Maybe there were anglophiles under the bed along with the reds. Similarly General Marshall's desire to get Russia into the war against Japan, what Flynn correctly identifies as a major turning point in ultimate communist victory in China, can at most be criticised as \\"win the war\\" shortsightedness, perhaps comparable to the US insistence on a Normandy invasion versus Churchill's advocacy of a more long term focuded strategy with invasion via 'the soft underbelly of Europe'.Flynn's book does however provide some useful correctives to the dominant account of the period over recent decades. The allied insistence on a Nationalist/Communist merger during the war was certainly unfair. The US and the UK were war allies with the USSR. China was not. The USSR maintained an unchallenged 'non agression pact' with Tokyo for all but the last week of the war. The USSR was one of the few states to recognise the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo. Mao's communists were definitely aligned with Stalin. Chang Kai-shek had no more reason to trust them than FDR or Churchill had reason to trust Vichy France. The diplomatic insistence on a shot gun marriage may perhaps be more easily explained by 'eurocentric blindness' than red subversion.As mentioned before, Flynn is correct in noting the key role of Soviet intervention in the Pacific War for ultimate communist victory. This factor is usually missing from most conventional accounts which portray communist victory in the Chinese revolution as either 'inevitable' or the result of Nationalist corruption and incompetence. Flynn points out that the communists only controlled a handful of provinces at war's end yet a few years later controlled most of the mainland. Certainly Nationalist corruption and incompetence didn't just happen. What changed the balance?Flynn's explanation provides at least part of the story. The US provided a massive resupply of Russia's far east forces in preparation for their entry into the war against Japan. When the Russians moved it was against a Japanese manchurian army that had been stripped to the bone to reinforce Japanese Pacific deployments. The US, unlike Russia, lacked decent intelligence in Manchukuo and over-estimated the size of the Japanese force. Stalin was in receipt of Japanese peace initiatives but failed to pass them on, presumably waiting for his moment of opportunity in Manchuria, which itself (as Flynn points out) had been a long term object of Czarist and bolshevik ambition. Marshall believed a large Japanese force lay in wait in Manchuria, just as Ike believed a large German force lay in wait in Southern Germany. Both proved to be phantoms.Stalin ensured Japanese materiel along with Soviet aid resupplied the Chinese communists post-war, at the same time the US was attempting to broker a peace, via Marshall, between the Nationalists and Communists. Some in the US imagined Mao as an Asian Tito. No such luck. The Sino-soviet split only really emerged following Khrushchev's de-Stalinisation. The US attempted to force Chang Kai-shek to concede by withholding aid. Corrupt regimes usually rely on a trickle down flow of graft to buy loyalties. Look at the system the US stitched together in Afghanistan to buy the removal of the Taliban. US policy in China greatly weakened their only dog in the fight at the same time as the Soviets were able to direct materiel (often originally sourced from the US or Japan) to their ally. Nothing inevitable about it.Flynn's interpretation has in some ways fared better with age since 1953. The charges against McCarthy have not exactly been repudiated by history but the publication of the Venona transcripts has forced some downgrading of the usual charges against him. We now know that Soviet penetration of higher circles in the US was significant, a charge the anti-anti-communists for a long time denied, almost as an article of faith. McCarthy was still off the mark however and claims of US strategy being written in Moscow are nonsense. One argument I am interested in is made by Athan Theoharis in his 1971 book and referred to by Ronald Radosh in his excellent 1975 book \\"Prophets On The Right\\". The Truman administration's failure to publicly repudiate the Yalta agreements, many of the terms of which it insisted on keeping secret, whilst actually repudiating the previous President's strategy de facto made possible created the space for McCarthyism to flourish. This helps explain why conservative 'strict construction' consitutionalists concerned at 'The Imperial Presidency' would ally with the McCarthyites.Flynn's approach has even picked up some high profile support very recently. Note the recent popularity of \\"Mao: The Unknown Story\\" by Jung Chang and Jon Halliday. According to it's 'The Guardian' review Chang and Halliday claim that \\"The American General Marshall, who had attempted to mediate in the civil war, had unwittingly saved the communist armies by imposing a truce in the summer of 1946 that lasted for four months. It was this truce that prevented Chiang's armies from crushing the retreating Reds. The ceasefire enabled the latter to be massively replenished by the Soviet side and then reverse the tide to win in Manchuria and then gain the rest of China.\\" Flynn's 1958 describes this incident in his chapter \\"The Blunders That Lost a continent\\". Flynn calls this \\"Blunder Number Four\\".The charges made by Flynn and \\"the China Lobby\\" , well delivered in this book, all told have not been retrospectively justified by history. But it is probably time the usual charges made against them are revisited. I suspect the likely result may be a reduced sentence."},{"Title":"Sarah's Bead","review":"Sarah's Bead is a refreshing, warm retelling of an ageless story. I was deeply touched by this book.

I found the chapter on fundraising and marketing enlightening, and was surprised that in some cases lengthy text actually works.

The message though is the same - get to the point and do so in a clear manner. There was also some inconsistency in the discussion of what to include in resumes. Specifically, the authors feel that including hobbies is irrelevant. They then present as a model resume one that includes hobbies, among them an interest in Black Labradors, which, to me, can have all kinds of connotations. Regarding resumes and their submissions, readers should also know that most jobs are obtained not through the mailing out or posting of resumes, regardless of how well structured the resume and how beautiful the prose of the cover letter, but through what are known as weak links, or not your first tier of connections but the levels beyond.

Thanks to Oates exhaustive research, The Fires... provides a vivid portrayal of the gruesome deeds that Nat Turner and his band of brothers committed on that fateful day in August of 1831.Nat Turner, as described, was more than a slave. By all standards, he was literate, intelligent and presented himself as a decent and trustworthy slave. Most importantly, he was, as some considered, blessed with divine gifts and was tormented with possessing such power and yet still a slave:\\"... behind Nat's well-mannered facade was a messianic individual who felt himself driven into some corner of slavery from which there was no return. He was like a powerful angel whose wings were nailed to the floor.\\" (p.41)Nat believed that the brutality he unleashed was for a higher purpose; a \`you shall reap what you sow' exhibition that would somehow reveal the wrongs of slavery .Around the time of the rebellion, Oates frames the role of the abolitionist movement as well as offering insight into the political climate of the day. Both of which contributed to pitting North and South against each other in that critical time period leading up to the most tempestuous season in American History; the Civil War."},{"Title":"The Fires of Jubilee: Nat Turner's Fierce Rebellion","review":"This book was absolutly amazing.

That, however, is not a good as it sounds since I've not come across hardly any books at all on the subject. The author does a good job in detailing the life of Nat Turner and his bloody slave revolt. The only qualms with the book arises 1) when the author glibbly dismisses the strong possibility of Nat being mentally unbalanced, 2) the author glosses over the more pressing reasons for the Civil War to only concentrate on slavery, 3) and the bizarre trip the author took through Virginia to get a feel for where the rebellion happened. This trip was very insulting to southern blacks and whites as the author acted as though he was taking a ride through Lion Country Safari and didn't want any of the &quot;animals&quot; (ie the county's people) to bite him."},{"Title":"The Fires of Jubilee: Nat Turner's Fierce Rebellion","review":"Nat Turner led the largest slave rebellion in American history. That is an indisputable fact. Unfortunately, not much else is known about the life of this legendary figure. Why did he do what he did? How was he able to do it? What was it about the man that made people follow him into insurrection? In his book, &quot;The Fires Of Jubilee: Nat Turner's Fierce Rebellion&quot;, author Stephen B. Oates attempts to answer these questions. Oates clearly did extensive research on his subject. He manages to unearth many new facts about Nat Turner that were previously unknown. Oates presents a vivid picture of what Nat Turner's life must have been like as a slave. He presents enough facts about Nat Turner to give the reader the beginnings of an idea of what motivated the man. He describes in detail the visions that Nat claimed to have had and the formations of the planned rebellion. Then, once the rebellion starts, Oates gives a moment by moment account. As I read it I found myself picturing what it must have looked and sounded like as it was happening. I felt real tension. Unfortunately, many facts about Nat Turner will simply never be known. The historical records just don't exist. Despite this, Stephen B. Oates has crafted an extraordinary biography. His work has brought us closer than ever to understanding who Nat Turner was and what he did."},{"Title":"The Fires of Jubilee: Nat Turner's Fierce Rebellion","review":"I read this book as part of my supplemental reading for college.

The story of Nat Turner, as seen through the eyes of Stephen Oates, is absolutely riveting. I ended up reading the book in less than 3 days, as I just didn't want to put it down. Stephen Oates has a way of writing that transforms the reader into the actual rebellion and allows one to see and feel the circumstances before, during and after the Nat Turner insurrection and the consequences of it to the South.

I completely agree with an earlier reviewer of this book - if you want to understand the 19th century South, and the Civil War, and the current day South, this book should be read.

It is a great narrative of not only the slave rebellion led by Nat Turner, but of the issue of slavery in American politics long before the war.Just as abolitionist John Brown, Nat turner somehow lost his way in trying to address the slave issue.This is a realy good study into the mind of a man that felt he was led by God to lead a bloody insurrection against the white man and the ideas that the black man was always destined to be in subjection.Nat Turner never had any other plan than to punish the slaveholders. His type of punishment will chill you.Even though he may have gone about the revolt in all the wrong ways, it actually opened the door to discussions, both pro and con on this peculier institution some 30 years prior to the war.I would highly recommend this work as an excellant study on the overall problems of slavery."},{"Title":"The Fires of Jubilee: Nat Turner's Fierce Rebellion","review":"Nat Turner believed he was inspired by God to lead the slaves out of bondage through violent upheavel. He drew on such passages of the Bible as Ezekiel in the Old Testament to justify the killing of men, women and children. In August, 1831, Nat's insurgents went on a nightly rampage from farm to farm in Southampton County, Virginia, killing approximately 60 whites, with axes and other weapons, even beheading children. The insurgency was quelled not long thereafter by federal troops and state militia. In addition, white vigilantes responded by torturing, burning, and killing blacks. At least 120 of those killed were innocent blacks.Nat Turner did, however, choose to spare the lives of somes whites, including the slave-owning family of his childhood playmate, John Clark Turner, as well as a poor white family whom he identified with the downtrodden. Further, Nat abstained from the use of alcohol and would become infuriated whenever his followers got drunk. Nat also forbade his followers from engaging in raping.Nat believed he was doing God's will in revolting violently against slavery, preaching to his followers the biblical passage that the first shall be last and the last first. He remained unrepentent to the end, through his trial and up to the time of his hanging.Some southern whites chose to blame Nat's actions on the influence of religious preachers and abolitionists, rather than focusing on the evils of slavery. There never was another slave rebellion of the ferocity and magnitude of Nat's rebellion. Professor Oates goes on to explain the legacy of Nat Turner's rebellion and the ramifications it had on a wider scale as the war between the states loomed in the not too distant future.This narrative can make the hair on one's neck stand up straight, while educating the reader on the evils of slavery."},{"Title":"The Fires of Jubilee: Nat Turner's Fierce Rebellion","review":"This is my first experience buying online books and it will not be the last one.

One of these is &quot;Cybernetics&quot; by Weiner and the other is &quot;The mathematical theory of communication&quot; by Shannon. Both require some study by contain many sections that are easily readable by anyone which get the main points across in an understandable manner.Weiner's book discuses the use of feedback on virtually every type of control mechanism known... i.e., those of nature as well as those of man. It is the &quot;basic&quot; stuff that everyone of us uses everyday and every moment of our lives whether we are aware of it or not. Whereas Shannon's book tells us how to communicate information in an error-free (or nearly so) way, Weiner's book explains how that information is used to provide effective control of everything around us. For many decades since I first was introduced to these two works, I have used their principles in most things I do.I very highly recommend these two books to anyone who considers themselves a &quot;thinking person&quot; and is seeking to understand the world around them. Both easily get 5 stars. They are major works!"},{"Title":"Cybernetics, Second Edition: or the Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine","review":"Norbert Wiener was interested in the means by which feedback could be communicated to help correct the problems that develop in an organism. In investigating this matter, Weiner investigates a number of topics that differentiate between mere computation and intelligence and the importance that information plays in both. This is the unifying theme of a book that seems to wander through many topics using philosophy, mathematics, and the theory of computation.For example, in chapter one of the book, Wiener illustrates the basic difference between man and machine with a discussion of the concept of Newtonian versus Bergsonian time. He states that Newtonian time - that of high level physics phenomena- is reversible. Bergsonian time, the time of living organisms making their way against entropy is not reversible. Thus since Newtonian time is reversible nothing \\"new\\" happens, as opposed to the irreversible time of evolution and biology in which there is always something new.He continues this idea in the chapter \\"Computing Machines and the Nervous System.\\" In it, he defines the characteristics of computing machinery. He concludes that the brain, being irreversible, is thus an analog of a single run of a machine. Wiener also points out that many problems of human metabolism and reproduction are associated with the inability to receive and organize impulses and make them effective in the outer world. Thus Weiner ultimately concludes that to live effectively is to live with adequate information.There are also chapters that are almost purely philisophical about the role of information in society. Then there are other chapters that present heavy-duty mathematics on such topics as representing a time series of known statistical parameters as Brownian motion in an attempt to solve communications problems in nonlinear situations. The mathematics in this book is presented with little or no background, so you are going to need other sources to understand what Wiener is trying to convey.In summary, if you want an interesting read on the science and philosophy of artificial intelligence and the role of the machine this is one of the best out there. It still stands the test of time after nearly sixty years."},{"Title":"Cybernetics, Second Edition: or the Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine","review":"Why is everything called \\"cyber\\" (cyberspace, cyberpunk)? Because of this book from 1948 in which Norbert Wiener, a prof at MIT, coined the phrase \\"cybernetics,\\" from the Greek word \\"kybernutos\\" meaning \\"governor.\\" If you're tired of viewing your computer as a black box (the input goes in here, the output comes out there, and something mysterious happens inside), or if you wonder if the tech world has any relation to the natural world, check out this unusual book, which is rewarding on many different levels.Find out why robotics, neural nets and artificial intelligence (AI) predate the PC and even the mainframe computer and are not a new development. Travel back to the days of the giant ENIAC when the computer seemed to be an idea on everyone's mind, simply waiting for advances in technology to make it a reality. But this very readable book goes further, as suggested in Wiener's subtitle: \\"Control and Communication in the Animal and Machine.\\" Many specialists in various fields initially opposed this book because of Wiener's interdisciplinary approach, which broke down the hard and fast walls between various disciplines.The vocabulary of this book has now become commonplace (we ask for \\"feedback\\" and refer to \\"systems\\" on a daily basis), but many of its ideas have yet to be discovered. I couldn't keep up with the math, but you don't need to to grasp the basic ideas or to enjoy Wiener's lucid and luminous style, which ranks among the best of popular science writing. Wiener also wrote a general market book, \\"The Human Use of Human Beings\\" to present some of these ideas to a wider audience. Some fifty years after its initial publication, this book still forms an inviting welcome to the machine."},{"Title":"Cybernetics, Second Edition: or the Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine","review":"This book was \\"meant to be an introductory text to the field of Cybernetics\\" according to the author. In my opinion, it is targeted to the educated lay reader. A Bachelor of Science is required to absorb 100% of the reading material. Having a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology, I am forced to skip all the mathematical equations(which sometimes goes on for pages on end). The author, Norbert Wiener, has a knack for explaining the wonders of physics, time, and quantum mechanics in verbose. I'm sure his mathematical proofs on time series are brilliant, if I only understood advanced math. I'm not going to hold my lack of knowledge against the guy, but I can only give it four stars for being unable to absorb the entirety of the book. I feel that if a book is dense in mathematics, there should be some kind of forewarning to the reader, which is why I knocked off a star. Still recommend it to that B.S graduate though!"},{"Title":"Cybernetics, Second Edition: or the Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine","review":"This was a very interesting book. It had some idiosyncrasies that prevented me from giving it a higher rating, but other than that, the subject matter and breath were fascinating enough for me to certainly recommend it to anyone with any interest in cybernetics as a broad concept.Let me first say that there were a few chapters in the beginning and end that were needlessly technical and mathematical. It isn't so much that I object to the existence of mathematical proofs in their proper context, but it seemed unnecessarily detailed for the overall purpose and thrust of the book. After working my way through a few of the demonstrations, I eventually gave up an took the author's word on the soundness of his conclusions. I think this is fair enough to do, so much so, in fact, that I started to wonder why he was making me flip past pages upon pages of dense calculus only to arrive at a summary paragraph that would elucidate the meaning of his findings. At one point he attempts to justify this technique by saying something to the effect of: it would take me much longer to put these formulae into common English, so read them for their condensed shorthand value. I, as the reader, would have been perfectly willing to let him dispose of the rigor for the sake of cleaner text. But whatever; maybe people really wanted to delve into that level of demonstration.In addition, for as direct and focused Wiener seems to be as a mathematician, his thoughts, and even his prose, seem disjointed and meandering. He quickly moves from one large concept to the next, sometimes leaving the reader reeling trying to catch up. He goes on digressions that seemed opinionated and lengthy, and, when returning to the original thread, makes no real indication that he has returned. Other times these digressions will be nearly freeform transitions between concepts, similarly lacking indication that he has departed one concept and started addressing another. That he does both of these leaves the reader wondering if the text is moving forward or looping back. I would like to think that the author was making some larger point about the nature of cybernetics though this ambiguity, but this seems doubtful to me.These criticisms are small, however, taken in relation to the positive aspects of this book. The conclusions being reached by Wiener might seem banal to a contemporary reader, but this only lends credibility to their influence. Weiner not only anticipates a great deal of the future of computing, he also strongly develops a theory of the animal (and human) as, essentially, an organic computing machine; not just the brain, but the whole organism. Early in the work, he distinguishes this position from simplistic Cartesian materialism (i.e. with respect to Descartes' conception of animals as sophisticated machines), and, instead, argues for a vitalism that explains the soul as a material concept. It is non-symmetrical feedback, as unfolding through time, that makes the system seem vital as opposed to mechanical, and it is this level of complexity that makes the behavior of animals and humans seem so radically different than the motions of planets or pendulums.The remainder of the work goes on to apply the cybernetic concept of feedback to a whole range of biological phenomena and computational questions in a way that demonstrates the power of the theory and the broadness of its application. So much of what Wiener says is taken as understood in modern times that it is easy to lose sight of how striking his claims really are."},{"Title":"Cybernetics, Second Edition: or the Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine","review":"Norbert Wiener, by his own admission, was a big fan of what today might be called \\"interdisciplinary studies\\", or \\"the no-man's land between established fields\\" as he describes it. In the process of describing his past accomplishments as a sort of cross-pollinator/evangelizer of cybernetics, he makes the case for a broad educational background, as a useful alternative to the darwinian academic trend of earning a living from increasing specialization.Despite being an extremely sharp mathematician, and openly pooh-poohing the use of emipiricism and the application of maths to the social sciences, he nonetheless understood and even cared about the immense social impact of the technology (\\"technique\\" as he calls it), being developed by him and colleagues on the lay man of the future. He refers to the inevitable devaluation of future human beings, being forced to compete against computers, just as physical labor can not compete against automation (\\"...there is no rate of pay at which a US pick and shovel laborer can live which is low enough to profitably compete with a steam shovel as an excavator\\" serious aside: what does this say about the entire monetarist efforts of \\"the Fed\\" in tackling unemployment today! futility?).Ironically, for a mathematician so deeply involved in the exposition of the advanced applications of the math of group theory, thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, to signal processing and control, his broad economic and societal comments (about the role of God, the undeniable technological impulse/drive of Man throughout history, Labor Unions, Capitalist \\"Hucksters\\" etc) are the most prescient and catchy part of his work! (maybe because I am not a mathematician myself).But, these social themes are NOT what Cybernetics (2nd ed) is all about. Norbert has written many many other books solely musing over these social themes very profoundly! In Cybernetics, the preface and first chapter represent the full extent of his thoughts on this area, which he alludes to again in the second half of the book.Cybernetics, is an eclectic work with several themes or threads. The eclecticism derives from his pure genius to see common patterns emanating from what one could call the study of \\"Signals and Systems\\" applied to biological evolution, development of instinct, learning, all the way to the more commonly explored information theory, computing machines, and feedback theory. Another significant overall theme is of the utility of modern statistical approaches in the study and analysis of non linear systems, to time's arrow, thermodynamics, and evolution itself. He certainly grounds all his observations (with many amazing nuggets to be picked up by an alert reader, along the way) by alluding to rigorous if not totally un-refutable mathematics.The second chapter is the 'K2' summit of the maths to be encountered in the book (good luck). This chapter touches on topics which can be considered a good chunk of what qualifies today as standard rigorous graduate level course work in the field of signal processing in electrical engineering; for example, how fourier series are almost a second nature outcome of group theory and invariant transformations; how the ergodic theorems apply to Gibbs' statistical mechanics and indeed make noise filtering possible in communications. The next chapter goes into the development of theory of feedback and control. Then, in the rest of the book he leaves signal processing and he segues on to computation, artificial intelligence, gestalt and perception, and self replicating machines! One of the famous (infamous?) memes from this book is that \\"reality\\" is actually \\"computed\\" by humans, not observed or sensed.Strangely, the blurbs/endorsements on the back cover of the second edition showcase reviews by a very diverse (to say the least) set of mass market publications (eg. NY Times, Electronics Magazine, Saturday Review of Literature), as if this book were a fun sunday afternoon's read: \\"lucid, direct....as readable by the layman as the trained scientist\\". Yeah. I highly doubt any of the reviewers mentioned in the blurbs really read the book (much less the even more mathematical first edition). It may be a fun read for the \\"layman\\" if the layman happened to be employed as a post-doctoral research fellow in signals and communications labs, certainly. But for the rest, may i humbly recommend a prerequisite of an undergraduate engineering degree to get the perspective and thrust of ideas Wiener wants so much to impart.If you have an engineering degree somewhere, it can be a very profitable read. The only bones I have to pick are that this is an amazingly top-down book in 200 pages. Wiener tackles his subjects on from such a high conceptual level, that he can not go into the more pedestrian level which is also an extremely interesting discussion of the many themes he touches. (But then I feel no book should be more than 200 pages in today's time!) How can you drink from a fire hose? Verry carefully! But the fire hose has it's purpose too!It is also important to read this book in the context that this author represents the culmination of the knowledge of computer theory at the very point of the introduction of computers into broader society. Prior to this, they were mathematical department curiosities. Certainly WW2 played a part. Then there is a strange leap to the \\"Whole Earth Catalog\\" level. So from a historical perspective and to understand historical milieu it is also a significant work."},{"Title":"Cybernetics, Second Edition: or the Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine","review":"This is a seminal work by Norbert Wiener,genius mathematician, who was a child prodigy who recieved his PhD from Harvard at 18, then denied a faculty postion because he was Jewish in 1936. He was a generalist, however, having first studied Zoology and philosophy; later psychology. He was absolutely prescient in his predictions about the sociopolitical outcome of Cybernetics a term that he coined himself. Cybernetics is automation, using feedback loops, that has led to robotics and machines making machines and leaving unemployment behind. Wiener predicted our current state of affairs in Cybernetics as well as in his sequel, Human Uses of Human Beings. It is a robustly readable book if one must skip the few mathematical formulas and milk it for its social implications. He discusses the coming concentration of media (communication), loss of local media, and the propagandization of our democracy leading to war. He predicts the economic failures that have seized the Western World before and since 2008 and that call for a \\"search for novel means of distribution of wealth\\" because full employment would no longer be needed or relevant. Here is a man who was at home with contemporaries Mead, Einstein, Buckminster Fuller, Bateson. For his long range views, that valued decentralization, he was ostracised and maligned by centrists and war profiteers. This book is an essential building block for the understanding of modern social and political problems and for the beginning of solutions. It is a true classic in the humanities sense.\\"Cybernetics typically denotes the interdisciplinary study and strategic deployment of communicative control processes in \\"complex systems\\" constituted by humans, other animals, machines, and the rest of living-nature. In what follows, I wish to suggest an even broader use of this term. Cybernetics, not simply as a field of techno-science research and application, but as a term connoting the most far-reaching of ultramodern forms of social control. In this sense, I will be using the phrase, social cybernetics, to provisionally configure the fluid, high speed, and densely layered webs of communicatively driven positive and negative \\"feedback\\" which, this very moment, affect the ways you are receiving my words. This is a story of how loops of cybernetic feedback are informing the energetic ritual organization of power between ourselves and others.

Wiener was on the right track when he proposed a similar idea but unfortunately, for my case, I found too much of an outmoded mechanistic approach in his book (self-regulation instead of self-organization, for example) Nevertheless, if you have read the complexity and chaos authors and want to go back to some of the historical process that contributed, its a must read. I also find his integrating effort very valuable."},{"Title":"Cybernetics, Second Edition: or the Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine","review":"it took a fairly major effort to read this one. the texts are hard enough to understand with ancient language (its hard to find people talking about \\"computing machine\\" nowadays). Lots of math appears in this book, and there certainly they are not step-by-step. This is basically for people with a good intuitive grasp of the underlying mathematics or else there is no chance you can follow it. The style of writing also seems foreign to me (21 years old).

Mr. Gilbreth thought it would be though before he and his wife had twelve children. The book Cheaper by the Dozen is a non fiction biography written by Frank B. Gilbreth and Ernstine Gilbreth Carey.The main characters of this book are Mr. Gilbreth, Mrs. Gilbreth and their twelve children. Six of them boys and the other six girls. This book is about the adventures and stories of the Gilbreth family before Mr. Gilbreth dies. The main idea of this story to me is that you should spend your time wisely, try to get as much done as you can in life because one day your time could run out.The strong points of this book to me are when the twelve kids are getting into each others business, also when there is a lot of action going on. I think twelve to fifteen year olds would be very interested in this book, but both younger and older people will enjoy this book also. I would recommend this book to all readers. Once you have finished reading Cheaper by the Dozen and you liked it you should read Belles on their Toes, the sequel to Cheaper by the Dozen."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"First of all, this book--the true, original story--has nothing to do with the recent Steve Martin movie.This book is set in the 1920s in Montclair, NJ mainly and the father of the 12 children (11 lived, but the death of one is not mentioned in this book) is a big, jolly, eccentric and a fascinating possible-genius who works as a consultant making businesses more efficient through his motion studies.The book is a series of reminiscences as told by two of the older Gilbreth children. They recreate many episodes with full dialogue (which of course couldn't possibly be completely accurate historically) making for easy and humorous reading.I read this book for the first time when I was a young teenager. I loved it then, and it was perfectly appropriate. I re-read it 20 years later and was surprized at how many of the scenes I'd remembered from my first reading. (If only I could recall much of my schooling as well!) As an adult and now a parent (of a scant 3 offspring), I had a new appreciation for the story this time around. The Gilbreth children are tutored constantly in all manner of subjects by their talented parents, using many novel approaches. This is fascinating to me, as a parent: the teaching meathods, the team-spirit instillation, the overall vibe in a household as complex and successful as this one (the family is rich and all the children seem to have gone on to further success).This book has been translated into something like 50+ languages and its obvious why if you read it. It is everything an enjoyable book should be. The warmth, intelligence, pro-family team attitude, and wonderful humor would cheer anyone's spirit."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"From the cover, I thought the story line was the remake with Steve Martin but it was the story line that I wanted with William Powell."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"This book is hilarious.

The subject matter, the tone, the style all echo strongly of the predecessor by Clarence Day. Unfortunately, it's difficult for this reviewer to be at all objective given his perennial love for the \\"Life with Father\\" movie that predates this novel. Something about that William Powell.Suffice it to say that \\"Cheaper\\" and \\"Life\\" belong on the same shelf together and both provide us with an interesting look at family life near the turn of the century. One adds little to the other aside from detail. Cheaper wins slightly over Life with some wonderful 1920's references from Raccoon coats to bob haircuts and flappers.For now though, 23 skidoo!"},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"Famous memoir about Frank Gilbreth (a pioneer in motion study) is not only funny but interesting as a period piece; America in the 1910's. Easy reading."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"This book, although written in the mid-20th century, is a very fresh and witty true story about the Gilbreth family. It takes place from around 1900-1924. The authors have a very snappy style, and the descriptions of what this family was up to are worth your time. At some parts, I laughted until tears ran down my cheeks. The book is nothing like the Steve Martin film; it's much funnier. And a good history lesson. From the cars the family used, to the train travel descriptions, to how the family handled medical crises, readers will get a great picture of what life was like in the New Jersey suburbs (yes, that's what they sound like) in the '20s. Also, there are hysterical stories about the dating habits of young people in that era. My favorite part is a little episode about birth control - ironic, since the family had 12 kids. If you're down, read this book. You'll cheer up instantly."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"When two extremely intelligent people, become married, and begin starting a family, what do you get? An efficiency-expert for a father, a psychologist for a mother, and twelve crazy kids, who are rambunctious, yet loving at the same time. When the Gilbreth family is moved from Providence, Rhode Island, to Montclair, New Jersey, no one knows what to expect. Throughout CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN you find out just what crazy things happened to the family during their journey. From leaving kids behind at restaurants, to being mistaken for an orphanage, siblings Frank B. Gilbreth Jr. and Ernestine Gilbreth Carey, explain to us just what it was like being a family of 14. Written in 8-10 page short stories, CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN offers something for children and adults of all ages. A must-have for all looking for a heartwarming, yet hilarious, family story.NOTE: This book is NOTHING like the 2003 movie starring Steve Martin and Hilary Duff. In fact, the only similarities are the amount of children in the family. If you are looking for a novelization of the movie, this isn't it.Erika Sorocco"},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"I loved this book.

I followed it up not long after with the sequel &quot;Belles on Their Toes&quot;, also by the Gilbreths and enjoyed that one almost as much. I've since read them as an adult and was recently reminded of these books when I found the movie one morning (Cheaper by the Dozen) and watched it.

Of course, you guys ARE grown-ups, but still. Cheaper By The Dozen's my favorite book in the whole wide world.... Two words: Great book. Funny, yet serious, yet sad. It takes REAL writers to make something like it. It's like they made a concoction: a cup of funny, a pint of serious, and just a drop of sad. I've read this book so many times, it's scary. Frank B. Gilbreth, Jr., and Ernestine Gilbreth Carey lead us through this book with Daddy and Mommy Gilbreth and their twelve ducklings. Trust me, you'll love this book.P.S. Wanna say, &quot;Hi,&quot; or &quot;Your review is bogus&quot;..."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"I got copies of this and the sequel book, \\"Belles on their toes\\", when I was around 10 years old. I loved them then and still do. I just re-read them for the first time in years and was sharing some stories from them with friends who now want to borrow the books. Would you believe I was just looking them up on Amazon to make sure they are still in print and can be replaced if something should happen to them while on loan to my friends? That speaks to how much I cherish them! Both books are funny, interesting, and touching.What many of the reviewers aren't mentioning is that this is a true story and the parents, Frank and Lillian Gilbreth, were pioneers in the field of motion study and the science of what has since become known as ergonomics. All through the same years they were producing 12 children, they were also running a consulting business as equal partners. That would be amazing today, but when you factor in the fact that it took place in the early 1900's, their story becomes even more incredible.The book recounts how the father believed what would work in a business would also work when it came to running a home. It's interesting and amusing to see how he used business practices to keep their family life running relatively smoothly. He also had some interesting theories in how to get kids to learn a variety of subjects with little or no effort such as listening to language records as they got ready for school in the mornings or painting morse code all over the walls of their summer home so they were surrounded by it constantly.It's truly a fun and fascinating true story. I highly recommend it for anyone around 10 years of age and up."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"It's difficult for me to imagine that the two Steve Martin movies, which I have not seen, have much in common with this lighthearted, inoffensive book. The memoir recalls the Gilbreth family during the 1910s and 1920s. It was originally published in 1948. The family's misadventures surrounding six boys, six girls, an intelligent but subservient wife and a quirky, intelligent, rotund father are simply a joy. The humor is reminiscent of a simpler, more proper time and is mildly affected by the onset of the Roaring Twenties. It is similar to the storytelling style of James Herriot's \\"All Creatures Great and Small.\\" A quick, easy read that is a perfect cure for a case of the blues."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"This has been one of my favorites since I was 13.

Didn't bother to see the movie once I found out it had nothing to do with either the book or the first movie.Part of it is sad, as other reviewers mention, but HELLO... it's non-fiction. Read the sequels. They continue the story. This was an amazing family that did very well."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"I thought this book would be long and boring, but, thankfully, I was proven wrong.

I recommend this book for all ages!"},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"Cheaper by The Dozen, written by Frank B. Gilbreth Jr. and Ernestine Gilbreth Carey, is a heartwarming story based on the truth. It involves a dozen children with two parents. The father loves motion study which is taking your actions and reducing them to not take as much time. Everything that the family does together turns out to be a lesson.This book will keep you entertained for hours. Along with entertaining, it also involves a lot of motion study. It is a way to get rid of all un-needed motions as I explained before. A example of this from the book is; \\"Is it better to stack the dishes on the table, so that you can carry out a big pile?\\" Dad asked. \\"Or is it better to take a few of them at a time into the butler's pantry, where you can rinse them while you stack? After dinner we'll divide the table into two parts, and try one method on one part and the other method on the other. I'll time you.\\". This explains that basically, everything that the family does, turns into a motion study.To make this book even better, the authors, Frank B. Gilbreth Jr. And Ernestine Gilbreth Carey are in the book. They lived through the experience and now want to share it with you. You can also tell that it took place a long time ago because in the book it states that they had one of the very few cars, and when one child was being born, their handyman, Tom, had ride on his bike to get a doctor rather than a car.To conclude, I would like to say that this book would be one to invest your time into. You will never get bored. Take my word for that."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"Cheaper By the Dozen is a classic in the tradition of the Little House books.

They lived in the U.S.A. There were twelve children, a father and his wife. This book is about how the family goes about their life. It also explains how they get along with each other. This book took place in the 1800. At the end the father has a heart attack while he is on the phone and he dies. One example of what they go through in this book is that they got a good education. The father and mother have a hard time taking care of the children. Back in those days the father was in charge. The father would say, \\"line up.\\" When he would say that the children would get in line.Back then they did not have a lot of cars. Cars were expensive then. The family had a car. They were proud of their car. They were not rich but not poor, either. They were probably very tired at the end of the day. It was interesting to read about a different family than mine that has a lot more responsibility. It is a true book. I liked the book because it had a lot of action and adventure. It had a lot of cliff hangers. It was really exciting in some parts. It even sounded like it was happening right then. My mom recommended it because she had read it and she said it was a good book to read. When I got the book I did not know that I would like it.

You get an interesting and hilarious book about family and life. Most people back in the early 1900's had rather small of average sized families. However, there was one family in particular that was rather large. \\"The more the merrier,\\" Frank Gilbreth always said. Cheaper by the Dozen by Frank and Ernestine Gilbreth, is about an abnormally large family with a mother, a father, and 12 children; six girls and six boys. Not only are Frank and Ernestine's children intelligent, but also at times trouble makers. What makes this novel so interesting is that it not only tells the story of twelve individual children but also the story of how they help and grow together as a family.This book takes place in Montclair, New Jersey in the early 1900's. I think that I found it a little more interest in this book because Montclair is close to where I live. If the setting was in a different state I probably wouldn't be able to relate to such details like the weather and area where they live. Also, when you have 12 children, I believe it would be better to have more open land and not as many busy streets like in New York. If the setting were different then the story would have changed because of the location. This is why I believe the area or setting is more reasonable in Montclair, New Jersey than in a busier area like a city.One of the main characters in this book is Frank Gilbreth, the father. Frank is an over-achiever, even with his children. He is always pushing his kids into getting good grades, and even skipping grade levels. Frank and his wife Ernestine raise their children by discipline and rewards when they have good behavior. Frank believes in sometimes punishment and Ernestine agrees with him throughout the story. This story is very understandable and believable because it deals with real life situations such as the natural brother and sister arguing. What also makes this book interesting is that the author uses details such as how the father takes such interest in his job (Motion Study Director) that he brings it home. He tries to see how much faster he could make (for example) washing the dishes. Throughout the book author keeps a steady plot, there is not really any twists or surprises until the end. However, even though the ending is surprising, it makes the story unexpectable. The ending was the most interesting part because you did not see it coming, however the ending made the book tie in at the end. I enjoyed the book especially with the unexpected conclusion.My favorite characters from the book are two of the main characters, Frank Gilbreth and Ernestine Gilbreth, mother and father. Frank is a rather tall man who dresses nicely, is successful, a Motion Studies Director, and a proud father of 12 loving children. Ernestine is a average sized woman who agrees with Frank most of the time, and rarely believes in punishment. She is also a proud mother and wife. The main character, Frank, changes by the end of the story because he realizes that the children always try their hardest on what they do including school work. Also, I felt like I could relate to what Frank does towards the end of the book. Anne, one of the oldest girls, is asked to prom by a guy from her school. Frank is unsure about this boy so he goes to the dance, with Anne and her date. To me, this is something I can relate to because it sounds like something my dad might do.This book was very enjoyable and interesting. Some lessons I learned from this book are to appreciate the things you have. For example, the children have certain hammy downs and clothes that they have to wear. Also, with all of the children in the house not everyone gets their own personal time with their parents or other siblings. This easy flowing novel is a great book for middle school children to relate to because it deals with some of the problems people do too! I really enjoyed this book and would love to read more novels with this kind of plot or by the same author. I can't wait to pick up another Frank Gilbreth book!

It already had historic overtones then, and it seems even more historic today.CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN (a reference to the number of children in the Gilbreth family) accurately represents life in America in the early years of the 20th Century, a simpler time in every way.Reading this autobiography by siblings Frank Gilbreth and his sister, Ernestine Carey, one is reminded of those values that combined together to make the United States the greatest country in the history of the world.The book also transmits a sense of the fun it was to be part of a large family in those long-ago days, and the pride--even the complacency--that came with being citizens of this nation.The original movie made from this book follows the family faithfully; the recent feature film has nothing to do with the real-life Gilbreth family, other than its title.So, read CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN and take a trip to a nicer time now far, far away."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"i just finished reading this delightful book by two of the twelve gilbreth children. to be able to put faces and emotions to the Gilbreth family was a pleasant experience. to know that the head of this hilarious household improved the modern keyboard format and typing classes that could &quot;teach anyone in two weeks&quot; and still kept his sense of humor, love of family and wits about him while raising 12 children is heartwarming and endearing. when you read this book youll be whisked away to a time when life was simpler and happier and wish you could experience it."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"This book is the best book I have ever read. I own it and have read it many times. It kept me interested from the first page and you will not want to put it down. It is about a family of 12 children. Their dad is always thinking of new ways to save time and he thinks that he can teach him and his children anything. The family likes to play practical jokes on eachother and are always having a good time. This book is very interesting and never gets boring."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"Excellent reprint of the 1940's classic with an interesting new foreword by Ernestine that brings us up to date wrt the main characters (particularly siblings.) Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"I had seen the film version many years ago but had no idea that it was based on a real family.I really enjoyed this book and was fascinated and impressed by the parents. The book is realistic and amusing and by the end your find yourselves so involved with the family that you'll have a lump in your throat or tears in your eyes.My favourite scene is the birth control advocate meeting the family in all its glory. Brilliant."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"One of the finest pieces of children's literature written in the twentieth-century. There are books in this world that deserve to be remembered and books that do not. This book is perhaps THE funniest book of the 40s, and it is certainly one of the best. The events recounted are based in fact (with a little literary license thrown in). In real life, Frank Gilbreth was the foremost expert in the country on motion study and its effects. Transferring this knowledge to his home life, Frank attempted to raise his twelve children according to his own unique set of rules and regulations. The result was sometimes catastrophic, sometimes brilliant, and always funny.As other reviewers of this book have mentioned, this book has nothing to do with the 2003 movie starring Steve Martin. When I noticed that the poster of this movie was exhibited on the cover of this book and being sold in stores everywhere as its original inspiration, I was a little angry. The movie and the book have exactly one fact in common. Twelve children in a single family.Like all books written in the past, there are elements to this book to be aware of. There's a Chinese cook in the story that speaks broken English and occasionally reacts violently to the children. When a birth-control advocate arrives at the house, the Gilbreths take the opportunity to turn the situation humorously to their advantage. But really, in the scope of 40's children's literature, these are small potatoes. To read this book as a kid is to love it. Heck, to read the book as an adult is to love it as well. Ten stars would I give it if I could. Unfortunately, I only have five to work with."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"Cheaper by the Dozen is one of the greatest books ever. I had such fond memories of sitting in my 6th grade class after eating lunch, when my teacher would dim the lights and, in the filtering afternoon sunlight, read to his class several pages a day of a book he liked and wanted to share. Cheaper by the Dozen was one of these books. I just finished grad school and I went back and reread this, especially since I was disgusted by the remake of the movie. The story in the Gilbreth's novel is not just about a family and its crazy way of life, but it's really a commentary on life in the first half of the 20th century, when everything was changing and Dad longed to instill traditional values while using his family as a test pilot for his quirky ideas. This is something no modern update film could possibly capture. This book is the childhood every kids wishes they had. A good, old-fashioned Sunday picnic of a novel, complete with typing contests, the man from Nantucket, and an early model Ford with a mind of its own. A real gem!!!"},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"I haven't seen the new movie version with Steve Martin--I understand it has received mixed reviews and is quite different from this book. However, if the movie encourages a new generation of readers to discover this book, then hurrah for it--because this is a book worth reading. It's been years since I last read Cheaper by the Dozen, but I must have read it dozens of times as a child and adolescent. It is the story of a family with, yes, a dozen kids, growing up in the early part of the twentieth century. The father, Frank Gilbreth, is an efficiency expert who applies his theories to his built-in test group--often with hilarious results. It is an exceedingly funny book, but also touching and at times very sad. The sequel, Belles on Their Toes, carries on the story, focusing on the oldest daughters (one of whom is the author, Ernestine Gilbreth Carey). Both books were also made into wonderful movies in 1950 and 1952, starring Clifton Webb and Myrna Loy."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"When I, with only one sibling, went to my friend Cathy's house, the logistics of that household blew my mind, even though I was only about ten. Cathy was one of thirteen children. At lunchtime, Cathy's mom called out from the hammock where she was reading a magazine. She asked the oldest child to get three loaves of bread and four packages of hot dogs from the freezer and make lunch for the 15-20 (many of her own and lots of their friends) children who played in the big shady Michigan backyard. I remember stopping and staring at her. Four packages of hot dogs? Suddenly I understood why she always commandeered at least two kids to accompany her when she visited the local A&P.; Imagine the train of grocery carts...For me, reading Cheaper by the Dozen was like revisiting those Michigan afternoons. The adventures of the Gilbreth family are enduring and endearing, memories of one not-all-that-unusual huge family that muddled along at the turn of the twentieth century. Experimental industrial efficiency methods were used by the parents, so the household hummed along with the precise scheduling of an assembly-line factory. The humor is broad, the tone is generally loving, the characters are well-developed, and the numerous children manage (mostly) to emerge as individuals both in life and in the telling.Cheaper by the Dozen remains a classic and can still be enjoyed by people of all ages. It's actually a good one to read aloud to your own modern little family of 3 persons."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"The real Frank and Lillian Gilbreth were much more interesting than the Bakers that were portrayed in the recent movie.This book was written by some of the older members of the Gilbreth clan, so it has plenty of good, old-fashioned laughs. No (real) violence and no sex makes it a great read for all ages. Although the book switches back and forth between years in the lives of this remarkable family, it is altogether well-written. You will want more stories of the Clan long after you finish this quick read."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"Cheaper by the Dozen is a well written biography on the Gilbreth family and all the craziness they go through every day with such a big family. This large family consists of 12 children and a set of parents. All 12 kids-Fred, Dan, Anne, Bob, Bill, Frank, Martha, Lil, Ernestine, Jack, Jane and Mary-all have red or blonde hair and lots of freckles. My favorite character was Mr. Gilbreth. This story took place in Mont Clair, New Jersey and i think that was a very appropriate setting. My favorite part in the book was when Mr. Gilbreth would not let Anne and Ernestine wear make-up, high heels or short skirts. I also liked when the Gilbreths went to California to visit Mrs. Gilbreth's family. There are many more good parts, but you will need to read the book or listen to it on tape to find out about them. What i liked best about the story is that it was pretty funny. I would reccomend it to any one who likes books written with a sense of humor. There isn't any real plot or climax to this story, but that may be one of the reasons I liked it so much. It flows very well and the only confusing part is all of the characters. Overall, it was a pretty good book."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"I would definitely recommend this book to readers. It is very funny and clever because of the colorful conversations of a family of 12 kids and two adults. What I really liked about it was how they were always trying to find new ways to make their lives more efficient, by doing two things at once like brushing their teeth while learning a language or shaving with two razors. The only thing I didn't like was how their father died in the end.I also liked the family's car, the Silver Arrow, which managed to seat the kids and the adults. Another thing I liked (the most) was the family's father who was constantly making jokes and trying to manage the family.Overall, it's one of the best books I've ever read."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"A book that I have read no less than 10 times. It's entertaining and insightful and really a timeless story (although part of its charm is the historical information it provides too). It deals with subjects like family closeness, female empowerment, importance of education, and the loss of a loved one, all with humorous anecdotes and touching stories. As a book that I read both as a child and an adult, I was suprised at things I had missed (or where over my head) in past reads and how much I still enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"Most people wouldn't agree with me, but I found reading the story depressing. From my parents' generation and beyond, they're hardly had anything. So as I was reading, I would think of what my grandparents were doing during the time that the Gilberths are laughing away and watching the movies. I gave it a four because it is pretty good and funny, and the way it makes me feel is only to me."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"Checked this out in my local library and funny enough it was in the children's section. We had listen to it before but our old radio would fade in and out while we listen to it painting. So, later when we had the chance again (now it was found in the adult section) so this time we would listen to it in the car, I was a bit shocked at the language on it. Even my 11 year old stated there was a *allot of cussing* on this tape. The stories are funny enough without the hard language. This tape/cd has no rating on it. It should be at least PG-13 to give parents a heads up for a younger listeners."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"Overall the book was good. I thought Cheaper by the Dozen by Frank B. Gilbreth was a funny book. I would highly recommend it to everybody bacause it is a good book. The reason I would recommend it to everybody is because it doesn't set a bad influence on little kids. This book is a very good book."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"I'm more into a different genre than this book. I thought it was really really boring. It probably didn't appeal to me because I don't have 11 siblings or 12 children and because it was set at a totally different time than I can relate to. Hardly anyone anymore has 12 kids! I thought that the parents had good intentions for having a big family, but to put that kind of pressure on them to skip school and hope that your younger sibling didn't skip to your grade wasn't the best idea."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"The reason why I said that is because I would have thought they would have made their lives more accurant to me. And to me one of the kids were talking and that just mad it more confusing. But I would recommend it to someone who like looking at other peoples lives."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"The book Cheaper by the Dozen was alright. The good part about the book is how it is real story about there life and it really happened. The writers of the book were part of what happened. I gave it three stars because it wasnt worth 5 stars but people should still read it. Its about family problems and it is very heartfelt."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"I loved this movie as a child and thought my six year old and I would listen to the book on cassette. I was not prepared, nor did I remember, the use of language in the movie. The third time I heard the Lord's name taken in vain, I turned the cassette off. I am going to buy the book and read it to my son, skipping those parts. I guess when I watched the movie (many moons ago) that language was not allowed on television and therefore we were not subjected to it. I was very disappointed in the book on tape. The story is wonderful. The authors (two of the children) could have alluded to the language without repeating it. I rate it two stars because of this."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"I did not like Cheaper by the Dozen because it did not grab my attention at all. I do not like reading about the life of a large family where the father ties to teach the kids everything, or showing off in front of a bunch of people. I also do not believe anything of this story is realistic. Do you think someone now of days can handle 12 kids? I do not think so. Now of days things are more expensive, so think how wealthy someone has to be to maintain a house, work, and still have time to spend with each child and buy things you need in the household. And do you think the dad has time, with work to teach each child all the different things. I think you would like this book if you are interested in stories about everyday life with a big family and the parents tutoring 12 kids and go on vacations. Or if you want to know what life was like back then and have 12 kids. Still how can they fit 14 people in a car, 9 kids in the back, 1 in the front, the mother in the passenger side with 2 babies in her lap, and the father driving the car? I was thinking how 2 adults keep 12 screaming kids under control. If you like the movie Cheaper by the Dozen with Steve Martin you might like this book even though they are really different, even the last names are different. I really did not like this book but if you want to read it go right a head."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"The book was entertaining and heartfelt. I gave only three stars because I feel very strongly about overpopulation being a global epidemic. Still it is worh reading."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"I loved this book so much! I MIGHT read Belles On Their Toes, but I'm afraid it won't be as good."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"this is by favorite book of all times! it's so funny, if you havn't read it you should definitly buy it and read it!"},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"I read about the Gilbreths (a family of 12 children) when I was in elementary school and LOVED it!

There is two versions of the book and a movie based on the books. Although the movie and books are a little different, people of all ages can enjoy! Many people, even adults have read both books and saw themovie, and loved it!"},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"The book Cheaper by the Dozen by Frank B. Gilbreth jr. and Ernestine Gilbreth Carey shows how hard it is to live and raise 12 children. It also demonstrates how families learn to work together in one big group. They worked through their problems by not taking everything so seriously.One way the book shows how life is a lot harder with 12 children, is by the amount of money the parents have to spend on the kids. For example, the kids clothes, their school supplies, their furniture, their sports equipment, their food and their doctor bills. The parents both have to work really hard to pay for these things and more. The father is able to work through problems without being stressed, and instead of making them serious, he makes them humorous.The book illustrates how the family works together in a group. For example, the family is able to clean the house in a quicker period of time than a regular family of 4 or 5, even though there is a much, much, much bigger mess to clean up. Their everyday life is full of humor and surprises.Cheaper by the Dozen is a very funny book. If you want to laugh, I recommend you read this book."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"Cheaper by the Dozen is a great &quot;read aloud&quot; book for all ages.

We are planning to read the sequel Belles on Their Toes when we have finished."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"Dear Reader,Imagine being one of 12 children. The book &#65533;Cheaper By The Dozen&#65533; was written by Frank B. Gilbreth Jr. and Ernestine Gilbreth Carey. The Gilbreth family moved from Providence, Rhode Island to Montclair, New Jersey. In this story the dad, who was an efficiency expert, loved jokes, especially when they were on him. The mom was on a lot of church related committees. She didn&#65533;t like to go to church on Sundays, because she spent so much time there during the week, but she made everyone in the family go anyway. The church had her recruit newcomers for committees. If people tried to say they didn&#65533;t have time because of their kids, she would say she had time with 12 kids. The mother always thought all the kids were individual people. On the other hand, the dad thought they all were one giant unit and had to stay together. The story is about their life and what happens. I recommend this story to teenage audiences because of strong language.By Tommy A.K.A. EGGDUDE"},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"This book was great!! We read it for 8th grade Language arts, and I absolutely loved it! It is very funny, and the stuff that happens is so wacky that you have to remind yourself that this is a true story.

But it had its humor points and all-in-all the book wasn't bad. The Gilbreths' childhood is a memorable one, and if you're the kind that love humourous bios, then this is the book for you!

A hilarious comedy about a family with a dozen children. You join them on Sunday rides through the country, battles in family court, summers at the sea, Father's theories on motion study, having their tonsils out, plus so much more. I loved it. Guarenteed to make you laugh and maybe cry. Kids and adults will enjoy listening to it together...."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"This book kept me interested ever since I started reading it! It is funny and entertaining book for young readers. It is about a family of fourteen who learn how to live and work with each other! They go through things together including getting their tonsils removed and much more! It starts out with the parents getting married and having their first child a year after the wedding. The book talks about every day living together,dealing with each other,and growing up together. They make movies together and travel across the country together.They visit relatives in California and Oregon and play very dirty tricks on them. This is also a sad and touching book. The children deal with losing their father and almost losing their brother. This a very readable book and i recommend this book to any reader!"},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"Cheaper by the dozen was a funny book about a family that had 12 children: 6 boys 6 girls. Set in the early 1900's, it is written by two of the children. My wife and I laughed on a regular basis as I read it to her. I guess the reason it was so funny is because we could see the stuff happening in our family. Although there is an occasional profanity (thus I won't let my children read it until they are older), it is ONLY occassionally. Some of the ideas that the father had I have implemented in my family. Although seemingly written for younger readers, it is enjoyable for adults (probably more so for adults)."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"Cheaper by the Dozen is a good book for children who like true stories. It is about a family of 14 people and 12 of them are children. My favorite character is Frank. I like Frank because he is independent. The funniest part of the book is when they find Mikes athletic cup in the dish washer. You should read Cheaper by the Dozen."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"Cheaper by the Dozen, written by Frank Gilbreth Jr. and Ernstine Gilbreth Carey, was published in 1963. I found this charming story to be captivating, motivational, heartwarming, and humorous. It was written with outstanding ethics and a casual historic format (the book was based off of a true story). The story was coiled around the father of twelve children, Frank Gilbreth Sr., who was in the business of \\"motion study\\" which he was very good at. Motion study was said to be finding the way to make-work quicker and more efficient. The day that Frank had proudly taken his wife's hand in marriage he had told her that he wanted to have 12 children, 6 boys and 6 girls. The tale was a telling of how the young couple got to that point and what happened from there. Three of this books main aspects which added to its splendor were the emotions portrayed, the experiences shared with the reader, and the originality of the whole anecdote. I would easily recommend this story of family love, trail and success to any person.This book was an emotional story of a large family and its path. I found there to be many emotions that were experienced while reading the book. Many emotions were such that made you react and think. Frank had a very evident pride of his family which was touching to the reader and showed much character. This was shown more than once when he had a business partner over and \\"whistle assembly\\" to show how fast his children could present themselves. The ending was a sad and unexpected one that didn't give an immediate positive impression on the book. The ending, which I will not give away, was shocking to me but it caused a realization of how strong and together the families was through good and hard times. Emotions portrayed played a large role in the theme of the story and added much to the end product.Experiences of the Gilbreth family were spectacular and gave the book a large amount of character and individuality. Though there were several events throughout the story that I could relate to the incidents which I couldn't relate to were fun to learn about. Throughout the plot I was constantly entertained by the idea of having 11 siblings, which I have obviously never experienced before. The aspect of unusual experiences added an unexpected flavor to the book and gave it a stand out quality. At one point in the book the family was taking a road trip and was mistaken for an orphanage because of their uniform behavior and the families reaction added comedy to the scene that made it unforgettable. Often in the story the authors would give many examples and details giving the reader an inclusive feel that you don't often find with books. The addition to the book of multiple experiences, some out of the ordinary and others everyday, put a positive influence on the book Cheaper by the Dozen.Originality was the part of the text that made the book irresistible, the type of book that you can't put down. Several times I found myself being amazed at the setting of the story. It was so different in every way that it was for me contrary to everyday life. Another aspect of the story was that the authors were so open and detailed in their writing that the reader felt compelled to learn more about the family and what they are like now. The quality of originality found in this book has caused the book to stand out in my mind, and alter my actions for the better in areas such as time management. If the book had been blas&eacute; it would not have been the success that it truly was.Cheaper by the Dozen was a humorous story that was a joy to read and share with others. The book, contraire to others that I have read, was entertaining. I walked away feeling as if I had received advice from a close relative who had an interesting tale to tell. This book comes highly recommended from me to anyone who has a desire to read something worthwhile and wholesome with a flare of comedy."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"Frank Gilbreth, a man of great pride and confidence, always sought the respect and attention of everyone and always looked to stand above the crowd. Frank Gilbreth Jr. and Ernestine Gilbreth Carey write a comic-filled Cheaper by the Dozen to tell of all the adventures of growing up in a family of fourteen. There is no other man more capable of raising twelve children than Frank Gilbreth. Being a world-famous efficiency expert, Frank often used the children as guinea pigs to test out his different theories. He put the newborn baby Anne into the bathtub because he thought newborn babies could instinctively swim. When Anne could not swim he took her out of the tub and looked at the nurse and said, \\"Now if it had been a boy.\\"His ability to never show a sign of weakness helped to keep him one step ahead of his children. It is one laugh after another as Mr. Gilbreth tries to control his circus of children. With each adventure you can't help but fall more in love with the Gilbreth family. Cheaper by the Dozen is a classic tale of fond memories of growing up in early America, but like the Gilbreth family, continues to stand above the rest."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"I can't imagine living with twelve brothers and sisters and getting along!

It is a bit better than the movie version, and light years above the stage version. The stories of a family living with an efficiancy expert is funny enough, the fact that there are 12 kids (well, actually 11 b/c one dies of diptheria when she is really young) makes it all the funnier. Unfortunatly, this book is rather dated as is apparent by he considerable racism. (The Parents perform a minstrel show for their children, anything taboo is deemed &quot;eskimo,&quot; the sterotypical portrayel of a chinease cook, etc.) Fortuately, this parts are easiyl skipped over, though they really should be cut. Read this book, it is genuinly touching and has some nice lessons about family, but I would recommend editing it before you share it with impressionable young children."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"Hello I grew up in a family with six kids. That may or may not be huge family to you. When I first read this book I was about fourteen. I couldn't put it down!!!The new movie STANK!!! I didn't even go see it! Did not follow the book at all! And the book was a true story!The father is a big man and made his money by saving people time. For example doctor's in surgery now use the nurse's to pass them their tools, look at your keyboard he put the letters in their postion,and there might have been a new way to remove tonsils, but that is a story you'll have to read in the book.The mother grew up in a rich family. She was easily frightend but she wasn't a scardy cat either. She went along with the father's ideas and fully supported him.The kids all learned the value of time. They also loved pratical jokes and were like any other kid. The older girls were embarrassed by their little siblings.Well I really enjoyed the book!

It is the humorous story of a mother and father, who is a motion study expert. Together they raise a dozen children. It has funny anecdotes about their real life and all the crazy things they do. The father is always testing his motion study on the kids, and what happens is always hilarious. It also tells about their maritime adventures every summer in Nantucket. Though this family goes through many scrapes and quarrels, they are resilient and always persevere.I love this book and would recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor wishing for a funny book. This book dominates my top ten list of books."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"Cheaper by the Dozen, by Frank B. Gilbreth, is an excellent book because is makes people who read it laugh. For example, one time father yells at the people on the sidewalk and calls them funny names. The reason this is so funny is because you don't often see grown men yelling at each other in public. Then there is the time that Lillian bobbed her hair on her own. This is funny because the results are disastrous. This book should be read by all middle-schoolers who enjoy a good laugh."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"The Gilbreth Family is a delight to read about. The Gilbreths have 12 children and the father runs his family like a well oiled machine.

As you learn about the highlights of growing up with the Gilbreth family you will find many laugh out loud moments and feel a part of this large and loving family.

I was struck, however, with how arcahic much of the language and many of the concepts seem in the nineties, and I was glad to be able to explain them as we went along.

Around that era and before then, large families like the Gilbreth's was not as unusual as you may think. But not many had the unique upbrining of motion studiers. The information that Mr. Gilbreth conveyed to his very lucky children made their lives complete. And may I commend Mrs. Gilbreth, on her liveliness and spirit, and all the energy she had to have to raise 11 children all alone (with alltile help from Tom of course!) And the way all the children managed so well to economize and forfeit some of their pleasures for each other shows strong character and love to the roots. Any good writer could make up a story like this one, but what gives this one charm and shine is the reality of it all. These things really happened! It is amzing to witness the love and adventure of the Gilbreth house."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"This book is amazing! I couldn't wait to read what would happen next!

We used to listen to it when I was a kid on long car trips.It is a shame the used the title for the movies, causes a lot of confusion."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"One of the best books I read in my childhood. I read it many times, and though I was regaled at the adventures of 12 brothers and sisters, I incidently learned much about the early 1900's in the U.S. Everything from the father's life direction of \\"Motion Study\\" being pivotal in the development of assembly lines, to his hand in the beginnings of \\"touch typing,\\" to how it feels to ride in a Packard or to be six sisters dressed all alike in \\"dusters\\" makes this book a fascinating trip back in time. While the modern movie with Steve Martin is a sweet and funny look at family life, the original story is a cross-section of both family life and American history."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"As I read this book, I was laughing so hard I think I disturbed the neighbors. I often had to force myself to put it down. Frank B. Gilbreth, Jr. and Ernestine Gilbreth Carey tell a story like no other, and they have mastered the art of humor in this narrative of Frank Gilbreth, Sr.'s family of twelve children that were raised under a strict system of efficiency.1. Efficiency: the Ultimate ValueThe ultimate value held up throughout the book by Frank Gilbreth, Sr., the patriarch of the family, is efficiency. Why so much faith placed in efficiency? The book concludes with the answer. Someone once asked Frank, Sr.: \\"But what do you want to save time for? What are you going to do with it\\" Frank answered, \\"For work, if you love that best ... For education, for beauty, for art, for pleasure ... For mumblety peg, if that's where you heart lies\\" (p. 180).What did this efficiency look like? The book gives numerous examples of the division of chores, of cutting down one's motions in effecting a task, and efficient education, and the like. For example, Frank Sr. once demonstrated how to take a bath in the time it would take for one French or German record to play: \\"Dad would sit in the tub and put the soap in his right hand. Then he'd place his right hand on his left shoulder and run it down the top of his left arm, back up the bottom of his left arm to his armpit, down his side, down the outside of his left leg, and then up the inside of his left leg. Then he'd change the soap to his left hand and do the same thing to his right side. After a couple of circular strokes on his midsection and his back, and some special attention to his feet and face, he'd duck under for a rinse and get out\\" (p. 34). He even found ways to educate efficiently. \\"Since Dad thought eating was a form of unavoidable delay, he utilized the dinner hour as an instruction period\\" (p. 39). Efficiency applied not only to finding ways to save on time, but also to finding ways to stretch the value of money. \\"One purchasing committee found a large department store which gave us wholesale rates on everything from underwear to baseball gloves. Another bought canned goods directly from a manufacturer, in truckload lots\\" (p. 31-2).I would agree with the vision of Frank Sr., and his desire to see nothing go to waste. I would even go as far as to say that as a direct result of reading this book, I have begun to adjust the way I do things in order to free up more time for doing what I love best: reading, playing the cello, etc. Yet taken to the extreme, holding up efficiency as the ultimate value of a family may deprive it of its humanity. One has the vision of children lined up before the school principle shouting out the answers to multiplication algorithms on demand (p. 40), leaving the children looking like talking calculators without souls.2. The Value System of Frank Gilbreth, Sr.What surprised me most about the book was that, although the only real articulated value of the family was efficiency, there were times when Frank Sr. would behave otherwise. For example, there is no explanation in my mind as to why he so adamantly opposed the girls when they wanted to use makeup or bob their hair. One may make the argument that he opposed makeup because it took time, but bobbing one's hair, by his and Lillian's (the matriarch of the family) own admission, was a more efficient hairstyle that required less combing. With these questions, something else was going on in the back of Frank's mind. It has something to do with modesty, I believe, and his wanting to protect his daughters from falling prey to lustful glances, yet the book does not give us details on this part of Frank's psychology and whether his thinking and behavior was ever at all linked to a transcendental worldview. We know that Frank Sr. had a distaste for priests, whom he saw as bandits in disguise, yet it is not clear if he believed in any transcendent being. There are occasional references to God (e.g., \\"I give nightly praise to my Maker,\\" p. 31), but it is not clear whether these were made in sarcasm or seriousness.3. CritiqueThere were some parts of the book that I feel left me with a slightly empty feeling. The beginning of the book depicts a Frank Sr. whom the reader can't not love. He is charming, great with kids, and always has a treat in his pocket for the first one to answer a pop question. He engages all of the children during his surprise visits to the school and is a true master of his environment. He is funny and loveable.Yet after the last child is born, there is a change in Frank Sr. He is no longer the same funny, enthusiastic father of an increasingly large family. He loses some of his luster and we begin to even find some of the dark points of the book, like when one of the girls comes down to the dinner table with a hairstyle that he forbid her from having, a fight breaks out, and Lillian bursts out into tears. These stories left me sad as I thought about the lost innocence of all of the children in the first hundred pages of the book. Perhaps deleting the inevitable family quarrels would have created a fictitious image of a perfect family, but it would have been a happier story."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"It was written in a time that was really trying to point out the ways to save time and money.

I was happy to see a copy of a novel I had read as a young girl.Thanks,"},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"Frank B Gilbreth, Sr. was an American original, known in his own day as an efficiency expert and still remembered because of his \\"motion study\\" methods. He is, in addition, still loved, because two of his children wrote about him in this book.He was unquestionably a Trial to his children, painting messages in Morse Code on the walls, putting record players and foreign language records in the bathrooms and driving around with his huge brood of children in the car shouting embarrassing remarks to passersby. Not only does he sound like enormous fun, but after a childhood like that one would be prepared for anything the world tossed at you.This is a great book, especially for the hard times that are facing the world. It reminds us that there are fabulous ways to have fun without being hooked up to some electronic device. It shows how creativity can make money go a little further. Maybe love, ingenuity and the willingness to try will get a family through, especially if they stick together. A great book, so why only four stars? Because the sequel BELLES ON THEIR TOES, is even funnier and better."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"After losing the 2nd copy of \\"Cheaper\\" I decided to try again -- My wife got this as one of her Christmas Presents and is extremely well pleased."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"I don't know why they would put a picture from the recent movie on the cover of this classic book...it had NOTHING to do with this book.

This is one to read out loud to the kids. They will laugh and laugh...and so will you. :^)"},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"\\"Cheaper by the Dozen\\" is a wonderful, entertaining portrayal of life in the early part of the last century, combined with universal themes about family life that today's readers can very much relate to. As a member of a family of 10 children from New Jersey growing up in the middle of the twentieth century, this book about a large family from New Jersey in the early twentieth century particularly resonated with me. It was and still is one of my favorites. Frank and Lillian Gilbreth, were pioneers in scientific management and engineering, and this book portrays their entertaining adventures in applying these techniques to the raising of their 12 children. After not having read \\"Cheaper by the Dozen\\" in over twenty years, I recently read it again with my teenage son, and thoroughly enjoyed it - even more so than I had as a child, with the added perspective of parenthood. It is highly entertaining, and I literally had tears in my eyes I laughed so hard in certain sections.The book is written by two of the Gilbreth \\"dozen\\". Its anecdotal style is mostly light and entertaining, and a certain amount of poetic license was taken in writing about actual events. It should not be viewed as a completely accurate historical biography of the Gilbreth's, nor was that the intent. (If you are looking for that I would recommend \\"Time Out for Happiness\\", by Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Jr., and \\"Making Time\\" by Jane Lancaster, both of which are generally available. Internet searches will also lead you to lots of additional information, pictures and even some film footage of the Gilbreths.)Although sometimes portrayed as a book appropriate for children, I would not recommend this book for pre-teens for a number of reasons. First off, some of the language (although relatively mild by today's standards) as well as issues discussed (such as those hinted at and referenced in stories about the older daughters dating) are really not appropriate for pre-teens. Secondly, and my only real criticism of the book, is that there a few portions and references which were acceptable by the standards of 1948 when this book was published, but would now be considered less appropriate and insensitive: a small section containing a stereo-typical portrayal of a Chinese cook, a brief mention of the parents putting on a minstrel show to entertain the children (which went over my head as a teenage reader), and the referral by Mrs. Gilbreth to off-color language as \\"Eskimo\\". These are reflective of the time period, but a bit of guidance for younger readers on these issues might be useful (for my son, I used these as \\"teachable moments\\" regarding how standards have changed). I still highly recommend the book as an entertaining, fun read both for teenagers and adults."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"This is a story about family. It is funny in a gentle way. Family values, respect , and good-natured fun are featured in this period piece. Bothe mother and father are efficientcy experts who believe that having a dozen children is most efficient. The humor comes from the situation of having twelve children and all that it entails."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"First the confession: I had a role in the Roosevelt Middle School production of Cheaper by the Dozen in 1972. Rereading this young adult classic, I was struck by three things. One was the amount of stagecraft that any parent puts into his parenting, whether conscious or not. To our children, we are larger than life, even when we are embarrassingly insignificant. Two, modern management was invented by ambitious engineers like Frederick Taylor and Frank Gilbreth. And three, the technological changes that happened a hundred years ago were at least as significant as the ones of the last decade. There was one technology that the book mentions that didn't survive the Darwinism of the marketplace. Who knew that you could put whistle on the exhaust pipe of a car, the same way you do on a teakettle?"},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"I was watching the attractions for the Steve Martin version of Cheaper By the Dozen and thinking that it looks like the only element they kept from the book was the title and having 12 kids. I really haven't read the book since..... 6th grade? It was my favorite book then. I decided to re read it and it's still really funny. I mean laugh out loud funny. The rest is a charming look at life in a different time.It's just a wonderful story about Frank and Lillian Gilbreth (I believe he started motion study and invented touch typing, she was a psychologist) and their 12 children growing up around the turn of the century everything in the household is about learning and responsibilty to gently instill responsible behavior in the children as they grow to adulthood. That said I really loved the bit where the wife leaves him with the kids and when she returnes he says he only had problems with that one over there, but I spanked him and that worked it all out and she says he's not one of theirs."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"The book Cheaper by the Dozen by Frank B. Gilbreth Jr. and Ernestine Gilbreth Carey is a remarkable book about a family with twelve children. This book is full of memoirs from the Gilbreth family. The authors of this books are two of the children in the family, which makes the book even more interesting and exciting. The stories in the book are about the family as a whole, not just the authors Frank and Ernestine. These twelve lively kids make the book fun to read and I loved reading the variety of stories that made their lives memorable. Every child is so unique that by the end of the story, I was able to tell apart the children just by hearing what they did or what they said. I really felt that I was part of the family by the end of the book!"},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"I first read this book at the age of 9. I read it so much in the following years that the pages began falling out and eventually had to throw it away. Whether you are 9 or 90, I think you will find this an enjoyable story about a family who lived when life was simpler. They may not have had much money but they more than made up for it with love and laughter."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"Cheaper by the Dozen, written by Frank Gilbreth Jr. and Ernstine Gilbreth Carey, was published in 1963. I found this charming story to be captivating, motivational, heartwarming, and humorous. It was written with a casual historic format. It was based on a true story and reflected outstanding personal ethics. The story was coiled around the father of twelve children, Frank Gilbreth Sr., who was in the business of \\"motion study\\" which he was very good at. Motion study was said to be finding the way to make-work quicker and more efficient. The day that Frank had proudly taken his wife's hand in marriage he had told her that he wanted to have 12 children, 6 boys and 6 girls. The tale was a telling of how the young couple got to that point and what happened from there. Three of this books main aspects which added to its splendor were the emotions portrayed, the experiences shared with the reader, and the originality of the whole anecdote. I would easily recommend this story of family love, hardships and success to any person.This book was an emotional story of a large family and its path. I found there to be many emotions that were experienced while reading the book. Many emotions were such that made you react and think. Frank had a very evident pride of his family which was touching to the reader and showed much character. This was shown more than once when he had a business partner over and \\"whistled assembly\\" to show how fast his children could present themselves. The ending was a sad and unexpected one that didn't give an immediate positive impression on the book. The ending, which I will not give away, was shocking to me but it caused a realization of how strong and together the family was through good and bad times. The emotions portrayed by the characters played a large role in the theme of the story and added much to the end product.Individuality and character were expressed by the Gilbreth families' experiences. The occasions that I couldn't relate that I read about to were fun to learn about. For example, I was constantly entertained by the idea of having 11 siblings, which I have never experienced. The aspect of unusual experiences added an unexpected flavor to the book and gave it a stand out quality. Often in the story the authors would write many examples and details giving the reader an inclusive feel, like you're actually experiencing the event, that you don't often find with books. The addition to the book of multiple incidents, some out of the ordinary and others everyday, put a positive influence on the book Cheaper by the Dozen.What made the book irresistible for me was its originality. It made it into the type of book that you have to keep reading. You can't put it down until you're finished. Several times I found myself being amazed at the setting of the story. It was so different in every way that it was for me contrary to everyday life. Another aspect of the story was that the authors were so open and detailed in their writing that the reader felt compelled to learn more about the family and what they are like now. The quality of originality found in this book has caused the book to stand out in my mind, and alter my actions for the better in areas such as time management. If the book had been blas&eacute; it would not have been the success that it truly was.Cheaper by the Dozen was a humorous story that was a joy to read and share with others. The book, contrary to others that I have read, was entertaining. I walked away feeling as if I had received advice from a close relative who had an interesting tale to tell. The last several lines of the book, where a reporter asked Frank Gilbreth Sr. why he wanted to save time and what he used his spare time for, really caused me to react emotionally because they put a finishing coat on the book that couldn't have been done better. This book comes highly recommended from me to anyone who has a desire to read something worthwhile and wholesome with a flare of comedy.This is what Frank Gilbreth Sr. said in reply to the reporter's question:\\"For work, if you love that best...For education, for beauty, for art, for pleasure...For mumblety-peg, if that's where your heart lies.\\""},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"Cheaper by the Dozen - By Frank and Ernestine Gilbreth\\"Cheaper by the Dozen\\" is the autobiography on the Gilbreth family. What makes the Victorian-era family so remarkable is that there were twelve children, all red-headed, and more remarkably, they were born in just a seventeen year span.In the early 1900's, the future parents of the children, Frank and Lillie, married. On the honeymoon to California, Lillie asked her husband jokingly how many children they should have.The response was, \\"Let's sell out for a dozen. No less.\\"The book is written by Frank Jr and Ernestine Gilbreth, but the point of view is from all the children.Life in the household was never dull by any standards. Although it would seem the children would make all the noise, it was usually Frank, who loved being with children and playing games and jokes, sometimes even more than the kids. But most of all, he was proud of his family.\\"How can you afford so many kids?\\", a stranger would ask.Frank would say, \\"They come cheaper by the dozen, I guess.\\"The personality of their father kept the kids sane and well behaved throughout the years of regulations.But it was not much longer after the oldest, Anne, had attended prom that Frank's long battle with a bad heart started catching up on him. He had known about this problem for several years, but had kept the pressure off his children. The idea of his death was so far-fetched to the minds of the 12 kids that on a sunny Saturday morning when their mother informed them Frank has passed away, it took years for the news to fully sink in.Lille Gilbreth took over the successful business of industrial engineering her husband had started upon his death.Most importantly, the family stayed together throughout the years of struggle that followed the tragedy."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"I read Cheaper by the Dozen in class with my classmates and teacher.

He wants them to learn as much as possible about everything so he always finds a way to teach them new things. As an efficiency expert he made sure that everything was done in a time efficient way. It was a sin to waste time in the Gilbreth house and he was constantly coming up with new ways to save time. The Dad in the story liked to parade around and show off his kids.

Anne is the oldest,then Ernestine, Martha, and so on. They all have red hair and tons of freckles.Can you imagine having TWELVE children to look after? Mom (Lillian Gilbreth) and Dad (Frank Gilbreth) try to juggle this task. The reader would like this book because it is about a family that has a barrel of fun and adventure. The reader would also like this book because it is funny at times, but serious at the right moments. If you read Cheaper by the Dozen, you'll never regret it."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"This is a really good book. I have had the same copy since I was 11 yeas old and I am now 24. I have the hardcover edition first printing in 1948. The only problem with it is that it skips around one chapter will be when the children are older and the next seems like it is from a few yeas before. It is about a family of 12 children the father is an effencicy expert and the mother a psycologist. There are six boys and six girls. it is fun to read about their adventures and the way their father taught them. The book ends when the father dies. I have never read the second book &quot;With belles on their toes&quot; but I would like to. --sorry about the spelling."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"I have been addicted to this real life story for over 25 years. I've starred as Mother Gilbreth on stage and also directed the production. I will be directing it again because it has everything audiences want...humor, honesty,character development and bittersweet reality. It's a family show that focuses on parenting and family unity.

This book depicts the way how a big family can make their daily life more interesting. They enjoy their holidays together by playing fun and interesting games.

I remember reading it years ago, but I couldn't remember anything about it. So once my mother was finished with it, I took it and read it in a few nights.Now, as this is technically Non-fiction, I wasn't expecting Cheaper by the Dozen to be a fun read at all. Not the case. The two Gilbreth children who co-wrote this book knew how to take their childhood and put it into a form that was fun and enjoyable to read.Anything that was sad was immediately followed by something that was at least a bit uplifting, even if it was a comment such as \\"well, now it's up to me. Think you can manage here alone?\\" that was seen at the end of the book.Each chapter could be it's own stand alone short story, but when read one after another, it paints a humorous, yet somewhat strange life of 12 children-six boys and six girls-living together in a house in then early 1900s.Some of my favorite stories and life-instances are Dad teaching everyone morse code by painting it on the walls of their lake cottage, taking rides around the town in one of the earliest cars and having to fight with the car once it had stopped to get it running again, and how the eldest child, a girl, decided that she was just going to have to go get her hair cut in a bob, or else everyone younger than her would never manage to be fashionable because Dad just wouldn't allow it!Cheaper by the Dozen is a very short book, which makes it good for a bit of light reading just before bed. Just, don't expect to get to bed on time when you planned on it. The Gilbreths are very good at sucking you into their life and charming you with their tales.This book is nothing at all like the movie (indeed, the only thing they have in common is the title), and truly deserves five out of five stars."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"This riotous chronicle of an Irish-American family of 12 children proves delightful and fast reading. Written with fond memories by two of the older members of this irrepressible brood, this book presents the portrait of two remarkable parents who raise their red-headed and blond children without any concern for what the neighbors or even strangers might think. Father looms larger than life with his Motion Study business and avant garde (well--original, to say the least) methods of instructing his clan in all manner of subjects--regardless of age. From the Family Council's division of labor, to learning to type on Moby Dick (with the names of the keys removed); from cheating on the psychology test to learning navigation, astronomy and the Morse Code, the jovial, ample head of the household expects his children to be the best and to ultimately function as a loving, cohesive unit.Mere sibling rivalry pales in the face of three age groups of offspring struggling to grow up in a boisterous and even obstreprous army all under one roof. Their demure Mother never administers corporeal punishment, but is easily shocked by what she euphemistically calls \\"Eskimo\\" language (off-color or swear words). Humorous disasters occur on every page, as the family copes with astonished looks and rude comments by amazed strangers. When the three older girls start dating there ensues a new wave of social woes--when overprotective Dad insists on acting as chaperon on their dates with the young \\"shieks.\\" Despite inevitable tugs of war and attempts to outmaneuver each other--and well-intentioned relavitves--this spunky family pulls together in times of great trial. As remarkable as LIFE WITH FATHER's Clarence Day, Frank Gilbreth emerges as an unforgettable character--certain to bring smiles to readers' faces with his boundless optimism for outlandish schemes. Truly a classic for kids of all ages!"},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"Cheaper by the dozen was a good heartwarming family book. It was easy to read because it had a very good flow to it. I liked reading it because Frank Gilbreth (the dad) reminded me a lot of my grandfather. The book was mainly about the life and hardships of a family with twelve children. What I found was kind of funny was that if one of the twelve children got a cold or strep throat, within two or three days everyone else would have a cold too. Also since Frank was in the military, the family was very organized and had an assembly whistle. Overall in my opinion the book was pretty good and fun to read. I would highly recommend to book to anyone who likes a heartwarming family book."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"It is very, very rare to come across a book that is purely and simply fun to read. The reason that this book is a classic is that it has managed to be just this. This is the story of Frank Gilbreth, his wife, and their twelve children around the turn of the 20th century. If you imagine that a family of fourteen would provide many, many occasions for humor, you would be very correct. This book is an account, written by two of those twelve children, of the many interesting and humerous events which befell them growing up in such a large family. The family is made even more enjoyable and strange by the extremely unique father who was a pioneer of motion-study, and who did such things as covering the walls of their home with lessons about astronomy, morse-code, etc. It is very interesting to read, but, most of all, it is very, very fun.My only complaint is about the absolutely horrible cover on the new version. Why on earth would you use the cover from the Steve Martin movie with the same title as the cover for this book, which bears NO connection to the book except that it is about a large family? It is an incredibly tasteless and transparent attempt to cash in on Martin's popularity.Overall grade: A+"},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"When Frank and Lillian Gilbreth married, he said he wanted to have an even dozen children and Lillian was happy to oblige, having six boys and six girls. Frank and Lillian worked as efficiency experts and Frank employed efficiency techniques at home including figuring out how to shave in the quickest amount of time; how to dress as quickly as possible; having everyone in the family get their tonsils removed at the same time; and holding an Assembly Call in which he whistled and timed how long it took the family to gather together. Frank was the disciplinarian while Lillian was willing to look the other way when the children acted up. Together they had all kinds of adventures, some on land, some at sea, many of them hilarious.Written by Frank Gilbreth and Ernestine Gilbreth Carey about their childhood, \\"Cheaper by the Dozen\\" is a very funny, old-fashioned read. The father stands out among all the characters, with his strict ideas about discipline and efficiency, yet having a nice sense of humor. Some of his ideas were a bit much, like having his children skip grades to get through school faster. While Frank is larger than life (literally), his wife Lillian is a more quiet character, seemingly in the background until you realize how much control she has over her husband. With twelve children, it's hard to keep them all straight, but a few of them stand out. Bill stands out most notably, with his penchant for playing practical jokes. He has some of the funniest moments in the book - like when he turns the table on his father who liked to scare them with his car horn; almost knocking the cook in the oven; or terrorizing his Aunt Anne. The other children who stand out are oldest daughters Anne and Ernestine who have the unenviable task of dealing with their father as they start to date. The book is more stream of consciousness than chronological and it can be hard to keep track of how old the children are. The book is full of humorous events including family trips in the car which always caused people to stare; family council meetings; a visit from a woman representing birth control who had no idea how large the family was; boat trips; and a visit from a psychologist. The book also has brief biographical sketches of both Frank and Lillian, although Frank's service during World War One is barely touched on. Although the book is humorous, it still touches on the difficulties of raising a large family, notably when Lillian had to travel by train from Boston to California with seven children who were sick for much of the trip. Some parts of the book made me cringe, especially when Martha had her tonsils removed after eating a heavy meal and when Lillian, tired of waiting at the hospital for her baby to be born, walked home while in labor. Still, most of the book was very funny.\\"Cheaper by the Dozen\\" is a nice, humorous read."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"We started listening to this on tape first. Enjoyed it so much we bought the book to finish reading it out loud. 10 year old son couldn't wait and read it himself. My husband read it out loud and did the voices. What a treat!

The scene where a sly neighbor sends the unsuspecting lady from the Birth Control League for a visit is to die for."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"Cheaper by the Dozen by Frank B. Gilbreth is a classic assigned to me as part of my reading class. Reluctantly I began what I expected to be a painful experience. Having seen a movie with the same title, I assumed this book would be a waste of time, stupid and boring. Thankfully, I was wrong. Other than the same title, the book and modern version of the movie, are completely polar opposites.Gilbreth is a father of 12 during the early 1900's. He is a white collar professional whose specialty is \\"efficiency\\". In order to run this large household smoothly, Gilbreth introduces systems of operation similar to a factory within his home. This book is funny as we watch the children go through their daily grind using Father's grand plans for organization.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel and highly recommend for a quick read."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"&quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot; is a book full of warmth, love, admiration, and grief. A warning: this is nothing like the 2003 movie &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen.&quot; The only common theme is the 12 children. This story will remind you of your childhood days, if you grew up in a large family, or will remind you of one of your parents (or just make you yearn for a large family). Told in a random autobiographical format, you'll be taken through certain highlights of this family's life. What makes it a bigger treasure is that it is told by two of the Gilbreth children. If you're a fan of &quot;Life with Father,&quot; then you'll love this story. It's a snappy read, and one that should be read together by families. The last chapter is sad, and a depressing note to end on. Nonetheless, the entire time you're reading this book, you'll have a smile on your face, and a few laughs. I recommend."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"What do you get when you put together 12 children and a mother and father? You get a heart warming tale about a family of fourteen living in the late nineteen twenties, who deals with the struggles that all families go through.

It's great and funny story for all ages to read and enjoy, and anyone with a big or little family can find something to relate to the things that happen in the book. I would recommend that everybody read this book. I would give this book a four and a half star rating."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"I used to giggle over this book as a kid. It was a huge hit amongst my classmates, and we wore through several copies of Cheaper By the Dozen.The Gilbreth family of 12 kids, parented by efficiency experts Lillian and Frank, were a bit eccentric and very funny. I still can remember the line one of the kids rapped out to a guest at dinner &quot;Please, we are NOT in the mood for an organ recital.&quot; This was the standard reprimand for belching in the family and never intended for public airing.The Gilbreths were actually serious innovators of efficiency for the new factory assembly lines, figuring out the number of movements needed to complete a task and establishing a unit of work movement called the Therblig. They were also warm, funny, loving parents and their story is a good one to read out loud to kids, who invariably love this book."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"Has a story been so good that it made you laugh out loud? Well Frank B. Gilbreth and Ernestine Gilbreth Carry wrote an excellent biography of their childhood titled, &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen.&quot; It is a very funny book. It is full of all the adventures the Gilbreth family went throgh in the first two decades of the 20th century.Can you imagine having to take care of 12 kids and a dog? That would be a pretty hard job. I love reading this book especially when their father (Mr. Gilbreth) was teaching the kids Morse code. All over the house on every wall was Morse code. The kids had to find out what they said. Some would say, &quot;Go to my room and under my bed is a deck of cards.&quot;I encourage any one who loves non-fiction biography to read this book. I am sure you will like it too. If you don't like it in the beginning you should stick with it because it gets extremely good at the end."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"The first thing I have to say about this book is that it's funny and will make the reader understand how a super large family really can make it financially.I read this book the first time because it was required in junior high (now known as middle school). I just read it again with my teenage daughters to maybe bring some understanding to them about saving time and money and that time is money. This father is the king of creative spending and overlapping chores to save time.A very enjoyable book to read. This is an excellent book to co-read with your children of any age and might help you get a few frugal points accross to them.It's a comical read laced with some very neccesary ideas of financial knowledge.This is a quick book to read, and in my case a shared time of family financial understanding.

What a relief to see it is reprinted, and to find that the stories are just as funny and wonderful as they ever were.This is a book about the Gilbreth family; Father, mother and twelve (yes 12!) children. Most especially this is the story of the Father, and his time-motion studies which he applied in work and in life. He was a time and motion expert in the first couple of decades of the twentieth century - travelling internationally and showing the new factories how to improve their production by increasing their efficiency.This book has been written, with great affection and humour, by two of his children - Frank and Ernestine. I find it truly amazing that not only did the family boast twelve children but they all learned to speak foreign languages, touch typing, mental maths and even morse code - all because their father worked out dozens of ingenious ways to motivate them - although often it was quite reluctantly on their part. Their father was a truly larger than life character who dominates the book with his booming pronouncements and occassionally humbling mistakes - but you can almost see his eyes twinkling with a ready laugh.This isn't just a book for adults, kids love having the stories read to them.

This perfect way to spend a rainy day. You will be very amused when you read about the hilarious events of the Gilbreth family. The family of twelve children have many adventures you will enjoy reading. The father is almost crazy and a very successful business man. He is very strict and overprotective. He won't let his daughters wear make up or dress the way they like to. They slowly change his mind and begin to dress their way. He thinks his children can do anything and is also believed he could do anything. He loved jokes and laughing and you will love the practical jokes they play on each other. The rich family loves to go to movies then out for ice cream. They also spend their summers at the beach, where their Dad forces them to learn to swim. He wants them to learn as much as possible about everything so he always finds a way to teach them new things. As an efficiency expert he made sure that everything was done in a time efficient way. It was a sin to waste time in the Gilbreth house and he was constantly coming up with new ways to save time. The Dad in the story liked to parade around and show off his kids. Although this was embarassing to some of the kids as they got older Dad found it hilarious. The mother also was sometimes embarrassed or insulted by the attention they got or the comments other people made. This book will keep you laughing right up to the last chapter when Dad dies.

The father is an efficiency expert who runs the family like it is a factory assembly line, with everything timed down to the minute. Even the times for bathing are scheduled, so that the household runs smoothly. Mr. Gilbreth practices all of his ideas on how to run an efficient business on his family; they are the guinea pigs for new ideas.He is the parent who disciplines all the kids, and the mom is really understanding of how hard it is to live in such an unusual family. Both of the parents were professionals, as the mom was also a psychologist and industrial engineer. They applied their professional ideas on raising the 12 kids. The children learn foreign languages, long division and about the solar system, using methods from Mr. Gilbreth's professional life. They were also taught touch typing and morse code by efficient methods. It is a very humorous look at the life of a large and unusual family. The ending of the book is sad, as Mr. Gilbreth dies, leaving Mrs. Gilbreth to raise the children alone.The tone of the book is humor, as many of the situations are really funny, and the parents approach life with a sense of humor. The father is often very sarcastic, but not in a mean way. He liked to parade the family around and even though he was proud of them, he found the reactions of other people very funny. The parent's sense of humor made dealing with the problems of a large family easier, and made for a more loving lifestyle. Even though raising a family that large was serious business, they never took life too seriously. I think that is an important way to raise a family, by keeping a sense of humor. The father is a smart man, and he is never characterized as an idiot, even though he does some crazy things to help his family. The main theme throughout the book is the importance of humor in their lives."},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"Non-fiction is a category with very few books I would recommend that everyone read. Usually, the topics are tied too closely to interests. I think that this is one of the few books that is actually of general interest.Frank Gilbreth Sr. was the sort of over-the-top character you could imagine would invent a new field, and so he did. Motion study, and industrial engineering owe him a lot. His wife and he were an excellent team who innovated the way people work.The book takes great pains to explain the factors that made their family unique, from size to father and mother. All sorts of bizarre and funny moments are recorded within. Personality of the players is excellently displayed in the various events.If you want a peep into another era and culture, or just some humorous anecdotes, this book is excellent. If you are entering the workforce, you might find some excellent time-saving tips in there as well.

Gilbreth, Jr., and Ernestine Gilbreth CareyB.MasukawaP. 6Cheaper By the Dozen is about a family with twelve children by Frank B. Gilbreth and Erenstine Gilbreth Carey. The father of the dozen, is a man that's headstrong, funny, and agreeable. He is a father that is happily situated in a crowd of children. Lillie, the mother, is a strong woman that specializes in Psychology. She is the one in the household that would dry the tears, resolve arguments, and give hugs and kisses to her twelve kids. The parents are a couple that usually agrees with each other. The father gets upset at anyone that hurts his wife's feelings gets punished. Together they raised Anne, Mary, Erenstine, Martha, Frank, William, Lill, Fred, Dan, Jack, Bob, and Jane.As the kids grow up, they became very educated by their father. Everywhere they went, he would stop and explain how the object came into being or it's significance. Mr. Gilbreth taught them how to use a typewriter, multiply two-digit numbers quickly, and skills to help study for school better. Lillie taught her children her wisdom, strength, and skills that are needed in everyone's daily lives. The family has committees with each other to discuss different matters of the family. Matters that was discussed, was getting a dog, what kind of new rug to get, and the kinds of clothes that they were allowed to wear. The dozen children always play with each other and become very close. In the end, Mr. Gilbreth dies by the fault of his heart problems that he has had for years. After his death, Lillie took her husband's job and continued to raise her family.My favorite part of the book is when the author talks about the Jazz age. During this time, Anne asks to able to wear shorter skirts and underwear, silk stockings, bobbed hair, and pointed shoes. The father rejects this new fashion because he thinks it's wrong to have your bare knees showing and have underwear that you can see through. Anne decided to cut her hair short and resulted to make her father very upset. This is my favorite part because she stood up for what she believed in. Anne didn't so this for herself , but did it to help her younger sisters to wear the things that they wanted. In my opinion, she has been brought up well if she did something that would to upset her parents for the benefit for her siblings.I chose this particular book because I wanted to read something that I myself would never experience. To be part of a family with twelve kids was something that I'd never be a part of. As a started to read this book, I was amazed at how the parents controlled their children. Every single child was happy, educated, and loved each other. This tale showed me the high and low points in a large family. My favorite character was the mother because even her husband died, she stood strong and continued to raise their family.

The parents are both well-educated, strongly-opinionated individuals and through out the book we see Mr. Galbraith's great respect and admiration for his wife. They raise their children in unusual but thoughtful and amusing ways... painting a huge mural depicting the solar system on the walls of their summer house, teaching their 4 year-olds how to do long-division in their heads at the dinner table, insisting that the nannies speak to the babies in French and German.It is such a pleasure to read about people who have strong convictions and follow their own good judgement.

It is most enjoyable, and I think I've played it till I almost have it memorized. The nuances and subtleties she brings to an already enjoyable book, make her performance of it something not to be missed. She does the male and female voices so well that you will find yourself forgetting that it is a woman performing all the parts. I say performing, because she adds so much with inflection, tone, and timing that it really is not so much a reading as a one woman show. From the baby talk to the gruff Man Of The House, she makes this audio book far more of an experience than simply listening to a book being read. If you like the book, you will love the audio. You will not be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"Having a family of fourteen isn't exactly cheaper or easier than just having a family of three or four. Mr. Gilbreth thought it would be though before he and his wife had twelve children. The book Cheaper by the Dozen is a non fiction biography written by Frank B. Gilbreth and Ernstine Gilbreth Carey. The main characters of this book are Mr. Gilbreth, Mrs. Gilbreth and their twelve children. Six of them boys and the other six girls. This book is about the adventures and stories of the Gilbreth family before Mr. Gilbreth dies. The main idea of this story to me is that you should spend your time wisely, try to get as much done as you can in life because one day your time could run out. The strong points of this book to me are when the twelve kids are getting into each others business, also when there is a lot of action going on. I think twelve to fifteen year olds would be very interested in this book, but both younger and older people will enjoy this book also. I would recommend this book to all readers. Once you have finished reading Cheaper by the Dozen and you liked it you should read Belles on their Toes, the sequel to Cheaper by the Dozen"},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","review":"This book is about a family called the Gilbreths finding the best way to live.

Set in the parish of St. Ogg's, Maggie and Tom Tulliver endure childhood and young adulthood while experiencing the harsh realities of poverty, devotion, love, and societal reputation. I emphasized greatly with Maggie as I have experienced some of her own lived experiences. I truly loved every chapter of this book and didn't want it to end. It is indeed very rare that I have this type of reaction to a book. Although this book was published during the Victorian era, it's amazing how Eliot's prose flows virtually unobstructed. The reader is given a rare glimpse into rural life during the 19th century and is treated to how strictly structured society was then.

It portrays the grimmer side of what should be the typically happy fairy tale"},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"THE MILL ON THE FLOSS is an incredibly gruelling read, especially for those who are highly empathic or emotionally vulnerable to human suffering, even if the humans in this case are entirely fictional. Maggie Tulliver is seemingly doomed from birth, being a passionate and impulsive woman in a constricted, decidedly malevolent society that utterly forbids such traits in females. My personal reading of the novel was made all the worse due to the character of Tom Tulliver. To me, Tom is the personification of all the very worst aspects of humanity, and is all the more loathsome because of it. He is highly gifted at homing in on and pointing out the weaknesses of others, but stubbornly refuses to acknowledge his own serious flaws. The scene with Maggie confronting her brother in the first chapter of the seventh book is especially devastating. Tom speaks down to Maggie from an imaginary pedestal of his own making, then proceeds to abandon her in her darkest hour. It is a callous act of arrogance and wrongful moral judgement that far exceeds any sin Maggie might have perpetuated in her entire lifetime.Tom has strengths of his own - he is strong in will and dedication, and almost single-handedly rescues his family from financial ruin. However, these strengths also underline his weaknesses. Tom indeed has a firm sense of right and wrong - in everyone else. When it comes to his own person, Tom fancies himself (however unintentionally) among the Gods. This is perhaps what makes him the single most unsympathetic character I've ever encountered in literature. In many ways, Tom is little more than an educated bully.Many readers may believe that Tom is redeemed in the final pages of the novel along with Maggie, but I'm forced to disagree. Tom's overbearing pride, which has been one of the mainstays of the novel, has finally broken down only in the face of an act by God Himself. It took something entirely elemental to force a single scrap of humility on Tom's personality. Tom hasn't learned his most valuable lesson, even moments before his death. At least, that's what I'm inclined to believe."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"If you enjoy a read that will leave you depressed and unfulfilled on every level, ths book is for you!

This is truely a classic to read if you have a brother or sister."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"There is nothing like an obtuse, clotted introduction to impede a good book. For George Eliot's \\"The Mill on the Floss,\\" The introduction contributes nearly 50 pages of dense literary criticism that numbs the head, darkens the spirit, and creates grave doubts that this book is worth reading for anyone with less than a doctorate in English literature. There is nothing better than reading a good novel. Likewise, there is nothing worse than reading literary criticism that employs the obscurantist principles of the type that infect this introduction. After threading a path through these paragraphs that loom like mountains of iron, it is presumed one is ready to embark on Eliot's novel.George Eliot, a.k.a Mary Ann Evans, wrote several novels in the mid 19th century. \\"The Mill on the Floss,\\" written in 1859-60, is not considered one of her better novels. That distinction falls to \\"Middlemarch,\\" a book that is often referred to as \\"the best English language novel ever written.\\" Others compare Eliot to Dickens, with the astute observation that Eliot's prose is loftier and her plots are composed with a greater intellectual ability. Wherever your preferences may lie in regards to 19th century English literature, Eliot's novels will find their way to your bookshelf. She's an important enough figure in the English literary canon that an opinion on her writings is an absolute necessity.Eliot's writing is a large tapestry woven with biblical, classical, and English literary threads, as paragraph after paragraph, page after page, unfurls into a beautifully formed whole. Characters and atmosphere are masterfully etched in ink and paper as Eliot constructs a story exposing the contradictions and capriciousness of English provincial life in the 19th century. The ornate prose and intellectual brilliance found here can quickly overwhelm the literary novice. This is not a book for speed-reading or a quick weekend read. Passages must be reread and thought about in order to draw out Eliot's intentions.\\"The Mill on the Floss\\" tells the story of two families, the Tullivers and the Dodsons, with special emphasis on Maggie and Tom Tulliver. The story covers over a decade of trials and tribulations within these two families, from the bucolic innocence of childhood on the banks of the Floss, to the bankruptcy of the Tulliver family and their subsequent exile from the family home of Dorlcote Mill. Roughly the last half of the book examines the travails of Maggie, as she falls in love with Phillip Wakem, the hunchbacked son of the lawyer who brought about the ruin of the Tullivers. Maggie's intentions with the enemy bring on the wrath of brother Tom, who has sworn to his father to oppose the Wakems with every ounce of his strength. When Stephen Guest (the beau of Maggie's cousin Lucy) suddenly woos Maggie, the connections become even more tangled (Guest is such an annoying addition to the story that Penguin saw fit to include an essay at the end of the book entitled, \\"The Placing of Stephen Guest,\\" in an attempt to justify his presence.). Tom and Maggie reconcile in an ending that is both redemptive and poignant.A surprising element of the novel is its humor. It is not the staccato, rim shot humor one finds in America, but a slow, ingratiating British wit that builds over the course of dozens of pages. This humor is most apparent early in the story, when characters are introduced and Eliot examines the troubles of childhood. By the time things begin to decline for the Tullivers, the humor disappears from the story. This use of humor is unexpected from such an august figure as Eliot.What is even more surprising is the use of British vernacular in the dialogue of the characters. This may be due to Eliot's love of Sir Walter Scott, an author who made copious use of Scottish accent in his fictional novels. Regrettably, this \\"British brogue\\" doesn't work as well here as it does in Scott's work. All too often, the dialect drops out of dialogue, leaving the reader to wonder how the characters can switch between perfect English and provincial slang.Perhaps Eliot's novel is best summed up in her statement, \\"I am telling the history of very simple people, who had never had any illuminating doubts as to personal integrity and honour.\\" There is honor and integrity, such as duty to family and stoicism in the face of harrowing losses. However, this is ultimately a sad book, and quite effective in showing how social norms and narrow mindedness can ruin lives and create needless sorrow. This may not be Eliot's best work, but it definitely deserves due consideration by lovers of classic literature."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"Maggie Tulliver, who is age seven when the story opens, lives at Dorlcote Mill on the River Ripple at its junction with the River Floss near the village of St. Ogg's in England, with her father, who owns the mill, mother, and older brother Tom. The novel spans a period of ten to fifteen years, beginning with Tom's and Maggie's childhood and including her father's ongoing battles with a lawyer named Wakem, the Tullivers' consequent bankruptcy resulting in the loss of the mill, and Mr. Tulliver's untimely death. Tom has been in school with Philip Wakem, the lawyer's hunchbacked, sensitive, and intellectual son, and Maggie has grown fond of Philip, seeing him secretly. To help repay his father's debts, Tom leaves his schooling to enter a life of business, but in his hatred of the Wakems, he forbids Maggie's seeing Philip, and she languishes in the impoverished Tulliver home, renouncing the world after reading Thomas &agrave; Kempis's The Imitation of Christ.Some years later, Tom has been successful and able to restore the family's former estate. Lucy has been away teaching school but returns to visit with her cousin, Lucy Deane. Her acquaintance with Philip is renewed and he still loves her, but Stephen Guest, a young socialite in St. Ogg's who is Lucy's fianc&eacute;, is also attracted to her. Maggie enjoys the clandestine attentions of Stephen, but when he substitutes for the sick Philip in taking her on a boat ride and proposes that they stop in Mudport, and get married, she rejects him and makes her way back to St. Ogg's, where, rejected by her brother Tom and almost everyone else except her mother, Tom's friend Bob Jakin and his family, in whose home she takes lodgings, and the minister, Dr. Kenn, who engages her as governess for his children, she lives for a brief period as an outcast, though she does reconcile with both Philip and Lucy. When the flood comes, Maggie sets out in one of Bob's boats to rescue Tom, and together they head to rescue Lucy, but their boat capsizes and the two drown in an embrace, thus giving the book its Biblical subtitle, \\"In their death they were not divided.\\"I have always liked Eliot's Silas Marner because it is, in the final analysis, a tale of redemption. However, The Mill on the Floss is not primarily a tale of redemption. In fact, the book is somewhat autobiographical in that it reflects the disgrace that the author herself felt while involved in a lengthy relationship with a married man, George Henry Lewes, although there are differences. No actual immorality is portrayed in the book, and towards the end, Maggie does make the right choice. There are a little bad language and some references to drinking alcohol, using tobacco, and dancing. Biblical quotations and allusions abound throughout, but I am not sure that the book represents a truly Biblical worldview. A certain degree of fatalistic determinism is at play throughout the novel--in fact, on one occasion Maggie says, \\"Our life is determined for us\\"--although Maggie's ultimate choice not to marry Stephen demonstrates a final triumph of free will. Some latent feminism also occurs in that the cultural norms of her community seem to deny Maggie her intellectual and spiritual growth. Many of Eliot's observations about the nature of people and society are interesting, with some of which you may agree and others you may not, but occasionally her social commentary goes on and on to the point of becoming boring. Like The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne, in the right hands The Mill on the Floss could be used to teach a good lesson on not being judgmental, but due to the \\"titillating\\" nature of the story I would recommend that it not be inflicted on anyone under age eighteen."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"As Maggie Tulliver searches to fulfill herself while still being morally responsible, she increasingly comes into conflict with her beloved brother Tom and her community.

I was hooked. I liked it tons better than \\"Adam Bede\\" with its snotty, stuck-up stilted characters. The characters in this one have personality and funny quirks.The ending, however, is awful. I think she got sick of writing this, because she cuts it off short in a bizarre and contrived manner. Very unsatisfying. I had hoped for a more subtle ending."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"What a pleasure it is to read the novels of George Eliot. The sheer intelligence of the author shines on every page. In this, her second novel following closely after Adam Bede, she draws on her own experience to create a world of characters surrounding her hero & heroine, Tom and Maggie Tulliver.The story develops at a leisurely pace with the first two books devoted to the childhood of Maggie and Tom. As Tom goes off to be tutored, Maggie must stay at home and their lives slowly diverge until in subsequent books, as their father's world disintegrates in debt, they are found on opposite sides with their filial love tested again and again. One of the most impressive aspects of the novel is the complexity of these characters as created by Eliot. Tom distinguishes himself at the trading firm of his Uncle Deane and matures into a confident and courageous young man, repaying the debts of his father. Yet, his character is flawed in both his inflexibility and his inability to appreciate the needs of his sister Maggie. Maggie, who is significantly more intelligent than Tom, and self-taught, has developed from a somewhat over-emotional young girl into a sort of Christian ascetic based on her reading of Thomas a Kempis. She is forbidden friendship with Philip Waken, the son of the lawyer who bought her father's mill, and is prevented from developing the potential that is central to her character. The denouement of the novel leads it down the path of the tragic side of life if not true tragedy, but the complexity of the characters and realism of the world in which they live continues to impress."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"I had never heard much about 'The Mill on the Floss' before reading it, but I enjoyed other Eliot novels so I decided to try it. I usually enjoy plot-driven books, and this was a bit more character-driven, but I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. Eliot's writing (and, I'm sure, the editing) doesn't have the bogged down feel of many classics, and her descriptions--especially of places, but of people as well--are often brilliant. Her descriptions of education and women's 'place' in society are fascinating, and the interactions between characters are in many cases timeless. I strongly recommend the book even for those who are often 'classics-shy'. Though at times strong on description and slow on plot, this novel contains insights on relationships and a view on the education of women to which everyone should be exposed."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"The Mill on the Floss, published in 1860, traces the turmoil in the life of Maggie Tulliver, a young woman who has a streak of independence but who also feels close to her father and her brother and believes that she must always honor their feelings and wishes. Maggie's father is the owner of the Dorlcote Mill on the Floss River, a failing business drawing him into increasing debt to his relatives and creditors. Her brother Tom, with no interest in the mill, is encouraged to learn other skills which may suit him for a higher level of society. When the mill fails and is sold at auction to Lawyer Wakem, the Tullivers become social outcasts, at the mercy of creditors and dependent on their extended family.Philip Wakem, son of Lawyer Wakem, is a hunchback who has been a school friend of Tom Tulliver and a special friend of Maggie, who treats him kindly and appreciates his intelligence and thoughtfulness. When the mill is sold to Wakem, Tom and Mr. Tulliver end all contact with the Wakem family, and though Maggie continues to see Philip privately, Tom eventually forces her to choose between the family and Philip. Another relationship with Stephen Guest, who has been courting her cousin Lucy, unleashes Maggie's passions and leads to a dramatic conclusion.Throughout the novel George Eliot (the pen name of Mary Ann Evans) explores the many kinds of love in Maggie's life--her devoted love of her father, her dependence on and love for her brother, her intellectual and kindly love for Philip, and her passionate love of Stephen Guest. Creating a fully drawn character in Maggie, Eliot shows a full picture of a young woman of 1860, trying to be independent, trying to live according to society's strictures, and trying to be true to her own feelings, despite pressures from family and society. Eliot, who herself made the scandalous choice to live openly with a married man for twenty-six years, was thoroughly familiar with these issues herself, and her depictions of such themes as family loyalty and the social conventions and limitations of class carry the ring of truth.Psychologically astute in the exploration of themes as they affect Maggie, Eliot amplifies these themes through imagery from nature, legend, and even religion. Often melodramatic in plot, the novel remains realistic, even autobiographical, in its attention to character. Though it is not as fully developed as her later novel Middlemarch, Mill on the Floss is still a well developed, thoughtful novel which goes far beyond the pulp fiction being serialized in newspapers and magazines during that time.

Especially Maggie, Lucy and Bob. I have to admit I cannot stand Tom, though. He behaves as if he never made mistakes himself, he's too strict and unforgiving. The funny thing is that he turns out to be the real love of his sister's life, over any kind of romantic love. This is probably a reflection of the writer's frustrated relationship with her own brother.A delightful book all in all."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"In THE MILL ON THE FLOSS, George Eliot writes of her heroine Maggie Tulliver in such a way that autobiography seems inevitable. Even had Eliot not made a secret of the nearly one to one relationship between her and Maggie, the connection is too obvious to ignore. In George Eliot's personal life, she had an ongoing dispute with her brother that so distressed her that the only way to resolve it was in her fiction. So Maggie spends nearly the entire novel trying to prove her unselfish love to her brother Tom who refuses to see the good in Maggie until the highly controversial ending in which Maggie nobly risks her life to convince Tom that her love for him is unsullied. However much one sees of Eliot in Maggie, Maggie is still a fully-rounded individual whom Eliot has chosen to flesh out in a manner that was unheard of for her time. In presenting the character of Maggie, as well as the others, Eliot presents the unfolding of their distinct personalities against the backdrop of their respective social milieus. Eliot suggests that society has a definite impact on the way each character develops. For Eliot, character is formed partly by his or her environment and exhibited heavily in the ways that she chooses to allow each character to act in their homes, their fields, and their workplaces.Eliot traces a gradual connection between theme and character. Since environment is one of the two primary factors that impact on the push-pull connection between theme and character, she is careful to delineate early on that the same environment that houses Maggie and Tom nevertheless pushes each to a sociological fork in the road from which each takes a divergent turn. This divergence leads to the book's primary theme: the evolving nature between brother and sister is both cause and effect of the ultimate maritime tragedy that concludes the book. Maggie, even as a young child, is seen as perpetually in conflict, the causes of which are beyond her control. Maggie has an internal conflict in that she is often called to make a choice between that which her heart calls for (say, her love for Stephen Guest) and that which her duty forbids (the vast class gap between the two that forbids a relation). Maggie also has a direct conflict with Tom, whose brutishness and inexplicable meanness toward her impel both toward the book's tragic close. Finally, she has an ongoing conflict with society at large, symbolized by a collective mass of family, friends, lovers, and a cobwebbery of implicit rules that Maggie breaks unwittingly and to tragic effect.The ending of THE MILL OF THE FLOSS has created a controversy that has lingered from Eliot's day to ours. When Maggie chooses to literally die with Tom than to live without him, the reader is faced with passing judgment on its credibility. Has Eliot taken the cheap way out and sought the conventionally tragic ending of the sentimental Victorian novel? Or is Maggie's final act of unselfishness to be viewed through the lens of autobiography in which the author is vicariously healing the rift between her and her real life brother with the sacrifice of Maggie for her fictional one? The question was raised then and is often raised now with no resolution. What remains is a novel whose ongoing charm lies in its depiction of a style of life that was seen as far removed even in Eliot's day and for which retains a nostalgic charm that the passing of the centuries cannot lessen."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"As a modern reader I found the tone of Eliot to not only be didactic but insultingly so. With every nuance so pointed in its intentions the characters and action are devoid of any impact. One cannot help that feel this is clearly a novel that has aged badly for the simple reasons that its very heavy handed message is old hat and obviously the original audience for this novel was one of lower education standards than today. As a simple book written to carry a message this is one of the weaker Eliot novels for the modern audience to read."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"Whenever anyone asks me for books I really hate, this one is topof the list.

This is my first reading of one of George Eliot's masterpieces, and probably the last one. I was extremely sad when I finished the book, the kind of effect and memory I never had when reading other british classics. Why should Maggie and Tom die? And why did Stephen and Lucy get married eventhough they have no love between them? Especially for Stephen, by marrying Lucy, he has fulfilled the expectations of those who separated him and Maggie. I didn't like the ending because it left every character in the story torn apart, despair, and meaningless in life. I've always had this feeling inside when reading passages about Tom and Maggie, that there is some sort of incestial love between the brother and sister, and my feelings were reafirmed after reading how they hung on to each other when they died.

Even an experienced reader is left asking, &quot;What's your point?&quot; It seems as though she tries to say too much (or really never knew what she wanted to say), and it all gets jumbled and garbled into essentially nothing--and she does it all in only 600 pages. If you have to read it for school...I'm sorry. If you're thinking about reading it for pleasure, there are plenty of better books to read."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"Powerful and moving, \\"The Mill on the Floss\\" is considered to be George Eliot's most autobiographical novel. Along with \\"Middlemarch\\" it is my favorite. Set in early 19th century England - St. Ogg's, Lincolnshire to be exact - this is the tale of gifted, free-spirited Maggie Tulliver and her selfish, spoiled brother, Tom, who were born and raised at Dorlcote Mill on the River Floss. Eliot's portrayal of sibling relationships is terribly poignant and plays a major part in the novel, as does the longstanding rivalry between two local families - the Tullivers and the Wakems.From earliest childhood Maggie worships her brother Tom, and longs to win his approval, and that of her parents. However, her fierce intelligence and strong streak of independence bring her into constant conflict with her family. She finds, in literature, the kindness and love she longs for in life. \\"...everybody in the world seemed so hard and unkind to Maggie: there was no indulgence, no fondness, such as she imagined when she fashioned the world afresh in her own thoughts. In books there were people who were always agreeable or tender, and delighted to do things that made one happy, and who did not show their kindness by finding fault. The world outside the books was not a happy one Maggie felt. If life had no love in it, what else was there for Maggie?\\" Her nature, complex, passionate, sensuous, noble, intellectualized, and spiritualized, is of great importance to this novel, as is the pathos of her relationship with Tom.Maggie's early years are brilliantly and unsentimentally portrayed from a child's perspective. The author structures a sequence of childhood's phases, which might appear, at first, to be random vignettes, but constitute an excellent psychological basis on which to build a character and motivation. Eliot once stated, \\"my stories always grow out of my psychological conception of the dramatis personae.\\" Thus, the author chronicles Maggie's life as she grows from a precocious little girl to a strikingly attractive young woman, tall with full lips, and a \\"crown\\" of jet black hair. Her lack of social pretension makes her even more charming and likeable. As she matures, her conflicts with her brother, her family, even with her community, increase significantly. She, herself, feels torn between what is considered her \\"moral responsibility\\" and her search for self-fulfillment. Ultimately, she demonstrates honor and courage in the face of the disapproval of a narrow, tradition-bound society.Parallel to, and intertwined with Maggie's story, is that of families Tullivur and Wakem. After Tullivur loses his mill and social respectability through bankruptcy, (a loss precipitated by a rash lawsuit he undertook), Wakem purchases it all. Mr. Tullivur agrees to stay on as manager. At first he seems resigned to his misfortune. However, within the space of a few pages he is swearing vengeance on the new owner and cursing him. He actually summons Tom to inscribe his curse on Wakem in the family Bible, and makes his son swear to uphold it. The feud becomes violent when Wakem, in the role of proprietor, appropriately corrects Tullivur's management of the mill. Of course the criticism is taken as an insult, and shortly afterward, upon meeting his boss on the road, Tullivur horsewhips him in \\"a frenzy of triumphant vengeance.\\" Tom sees this uncontrolled outbreak of madness as the result of long repressed hatred. Mr. Tullivur never repents his beating of Wakem. His injured pride and sense of righteous indignation, justify him in his own mind. This lack of forgiveness is also demonstrated by Tom for his sister. In direct contrast, Maggie couples love with forgiveness.As she reaches adulthood, Maggie finds herself torn between her relationships with three extremely different men: her proud, stubborn brother, Tom; Philip Wakem, a beloved friend who is also the son of her family's worst enemy; and a charismatic but unacceptable suitor. When Tom is thrown suddenly into the role of adult, after his father's death, he becomes obsessed with acquiring social status and power. He attempts to arrange a socially advantageous marriage for Maggie, and when she refuses, he severs ties with her.I won't spoil your read with any further discussion of the novel's details, especially the dramatic conclusion. George Eliot writes with a keen sense of humor, especially when addressing the grotesque in the human character. Her narrative has great depth, as insight to character and social observations are more important to Eliot than pace and action. \\"The Mill On The Floss\\" is deeply romantic - a work of great beauty and a literary classic. I cannot recommend it highly enough.\\"The Mill On The Floss\\" is based partially on Eliot's, (born Mary Ann Evans), own experiences with her family and her brother Isaac, who was three years older than she. Eliot's father, like Mr. Tulliver, was a businessman who had married a woman from a higher social class. His wife's sisters were rich, ultra-respectable, and self-satisfied. These maternal aunts provided the character models for the aunts in the novel. Like Maggie, Eliot was extremely intelligent, energetic, imaginative and unconventional. She did not fit traditional models of feminine beauty or behavior, causing her family a great deal of consternation. Eliot lived with a man who she had not married - a daring enterprise in Victorian England. By the time this novel was published, she had gained considerable notoriety as an \\"immoral woman.\\"In this edition writer and critic A. S. Byatt provides full explanatory notes and an Introduction further relating \\"Mill On The Floss\\" to George Eliot's own life and times.JANA"},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"The Mill on the Floss, by George Eliot, stands among the greatest nineteenth century British novels. As engaging and readable as anything by Austen or Dickens, this novel adds a degree of psychological and emotional complexity that few novels, of any period, can match.The novel seems to have the breath of life in it, so that the characters and circumstances seem true and real, even to the modern reader so far removed from the pastoral life of two hundred years ago.To those who may feel intimidated by the book, don't be. The writing is accessible to any 21st century literate and the controversies of Victorian-era farm life are far more compelling than they may appear at first blush. Give it a try; you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"George Eliot's works are varied and wonderful, and although this is not the book that she's most noted for, it is one that she held most dear. It is a \\"no-holds barred\\" autobiographical account of her own life. George Eliot's real name was Mary Anne Evans, but she used the pen name of George Eliot because society at that time thought it was not correct for women to be authors, and she wanted her books read on their own merits. In this book we read of Maggie Tulliver who was intelligent, imaginative, idealistic and ambitious like George (Mary Anne) herself. The book goes into the continuous conflict between Maggie and her environment, and the frustrations that she encounters in her search for fulfillment and love. George Eliot bared her soul in this novel, but it also contains her trademark wonderful dialogue and characterizations. I have read all George Eliot's works, and found them all richly and disturbingly illuminating. They certainly do make you think about her and the struggles that she encountered within the moral and religious strictures of her society."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"This was my first (of four, so far) George Eliot novel. It's also my favorite. Unlike Adam Bede or Silas Marner, I found the characters to be interesting and enjoyable. No, it's not a finely-crafted piece of literature like Middlemarch. And it might be a bit on the melodramatic side. But for some odd reason I found the story to be ultimately quite moving.Other folks who I gave the book to gave it mixed results. No one disliked it, but most found the &quot;brother-sister&quot; element to be a bit corny. And pardon my sexism, but I thought the book would appeal more to women than men (since the main character is a teenage girl). Not so. This book is definitely &quot;not for women only&quot;.I imagine if you have a sentimental streak through your bones you will probably love this book."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"From a technical point of view, I think that the writing is superb: the description are vivid (I particularly loved the description of Maggie as a little Medusa with her snakes shorn. The book is a mixture of the earnest and the farcical, and at points is extremely funny. The structure is carefully built, with the different metaphors of the river reflecting the state of mind of the characters. I found the end very unsatisfying, I was close to the end of the book before I found Maggie sympathetic, and I thought it failed the chief standard of a novel: to be an involving narrative.I don't mind that the author speaks to the reader per se, but every time I got caught up in the narrative, it wasn't long before the story ground to a halt while Eliot delivered herself of a short essay. The nearly three pages asking the reader to think of villages on the Rhone and castles on the Rhine (neither of which I have ever seen), wore out my patience--it almost seemed like a joke. Both the critics that I read thought that modern readers were put off by the length of the book, but I can think of a lot of long modern novels. It's not so much the number of pages as the way they are filled.Maggie Tulliver is apparently a seriously disturbed child, surrounded by insensitive adults who certainly can't help her. I feel sorry for her, but I don't like her. Wanting to be loved isn't the same as being lovable. For most of the book, Maggie is pretty self-absorbed. I pity her for her unpleasant relatives, but that doesn't mean that I find her sympathetic by contrast.Maggie is destructively impulsive, probably hurting herself more than anyone else, but Eliot lost a great deal of my sympathy early on when Maggie allows her brother's rabbits to die of neglect. It is hard to understand how someone who is supposed to be devoted to him could have so completely forgotten his request to take care of them. The critics that I read pointed out that Maggie is always very sorry for what she does, but it seems to me that she is only sorry for how other people's annoyance will affect her. She never, until the end of the book, is remorseful at causing someone else pain. If she were, she would understand that her brother is reasonably angry, and not complain that he is cruel for not instantly forgiving her. Not to mention what the rabbits went through!Eliot's view of Maggie and her father is that they are as they are, they cannot help themselves, but everyone else is responsible for their own conduct and for accommodating the Tullivers. I find it hard to be sympathetic to them when Eliot was so scathing about everyone else. I am probably projecting 21st century standards back on a 19th century book, but Tulliver acts against the advice of his wife and goes bankrupt in a law suit, which is rather self-centered and bullying. Maggie (and I suppose Eliot) feel that he should not be blamed for this. Certainly there is no point at railing at a person who is nearly comatose with distress, but he is in fact seriously at fault. [added later: I am reminded a bit of Mrs. Bennet in Pride and Prejudice. Both wives are presented in a very unflattering light as weak and trivial, but in fact they may be said to have a better grasp of reality than their more sympathetically portrayed but somewhat irresponsible spouses. One has to wonder what the authors were thinking in describing these women.]I found Maggie much more sympathetic in Book 6 and after, but it and her romantic problems seemed a little contrived. The change in her from Book 5 is only partially accounted for; a lot of it is obviously just a set up for the Dramatic Ending.I would like the book better if Eliot featured some intelligent resolution to Maggie's problems: she could have learned not to be so emotionally dependent upon her brother, she could have made another life for herself. The problems of her love life are indeed a dilemma and not easily solved, but the ending really seems like a cheat. I hope Eliot didn't mean this as encouragement for woman who found themselves at odds with social expectations. Even the reconciliation between Maggie and her brother makes me scoff. They had a big reconciliation scene earlier in the book and it didn't last, so this one doesn't seem meaningful. It is like the end of a television drama where decades of misunderstanding are permanently resolved in the last 60 seconds.This is certainly a piece of literary history, and there are some great examples of writing in it, but I don't think it has held up as a novel.And if you don't like this review, and even if you do, James M. Rawley has appended some very interesting comments, as well as writing an excellent review of his own."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"Allowing myself the use of a preciously rare adjective, I will call George Eliot's \\"The Mill on the Floss\\" a Wordsworthian novel in the sense that it is a deeply personal work to the point of being semi-autobiographical, adores nature with imaginative poeticality, and shows a great affection towards a sibling. Like all of Eliot's major novels, it is a masterpiece of form, developing from a pastoral about childhood into a brooding love story concerning five young people who are motivated by a complex web of emotions involving pity, loyalty, and spite.The two protagonists are Maggie Tulliver and her older brother Tom, whose father owns Dorlcote Mill on the river Floss near a town called St. Ogg's. Maggie, Eliot's presumable alter ego, is a normal little girl in most respects but extremely bright and quite mischievous, cutting off her hair to rebel against her remonstrative mother and nattering aunts and uncles and pushing her pretty cousin Lucy Deane into a puddle of mud in a fit of jealousy. Tom, on the other hand, is a pragmatist rather than a Fury; he lives strictly according to the principles set forth by their father and believes people should be held accountable for their actions. While Maggie enriches her mind through her own reading, her father, who believes girls have no need for education, sends the much less bookish Tom to a prosaic tutor named Stelling to fathom the mysteries of Virgil and Euclid.While visiting Tom at Stelling's, Maggie meets the only other person in the novel whose intellect matches her own--Philip Wakem, a sensitively artistic but deformed boy whose father, a lawyer, is the sworn enemy of Mr. Tulliver. Philip, painfully aware of his unattractiveness, falls in love with Maggie because she is the only girl who has ever shown any interest in him; but Tom, loyal to his father and mindful of the harm Mr. Wakem has done to their family, warns her not to socialize with him. The trysts of Philip and Maggie--the hunchback and the tall, gawky girl--may seem like a grotesque parody of Romeo and Juliet, but there is touching sincerity and truthfulness in their scenes together.Years pass, and a new man enters the story--Stephen Guest, the handsome heir to a shipping business which is co-owned by Maggie's uncle Deane (Lucy's father) and employs Tom, who is trying to make enough money to buy back Dorlcote Mill, swindled away by Mr. Wakem. Stephen is ostensibly Lucy's boyfriend, but he soon becomes attracted to Maggie, who has turned into a graceful young lady. He also happens to be Philip's friend, and this can lead to nothing good. Maggie is thrust into a gnawing dilemma--she loves Stephen but feels too much pity for Philip to abandon him; her love for Stephen is consumed by guilt. And on top of this, Stephen reveals himself to be remorselessly selfish, concerned only for his own happiness.The ending, it must be said, is tragic, but not in the classical sense of being a consequence of the characters' flaws. It is more dramatic than it needed to be, but it may just be Eliot's expression of the eternal unity she felt with her brother, a fate not to be shared by any traditional romantic partner, and the novel could hardly have concluded with greater force and pathos. I praise many writers for a variety of skills, but Eliot stands high above the rest in her creation of these literary worlds of such extraordinary fineness and delicacy and in her exalted level of communication. In my opinion, the art of the novel has no greater practitioner."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"There were certain passages of The Mill on the Floss, Proust once told a friend, that never failed to move him to tears. No wonder: In its exact and evocative attention to detail, vivid characterizations and profound understanding of human thought and motive, The Mill on the Floss had an obvious and startling influence on A' La Recherche du Temps Perdu. The Mill on the Floss is melodramatic, sure, but melodrama was the bread and butter of Victorian English novelists; compared with David Copperfield, for example, The Mill on the Floss is a model of restraint. George Eliot creates here an indelible portrait of St. Ogg's, an English provincial town whose residents lead lives &quot;irradiated by no sublime principles, no romantic visions, no active, self-renouncing faith.&quot; In particular, she creates Maggie Tulliver, one of the most memorable characters in all literature, whose quest for sublime principles and romantic visions puts her into direct conflict with her neighbors and with Tom, her stubborn, unimaginative brother. The book's tragic ending is superbly haunting, and has helped to make it a deserved favorite of readers for nearly 150 years."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"Having read most of George Eliot's novels, I can say without reservation that I believe this one to be her finest. It's also likely her most accessible, and the pacing of it is superb. THE MILL ON THE FLOSS is a very autobiographical novel, to a heartbreaking extent. I highly recommend reading this one alongside a bio of Eliot as it really highlights the aspects of Maggie Tolliver that come directly from Eliot herself. A brilliant, brilliant read, and one of my favorite Victorian novels."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"_The Mill on the Floss_ (1860) was George Eliot's third published book (after Scenes from Clerical Life and Adam Bede)and tells the story of Maggie and Tom Tulliver, two children who grow up in the middle-class rural community of St. Ogg's.It has been a while since I last read Mill on the Floss, I think that the last time I did I was in my early 20s, just graduated from school. I got a lot more out of the book this time. I think it profits both with re-reading and age. The first time I read it I identified so strongly with Maggie that I practically skipped over everything dealing with the other characters. I found Tom loathesome and the ending of the book appalling.As a slightly more adult human, I was able to read it for more than just Maggie's story and enjoy it even more. I was surprised by how compulsively I read it. I had every intention of stretching it out over several days, but I literally found that I could not stop reading it and carried it with me from room to room in the house. I laughed at Eliot's sly humor and this time around saw people like the Gleggs as people and not simply stock appendages of the story.I think what makes Mill On the Floss such a powerful book (aside from the writing style, which is excellent) is this notion of the divided self which is being worked out both through Tom and Maggie. Tom has a firm clear sense of right and wrong and is always being forced to question or do injury to that sense because of his very difficult sister. On the other hand, Maggie cannot seem to find the right balance between self-indulgence and renunciation. She never manages a way to negotiate between the sharp emotions that she feels and her desire not to inflict the consequences of those emotions on her family and friends. It is a tragedy that neither of them ever really manage to understand each other and are constantly hurting and being hurt in their drive to do the right thing and be who they really are.Interesting how Eliot plays with the tropes from all the popular weepy sentimental novels of the time. A young unattractive girl (unattractive because she has dark hair) overcomes poverty and goes on to attract the eye of the most fastidious and eligible man in town... However, in the world of St. Ogg's (unlike the novels of the sentimental sisters like Mary Jane Holmes) Maggie is unable to overcome her obstacles to happiness and is as trapped by her beauty and popularity as she was her unattractive hoyden girlhood. Given the position of women at the time and the strength of the social norms, it is unfortunately a much more believable view of the outcomes of things.If you have not read Eliot, I would agree that it is not her best book (still Middlemarch, for me, and I would begin there first) but it is hugely thought-provoking and honest. It should make many a young woman of today count their blessings and thank the stars that the world has changed since the time Maggie Tulliver was a girl."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"Powerful and moving, \\"The Mill on the Floss\\" is considered to be George Eliot's most autobiographical novel. Along with \\"Middlemarch\\" it is my favorite. Set in early 19th century England - St. Ogg's, Lincolnshire to be exact - this is the tale of gifted, free-spirited Maggie Tulliver and her selfish, spoiled brother, Tom, who were born and raised at Dorlcote Mill on the River Floss. Eliot's portrayal of sibling relationships is terribly poignant and plays a major part in the novel, as does the longstanding rivalry between two local families - the Tullivers and the Wakems.From earliest childhood Maggie worships her brother Tom, and longs to win his approval, and that of her parents. However, her fierce intelligence and strong streak of independence bring her into constant conflict with her family. She finds, in literature, the kindness and love she longs for in life. \\"...everybody in the world seemed so hard and unkind to Maggie: there was no indulgence, no fondness, such as she imagined when she fashioned the world afresh in her own thoughts. In books there were people who were always agreeable or tender, and delighted to do things that made one happy, and who did not show their kindness by finding fault. The world outside the books was not a happy one Maggie felt. If life had no love in it, what else was there for Maggie?\\" Her nature, complex, passionate, sensuous, noble, intellectualized, and spiritualized, is of great importance to this novel, as is the pathos of her relationship with Tom.Maggie's early years are brilliantly and unsentimentally portrayed from a child's perspective. The author structures a sequence of childhood's phases, which might appear, at first, to be random vignettes, but constitute an excellent psychological basis on which to build a character and motivation. Eliot once stated, \\"my stories always grow out of my psychological conception of the dramatis personae.\\" Thus, the author chronicles Maggie's life as she grows from a precocious little girl to a strikingly attractive young woman, tall with full lips, and a \\"crown\\" of jet black hair. Her lack of social pretension makes her even more charming and likeable. As she matures, her conflicts with her brother, her family, even with her community, increase significantly. She, herself, feels torn between what is considered her \\"moral responsibility\\" and her search for self-fulfillment. Ultimately, she demonstrates honor and courage in the face of the disapproval of a narrow, tradition-bound society.Parallel to, and intertwined with Maggie's story, is that of families Tullivur and Wakem. After Tullivur loses his mill and social respectability through bankruptcy, (a loss precipitated by a rash lawsuit he undertook), Wakem purchases it all. Mr. Tullivur agrees to stay on as manager. At first he seems resigned to his misfortune. However, within the space of a few pages he is swearing vengeance on the new owner and cursing him. He actually summons Tom to inscribe his curse on Wakem in the family Bible, and makes his son swear to uphold it. The feud becomes violent when Wakem, in the role of proprietor, appropriately corrects Tullivur's management of the mill. Of course the criticism is taken as an insult, and shortly afterward, upon meeting his boss on the road, Tullivur horsewhips him in \\"a frenzy of triumphant vengeance.\\" Tom sees this uncontrolled outbreak of madness as the result of long repressed hatred. Mr. Tullivur never repents his beating of Wakem. His injured pride and sense of righteous indignation, justify him in his own mind. This lack of forgiveness is also demonstrated by Tom for his sister. In direct contrast, Maggie couples love with forgiveness.As she reaches adulthood, Maggie finds herself torn between her relationships with three extremely different men: her proud, stubborn brother, Tom; Philip Wakem, a beloved friend who is also the son of her family's worst enemy; and a charismatic but unacceptable suitor. When Tom is thrown suddenly into the role of adult, after his father's death, he becomes obsessed with acquiring social status and power. He attempts to arrange a socially advantageous marriage for Maggie, and when she refuses, he severs ties with her.I won't spoil your read with any further discussion of the novel's details, especially the dramatic conclusion. George Eliot writes with a keen sense of humor, especially when addressing the grotesque in the human character. Her narrative has great depth, as insight to character and social observations are more important to Eliot than pace and action. \\"The Mill On The Floss\\" is deeply romantic - a work of great beauty and a literary classic.

Haight, with an Introduction by Dinah Birch further relating \\"Mill On The Floss\\" to George Eliot's own life and times.JANA"},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"A few thoughts on the characters:It seems to me like Eliot's task is to take these outwardly simple, perhaps typical characters, turn them inside out and examine their hidden complexities. This is, I think, a common desire for all fiction writers, but Eliot takes her cases from a class of people she herself says would be outwardly kind of crass and uninteresting.It reminds me of DH Lawrence, in a way, who made me doubt how incredibly complex and sensitive and insightful all these coal miners could really be. Beyond just the vocabulary, but to have the time, the attention, and the innate desire to feel things soooo so deeply and be so overcome by things like full moons and whatnot. I guess he should know, having been the son of one, but still. I certainly don't have any desire to feel anything deeply. Maybe because I'm one of those awful, over-educated people who know nothing but extinct languages and who can't lift a bale of hay. Although, I could lift one, if one were here. I might even still be able to lift two. But never mind.Dickens had caricatures, and Eliot also has characters who are objects of sarcasm or ridicule, but they also have complexity. Take Aunt Glegg, who was sooo horrid and strict with the children early on in the book. The passages depicting her martyrdom, her conversations with her longsuffering husband, and her self-imposed exiles to her room accompanied by a book about saints and a bowl of gruel -- are hilarious. However, it is this Aunt, by the same rules and internal system that made her awful initially, who is most generous and protective of Maggie later on, after the disgrace. That's what makes these characters good, and real -- they are not just meant to be lessons for us, or walking ideologies to be criticized, but they are living under human systems, each to their own. Maggie has hers too. And Tom. Both could have made different decisions to make their lives easier, but they strictly adhered to their own way."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"I must admit it took me a while to get into it, but once I did I was so glad I had persevered. This was my first George Eliot and after reading 'The Mill on the Floss' it won't be my last. The character development is fantastic, the story engaging and the whole thing is just a pleasure to read. My one complaint would be that the ending is far too depressing for my liking. Anyway, this is a great book and you will love Maggie Tulliver."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"Known to all as George Eliot's greatest creation, it's no wonder when you start reading from page one to the last. Through and through the power and spirit of the story is astounding, and a the end just shocks and volts one.While many authors go and create a happy ending just to satisfy readers and keep them as THEIR readers, Eliot did something unexpected, and aparently few people know how to appreciate such a different and original outcome. Life isn't always full of happy endings, but the eternal binding of brother and sister is true and touching."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"It begins with the satire and light-heartedness of a Dickens novel, which is gradually consumed by the emotional intensity and confusion characteristic of Austen, but sadly it never reaches the tragic depths of ' Anna Karenina', which in my opinion it so despretly wants. Because of this, it fails to find it's way and gets hoplessly lost in the third section, with unnecessary plot twists. Nonetheless, Elliot paints a real and beautiful scene of rural life wich is unsurpassable, but is let down by a dodgy climax, a shame for us and shameful for her."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"The truly amazing thing about George Eliot is her ability to make readers not just care, but actually ache for the characters in her novels. The tale of Maggie Tolliver has to be one of the most gut-wrenching in the whole of English literature. Unlike earlier reviewers, I found her trials totally believable, given the time in which she lived -- a time when women had absolutely no rights and were generally at the mercy of their fathers, brothers and husbands. I did not find the fact that Maggie's sense of duty, honor and decency forbade her from eloping with her cousin's fianc&eacute; the slightest bit implausible. What is sad is that modern-day readers mistake her nobility for &quot;wimpishness.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"Few females were writing fiction in those days, but it says a good thing about Great Britain that most of them were British. Mary Ann Evans, the real name of &quot;George Eliot&quot;, was an enlightened and socially conscious woman, who wrote a story about the Torvill family, from the standpoint of Maggie, a young girl with a sharp mind, struggling to be herself in a world which was hard for that kind of person. The central theme is perhaps her struggle between family loyalty and independent spirit, as revealed through her relationship with his beloved, but tough, brother. The book is long and evocative, painting with acuteness the social surroundings in which the story develops. And the development intertwines many messages and situations, always revealing Maggie's inner self. One important characteristic of the book is that it is difficult to classify, since it contains features of Romanticism and Realism; social narrative and a glimpse into what psyichological literature would be in the Twentieth century."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"This was a really sad, but really great novel. Granted, it's not an action packed novel, but if you like Dickens or Austen, and have a shred of patience (the novel is lengthy) you'll like this novel, too. I really felt for Maggie and her unrelenting desire to be loved and accepted by her family. Unfortunately, the way she goes about trying to earn their love and affections doesn't turn out the way she wants it to. This novel has it's share of melodrama, as much Victorian literature does. I liked this novel particularly because it doesn't center around passion/romance (although it has that too), but the love and closeness of family, and what a woman will do in order to have that. The characters in this novel are well written, and as shocked as I was by the ending, I thought it was really good. I was satisfied because finally there is a point in the story where I think Maggie was truly happy. I recommend this read wholeheartedly."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"George Eliot with her keen observation of human attribute, had written another novel about man's struggle with ephemeral follies and victorious governance of emotion towards what is right.This story preludes with sibling fondness of Tom and Maggie Tulliver with each other marred by the former's occassional bullyness and the latter's childish peevishness. As manifested on the personality of the brother and sister, Tom's perusal of Latin in boarding school where Philip Wakem also attends and excells fuels his repugnance towards the deformed Philip. During her visits to Tom, Maggie meets Philip whose intellectual interest matches hers and instantly initiates friendship with the physically deformed lad.To Maggie however, the feud between the Tullivers and Wakem clan doesn't put a damper on her clandestine meetings with Philip in the mill. Until she meets her cousin's lover Stephen Guest. Torn between Philip's undying love and Stephen's fleeting adoration, she finally succumbs to rendezvou with the young and handsome coxcomb.It is not unusual for a woman of caliber to make indelible mistakes and for a learned man to let his boorishness seeps out of the cracks of his soul. Nonetheless, a woman of higher intellect on command can disengage liquid glue that travels short distance from her brain to mend a broken heart.The novel ends with poetic justice. For relationships cultivated out of soil of deceit will bear sweet but poisonous fruit; and the toxic seeds will proliferate to feed the mouth hungry for misery."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"This book was beautifully written with many twists to the tale. The pace of the action, the language and atmosphere in the story reflect the era it was written and so richly portrays. George Eliot reveals herself to be a wonderful observer, with a dry wit and a 'reactionary' to the roles society enforced upon women. Her keen eye gives life to simple details such as flour covered spiders or the volumous attire of the ladies of a certain standing in society.This book, although written so long ago has the ability to keep us 'on our toes' and, at times, reflects prejudices that still hold true today. The sadness,tragedy and humour all combine to make a great read and I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"I have been promising myself for years that I would read some of the works of authors like Thomas Hardy and George Eliot. I started out by purchasing Mill on the Floss and was interested in reading about Maggie, her brother, and their relatives. I was very amused as the book progressed and the author, in a very subtle way, described Maggie's aunts and uncles in their narrow-mindedness and snobberies. Somewhere about the time that Maggie ran off and was taken in by gypsies, I became very bored and have not finished the book. I will probably pick it up again and fast-read to the end but I am not in a hurry to do this. The fault is in me, not in the book. In this day and age we readers are used to fast action and it is hard to stick with a slow-moving book like this.Perhaps I will edit this review after I finish the book--which I will do at some time."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"Ah...readers who do not know how to appreciate the structure and writing of classics should not even read them at all, even if they are required to for a class or course.A number one hit, telling the story of family and love."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"A young woman's brother won't let her marry or meet up with her flirts.

Was it a semiautobiographical account of Eliot herself? Was it simply an artistic failure? I will never know. One thing is for sure: This novel has no artistic meaning whatsoever. Up to the point where she is in love with Philip, even though their parents are enemies (Romeo &amp; Juliet? Only now it's even more pathetic since Philip is a hunchback), the book made at least some sense. Later, then, when she meets her cousin's fiance and falls in love with him she (Eliot) loses me completely. If we had the ending (as it were) right there without the introduction of the &quot;third party,&quot; then it might have been OK.

But generally her descriptions are way to long and that gave me the feeling that she was trying to hard to create some atmosphere. She simply over did it!

Boring, decidedly too long and with a detestable, foolish heroine. Why did Eliot wish to torture her readers?"},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"The Mill on the Floss, published in 1860, traces the turmoil in the life of Maggie Tulliver, a young woman who has a streak of independence but who also feels close to her father and her brother and believes that she must always honor their feelings and wishes. Maggie's father is the owner of the Dorlcote Mill on the Floss River, a failing business drawing him into increasing debt to his relatives and creditors. Her brother Tom, with no interest in the mill, is encouraged to learn other skills which may suit him for a higher level of society. When the mill fails and is sold at auction to Lawyer Wakem, the Tullivers become social outcasts, at the mercy of creditors and dependent on their extended family.Philip Wakem, son of Lawyer Wakem, is a hunchback who has been a school friend of Tom Tulliver and a special friend of Maggie, who treats him kindly and appreciates his intelligence and thoughtfulness. When the mill is sold to Wakem, Tom and Mr. Tulliver end all contact with the Wakem family, and though Maggie continues to see Philip privately, Tom eventually forces her to choose between the family and Philip. Another relationship with Stephen Guest, who has been courting her cousin Lucy, unleashes Maggie's passions and leads to a dramatic conclusion.Throughout the novel George Eliot (the pen name of Mary Ann Evans) explores the many kinds of love in Maggie's life--her devoted love of her father, her dependence on and love for her brother, her intellectual and kindly love for Philip, and her passionate love of Stephen Guest. Creating a fully drawn character in Maggie, Eliot shows a full picture of a young woman of 1860, trying to be independent, trying to live according to society's strictures, and trying to be true to her own feelings, despite pressures from family and society. Eliot, who herself made the scandalous choice to live openly with a married man for twenty-six years, was thoroughly familiar with these issues herself, and her depictions of such themes as family loyalty and the social conventions and limitations of class carry the ring of truth.Psychologically astute in the exploration of themes as they affect Maggie, Eliot amplifies these themes through imagery from nature, legend, and even religion. Often melodramatic in plot, the novel remains realistic, even autobiographical, in its attention to character. Though it is not as fully developed as her later novel Middlemarch, Mill on the Floss is still a well developed, thoughtful novel which goes far beyond the pulp fiction being serialized in newspapers and magazines during that time.

Her blind love for Tom was understandable to a point, but today's woman would most likely not put up with his scorn and narrow-mindedness. If you don't enjoy reading lengthy sentences chalk full of descriptions, I would not recommend this book. On the other hand, if you like that kind of slow, but interesting reading, you will Mill on the Floss."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"I read this book for a Victorian writer's group. I must admit that at first I was sorry this novel had been selected to represent the time period, because I have read books by Jane Austen, the Bronte sisters and many other novelists whose writing certainly draws you into their stories more quickly. However, I am glad that I persevered to finish the book. Yes, there is a very long set-up, and yes, a huge amount of action occurrs in the last 150 pages of this 650-page novel. But read on--it's worth it.The novel essentially tells the story of the Tulliver and Dodson families, who live in the town of St. Oggs, known for its middle-class ethics and narrow-mindedness. Mr. Tulliver is married to a former Miss Dodson. The Dodsons are a fairly prosperous family of four sisters and their husbands. Mr. Tulliver is a somewhat less well-off miller, and a major theme of the novel is the way that Mrs. Tulliver's sisters believe that in marrying Mr. Tulliver, she married beneath herself and brought shame upon the family...The Tullivers have two children--Tom and Maggie. Tom is responsible and hard-working, but has an overdeveloped sense of morality and is constantly punishing Maggie for her shortcomings. Maggie does not seem to belong in St. Ogg's; she is a little wild and free-spirited, qualities that do not endear her to the Dodson sisters of the townsfolk in general. She also worships her brother, despite her inability to live up to his demands. The story unfolds as Tom and Maggie come of age...There are a lot of vivid and interesting characters in this book. I found the Dodson aunts particularly interesting. Maggie's character is probably the most memorable in the novel--she becomes a unique kind of heroine particularly when one considers her goal in life, which is to bring happiness to everyone else while she completely sacrifices her own hapiness.The most memorable aspect of this novel to me is the concept of egoism. While each character's trials is the most central theme in his or her own life, in the grand scheme of things, their troubles are minute and unmemorable. This is a timeless theme, that is as important to bear in mind today as it was when the novel was written.This novel can be difficult to read. The paragraphs can be exceedingly long, sometimes 2-3 pages. There is not a lot of dialogue, as Eliot is more concerned with the characters' inward struggles. Finally, not a lot happens in the first 350 or so pages. However, struggle through the somewhat dull beginning. The ending is exciting and heartbreaking, and will stay with you for a long while."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"In a study on societal themes in the novel, Elizabeth Langland argues that novelists of Eliot's era depict the \\"family as a haven, as an environment in which the guilty or erring individual can expect shelter, but that haven brings with it the right to censure.\\" From the perspective of Tom Tulliver in \\"The Mill on the Floss,\\" his sister Maggie sorely tests--and eventually relinquishes--this familial right to safe haven. Even as a child, Maggie was a censure-prone tomboyish rebel. When visiting Tom at his school, she exclaims, \\"But I shall be a clever woman.\\" To which Tom retorts, \\" . . . and a nasty conceited thing. Everybody'll hate you.\\" From the earliest age, whether she's raggedly cutting her hair in a fit of pique or tramping through mud in her Sunday dress or just wanting to do what boys do, Maggie just doesn't know her place.Eliot's novel, in some ways, resembles a typical Victorian-era bildungsroman; we follow a young child who develops into an adult of some degree of independence. But where her fictional counterparts must overcome foolishness, ignorance, poverty, or class, Maggie has the additional burden of struggling against the constraints of being a woman ahead of her time. Other than courtship, a husband, and children, There could be no \\"great expectations\\" for someone as intelligent as Maggie. A generation later, Edward Carpenter would note, \\"There was only one profession possible for a middle-class woman--to be a governess--and to adopt that was to become a pariah.\\" Or as literary scholar Carolyn Heilbrun put it, \\"In literature and out, through all recorded history, women have lived by a script they did not write\\"; Maggie's only fault is that she wants to write her own script.Maggie's life becomes even more complicated when her bumbling, obstinate father loses the farm in an ill-advised lawsuit against an attorney--whose son Maggie has secretly befriended. With the demise of Mr. Tulliver (who humored and even supported Maggie's \\"cleverness\\"), Tom assumes the role of the family patriarch and finds in himself a dormant authoritarian streak enhanced by an insufferable moral rectitude and an innate intellectual dullness. Tom, for all his newfound righteousness, still learns to come to terms with adult society, while Maggie, for all her sudden beauty, finds it difficult to act like a proper lady. And things only worsen when she is pursued by her cousin's fianc&eacute;.The irony of Maggie's struggle against the demands of her brother and the strictures of society is that, while her intentions are noble and her cleverness is substantial, she is sacrificed on the altar of circumstance. \\"Character is destiny,\\" quotes Eliot, adding, \\"but not the whole of our destiny,\\" and what happens to Maggie is \\"a great tragedy in consequence.\\" Maggie is ultimately judged in the courtroom of the salon, represented by the Greek chorus of her aunts, whom Eliot depicts with Dickensian wickedness and mirth. The three Dodson sisters provide much-needed comic relief throughout the novel, especially when things turn grim for Maggie, and through her portrayal of these three women Eliot skewers the pretentiousness and hypocrisy of social traditions.\\"It is a sordid life, you say, this of the Tullivers and the Dodsons,\\" admits Eliot, but understanding this \\"oppressive narrowness\\" is essential to comprehending the limitations placed on the lives of both Tom and Maggie. \\"The Mill on the Floss\\" is superb not only in its overt feminist themes but also in its criticism of the human aversion to nonconformity. In such a society, not even the haven of one's family can protect an honest and intelligent woman from isolation or ruin."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"\\"The Mill on the Floss\\" is by far one of my favorite text from George Eliot (Marian Evans). I may be a little biased as I have used this text as a basis for an independent study on kinship relations in Victorian England as well as a paper on the domestication of women.This is the most autobiographical of all of Eliot's works with Maggie and Tom Tulliver being based on herself and her brother Issac. The similarities between Marian Evans and Maggie Tulliver dominate the texts; however, the relationship between Tom and Maggie propels in a far different way than that of Marian and Issac. Maggie's main purpose throughout the text is to find love. Love completes her. Her first feelings of love come from her brother and throughout her life, she seeks what can be perceived as a \\"pseudo-brother\\" in the men she relates to.This text is a thrilling ride for those especially interested in the suppressed female in the Victorian Era. With an omnipresent third person narrator that occasionally speaks his/her mind, Eliot creates a fabric about the inter-working of families and the social construct in Victorian Society."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"The most obvious thing about \\"The Mill on the Floss\\" is the quality of writing. You can't argue with that. It's vivid, with wonderful descriptions, and many lovely parts. George Eliot writes of an incredible place, describing everything and making everything easy to visualize. She writes of characters that are so human and real, and then she describes situations with these real characters and everything works so well. Her writing is undeniably good, so now we need to move onto the plot itself.Here we have the Tullivers. Maggie is our heroine, starting out as a very young girl. She adores and idolizes her brother, loves her father, and rather disdains everything society wants her to be. She's independent, different, and bold. She'll do anything for Tom, her brother, and at the same time she wants to be herself. As she grows up, she finds that these two parts of her will fight against each other: her independence, or her beloved older brother.Tom is also an interesting character. Our first view of him is from Maggie's adoring eyes, so we find him to be strong, intelligent, and all-knowing. It becomes clear, though, that Tom also enjoys having a certain level of command over his sister, and he very often gives her ultimatums for their friendship. In situations like these, Maggie, trying so hard to please him, gets very hurt, and then Tom would act superior and ignore her. Tom lives strictly in the \\"black or the white\\" - for him there is no gray.Much of the book is simply about their relationship as they are growing up, but many parts revolve around other, slightly more minor characters. For example, Philip Wakem. Philip, a schoolmate of Tom's and a friend of Maggie's enters and leaves and reenters the story many times. At first he seems like a minor but solid character, but he then becomes very fixed in the plot as Maggie's secret, forbidden friend. He demonstrates a case of Tom's orders to Maggie. Stephen Guest is another example. He fell in love with Maggie and tried to elope with her. Maggie refused, though by the time she was able to return home, Tom had deduced the worst, once again demonstrating his \\"black or white\\" policy. Tom rejects Maggie, and Maggie has to leave.The main character is without a doubt Maggie, Maggie who feels such love for the people around her, wants to please them and receive love in return, and wants to be independent. Maggie struggles against so many things throughout this book (I won't reveal them all) and all sort of lead up to the grand finale, which may possibly be the best part of this wonderful book. Everything is written wonderfully, the characters are so rich and interesting, and the plot is never stale. It's an excellent book that I couldn't put down once I started.I recommend this whole-heartedly, and urge you to go buy it or borrow it from the library. It's a wonderful piece of writing that is so easy to love."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"Oh, my, this book was wonderful. I devoured all 600 pages in a week. The kind of book to read during the winter, curled up in a warm sweater while you drink a cup of hot chocolate. The writing is just beautiful-- the characters fully drawn and interesting. I fully identified with Maggie (the protagonist) as she moved through her very moral, principled life. She has many complicated relationships with people that are just a joy to read about. If you like Victorian novels, do not miss this one. I've heard Middlemarch is even better and I can't wait."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"Early in the novel, Eliot tells the great story of St. Ogg, who selflessly carried the Virgin Mary across a flooded river. The story pretty much frames the themes of the whole novel. The society of The Mill on the Floss is harsh, and the main characters must find it in themselves to live compassionately despite actions of the people aroung them.This tragedy is primarily the story of Maggie. Her father's unwitting actions spark the family's financial downfall. In the Victorian society, this downfall is particularly harsh toward women like Maggie. She has to struggle against the deterministic forces fighting against her.A lot of people don't like the opening hundred pages, but I thought they were some of the best. There was some wonderful biting humor, some extraordinary characterizations (particularly of Mr. Tulliver), some powerful imagery (look at the descriptions of the river), and real humanity. These elements carry on throughout the novel, and the plot picks up, too. Overall, this is a wonderful novel. Perhaps it is not Eliot's best, but it is too good to pass up."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"This is a deeply sad book, and that was all the spoiler I needed. I could see from page minus 20, somewhere in the introduction, that Maggie was (as the song says) born to lose. The details of how she lost, I thought and feared, would be impossible to take: after hurting me for five hundred pages, the book would kill me with its last ten.I was wrong, in fact. The book's a tragedy, but it has a cozy, cheery ending for a tragedy. I felt better when the book was over. I forgot how good Victorians were at writing upbeat endings, even in their saddest stuff. I forgot, too, that there's a large mixture of dialect comedy in the book, along with excellent suspense, so Eliot knows how to keep her readers laughing and stay popular. She made a fortune off this book.But let's look at some complaints that have been made. The heroine, Maggie Tulliver, is extremely bright -- and as a woman, she can't be sent to school by her rich but totally unintellectual country parents. Her much dumber brother is sent to school, hates school but ends up making good money, misunderstands and refuses to speak to his intelligent sister.That is the theme of the book: how the brother hurts the sister because he is a practical man who doesn't understand or respect intelligence. The reader has her nose rubbed in this theme from the beginning to the end. At the beginning, nine-year-old Maggie absent-mindedly forgets all about the rabbits her thirteen-year-old brother asked her to look after while he was away. He asked another farmworker to look after them too, and the farmworker also forgot. The unreliable farmworker is (to the brother) just a loser employee, but Maggie he punishes for her absent-mindedness. He refuses to speak to her, and of course the reader is very close to being on the brother's side. The rabbits die. They don't get saved by luck or by some other guy. They die of starvation.In other words, Eliot does not desert her theme or cover it with sugar. Intelligent girls can be absent-minded to a murderous degree, and no one thinks girls deserve an education in any case. A practical money-making man is obviously superior to a dreamy girl who deserves no education in the first place. Look: the girl kills rabbits! The boy gets practical things done! Maybe, reader, you'll agree that the girl would be better off dead.That's how deep the hook is sunk to begin with, and the following narrative only sinks it deeper. When she grows up, Maggie commits herself to an intelligent hunchback, but then falls in lust with a handsome, shallow man who likes her looks. Maggie's love is wrong. She knows that with her head and heart, but her head and heart aren't all there is to her. She wants the guy. Obviously, and many readers agreed at the time the book was written, and still agree now, Maggie is no good. She's slutty. She would be better off never having been born. When her brother got mad at her about the rabbits, he forgave her because he was thirteen and because, among tough country people, dead rabbits don't register very heavily. But when he's an adult and she's a slut, he never speaks to her again, just like George Eliot's own brother never spoke to her again when she started living with a married man.That is the theme of the book. The theme of the book is not that intelligent women are lovable because they're so smart and never act slutty because, at nineteen, their passions are totally under their intelligent control. Jane Austen's themes are a tiny little bit like that, because she doesn't mind always leading up to a happy marriage (and I underline _always_). Eliot wanted to make a slightly different point: you don't have to like us, but don't you have to let us live? Can't we, like men, do some good even when we're bad guys in the bedroom and don't much care about cute little animals?The struggle to ask these questions makes this a scary book. The reader is afraid she will be hurt and disgusted even more than she has been already. In fact, the book ends tragically but calmingly.Or does it ever end? People complain that Eliot moralizes too much, but how can she have moralized too much when the moral point she wanted to make is still not made, when her heroine Maggie is still seen by some as a dislikeable rabbit-killing slut, a century and a half after she was created? How can Eliot have argued too much when all her argument failed to get her point across?Perhaps her point will always fail to get across. That would be sadder than THE MILL ON THE FLOSS."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"This is a book that I would highly recommend to anyone. While I don't believe that this story can be placed in real life, I think that it does typify the style of literature in this period.In Maggie, there is someone who is truly an innocent, but through her life, teaches herself to take what life gives her and not fight for the things she truly loves. Only at the end, does she realize that she does have to have some kind of passion in her life. However, her duty/need to be accepted by her family tugs her in the opposite direction.In Tom, the duty to family is exemplified--to an extreme. His narrowness drives people away, and although he is to be respected for his drive to overcome, it comes at a high price. It is left to the reader to decide if it was truly worth the cost.Phillip, in my mind, is the hero of the story. Born with a deformity, he is accepted by those one would think would shun him. His outlook is to find passion in everything--for instance, if you don't sing well, don't let that stop you...as long as you are passionate about it, it will be fine. In Maggie, he finds someone that he can care about and who cares about him.Be ready for a great story."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"Is George Eliot the world's greatest novelist? There's certainly an argument to be made, based on her classics Middlemarch and Daniel Deronda, which feature characters as complex and vividly, bafflingly alive as those of Shakespeare.Yet today she seems curiously unread and under-appreciated, certainly in comparison to her contemporary, Charles Dickens. This has long mystified me, but perhaps I've found the solution in Mill on the Floss.Seemingly the best known of her books, Mill on the Floss is certainly the one most frequently taught in high schools and colleges. And it's probably enough to guarantee that most students forced through it or its Cliff Notes won't bother with her again.Not that it's a bad book. If you like Eliot, you'll find plenty of her riveting, obsessive characterization and dramatic psychology here. But along with these come a fractured, frustrating structure, a dearth of narrative drive, and endless passages of phonetic, &quot;naturalistic&quot; rural accents. Not to mention an ending so out of left field it seems to belong to an entirely different story. Unlike Middlemarch and Daniel Deronda, or even early but more successful novels like Adam Bede, Mill on the Floss is work, and its rewards are more modest.Mill on the Floss seems to rate the academic attention because of its autobiographical elements, perhaps for its dazzling heroine, rather than its overall quality. So don't let an underwhelmed response to this fascinating if flawed book keep you from the rest of her amazing work -- she might be the best novelist out there."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"Compare it not to DAVID COPPERFIELD but to Proust. I don't understand calling this book \\"sentimental\\" or \\"melodramatic.\\" Big Things happen, yes, many of them inside the characters' heads, and they all pay their way in tragic resonance. Big Things are felt, yes, and anatomized with scrupulous truthfulness. The prose is glorious, and the characters presented with such subtlety and complexity that a reader can only feel extravagantly complimented on his intelligence.If you're stranded on a desesrt island for the rest of your life and can have only one novel with you, make it REMEMBRANCE OF THINGS PAST. But if you're stranded on a desert island and have only a week to live, make it MILL ON THE FLOSS.By the way, Byatt's notes and introduction are terrific. (You will read the introduction after reading the book, of course.) She's plainly aware of all the traditional critical assessments of the novel, but isn't afraid to bust some of the hoary objections historically raised to the novel, most of them relating to the double-standard with which mostly male academics tend to treat female protagonists in fiction."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"This is a marvelous study of a character -- George Eliot was a genuine craftswoman -- you cannot help but feel her love for her characters, nor can you help delighting in the way she so finely sculpts them into souls.

We see her evolve upon her very human path -- we come to love her family and friends, even with their faults.

Eliot veers between portraying her as a self-assured, if &quot;naughty&quot;, girl (who can envision herself as queen of the gypsies - a charming scene) and woman paralyzed by self-doubt and familial tyranny. While the author deserves credit for presenting a character with psychological complexity, the treatment was so heavy-handed that it exhausted my interest without satisfying my curiosity. Overall, this book struck me as uninspired and formulaic, both in terms of plot and descriptive imagery. Indeed, the primary &quot;humorous&quot; characters (Bob and Aunt Glegg) really only clicked in the one scene they shared. Eliot did provide some treats, of course, particularly in describing the relationship between Mr. and Mrs. Tulliver.Eliot addressed the theme of self-abnegation beautifully in Middlemarch (pointing to Teresa of Avila as the model) and Adam Bede - two far superior books. This book does not convincingly explain why the heroine was willing to sacrifice so much for an abusive, unsympathetic brother. The conclusion to &quot;Mill&quot; is particularly unsatisfactory. It feels like the author has written herself into a corner and has to invoke natural catastrophe to extricate herself. George Eliot is a great author, but you need to read her other books to see why."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"Very good book, it held my interest from the very first page. I highly recommend this classic. It's a Must Read!"},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"How do you balance duty to your family against duty to yourself? Brother and sister Tom and Maggie Tulliver wrestle with this problem throughout The Mill on the Floss, guided (and misguided) by the opinions of a host of friends and relatives. Both accept different kind of burdens and cause each other different kinds of problems, and each suffers - one way or another - in the name of duty.Eliot fights against the influence of class, money, gender, and even handicap, repeatedly showing that being a good person is independent of these things, and this alone makes her a fairly modern read, although we have made so much progress in these areas in 150+ years that it is occasionally difficult to appreciate the seriousness of certain actions her characters take. For example, we don't think much today of a man and woman spending time alone together, but in Eliot's time, this would ruin a woman's reputation forever unless he married her. We also don't take family obligations quite as seriously, so it's important to remember that people were willing to do quite a bit to defend the honor of their families.With over a dozen people to keep track of, I kept updating a list of names in the front cover, and I found that a big help. I recommend this to anyone reading this book for the first time - especially when it comes to the various Aunts and Uncles and their particular idiosyncrasies."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"The merits of the novel deserve a more worthy arena to be debated and highlighted. It is specifically with the Penguin Classics Edition in mind that I write this review. A.S. Byatt offers an introduction that well-becomes the subject and the now absolutely essential appendix \\"The Placing of Stephen Guest\\". Anyone who has read the book or plans to do so in the near future, must read the said appendix for it proves to be of incredible and indelible insight into the awkward presence of Maggie's lover Stephen Guest."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"George Eliot (1821-1880) is one of the great literary artists in the Victorian (or any!) era. In this novel she tells the tragic tale of Maggie and Tom Tulliver growing up on the FlossRiver in the small village of St. Ogg's in Lincolnshire. Maggie and Tom have a complicated relationship which ends in tragedy.Tom is non-intellectual, something of a bully and a braggart; heis also loyal to his family assisting his father and looking out for what he thinks is best for his kidsister Maggie.Maggie is similar to George Eliot. She is plain, highly intellectual, a bookworm and a romantic who is courted by thesuave Stephen Guest and the physically frail Phillip Wakem. As in Romeo and Juliet the lovers are separated by a hatred between Maggie's father and the wealthy Mr. Waken who owns the Mill.While I think Middlemarch is her greatest novel this one, in my opinion, is a close second! It is warmer in tone filled withscenes of rural life in mid nineteenth century England. Somereaders will become irritated with her use of dialogue but I hadno trouble following the story.Eliot is great in using the rich symbolism of the river as she weaves this classic story which will be perused as long as their are English readers to savor her poetical prose tale of provinical life. They don't write them like this anymore!Don't miss this classic!"},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"The Mill on the Floss, published in 1860, traces the turmoil in the life of Maggie Tulliver, a young woman who has a streak of independence but who also feels close to her father and her brother and believes that she must always honor their feelings and wishes. Maggie's father is the owner of the Dorlcote Mill on the Floss River, a failing business drawing him into increasing debt to his relatives and creditors. Her brother Tom, with no interest in the mill, is encouraged to learn other skills which may suit him for a higher level of society. When the mill fails and is sold at auction to Lawyer Wakem, the Tullivers become social outcasts, at the mercy of creditors and dependent on their extended family.Philip Wakem, son of Lawyer Wakem, is a hunchback who has been a school friend of Tom Tulliver and a special friend of Maggie, who treats him kindly and appreciates his intelligence and thoughtfulness. When the mill is sold to Wakem, Tom and Mr. Tulliver end all contact with the Wakem family, and though Maggie continues to see Philip privately, Tom eventually forces her to choose between the family and Philip. Another relationship with Stephen Guest, who has been courting her cousin Lucy, unleashes Maggie's passions and leads to a dramatic conclusion.Throughout the novel George Eliot (the pen name of Mary Ann Evans) explores the many kinds of love in Maggie's life--her devoted love of her father, her dependence on and love for her brother, her intellectual and kindly love for Philip, and her passionate love of Stephen Guest. Creating a fully drawn character in Maggie, Eliot shows a full picture of a young woman of 1860, trying to be independent, trying to live according to society's strictures, and trying to be true to her own feelings, despite pressures from family and society. Eliot, who herself made the scandalous choice to live openly with a married man for twenty-six years, was thoroughly familiar with these issues herself, and her depictions of such themes as family loyalty and the social conventions and limitations of class carry the ring of truth.Psychologically astute in the exploration of themes as they affect Maggie, Eliot amplifies these themes through imagery from nature, legend, and even religion. Often melodramatic in plot, the novel remains realistic, even autobiographical, in its attention to character. Though it is not as fully developed as her later novel Middlemarch, Mill on the Floss is still a well developed, thoughtful novel which goes far beyond the pulp fiction being serialized in newspapers and magazines during that time. n Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"This is Eliot's semi autobiographical novel, and tells the story of Maggie Tulliver and her brother Tom. The story takes place in the village of St. Ogg, and at the Mill on The Floss that's been in the Tulliver family for generations. Other reviewers have told enough of the story (in some instances too much) that I don't see the need to go into it again. I thoroughly enjoyed the way Eliot depicted the sibling relationship between Maggie and Tom with all of those ups and downs that we all have experienced with our siblings, and culminating in the final finish of the story that thoroughly blew me away. I think I just sat for a good ten minutes just saying Oh Wow over and over again, and then felt the need to seek out my brothers and give them both a big hug.The joy of reading this novel or any other by Eliot is her gorgeous prose and brilliant characterizations, even with the minor characters. Just be warned, this is not an action packed, sit on the edge of your seat, can't put it down until it's finished type of novel. This is a story to savor and enjoy the multi-faceted characters and the author's glorious prose like a fine red wine or a box of chocolates (or both). If you are looking for high action and adventure, this is not the book for you. Highly recommended for any lover of 19th century English literature, not as dark and brooding as Hardy can be, but the prose is just as lovely, if not better."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"The Mill on the Floss has one of the most appealing young girl characterss of all 19th c. literature--Maggie Tolliver. The relationship between her and her brother is at once beautiful, horrible, and probably indicative of much that was true for boys and girls in 19th century England. Whenever I read the book (and I've read it a few times), I am again in love with Maggie, delighted with the people around her, and saddened by the heavy events that bring her down. George Eliot doesn't pull punches--when you've read one of her books, you know you've been somewhere else, experienced something powerful"},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"I read this book for a Victorian Lit/Graduate class and I was a bit put off because others, who had read it before, disparaged it as tedious. Yet again, I learned that one cannot judge by means of conformity (ever!). This is perhaps one of the best Victorian novels ever written. Seriously.Maggie is the slightly wayward and tomboyish (but undeniably goodhearted) daughter of a proud, stubborn, and provincial man, and a dull witted, ridiculous mother. She is sister to an immature and exasperating brother who believes he possesses the very kernel of justice within his beliefs and actions, but in truth is a selfish and undeniably cruel \\"bastard.\\" Lastly, she is a companion (and \\"potential\\" lover) to Philip, the deformed, yet soft-spoken and educated son of her father's worst enemy...The Mill on the Floss is a novel of sacrifice and determination, revenge and forgiveness, society and selfhood. And in case anyone cares, I read this 400+ page novel in two days. Not because of a dealine I had to meet, but because I could not seem to put it down.Interested yet? Listen, if you already know that you love Victorian literature, you will not be disappointed in this text. It is absolutely full of surprises. Granted, the ending could be infinitely better, but alas it is what it is. Regardless, the ending of a book is not necessarily where its merit is at.Furthermore, if you are into Queer Theory, you might find this text interesting reading as it plays with gender roles and expectations throughout.George Eliot (i.e., Mary Ann Evans) was a master and equivalent, in my opinion, to the great Charles Dickens."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"This book is the reason I became a literature major.That's all."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"I had to read Mill on the Floss for school, and although I thought it was wonderfully written, I found it hard to identify with Maggie. Her blind love for Tom was understandable to a point, but today's woman would most likely not put up with his scorn and narrow-mindedness. If you don't enjoy reading lengthy sentences chalk full of descriptions, I would not recommend this book. On the other hand, if you like that kind of slow, but interesting reading, you will Mill on the Floss."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"This was a very engrossing reread for me. Maggie Tulliver is indeed a very sympathetic and engrossing character and Eliot's writing is superb. I (like Marie Ann Evans herself) much prefer this powerful, diluvian tempest of a novel to what is considered her masterpiece, Middlemarch, for several reasons: It has more of the author's passion in it. It has more of the fullness of human nature, in general, in it and, most of all, I finally understand - My first reading of this book was as an adolescent. - Eliot's influence on Proust.In describing Maggie's childhood to the reader, Eliot asks: \\"Is there any one who can recover the experience of his childhood, not merely with a memory of what he did and what happened to him, of what he liked and disliked when he was in frock and trousers, but with an intimate penetration, a revived consciousness - when it was so long from one Midsummer to another?\\" A madeleine anyone?Any high-strung, sensitive reader is bound to relate intensely to poor, fierce, impressionable Maggie's travails. She is so sensitive that Eliot describes her as having \\"little more power of concealing the impressions made upon her than if she had been constructed of musical strings.\\" And she has Maggie herself say: \\"Certain strains of music affect me so strangely - I can never hear them without changing my whole attitude for a time, and if the effect would last, I might be capable of heroisms.\\" One is reminded of the \\"little passage\\" from Vinteuil's sonata and its profound effect upon Swann and, later, upon Proust's narrator himself.But, back to the novel itself: It really has nothing of the drawing rooms of Jane Austen in it - save to set these settings in relief for the reader's ridicule. It more resembles the novels of the Brontes, particularly Emily's Wuthering Heights and parts of Charlotte's Villette. It also contains what I consider one of the finest statements advocating the reading of great literature found anywhere. Thus, this passage (End of Book VII, Chapter II) is worth quoting at length:\\"All people of broad, strong sense have an instinctive repugnance to men of maxims; because such people early discern that the mysterious complexity of our life is not to be embraced by maxims, and that to lace ourselves up in formulas of that sort is to repress all the divine promptings and inspirations that spring from growing insight and sympathy.\\"The only reasons I'm giving it four rather than five stars are due to a certain unevenness in narrative voice that jars at times and to a Dickensian flatness of some of the characters. Nevertheless, recommended to all readers of \\"broad, strong sense,\\" who might just want to pick up Proust after reading this truly harrowing novel by a worthy predecessor."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"I just love George Eliot, and this book is no exception.

In my opinion, this novel is not as good as MIddlemarch, which I take to be the greatest of all 19th-cent. English novels, but it is a fine portrait of an intelligent young woman strangled and constricted by the society in which she lives, a recurrent theme in Eliot's fiction. Maggie Tulliver is a slightly lesser version of Dorthea Brooke in Middlemarch. I recommend both, but they move at a leisurely pace."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"I chose this book because it is aclassic which I read years ago.The ending was quite sad,but I enjoyed it"},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"I have thoroughly enjoyed every George Eliot book I have read. Daniel Deronda and Middlemarch are two of my all time favorites; now will add The Mill on the Floss to the list."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"This book was very hard to put down. I found myself longing for happiness and love for Lucy and Maggie and Tom and Philip and Stephen. I was matching them up in my head--well if this pairing doesn't work out--perhaps these would be better? I am so accustomed to seeing people paired off--to hoping that the fairy tale can be perpetuated once more. Why not life happily ever after? Is it so hard to imagine?Well, yes, when people's lives are complicated by authoritarian parents and siblings. childhood friendships, financial reversals, family feuds, a physically-challenged friend, uncharitable neighbors, and so-called family disgrace to name just a few flies in the ointment hampering the path of true love. This is not to mention the personal conflicts inside the people in question and at least one woman's struggle to make sense of romantic love and moral duty to one's self and neighbor.This story would be considered a tragedy and yet I didn't cry. I am one of those people who can't cry at hopeless situations. Romeo and Juliet? Sorry but I find the tears streaming down my face when the end of the story finds two people running happily to meet one another--ala Julia Roberts and her lover in the movie Eat, Pray, Love!Give me complications but give me some sweetness by story's end. This story is bittersweet. But will the characters stay with you and live on in your memory? I think so. And if you can't cry as I couldn't, perhaps you'll chuckle occasionally because the small-town people serve up some memorable tidbits. (Please take note that much ado is made about linens and china and other household trivia.) Beware that George Eliot's prose is rich with dialect and very complex sentences. But it's rich in ideas and if you're like me you'll find yourself suffering right along with the characters."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"i thought this book would be slow and not all that enjoyable but i was wrong.it is beautifuully written and quite compelling.as a result i acessed other books by the same writer.currently i am reading (adam bede) which is slow but (silas marner)was good also.in my opinion this is george eliot;s best work."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"One of the best historical novels ever written.

It is certainly a period piece, but the writing is sufficiently masterful to hold this reader's attention, indeed, grippingly. What I appreciated especially was that the whole, long story was character-driven. The marvelous character of Maggie is drawn vividly from the start and evolves consistently throughout. Another rich and dominant personage is her father, Mr. Tulliver. But ultimately every one of the large cast comes into his or her own. An additional attraction for a philosophical ethicist such as myself is that the struggle between desire and duty is portrayed in plot and word as eloquently and vividly as could be wished. (Sometimes too eloquently, perhaps, if it can be believed that people spoke in such perfect disquisitions. But Eliot shows herself capable of depicting every form of speech and vernacular.) I don't even mean \\"desire\\" so much as the whole range of \\"tempting\\" consequences from childish willfulness to mature fulfillment, which are pitted against dictates of conscience having their own passionate and reasoned tugs. What is shown is that both \\"sides\\" of our nature form a tangled skein in our motives, with neither the \\"winner.\\" Both duty and desire are legitimate; yet both are flawed - the latter prone to weakness and sophistry, the former to rigidity and pride. The only reason I gave this book 4 instead of 5 stars is that the ending struck me as abrupt, arbitrary, and unsatisfying; for the reader is kept guessing until the very last page about whether this will be a comedy (= happy ending) or a tragedy. The book has moments of hilarity (like everything else, character-driven) along with wrenching dilemmas. What with so much intricacy of plot and several possibilities of a tidy wrapping-up, it would seem a cop-out simply to end with utter finality and yet things in disarray. Perhaps that was a convention of the times. (I recall that, to satisfy his readers, Dickens imposed a saccharine ending on Great Expectations; and I recently read that Woody Allen had a similar reason for the ending of Hannah and Her Sisters.) Or maybe, as the book \\"sinks in\\" further (for I have only just read it), I will eventually sense an inevitability and become reconciled to the aptness of the closing Eliot chose."},{"Title":"The Mill on the Floss (Bantam Classic)","review":"This novel begins with an excellent exmaination of childhood and introduces us to a brother and sister who really don't know each other in some fundamental ways. Maggie is a girl with depth and true character and her brother simply considers her rebellious. The novel is a fascinating look at an insular world, social constraints and the place of Woman. I found the family discussions comic and truthful, and Maggie's later struggles very real. The ending left me tired and feeling somewhat manipulated . . .but also weeping. Truly great."},{"Title":"My Life in the NYPD: Jimmy the Wags","review":"Not since Target Blue, have I read a book that so captures the true essence of the NYPD.

The author comes off as the real deal, and does not use a lot of overly dramatic terms to get his points across, he just lets the stories speak for themselves.

Very well written Mr. Wagner! Hope to see more from you in the future."},{"Title":"My Life in the NYPD: Jimmy the Wags","review":"A terrific memoir of life as a cop on the streets of New York's tough Alphabet City neighborhood. Wags' book is loaded with fascinating, well told stories. Especially moving is the author's recollections of his dad, also a police officer, and how they would sit side by side listening to \\"Dragnet\\" on the radio. The experience apparently fueled Wags' dreams of becoming a New York City cop. My Life In The NYPD is much more enjoyable than Wags' earlier book about his catastrophic \\"career\\" as a PI/bodyguard which ended in a felony conviction. Aside from a nasty, totally unneccessary intro by racist, homophobic shock jock Don Imus, this is a unqualified five star read. Assuming he must have at least a dozen more great tales of his life as one of New York's Finest, I hope Wags finds time to write a sequel."},{"Title":"My Life in the NYPD: Jimmy the Wags","review":"I don't read much.

There is such a thing as poetic license but this was pure fiction!As n X member of his (sadly deluded) followers, who visited the spot where he fell (landed, hoped to bounce), whatever.......There was no bulls eye.A circle with a dot in the center was one of our most important meditations.It is possible that the washing of the pavement after the incident, may have deleted any painting, but NONE of our group ever mentioned seeing it.If any of them had seen it on their daily visits, they would have given it great spiritual import.The real story was actually more interesting.One of our number had died and Oric had persuaded 7 of our group that the poor young man was Lazarus and would arise if they stayed with the 'corpse' and waited with faith.(While Oric went to Egypt, I seem to remember) Only 5 of the 'seven seven pillars' stayed with Stephan's body for the whole 9 weeks.This was the body not reported.Oric was left with the option of going to a shabby courtroom and confessing to a misdemeanor or declaring he was Christ Incarnate and dealing with the consequences.He chose to jump from his 10th floor apartment window.I'm pretty sure he thought his Father would save him.Guess he didn't!As for me..I was the best person I could ever be for a few short years.

Instead what i got was one of the finest books I have ever read period. The reason this book works so well is because Wags has no ego. No stories are present in a way to make him a hero and honesty rings throughout the entire book. The other reviewers have already mentioned the layout of the book so I will only say that this book contains stories you will never forget. I work in NYC and it is extremely interesting to read about the City in to 70s and 80s when it was cesspool..it really makes one appreciate Guliani and the miracle he performed. If I had to draw a parallel to this book, I would compare it to the best of Wambaugh. Wags write about so many fascinating characters that each chapter is like a mini book unto itself.

Written in a no-nonsense style, here is a book about New York that you can really get your teeth into. If you know NYC, then you know that there is little, if any, exaggeration. Truth is indeed stranger than fiction, and every one of the weird situations and perverted personalities has the ring of truth. What a great adventure it was for me, who was a teenager on the streets of New York, to read what was really going on behind the scenes, the stories you never got to read. This isn't just a book about brutality in the streets. Wagner is a cop with a heart, and had a passion for his job. Although the tone is often nostalgic, it is never overly sentimental or mawkish. Here is a beautiful kaleidoscope of the city in all its rawness. Read it and see!"},{"Title":"My Life in the NYPD: Jimmy the Wags","review":"James Wagner, nicknamed &quot;Jimmy the Wags&quot; is a retired New York City street cop who, with the help of writer Patrick Picciarelli, also a retired cop, describes his police experiences in the Lower East Side of Manhattan in the 60s, 70s and 80s. It's an authentic voice that rings with the cadence of the city and the job he worked day after day, dealing with the dregs of society and everyday crime, as well as some of the major social issues of the time.We first meet Jimmy as a nine-year old boy, listening to Dragnet with his police officer father in their Staten Island home. We follow him through the police academy and then out to the streets. We meet his fellow cops and feel the pressures of the job, watching some of them turn into alcoholics or commit suicide. We see how many of the rules are bent to accommodate the reality of what is going on in the street. We're right alongside Jimmy, feeling his anger and despair when he goes to funeral services for fellow cops brutally gunned down. We meet celebrities and junkies and Hell's Angels and other assorted oddball characters. We're surprised at some stories, and we cringe at others and wonder how one man could have experienced so many outrageous things. Then we realize that these are the highlights of a long career, all compressed into a fast paced, action packed narrative with something new on every page. It's a good story, well told.

Jimmy the Wags was old school and made New York City a better place."},{"Title":"My Life in the NYPD: Jimmy the Wags","review":"I expected to read a load of self-serving macho crap, but instead I found this book very upbeat. Jimmy Wagner doesn't portray himself as being \\"tough\\" at all; on the contrary, he's very conflict-averse. Throughout the book he avoids conflicts where he knows he (or the perp) will get hurt.\\"Wags,\\" as he calls himself, worked out of the 9th Precinct, back when it wasn't hip. The East Village, or \\"EVill\\" in the day's jargon, was a cesspool of abandoned buildings, shooting galleries, pimps, toothless hookers, and violence. One of his stories involves the murder of a Bowery flophouse wino and some mysterious meat that serves as an important clue. Don't worry, it doesn't involve canibbalism, but it does involve two incompetent detectives!Incompetence is a recurring problem in Wagner's book. From his days at the academy, he meets all sorts of sickos who become cops, do a lousy job, and get to stay despite their deficits. One of the weirdest cops in the 9th Precinct is an old alcoholic, who wanders off for days at a time, nobody knowing where he's ended up. One of the scariest cops, however, is a violent sociopath who's rampages get worse and worse until the NYPD has no choice but to fire him. What happens to this policeman afterwards isn't really shocking, but I won't reveal it here.As for Wags, you'll be relieved to know that he lives happily. He leaves his work problems at the office and leaves his home problems at the house. Unlike most cops at his Precinct, he has only two drinks at the next door dive bar and goes home. New Yorkers have a nostalgia for the East Village of old, but others remember it as an incredibly unsafe district where life was cheap. It may have had a gritiness that people look back on with fond memories, but those who got beaten and robbed and spat on will have a different view. Even Wags admits he's thankful that the neighborhood is transformed.It's important to note that none of the cops in his circle lived in the East Village. Most lived in the suburbs of Queens, Nassau County, Staten Island, Westchester, or New Jesey. I doubt any cop who patrolled the 9th Preconct lived in the neighborhood where he worked. You have to wonder how much a cop really cares about a community where he doesn't reside."},{"Title":"My Life in the NYPD: Jimmy the Wags","review":"I read both of The Wags's books in a three day span.

They come together for 14 Tuesdays (just like they did while the author was a college student at Brandeis) before the professor passes away of ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease).This book is filed with the most beautiful sayings you can imagine. Here are a few examples: 'Giving to other people is what makes us feel alive.' 'Love each other or perish.' 'Everybody knows they are going to die, but nobody believes it. If we did, we would do things differently.' 'Learn to detach from experience.'Many people would avoid a book on this subject, because they do not want to think about death. Although Morrie Schwartz is dying throughout this book, the subject is really about living rather than dying. Few will find the dying to be distressing, even though it is graphically and frequently addressed.For those of us with many years to live, this book can be a wake-up call to start really living now -- in the ways we would if we were about to die, as well as to learn how to treat others while we still have them with us. For those who have but little time left, this book can be an inspiration for how to get the most out of the remaining time.You will probably find it heart-warming (as I did) to find out that the advance on this book was paid in time to help defray some of Professor Schwartz's medical expenses.May you find new meaning in your life from reading this wonderful book!

The 8th magnitude limit is deep enough to enable users to find Neptune and the brighter asteroids. The large charts, while they can be a bit awkward to handle, are great to view, as they show wide swaths of sky.The Second Edition brought some significant improvements: a useful step up to magnitude 8.5, galaxy shapes which show size and orientation, better representation of star magnitude, detailed charts of the Orion region and Virgo Galaxy Cluster. If you are debating between a used First Edition and a new Second Edition, get the Second; it's worth the extra money.A few shortcomings remain. The charts are arranged in ascending order of right ascension. This presents problems with editions which are bound on the left side. When users reach the right edge of the chart, they have to stifle the instinct to continue right to the next page, force themselves to reverse direction, and turn--of all places--to the previous page instead. The same with the left edge. Charts should be ordered in descending RA like Uranometria or Millennium. Ordering by ascending RA is a pointless tradition.Some of the versions are bound at the top, which solves the problem of the chart sequence--and makes the book less floppy to handle--but makes it harder to search for charts. Since the chart number is at the top right, the user cannot see what page they have their fingers on until the book is completely open.The pages of the laminated versions are very sturdy for field use but hard to grasp and separate, especially when moist with dew. This and the previous problem could be solved by adding numbered, graspable tabs to the bottom of each chart.A badly-needed improvement to the atlas came in a subsequent printing of the second edition: around the edges of each chart are noted the numbers of the charts which adjoin it. This greatly simplifies navigation through the atlas. It would be good to take this measure a step further and, on each chart, mark adjacent chart borders as well to save guesswork as to where each one ends and the next begins.The many virtues of this atlas have been amply documented by other reviewers. The space I have spent on the shortcomings is simply an attempt to round out the picture. The many improvements already made to this work speak well of the publisher's commitment to an excellent atlas. The Sky 2000.0 is now only a couple steps short.So which atlas to choose for your observations? I would completely ignore the 6th magnitude atlases on the market. For a beginning to intermediate observer, the magnitude 7.6 Pocket Sky Atlas is very well designed and affordable. For intermediate observing, the Sky Atlas 2000.0 is an excellent choice. For advanced observers who frequently go deep, I would suggest skipping the Sky Atlas and bringing both the Pocket and the Millennium along on outings."},{"Title":"Sky Atlas 2000.0, 2nd Field Unlaminated Version","review":"This is great for use at night, especially at a dark sky site. The maps on the field version are white stars on a black background. The magnitude range is useful for naked eye up to medium apeture telescopes. Enought deep sky object to keep you busy tracking them down for decades. The charts break up the sky into handy sized areas."},{"Title":"Churchill And War","review":"A book for all those interested in the martial side of the great British statesman. Especially interesting to me were thoughts on WW II air raids on Dresden and the overalll tactics and morality of Bomber Command. Also, many will find Professor Best's discussion of Winston Churchill's involvement with the development of the atomic bomb and his early 1950s statements on maintaining international peace, given this new war device, especially informative.British historian Geoffrey Best writes from deep knowledge, and in a pleasing style. Readers interested in a broader treatment of Sir Winston's life would profit from reading his 2001 biography, \\"Churchill: a Study in Greatness.\\""},{"Title":"Churchill And War","review":"This is a brillant book; well researched, extremely well written and a great read!Author Geoffrey Best shows the important role war played in the life of Winston Churchill, beginning with his birth at Blenheim (built for John Churchill, first Duke of Malborough and commemorating the 1704 battle, which secured England's rising position in the world) and focusing mainly on the British leader's seminal role in the Second World War. \\"War was central to Churchill's life,\\" writes Best, \\"He was a soldier before he was a politician.\\"Best addresses various aspects of Churchill as a war leader, including his influence on the Grand Alliance and the strategic insight and war direction he provided to Great Britian and the Allies. While he helped to determine the outcome of the war by ensuring America's participation, Churchill's strategic vision was, at times, faulty. Certainly his resistence to Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of Normandy and the European Continent, in favor of a greater Allied commitment in Italy and the Balkans, shows him at his strategic worse.Following the Second World War, however, the British leader became less conservative and more flexible and worked fervently to avert another world war. The use of atomic weapons in another war became anathema to him. \\"The fact was that Churchill had lost his taste for war,\\" records Best. \\"He had studied was for sixty years and lived it for fifteen of then and it had been getting worse all the time. He had never cherised illusions about it.\\"This book dispels a great many myths about Winston Churchill and his attitudes toward war. Informative and insightful, it will alter our perceptions of a great statesman, whose life, from beginning to end, was filled with war."},{"Title":"Churchill And War","review":"Geoffrey Best masterfully highlights the role that war played in Winston Churchill's long life while putting to rest some myths and misconceptions on this subject. As Best puts it diplomatically at the beginning, Churchill was not a saint. Churchill was at times rough and at others smooth. Churchill's roughness was embodied in his egotism, ruthlessness, and lack of consideration. Churchill's smoothness was found in his decency, patriotism, humanity, and courage. The secret behind Churchill's greatness lied in breaking rules.Churchill was a man in a hurry, on the lookout for both fame and notice. Churchill was always wondering how he looked like if he did this or that. Churchill was looking for his \\"finest hours\\" for decades. Churchill repeatedly showed recklessness on the battlefield while believing that nothing serious could ever happen to him during his military adventures.Churchill's books, articles, and speeches were at the service of his military and political ambitions while making a living out of them. Churchill valued most his writings about war. War was the most exciting activity to man in Churchill's view. History taught him that war was ruling the destinies of nations.Churchill was never one to be idle. Churchill's great transformation began when he took to serious company and books. Churchill did not find any relish in club-lounging, party-going, dancing, and womanizing. Although Churchill was not indifferent to female charm, he was not at ease with women. Churchill was lucky to find in Clementine Hozier a gifted woman who could accommodate his sometimes difficult character.Churchill was a very hard working man and showed an unusual talent for mastering detail. Churchill had an elephantine memory on which he could rely to use facts and data for further purposes. Although Churchill had an unusual gift with words, he was not by nature an effective public speaker.Churchill had a deep interest in military strategy within which the large allied armies operated during the two world wars. Strategizing was to him the closest thing to commanding great armies in the field. Churchill's interest in generalship was at the very heart of his fascination with war, including the technologies used for waging war. Like other war leaders, Churchill found the neutrality of non-belligerents irksome.Churchill remained a democrat at times of war by not suppressing critics who annoyed him. Despite his excitement about war, Churchill considered magnanimous peacemaking important once war was over. However, Churchill had no intention to condone the atrocities committed by the Nazis against non-combatants during WWII.The older Churchill was, the more he became aware of the heavy price tag attached to war for those who did not have his luck. For all his humanity, Churchill knew very well that war was a dreadfully demanding endeavor that overturned peacetime norms and hardened man's heart. Churchill had no illusion about the increasingly lethal evolution of war during his lifetime. Unsurprisingly, Churchill promoted a peace agenda after WWII with the advent of the balance of nuclear terror.To summarize, Best helps his audience better comprehend what role war played in the existence of a man who left an indelible footprint behind him."},{"Title":"Interview With An American Monk","review":"The only diappointment was when it was over, I wanted to hear more.

Only reliably cold-hardy plants are included, and these after considerable testing. Sabuco is opinionated, forthright, and I have found most of his statements borne out in my own experience. He is less folksy than Dirr, and this book is less well-known, but it is direct, concise, and if you are serious about trees and shrubs in cold climates, you must own it. Its only shortcoming is that it appears to have become an artifact, a dead-end; a new edition, expanded and reflecting the last twenty years of experience would be welcome."},{"Title":"Molecular Crystals","review":"Chemists play with molecules. They synthesize them ex-novo or they extract them from natural sources. The next step concerns their characterization in the gas-phase, solution, and solid-state. The latter is the playground of chemical crystallographers who are employing single-crystal x-ray diffraction methods to determine the 3D structure of molecules. Applications with molecular crystals, however, are not restricted to chemists but do include also the work of physicists, engineers, and materials scientists. Let us think, for example, about non-linear optical materials and organic electronics. Molecular crystals research is quite interdisciplinary a field and exploits all the available theoretical and experimental means so far developed by research scientists. The book of Wright presents an excellent and concise overview of the field. It comprises 10 chapters covering subjects such as crystal growth, intermolecular forces, packing, impurities, dynamics, optical, electrical, and chemical properties.

The same night, \\"Dixie Chicks\\" were playing at the Spokane Arena. (The arena parking lot was directly across from the theatre.) Needless to say, thousands came to see the \\"Dixie Chicks\\" and about 99 souls came to see the festival plays. (99 is considered a full house in a small theatre.)Now make no mistake, I'm not taking anything away from high-energy showmanship of The \\"Dixie Chicks\\" I only bring it up because I think the incident shows us where our premiums are.I believe that most people expect to be entertained on a grand scale. When they see a show, they want special effects, dazzling lights, eye-popping costumes, and beautiful people. They want to be distracted and consumed by what they see on stage, not left intact and \`thinking.' In short, they want to lose themselves rather than find themselves.The Best Women's Stage Monologues of 1997 by Jocelyn A. Beard is a collection of monologues by women, who by the force of their talent make us think about ourselves and our place in society. With the \`special effects' of words working, the plays make up a rich mosaic of moods that brings the characters alive before our very eyes. It makes us want to read the entire play from which the excerpts are taken.\\"Bad Grrrls\\" by Linda Eisenstein made me want to know more about the relationship of Meg and Dana. How did they meet and where are they going with their lives?Caitlin Hick's \\"Singing The Bones\\" is a powerful monologue about a woman's relationship with her preacher father and what happened the last time she saw him.\\"In Search of the Red River Dog\\" by Sandra Perlman is about a woman who has just been raped by her husband. I would defy any woman (or man either for that matter) to read the monologue without being moved to anger or tears.Joycelyn A. Beard is responsible for bringing these monologues to the reading public Every year or so they bloom like flowers in their yellow and orange colors as they fill in the tiny monologue collections in Barnes and Noble drama section. Ms. Beard works indefatigably bringing these books to life. It is Joycelyn Beard (and those like her) who keep theatre alive in a time of shrinking budgets and general apathy toward stage productions.\\"The Best Women's Stage Monologues of 1997\\" is a must read for anyone who loves going the theatre and who want to be entertained without being obliterated."},{"Title":"The Best Women's Stage Monologues of 1997","review":"Not only is this book a window into a dozen or more wonderful plays, it's also a must-have for any actress dying for something substantial and challenging to perform. It often seems so hard to find a decent female role that hasn't already been played a thousand times..but Ms. Beard proves that there are many lesser-known playwrights out there writing tremendous stuff, and she makes them all readily accessible. I've found great pieces in several books of this yearly series, but this one is by far my favorite."},{"Title":"Understanding \\"Our Father\\": Biblical Reflections on the Lord's Prayer","review":"Depending on who you talk to Scott Hahn is either a hero or a turncoat. He was raised Presbyterian, and was even on the fast track to be a president at a Presbyterian seminary when he began to doubt two protestant main stays: \`by scripture alone' and \`by faith alone'. So he did what any academically trained person would do, he decided to research and went back to school to do a masters in Roman Catholic thought, eventually converting to Catholicism. Since then he has been a prolific writer and speaker on things Catholic, and why the catholic faith is the one true valid faith.This book is part academic treatise and part faith discovery. The book will lead you through each of the different petitions in the Lord's Prayer, both in historical perspective and in reflection for what it should mean for us today. The sections are:Part 1 Contemporary Reflections by Scott Hahn0. Introduction1. Our Father2. Our Father ... In Heaven3. Hallowed Be Thy Name4. Thy Kingdom Come5. Thy Will Be Done6. On Earth As It Is In Heaven7. Give Us This Day Our Daily Bread8. Forgive Us ... As We Forgive9. Lead Us Not Into Temptation10. Temptation Part II11. Deliver Us from Evil12.

Saint John Chrysostom: Homily XIX o the Gospel of Matthew17. Saint Augustine: Our Lord's Sermon on the MountHahn open's up this prayer in ways you could never imagine. I have been serious about being a Christian for nearly 20 years and this little book helped me to see this prayer in a whole new light.\\"Why Bother?Still, it's fair to ask, Why Bother to pray, \`Thy will be done'? Isn't it presumptuous, or even redundant? Isn't God's will what happens anyway? Why pray for God's will? It Seems like praying for gravity to continue.The answer is simple. When we pray. \`Thy will be done,' we do not change or strengthen the will of God, but we do change and strengthen ourselves. Such prayer disposes our hearts to de the will of the Father.\\" p31,32Hahn goes on to say later: \\"Often, it seems that people pray in order to change God's mind. But God is eternal, perfect, unchanging, and unchangeable. We pray so that God can change our minds.\\" p74 what would our lives be like is we truly prayed for the fathers will to be done. Later Hahn states: \\"First in importance is the centrality of divine fatherhood and our share - our real participation - in Christ's divine sonship.Next, notice how the Fathers insist that our goal is virtue, and not mere learning.\\" p75 That is why the second part of the book goes into the writings of the church fathers. To show us that intellectual understanding is not enough, it must impact our hearts and move us to action and a deeper relationship with God. This book will help you move from your head to your heart, but it will feed both mind and spirit."},{"Title":"Understanding \\"Our Father\\": Biblical Reflections on the Lord's Prayer","review":"Scott Hahn has helped so many of us grow in our appreciation of Scripture in Catholic life. He has done so again in a very practical way. His book on the Our Father will assist people not only in their personal spiritual life, but also in their praying together. I hope that this book will become part of a prayer movement in the Church to lead us to reform and renewal."},{"Title":"Understanding \\"Our Father\\": Biblical Reflections on the Lord's Prayer","review":"Scott Hahn's &quot;Understanding 'Our Father'&quot; has arrived just as John Paul II has given the world another set of mysteries for the rosary, the Luminous Mysteries. The timing could not be better for a deeper understanding of the prayer of all prayers, the &quot;Our Father,&quot; the prayer given to us by Our Lord, and the prayer which initiates each mystery of the rosary.Why is Hahn's book so important? Don't we know the &quot;Our Father&quot; all too well? As Hahn quickly shows, there is nothing more unfamiliar as the all-too-familiar. Rather than rattling the &quot;Our Father&quot; off like the Pledge of Allegiance, Hahn has the reader go through it, line by line, and delve into its deep mysteries and alarming truths. By the end of the book, we realize why the &quot;Our Father&quot; is an ever-vibrant, fathomless source of theological reflection, and even more important, the prayer of all prayers.If that weren't enough, Dr. Hahn appends some of the deepest theological reflections of the early fathers upon this great prayer--St. Cyprian, St. Cyril, St. John Chrysostom, and of course, St. Augustine.In sum, just the book to fire up Catholics and Protestants alike, with the prayer which binds us all."},{"Title":"Understanding \\"Our Father\\": Biblical Reflections on the Lord's Prayer","review":"This is a great book for all Catholics, but it is an essential book for Catholic fathers, like me. At the center of the modern crisis in family life is a crisis of genuine fatherhood. The essence of restoring fatherhood is turning the hearts of fathers back to God the Father. The renewal of family life will proceed from the renewal of our life with the Father. Read this important slowly and prayerfully. It will deepen your faith and transform your family life"},{"Title":"Understanding \\"Our Father\\": Biblical Reflections on the Lord's Prayer","review":"My own journey into the Catholic Church involved an exponential increase in praying the Lord's Prayer, from once a week to multiple times every day: the Divine Office, the Rosary, and Mass. But I must admit that too often the busy-ness and distractions of my life have made my recitation of this precious prayer seem almost like &quot;vain repetition&quot;. For this reason, Scott Hahn's book is a godsend. His reflections (biblical, theological and spiritual) proceed petition by petition. As a result, readers rediscover this intimate family prayer of the Body of Christ. This book instills new life into our prayer. What an awesome privilege it is now to pray these words as an adopted son of God."},{"Title":"Understanding \\"Our Father\\": Biblical Reflections on the Lord's Prayer","review":"&quot;Understanding 'Our Father'&quot; provides some startling and worthwhile insights that can serve as powerful aids to prayers. This is a book to rouse you from the drone of repetition and guide you into the depths of Christ's own prayer. Scott Hahn has helped to acquaint many a Catholic with the finer points of Bible study. A gifted teacher, he has a knack for making the dull vivid and the complex simple. Here he unpacks the theological and biblical meaning of each phrase of the Lord's Prayer -- and reveals what he terms the &quot;inner logic&quot; of this most fundamental of prayers.Throughout, Hahn, professor of Theology and Scripture at the Franciscan University of Steubenville in Ohio develops and draws from his trademark brand of covenant theology, according to which the Trinity creates a family bond with us, the members of Christ's Body. Hahn also points to healthy human father-children bonds but doesn't forget those who've had bad experiences with their earthly fathers and now have difficulty accepting the authority of any &quot;father figure&quot; -- including God the Father. Catholic Tradition, he points out, &quot;tells us we must go beyond our earthly experiences and memories of fatherhood. God is more unlike than like any human father, patriarch or paternal figure.&quot;The book is written in Hahn's usual energetic, conversational style. The chapters are peppered with playful subheads -- &quot;Send in the Crowns,&quot; &quot;From Heir to Eternity&quot; among them. Sometimes I feel like I shouldn't laugh; it only encourages him. Then again the professor's peculiar penchant for puns does serve a useful purpose: it provides a steady stream of mnemonic doctrine-remembrance devices. It's worth noting here than only the first half of the book is written by Hahn. The rest of the pages offer commentaries on the Lord's Prayer by four Church Fathers: Sts. Augustine, John Chrysostom, Cyril of Jerusalem, and Cyprian."},{"Title":"Understanding \\"Our Father\\": Biblical Reflections on the Lord's Prayer","review":"In this wonderful exposition of the most beautiful of prayers, which came from the divine lips of Jesus Himself, Dr. Scott Hahn has, once again, provided the Catholic and the Christian with a splendid work of theological research. &quot;Understanding 'Our Father'&quot; will definitely serve to enrich spiritually all who are privileged to read and meditate on it. By coordinating his own commentary and meditation on the Lord's Prayer with those of four great doctors of the Church, Dr. Hahn provides an ongoing connection with the long continuity of Christian tradition. It is a book that the reader will find as intellectually satisfying as it is grace-filled and consoling."},{"Title":"Understanding \\"Our Father\\": Biblical Reflections on the Lord's Prayer","review":"Against the background of contemporary misunderstandings of God and Christian revelation, it is gratifying to see how a modern Scripture scholar, Professor Scott Hahn, contributes concise and profound insights into the most familiar prayer in all history, the Lord's Prayer. His meditations, enriched by covenant theology, will inspire souls with greater knowledge and love of God, and will stimulate in them a greater zeal to spread Christ's Kingdom, the Church, on earth. Readers victimized by a spiritually decadent culture to ignore their supernatural destiny are reminded, &quot;If He who was without sin prayed, how much more ought sinners to pray.&quot; The value of this volume is enhanced by inclusion of the texts of timeless commentaries on the Lord's Prayer by Sts. Cyprian, Cyril of Jerusalem, John Chrysostom, and Augustine."},{"Title":"Understanding \\"Our Father\\": Biblical Reflections on the Lord's Prayer","review":"Dr. Hahn has performed yet another great service for the Church (and the whole world, for that matter). The Our Father is Gospel prayer, the prayer that Jesus Himself gave to us. If prayer is oxygen for the soul, then Dr. Hahn has helped to breathe life into our prayer. In the light of four Fathers of the Church, as well as his own excellent insights, Dr. Hahn, a teacher in the Teacher, teaches us how to pray."},{"Title":"Understanding \\"Our Father\\": Biblical Reflections on the Lord's Prayer","review":"In &quot;Understanding 'Our Father'&quot; Dr. Scott Hahn removes the veil and reveals to us the deep significance of the prayer Jesus gave us, the Our Father. With elegance, eloquence and erudite scholarship, Dr. Hahn unpacks each phrase of this perfect prayer and shows us our relationship with God the Father, His providential care for us, and our own call to be divinized by following His holy will.

I did not post a star rating on this first \\"review.\\" Someone -- I have never been able to find out who, despite contacting the publisher several times -- took a book review that I had published in the National Catholic Review and without consulting me, edited it (editing out anything less than enthusiastic) and, again without consulting me, posted it on this page.Here are some portions of my original book review what were cut out: \\"It's worth noting here that only the first half of the 146-page book is written by Hahn. The rest of the pages offer commentaries on the Lord's Prayer by four Church Fathers: St. Augustine, St. John Chrysostom, St. Cyril of Jerusalem and St. Cyprian. These selections, 19th-century translations now in the public domain, can make for tough going at times, especially for those unfamiliar with reading ancient or doctrinally dense writing. Unfortunately, Hahn provides only three paragraphs of guidance on how to read these commentaries. I suspect some readers will, upon reaching this point, feel as if they're being sent off on an exploration without a map. Also, the Church Fathers can be downloaded from the Internet for free -- which makes the book's $15.95 price tag seem a bit steep. Despite these not-insubstantial reservations, Understanding \\"Our Father\\" provides some startling and worthwhile insights that can serve as powerful aids to prayer.\\"I am a journalist and I object to my work being edited and used without my permission for marketing purposes."},{"Title":"Understanding \\"Our Father\\": Biblical Reflections on the Lord's Prayer","review":"I'm sure that when Steve Wood, Benedict Groeschel and the rest of the gang got together on May 10, 2003, to submit reviews of this Scott Hahn book (see the reviews below this one), they meant well. Of course they did.The problem is, this book just ain't that great.The first problem is that only half of it is by Scott Hahn. The book's second half consists of excerpts from an antique translation of four Church Fathers. Although Augustine and Chrysostom have some great things to say, the other two have less value. Moreover, you can find these writings on the web at no charge -- they're in the public domain. That means you're paying $... for 76 pages of new material by Scott Hahn.Another problem is that Hahn's writings in this book don't seem to have anything to do with the patristic writings. Although both the Church Fathers and Scott Hahn have recognizably Catholic points of view, they are very *different* points of view. That means that Scott Hahn has basically done nothing to show what his family-covenant theology has to do with patristic theology, as represented by the excerpts in this book.A third problem is Hahn's puns. They are quite irritating.A fourth problem is with Hahn's commentary on \\"On Earth as it is in heaven.\\" He writes from the same perspective he used in his book on Revelation and the Mass . . . but he makes no effort to show that that's what this verse of the Lord's Prayer is actually referring to. Hahn seems to be free-associating here.Those are the problems. That still leaves a lot of good stuff. The rest of Hahn's commentary on the Lord's Prayer is easy to read, inspirational and insightful. If you can borrow a copy, I recommend reading it.If you want to read what the Church Fathers say about the Lord's Prayer, however, I recommend tracking down (probably in a good Catholic library) more recent translations. If you want the 19th century public domain translations, you can find them quite easily with a good search engine."},{"Title":"The Geometry of Physics: An Introduction","review":"Having gone through the first 3 chapters of this book, I must say I am really dissapointed. The author is supposedly trying to avoid the mathematical rigor to the account of explaining things in a physical way. Well, he almost completely fails in that and, the worst, confuses the reader. For example, he devotes 15 pages to smoothly introduce the reader to the concept of a manifold, promising a more rigorous definition to be given later on. When the time comes, he uses two \\"brand new\\" concepts, namely Haussdorf space and countable base, for the meaning of which, the reader has to look up in other books!(however cited in bibliography) If one wants to understand what all these things (manifolds, diff. forms, Lie deriv, etc.) are about, the best thing to do is buy a mathematical book. After all, it is hardly possible to satisfactorily describe abstract mathematical concepts if you avoid using mathematical language! For the interested, I am NOT a mathematician."},{"Title":"Sodium Calories & Fat in Your Food","review":"Although this book may contain over 30,000 foods, (not just 20,000 as the synopsis claims) it only contains sodium, calorie and fat statistics for them. I bought this book looking for the potassium values that the synopsis suggested it contains. It does not. My sole purpose for purchasing this book was falsely advertised in the synopsis and thus this book is absolutely useless to me. Thanks for nothing."},{"Title":"Lamh Dearg Aboo: Battle Cry of the O'Neills, High Kings of Ancient Ireland: A Romantic Novel .","review":"My mother bought a copy of this self-published book directly from the author, who was selling them door-to-door back around the time I was born. She did it out of pity, the moreso (as she later realized) after she started reading it. I tried reading it in my early teens, and tried again in my late teens, and I think I actually gave it another glance a few years ago when visiting my parents. (They've kept every book they've ever bought, including the 1967 set of Encyclopedia Brittanica.)I am sure that there are worse books, but in terms of painfully stilted dialog, this sets a standard that is hard to beat. It is bad enough that, read aloud properly to an audience that has already started drinking, it could be hilarious."},{"Title":"Scenes de la Vie Parisienne: La Cousine Bette","review":"Many of Balzac's novels read as if they were written too quickly and are full of holes in terms of plot and theme. This one is far better written and tightly plotted. It is, I think, an ideal introduction to this great writer. If you read French, I would recommend this edition in particular.This novels has clearly drawn characters with grim lives in an inexorable descent to self-destruction, which are the classic Balzac themes. It explores the life of a libertine as he ruins himself and his family for the sake of pursuing pretty girls. Unbeknownst to him, he gets help from Bette, a cousin full of secret hatreds and bent on vengence. It is very sad to read. One minor character even commits suicide by repeatedly smashing his head into a nail, his only means to finish himself off he could find in his jail cell.So why read it? When I described my fascination with Balzac to a pal of mine, I said, \\"yeah, it is all about disillusioned and cynical people\\" and he replied: \\"I am already disillusioned and cynical, so why should I read it?\\" Well, it is best for the wider social portraits that you can find, which are offered almost as an aside. Balzac in one section explains the politics behind the statues you see all over Paris, which is fascinating. You also learn of the career of courtisans, as they use their sex to advance themselves. The book is simply full of these thngs, in addition to the psychology of the many interesting main characters.Also unusual for Balzac is the coherency of the story, which does not degenerate into ramblings like many of his other novels as they weave the tapestry of his Comedie Humaine like so many threads, that is, as vehicles in his vast project to fully portray an entire society with characters re-appearing in different situations and venues throughout his interrelated novels. The characters stand on their own here and are more clearly drawn. Hence, it is a great intro to Balzac and may get you hooked for more, that is, if you are masochistic enough to subject yourself to it!Warmly recommended."},{"Title":"Brotherhood of Betrayal","review":"Randall Arthur continues to write books that express some emotional heart felt issues in the church today. The only problem I have is I can't put these books down once I start them."},{"Title":"Brotherhood of Betrayal","review":"I only bought this book because I read \\"Jordan's Crossing\\". Which I thought was 5 star. I really liked the book. So when I read this book, I thought maybe it would be somewhat of the same. The Legalist people were way over board to the point where the story was not believable. Of course, it was only fiction.Jason Faircloth identified himself as \\"literalist\\" in \\"Jordan's Crossing\\", yet he was never clear on what he \\"literally\\" believed. It appears that if you believe in the Bible to the point where you actually obey it, look out! You are a legalist! I have to admit, there are churches that abuse their members. But this in no way makes it okay to wilfully disobey the Bible. It's almost like the message of this book is, if a church requires obedience to the gospel, it is a very, very bad, bad thing, but if we sin, let's just love one another and everything will be okay.The denomination this young family was with, was obviously too extreme, not necessarily because of their standards, but because of their seemingly total lack love or mercy. From the moment they began to question and disagree with this denomination's wrong attitude, they should have left. It appears their congregation would've gone along with them, and that would have been the end of that. But the adultry thing,..well that would still have to be taken care of by somebody. Disappointing."},{"Title":"Brotherhood of Betrayal","review":"I loved this book! I read it many years ago, it still stays with me. The story told really puts you through emotional changes and makes you ask hard questions about God that help you assess your own faith in a deeper way. I highly recommend this book especially for anyone who has been hurt by the church or a \\"believing\\" spouse. I have given this book to many a healing friend whose lives don't look the way they wanted to due to people who they trusted not being trustworthy. AMAZING BOOK!"},{"Title":"Brotherhood of Betrayal","review":"I have read all three of Randall Arthurs books and he has really left me wanting more. Strong characters that for better or for worse - you like them. Randall doesnt write the soft cozy Christian fiction, no he gets to the core of real matters that we see in our world today - Pastors who are unfaithful, overbearing, or too by the book.I found his writing refreshing from so many of the Christian authors I have read that really do not make the plot any stronger than an argument. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Brotherhood of Betrayal","review":"C. S. Lewis once wrote, \\"Part of every misery is, so to speak, the misery's shadow or reflection: the fact that you don't merely suffer but have to keep on thinking about the fact that you suffer.\\" Randall Arthur masterfully exposes the grief, doubt, and utter loneliness that accompanies life's unexpected tragedies. His skillful writing immerses the reader in each character's psychological struggles. Though the details of the story may be unique, every reader will connect personally with the spiritual warfare waged in the hearts and minds of Arthur's characters. Even amidst the greatest devastation, however, hope remains fervent; all things can be made new.I particularly grieve for the reviewer below who fails to see the genuine grace, mercy and love offered by Christ, who came not for the righteous, but for sinners! No, Grace does not condone sinful behavior, but it is Grace that welcomes us again into the arms of our Father. And remember, no one has perfectly resisted temptation! To ignore the indubitable struggles in every Christian's life is to ignore the great love story of the Bible itself. It was the brother of the Prodigal Son who failed to understand the love of the Father!Thank you Mr. Arthur for your insightful novel. I pray many will find inspiration and hope within its pages.Also recommended:A Grief Observed by C. S. LewisSoul Survivor by Philip YanceyThe Man Who Was Thursday by G. K.

I accepted it in good grace. I now do not have any info on the book store or such so can not write to them. I thank you for the service you give tho. P:)"},{"Title":"Brotherhood of Betrayal","review":"I also thought this was a \\"new\\" book by Randall Arthur. I anxiously awaited its arrival only to discover this is the same book as \\"Betrayal\\" which I had previously read. I don't know who is responsible for this real act of betrayal--the author, the publisher, or Amazon. In my opinion, when a book is resold with a different cover and name, it should be clearly stated that this is the same book previously titled as whatever the original title was. I feel swindled by all transgressors noted: the author, the publisher, and Amazon."},{"Title":"Brotherhood of Betrayal","review":"At this point this will be the only negative review! It is an imprtant book(s) because of the lines that are drawn. but at the same time a straw man of legalism is set up and knocked down over and over!Randall does his best to set up hateful characters so that we can learn how hateful fundamentalism is. Of course these are all fictional characters, being the product of his own mind.So why is it an important series of books? In a word antinomianism. This a word that means lawlessness. In these books we have portrayed over and over the bondage of living right!The grace of God is turned into liscentousness to where adultery, divorce, and remarraige are viable options, for even a missionary!I think the lines are drawn very clear. What are our moral obligations as Christians?Especially, Christisn ministers?I think you can guess from my tonm I think Mr. Arthur is wrong!And because of that there are eternal consequences!Is it really legalism the problem today? Or immorality?I think the latter!"},{"Title":"Brotherhood of Betrayal","review":"I have read few authors that gripped me the way Randall Arthur has in his three stories (Brotherhood of Betrayal, Jordan's Crossing, and Wisdom Hunter). I could not put any of them down and lost a lot of sleep the week I read them. I cried and laughed and prayed my way through each of them. Randall, if you're reading this, thank you for letting God write through you. Though it has a been a good six months since I read them I am tearing up as I remember then now and how God used them in my life. Thank you for being honest about the good and the bad in the \\"church\\" and our lives, and about God's grace and His presence through both. I truly thank God for you, brother, I really do."},{"Title":"Brotherhood of Betrayal","review":"I too, like the other reviewer, am a fan of Randall Arthur's books. One of the first &quot;Christian&quot; fiction books I read was his first book, Wisdom Hunter.If you like 'prairie fiction' that always ends neatly and comfortably, then you'd best not read Randall Arthur. If you enjoy impactful books that tell it like it is, then you've found your author!Brotherhood of Betrayal is a re-release of Betrayal and is the best book yet by Arthur to date. It deals with the extreme legalism found in some churches in America and the even more widespread issue I could identify with: how do I treat 'fallen' brothers/sisters in Christ who've made serious mistakes? Am I willing to forgive a repentant brother? Do I continue to withhold forgiveness even after the God has forgiven that person? Why?If you've wrestled with these issues in some form, you'll find an excellent, Godly model for forgiveness and grace in this book. I was moved!"},{"Title":"Brotherhood of Betrayal","review":"I have been a Randall Arthur fan for years. Since I saw that he had a &quot;new&quot; book coming out I have been anxiously awaiting its arrival. I exciteldly opened the package from Amazon only to find that &quot;Brotherhood of Betrayal&quot; is the exact same book as &quot;Betrayal&quot;! All they did was change the name. Nowhere in the advertisements was that explained. I don't know whether to be disappointed in Mr. Aruthur, Multnomah, or Amazon. Bottom line, it was a great book back when I first read it a couple of years ago and I'll get over this frustration, but Arthur fans beware before you spend your hard-earned money. Oh, one more thing, it's being advertised as a bargain at $9.59, but upon receiving the book the cover price says $7.99.Well, that's off of my chest, so on to life's real issues."},{"Title":"Brotherhood of Betrayal","review":"This book is well written for Christian Fiction. However, imagine my surprise when I ordered Betrayal and Brotherhood of Betrayal, shown as two seperate books by the same author. The only differece I found was in the Acknowledgments page. On this page in Brotherhood of Betrayal, Heartfelt thanks goes to MULTNOMAH Publishers (including Rod Morris, senior editor).On this page in Betrayal, Heartfelt thanks goes to Word Publishing company. I purchased both books thinking that one was a sequel...not so..the words are identical. I felt this was misleading and dishonest, I see no reason for this fact.The next time I will research more fully before making a purchase!"},{"Title":"Brotherhood of Betrayal","review":"Arthur said that he wrote these books as a response to his pain. It is evident throughout. I have lived some of these very experiences and I could not believe how accurately he described what it was like, for instance, to find out that your spouse was unfaithful. He described how the wife felt, the physical sickening reactions to what changes your life forever, and to what you never wanted to or expected to face.He unashamedly portrays the complete inability of many whose lives remain \\"untainted\\" to have any understanding as to how to relate to those who are damaged by the sin of others. I have also been excommunicated from a church, and this part of the story, though to the \\"untainted\\" would seem unbelievable, I know it is believable, and was thankful to have it put into print. Indeed, such an \\"untainted\\" woman once told me that I was defiling others by talking about the excommunication, (spiritual abuse), and that she didn't need (want) to know what was wrong in my marriage, (abuse).My 15-year-old read this book while I went through a divorce from his dad. It facilitated his needed grieving, though his words weren't all there at age 15, his weeping and grief were very real as he identified with a main character in an incredible scene near the end. I know that my son's writing was improved as a result of reading Arthur.I meet people who have been through similar experiences as are found in this book and I pass the book on. It is such a gift. Thank you, Mr. Arthur."},{"Title":"Brotherhood of Betrayal","review":"Randall Arthur is a gifted writer, exposing some of the ways Christians let each other down, or \\"shoot their wounded\\", as someone has said. This book is gripping. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Brotherhood of Betrayal","review":"Yes, the story does pack a punch, and it is one of those books you have to stay up half the night to finish. The last reviewer already covered the positive side, and I agree with most of it. On the other hand, I found this book to be a little heavy on stereotypes, particularly in its portrayal of Fundamentalist Christians. I would not describe myself as a Fundamentalist, but I know many people who would, and they would be absolutely appalled by the behavior of the Fundamentalists in this story. Still, if legalism like this does exist, this book does a good job of pointing to a clear alternative in the liberty of Christ. This is a book will stimulate serious thought, and make a deep impression on the reader. It would also be good material for a study group discussion."},{"Title":"Brotherhood of Betrayal","review":"A wonderful book meant to stir thoughts about how Christians should treat their \\"brothers\\" in the Lord. How they should treat people...PERIOD!Jason Faircloth is at it again- bringing in the lost sheep!"},{"Title":"Brotherhood of Betrayal","review":"This book is one of the best I have read in a very long time. It is multi-dimentional, and revolves around a very selfish Pastor who up and disappears without a trace, leaving his family and church stunned.When the disappearance is confirmed that he leaft with a rich woman to \\"sow his oats,\\" so to speak, he leaves unspeakable pain behind for his wife and children, and hundreds of church members shocked, many who were financially supporting him and his missionary ministry.This book is filled with episodes of what happens when leaders of powerful fundlementalist churches begin to believe they can make decisions for God, and loose site of caring and compassion.I LIVED this story many years ago when I was the product of a divorce that was necessary by his behavior and BIBLICAL. However, the very people who had depended on me to come through on hundreds of projects, lead both the women's and childrens ministeries, even as far as be an unpaid janitor because they felt they could not afford one, suddenly turned their backs on me, and removed me from teaching, leading etc because I was \\"Divorced,\\" Not only did they do that to me, but they removed my children from the puppet ministery and children's choir. Basically I was totally ignored until I left the church, so this book was a tear jerker to me.This is a complex area, and I strongly did agree near the end of the book when the brothern offered the husband, after 7 years a way to become involved in the church once again. However, one of the deacons told him to leave that his actions were sending him to hell anyway...... I don't remember reading that in my bible!!Running a church is a real slippery slope of love and acceptance verses accountabiliy. However, in this story there was no love what so ever shown the wife, and her children 's needs were dependent on how SHE acted - and they had spys out watching her every move, even reporting back to the pastor seeing her have an innoncent lunch with a co-worker 4 years after her husband had disappeared!!When church deacons, elders, leaders, etc are more afraid of what will happen to them than to do whats right, something is wrong.Rarely did I read one book in l day, but this one I did - and shed many, many tears while in the process. Any human being can succumb to our \\"old nature\\" and do things we are later ashamed of. If we are forbidden to return to the loving arms of Christians for forgivness and help to heal, what is there? Especially when their pastors drilled and drilled into them that seaking counselling of any kind - even from a Christian is evil and not allowd in their sanctions.I HATED the ending. I at least wanted the children to know he had made an attempt, but his pastor buddy told him to leave, let them alone and forgot they existed. No matter what, those kids will be searching in their hearts for their dad all of their lives, and will never ever have any closure."},{"Title":"Brotherhood of Betrayal","review":"I was blown away when I read \\"Wisdom Hunter\\" so I had high expectations for this book. This book is very disturbing and shocking. I definitely think that Christian churches do have a problem with \\"shooting their wounded\\" rather than coming along side of them.Overall, I don't think this book is anywhere near as good as Wisdom Hunter. Still, if you are looking for a quick read that will make you think, this would be a book for you."},{"Title":"There And Now","review":"This book had a huge \\"What the heck?\\" factor in it. The romantic aspects of the book were completely unbelievable, especially when taken in context with the time period. I can usually get some small bit of enjoyment out of LLM's novels, but this was not one of them.Also, if you could please, for the love of God and everything holy, find a synonym for \\"presently\\" that would be amazing. Said the reviewer. She has hair of chestnut and hazel eyes. Presently, she felt the urge to inform the reader that what they were reading was happening now, and not five minutes ago. She then decided to awkwardly tack on unnecessary descriptions in places where they don't fit."},{"Title":"There And Now","review":"I enjoyed this book.

Finding the perfect man sometimes evolves traveling back in time to 1892. Due to all sorts of twist and turns, she becomes suspect for the house fire that caused the disappearance of her &quot;family&quot; during back in 1892.

The suspense keeps them extremely interesting and is always tempered with humor.

Elisabeth found herself in the same house one hundred years back when she worn the magical necklance. I was intrigued by the kind of shock and bewilderment that I imagined that I would experience, just like Elisabeth. Furthermore, she met and fell in love with Jonanthan and his daughter, Trista. Jonanthan was a loving and devoted father to Trista, despite his hectic life as the physician of the town. But we felt his loneliness and sadness. He was a man in need of a woman's love. And Trista, adorable and yet at times appeared to be too mature for her age, yielded and deserved a mother. Elisabeth just fit the role perfectly, except that she was from the time a century away. I was touched by the extent of commitment one would need to overcome to realise the dream of being with the loved ones, separated by a century. At the end, I wished there was more. It would be better if there was greater room for character development."},{"Title":"There And Now","review":"I thought the characters were very real, both the hero and heroine as well as his little daughter.

Interesting panoramas, the light playing on the spinifex, the wrinkled face of an Aboriginal tracker, the otherworldly red dirt, the camels silhouetted against the skyline.Robyn represented only herself and undertook the trek for reasons even she did not understand. Seeing her develop and expand her thinking during the days and weeks and months on the track makes this a fascinating book."},{"Title":"From Alice to Ocean: Alone Across the Outback","review":"From Alice to Ocean is a book of the phenomenal photographs taken by Rick Smolan (of National Geographic) of Robyn Davidson's incredible 1700 mile walk, alone across the Australian outback with four camels and a dog in the mid 1970's. The amazing full length written account is available in Robyn's small riviting paperback entitled Tracks. A good deal of her compelling writing accompanies the photos in From Alice to Ocean, published 16 years (1992) after her remarkable trek. Interesting to note: From Alice to Ocean was the first photography book ever published on a MAC computer. The result was, and still is, nothing short of spectacular. Every photo is world class and captures part of a land that is seen only by the Aboriginies who travel through.Interestingly Robyn felt she had sold herself out after more than two years struggling working for fierce camel owners to earn enough money to buy her camels, when she accepted a grant from National Geographic for her story. There was a stipulation that a photographer be flown in every few weeks to document her trip. In this case her loss of privacy is our gain. And in some instances hers, when on the journey she requests that a rifle like the one she carried be brought to the next drop off point, to give to Mr Eddie, an elderly Aboriginal tribesman who walked with her for several weeks (a companion in his seventies she thought would slow her down but who in fact she struggled to keep pace with).The magnitude of the journey, Robyn's eloquent account and the gorgeous photography make a remarkable book. No one will be disappointed with this rare collectors item and I imagine it is highly sought by anyone who hears of it after reading Tracks. I have a treasured 20 year old copy I received for Christmas the year it was first published. I'll always remember opening the gift while handing the very same present to my then boyfriend. I no longer have the boyfriend. Happily I have the book."},{"Title":"From Alice to Ocean: Alone Across the Outback","review":"Although large in size, and filled with breathtaking photographs, this book includes so much more than the regular \\"picture book\\".

On a clear, calm day in 1893 just a few miles offshore from Tripoli, the British Navy's newest and most powerful battleship Victoria collided with the Camperdown (a slightly older battleship) during manoeuvres and sank with heavy loss of life, including the commander-in-chief Admiral Tyron. Tyron was a popular hero, able, adept, innovative, a stern man who was smarter than the other admirals and captains, and who let them know it.Hough does a fine job describing the personalities of all involved. Tyron liked tricky manoeuvring and intensely disliked his authority or wisdom to be questioned. Scathing comments aimed at lesser authorities was regularly forthcoming. The Victoria and Camperdown led columns of capital ships in parallel, 6 cables (1200 yards) apart. Tyron ordered the columns to turn inward toward each other and reverse direction 180 degrees. But the ships had a turning radius of 2 cables and so needed 4 cables of searoom--each--to safely carry out the manoeuvre. The ram bow of the Camperdown sliced deep into the bows of the Victoria, which sank in 15 minutes. 400 lives were lost, and Tyron went down with his ship.Hough relates how Captain Markham of the Camperdown and Tyron's own flag-captain on the Victoria were concerned about the safety of the manoeuvre: more searoom was needed to avoid a collision. But Tyron was used to being obeyed, and so his orders were, fatefully, carried out. A court martial ensued, of course, and the blame officially fell on Tyron. So the question--which Hough addresses--is why? What did Tyron intend? Did he have a mental lapse? Hough shows a number of possible explanations and suggests what Tyron perhaps intended. But the intentions were certainly far from obvious--at least to ordinary souls, including captains. Hough writes well--this is a fascinating story indeed, and the collision is regarded as one of the more interesting naval mysteries. If you want more details about the ships themselves, I'd suggest Parkes' superb British Battleships, which is the definitive book on British Battleships from 1860 onwards."},{"Title":"Sustainable Cuisine: White Papers","review":"This elegant and informative book is the perfect introduction to the concept of sustainability - the meaning of which is self-evident but a working and uniform definition elusive.

Jellinek from therefore was made a movie with the same title.And this is because basically these are the same questions. Some people -in this two cases are women- have become unable to feel without the aid of strong experiences, so they have to search in masochism what more usual relations can't give. In the case of the Austrian piano teacher all that goes too far in search of a sense for living and she cuts herself with a razor. In the case of Anita Phillips the book is only a series of theories, but at deep are the same idea that for feel alive you must feel something. Usually this is supossed to be agreable feelings, but if this become impossible, some persons can search that in pain."},{"Title":"Big Fraid Little Fraid","review":"This humorous folktale from the hills of North Carolina is fun to read aloud to primary grade students during the dark, dreary days of October. This version, adapted in 1964 by the author from a story he heard as a child, centers around big brother Dave, who is always playing practical jokes on Ma, Pa and Little Chub, his younger brother. Their pet monkey, a gift from a sailor uncle, plays a key role in the climax of this tale, as Dave gets his &quot;come-uppance.&quot;The &quot;fraids&quot; are anything you can't see in the dark that make you afraid. Dave pretends to be a fraid to scare little Chub, who is coming in from the fields at dusk, but the monkey imitates him behind his back, giving him a lesson he'll never forget.It's unfortunate that this title is out-of-print, but it's a fun, just a little &quot;scary,&quot; introduction to folktales from the South. I imagine it could be special-ordered or found at a public or school library. A few words in this version are a bit archaic, but it's easy to replace terms like &quot;trowsers&quot; with &quot;pants.&quot; This story works with kids, with or without a Southern dialect."},{"Title":"On the yard;: A novel","review":"The NYRB lost classics series strikes gold again-- a rich, masterful, deeply authentic journey through prison life in the 1960s.

Remember all the mistakes you and your friends made? Well, in _Another Day, Another Dungeon_, Greg Costikyan incorporates all the silliness and stupidity of an introductory session of D&amp;D into a hilarious novel.The characters (quite appropriately) make this novel shine. In the adventuring party, you have a couple of quarrelling rogues, a dwarf who hauls around more equipment than loot, an extremely inexperienced mage, a drunken cleric, and (my favorite) a towering barbarian with more muscle than wit. Throw in a treacherous lizard man scout, a seductive necromancer, a slew of stuffy semi-retired adventurers who all seem to be based on Major-General Stanley of the _Pirates of Penzance_, and a few orcs, and you have the makings of a really funny read. Oh, did I forget to mention the centuries old all-powerful wizard (what adventure campaign would be complete without one of those)? Not to be missed is the evil elven crime lord (aww, isn't he CUTE?).The plot is straightforward enough. Timaeus D'Asperge, newly graduated from the local magic university, assembles a group of adventurers to tackle the nearby dreaded Caverns of Cytorax. Isn't it odd that in nearly every beginning adventure, there is a conveniently located dungeon filled with evil nasties, but close enough to town that the adventurers can be home by dinner? Anyway, the adventurers soon find that the treasure they bring home will cause them much more trouble than the Caverns. The whole town erupts as nearly everyone tries to steal the treasure from D'Asperge and his comrades.The book is great fun, and will be a favorite of anyone who has ever played D&amp;D or the like. If you've never played D&amp;D, or don't even have a clue as to what it is, the book will still keep you rolling. I highly recommend it to anyone who doesn't take their roleplaying too seriously.If you do take your roleplaying too seriously, might I suggest the 1982 made for TV movie \\"Mazes and Monsters\\" starring a very young Tom Hanks."},{"Title":"Another Day, Another Dungeon (Cups and Sorcery, Book 1)","review":"Costikyan has been around the RPG/gaming world about as long as I have--since the seventies.

I did when I read it for the first time at fifteen, before I had hardcore experience with gaming. The second read at thirty showed me the magic had gone.So why don't I love it anymore? I've lived the common roleplaying errors this book parodies. It reminded me not of hilarity, but of my own bad times with gamer stereotypes. The theme failed me. As far as humor in fantasy goes, Terry Pratchett does it a thousand times better (much rather read his stuff than 'greeps'). As far fantasy gamer humor, I find the comic books involving Kenzer and Co's 'Knights of the Dinner Table' superior.The scene with two wizards playing historical army warhammer and arguing about the color of unit's buttons reminded me of frustrating arguments that have ruined my gaming sessions. Such a scene is very illustrative of the dimensionality of the book -- all the characters are walking stereotypes of their classes -- sink like a stone dwarf, dumb barbarian, drunk cleric, idiot-savant mages, stupid orcs, cutesy elves, and so on. Even the original characters like the mycologist duke and polymage don't grab you emotionally, rather they are defined only by their quirks, under which no substance exists.As a novel, this work is meh. As gamer sub-culture humor, it succeeds masterfully, provided you are into powergaming and not roleplaying. Your not supposed to care about these characters, they're there so you can laugh at them. I didn't like that, and it's part of the reason I'm not rolling dice in a campaign myself.But hey, maybe I have baggage here. If you're a young gamer, you'll probably love this book like I once did. It can be a quick fun read if you don't have set expectations or bitter memories of old campaigns that went in the ashes over egos."},{"Title":"Another Day, Another Dungeon (Cups and Sorcery, Book 1)","review":"A witty adventure that's hard to put down.A must-buy for anyone whose ever role-played!Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Another Day, Another Dungeon (Cups and Sorcery, Book 1)","review":"This is one of the books Garni has been toting for years in his backpack beside his eleven foot pole.It is a must for a starting adventurer handbook for what not to do.........i laughed and cried best book i have read in years"},{"Title":"Another Day, Another Dungeon (Cups and Sorcery, Book 1)","review":"Just finished the book and I loved the humor - I'm on my way to the book store for book 2"},{"Title":"Another Day, Another Dungeon (Cups and Sorcery, Book 1)","review":"Quite possibly one of the most humorous books I've everread.

Unless you are some type of literature major, this book is boring, difficult to read - meaning it just doesn't flow well. Oh the horror, the horror..."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and Selected Short Fiction (Barnes & Noble Classics)","review":"Joseph Conrad is one of the greatest short story and novella writers, and this excellent omnibus has four of his best short works: \\"Youth,\\" \\"Heart of Darkness,\\" \\"Amy Foster,\\" and \\"The Secret Sharer.\\" All are essential for any fan or critic and an excellent place for the curious to start. However, all are available in many editions with widely varying supplemental material and prices. Readers must decide what edition suits their needs, but anyone wanting a representative selection with substantial supplementary material at a reasonable price could do no better.\\"Youth\\" is one of Conrad's most famous and acclaimed stories but is in my view the weak link. Like the better-known \\"Heart of Darkness,\\" it is told by the character Marlow through another first-person narrator, but the plot is more akin to the symbolic, adventure-esque seafaring stories of prior Conrad. There is more traditional excitement and suspense than in most Conrad, especially later work, which may attract those who usually dislike his fiction. However, as nearly always with him, symbolism is the real point. As the title suggests, this is a tale about youth and all it stands for and arguably one of its best literary representations. Marlow recalls the excitement and elation he felt when he first captained a ship, fondly recalling exuberance and navet&eacute; long since lost. However, as so often in such situations, nearly everything goes wrong, and youthful ideals are put to experience's harshly dramatic test. \\"Youth\\" is thus a sort of mini-bildungsroman, though Marlow's mad rush for the symbolic finish at the end of his story proper shows he learned very little at the time. However, he is now wiser and older, and retelling the old story brings several ambivalent feelings. He sees how much he has conventionally grown and learned but cannot help lamenting the loss of idealism that is possible only in youth and that steadily dissipates with age to the extent that it becomes hardly recognizable. Many will unfortunately relate strongly to this, and there is a good dose of Conrad's always beautiful prose and, very unusually for him, even a little humor. \\"Youth\\" would easily be most writers' masterpiece but lacks the scope, ambition, and style of Conrad's best works.\\"Heart of Darkness\\" is Conrad's most famous and arguably best work - not only one of the greatest short works ever but simply one of the greatest period. At once vividly realistic and profoundly symbolic, it on the one hand did much to expose the Belgian Congo's atrocities and on the other is a brilliant allegory whose precise meaning is still hotly debated over a century later. One would be very hard-pressed to find a text of such length with so many and various interpretations - nay, a text of any length; Shakespeare and a few other mainstays aside, hardly any other English language text has proven so malleable. It has been seen through lenses ranging from historical to psychoanalytic to seemingly everything between them - not least including biographical, as the scariest thing about the story is just how closely it is based on Conrad's experience. \\"Heart\\" is in many ways the culmination of early Conrad, which featured, among other focuses, a strong sea element and an emphasis on European colonialism in Africa and elsewhere. It fuses both into a dark masterpiece that works on many levels. Most simply and obviously, it can be appreciated as a sort of adventure story involving exploration and human endurance pushed to its limit; it has some fine suspense in this sense. Far more importantly, it is an unflinching look into the darkness of humanity's heart - a dramatization of just how low human nature can sink. This is most overt in the depiction of brutal inhumanity toward fellow human beings, but multiple symbolic layers make it all the more disturbing. Conrad shows that, for all civilization's supposed progress, the bestial instincts underlying humanity are only repressed - and quite weakly at that. It takes only an ostensibly primitive setting to bring them out, and when unleashed they can be at least as vicious as any wild animal's and worse in being malicious. Marlow's own harsh experience suggests all this, but it comes across most forcefully in the legendary character Kurtz. Like many ambitious but unethical Europeans of the era, Kurtz had no problem exploiting those in the Congo for personal gain, but the shocking conditions and enforced brutality eventually wear him down to the point where he snaps. It is debatable whether his days end in madness or some extreme guilt/shock combination, but his immortal final words - \\"The horror! The horror!\\" - sum up the whole story and all it symbolizes. The realization of just how bad things are hits Marlow so hard that he cannot bring himself to tell Kurtz's widow the truth, letting her think that his last words were her name, though he was so far gone that he had no time to even think of such things. As his final comment says, \\"It would have been too dark--too dark altogether...\\" Much the same may be said of the story itself, so realistically unflattering is its humanity depiction, which is a large part of the reason it is a masterwork. There are many others, not least Conrad's hauntingly beautiful and complex prose. Much of his reputation as a stylist comes from this, and it is simply incredible that he was not a native English speaker.These factors among many others made \\"Heart\\" a standard of English curricula for decades, and its popularity shows no sign of lessening. However, it has been the focus of attention for another reason in the last few decades - racist accusations stemming from African writer Chinua Achebe's famous essay. Conrad was certainly prejudiced and ethnocentric, if not necessarily racist in today's sense, which is reflected in \\"Heart\\" and most of his other work. That said, for what it is worth, he was no more so than the average writer - much less the average person - of his day. Indeed, his experience as a Polish, initially non-English speaking outsider on ships around the world and in England gave him more empathy for those outside mainstream Western culture than nearly anyone else in it could have had. One can even argue that it is perverse to pick on \\"Heart\\" when racist overtones can be found in nearly every work from the Victorian era - nay, nearly everything right up until the last few decades - since it shows some empathy for Africans, is generally seen as anti-colonialist, and eventually helped lead to reform. Many also say that such a stance misses the story's larger point, racist or not. Yet there is much to Achebe's reading, and all serious fans should read it and make their own decision. Many editions include it, but all should seek it out.This debate is also relevant to \\"Amy Foster\\"; Conrad's most underrated story, it shows the sufferings and uncertainties of outsiders in Western culture. Again inspired by Conrad's life, though considerably more dramatized than \\"Heart,\\" it shows that he was keenly aware of just how alone even an ostensibly well-adjusted foreigner could be in nineteenth century Western Europe. Drenched in pathos, this is one of Conrad's most moving works and very thought-provoking. It is also of historical interest for those curious about the era's treatment of foreigners and other outsiders and abounds with anthropological significance. Including this is one of the collection's true strengths, as it is not as frequently anthologized as the rest.\\"The Secret Sharer\\" is one of Conrad's final works of major short fiction and one of his best. It finds him returning to the sea after a long absence and has much of the suspense and adventurous spirit of his early works. Indeed, it may well be his most suspenseful and conventionally entertaining work of all; its influence on later writers is easy to see. This is so much so that it can be enjoyed by nearly anyone on this surface level, but as always with Conrad, there is deep symbolic value. \\"The Secret\\" again dramatizes outsider status, though more subtly and ambiguously than \\"Amy.\\" It also deals with other important themes, including the clash of rules and personal morality, authority vs. individualism, etc. The story ends the collection on a very high note and will, along with the rest, lead readers to seek more Conrad.Like all Barnes & Noble Classics editions, this has a wealth of supplemental material. Perhaps the most valuable is Conrad's own introduction, as his non-fiction pieces are always interesting and often insightful. Secondary material includes a long introduction giving an excellent overview of Conrad's life and thought, the historical context of the stories, and some critical analysis; extensive notes; a Conrad timeline; a rundown of works inspired by \\"Heart\\"; a summary of the stories' critical history; discussion questions; further reading suggestions; and even a map of the Belgian Congo. \\"Heart\\" aside, the stories are among Conrad's most accessible, but he can be a difficult read, making supplemental material necessary for most and invaluable for many. There are so many extras here that even hard-cores who already have the stories may be interested. That said, those who care not for extras will be able to find these stories - likely along with others - in cheaper editions, and those wanting more stories will also have to look elsewhere. All others can rejoice in this excellent collection."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and Selected Short Fiction (Barnes & Noble Classics)","review":"Bought it for school, it was the same price as the other Heart of Darkness books, however this one had another story from Conrad lodged in it, so I went for this one.Can't say I actually like the book. Had to read it for class. It was too drawling for me. The protagonist seemed intent on drawing out every statements in mundane rants. There was a decent message in there, but the style of writing is very difficult to swallow. It was like trudging through molasses attempting to read this... It's such a short book, took me 2 weeks!!"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and Selected Short Fiction (Barnes & Noble Classics)","review":"Although English was not his initial language, I think that had it been, Conrad would have wielded much the same command of the language as Shakespeare in his day. But regardless of the writing quality, this is also a gripping and mesmerizing story. Perhaps some of this is because Conrad used to be in the same line of work as the main character, Marlow, who recurs in many of his works, but this story delves far beyond mere personal reflections, dealing with far more difficult and weighty issues than, say, Anna Karenina, and even many of the plays of Shakespeare; But, for me, the story is nevertheless as thrilling as any modern day mass-market novel, if not more because of its superior writing and philosophical quality. My favorite sections are Part 2, and the final scene, so don't give up early. I would give this six stars if I could. This is not my favorite edition, but the one I read first."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and Selected Short Fiction (Barnes & Noble Classics)","review":"An excellent collection of short fiction.

This is a good publication, though, I like the larger text and the approachability of it."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and Selected Short Fiction (Barnes & Noble Classics)","review":"What I like about Josef Conrad is his subject matter, philosophical bent, and eloquent style.Apart from that however, this book was somewhat disappointing to me. What I wanted from this novel was for the author to see-even for a moment- the beauty and vibrancy of the Congo, to draw positivity and joy.Instead, he writes from a time flush with the new creed of Darwinism, by which \\"superior races\\" are granted the right to vanquish or dominate the inferior. Gripped by this hopeless and empty doctrine, the author suffered long fits of depression. For example he describes life as \\" The mysterious arrangement of logic for a futile purpose\\" (P116). He overdoes the \\"horror\\" of the whole scene, but it is worth remembering that the apalling Belgian exploitation of the Congo was not representative of all European colonialism.Conrads weak points are once again, his characterization. The main character Kurtz never really steps into life, neither do any of the others. There is not much action or interplay between events and characters. The book reads like a boy's adventure tale, centering around the hero-worship of Kurtz, an apparent paragon of malehood. It ends abruptly and unexpectedly, and the overall effect is somewhat flat and unsatisfying.Of the short stories included in this volume, \\"Youth\\" Is an enjoyable short story capturing a sailors memory of youth. It has elements that most can relate to and is pleasant prose. \\"Amy Foster\\" is a likeable delve into anti-foreigner xenephobia and the lonely lives of outsiders or castaways trying to fit into British society. The fact that Conrad writes as a foreign settler in the UK is one of the most interesting facets to his writing. \\"The Secret Shearer\\" is a nice and fairly gripping short story."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and Selected Short Fiction (Barnes & Noble Classics)","review":"Wanted to get a copy of the classic tale and found one for only .99 cents. amazingly inexpensive and quickly shipped.

In Sontag's words, the novel was \\"inspired by the emigration to America in 1876 of Helena Modrzejewska, Poland's most celebrated actress, accompanied by her husband, Count Karol Chlapowski, her fifteen-year-old son Rudolf, and the young journalist and future author of 'Quo Vadis' Henryk Sienkiewicz, and a few friends; their brief sojourn in Anaheim, California; and Modrzejewska's subsequent triumphant career on the American stage under the name of Helen Modjeska.\\" While Sontag strongly emphasizes that the characters and actions depicted in her novel are purely invented (and there is no reason to believe the contrary), the plot largely follows the biography that inspired it.\\"In America\\" begins in a post-modernist fashion, the book's \\"Chapter Zero\\" being the first person narrative of a contemporary authorial voice who finds herself coming out of the cold winter of an unidentified Eastern European city, shivering, into a party in the private dining room of a hotel more than a hundred years earlier. There is seemingly a disjunction of time and place. The narrator does not understand the language the people are speaking, \\"but somehow, I didn't question how, their words reached me as sense.\\" From this point, the authorial voice, the imagination, begins naming the people in the room-in effect, begins creating the characters that will populate the tale to follow-and begins probing the animated conversation she overhears, the snippets of enigmatic dialogue that will gradually accrete into the novel. As the narrator suggests at the end of this Chapter Zero, in words resonant of a theme by Virginia Woolf, \\"each of us carries a room within ourselves, waiting to be furnished and peopled, and if you listen closely, you may need to silence everything in your own room, you can hear the sounds of that other room inside your head.\\" Thus, in typical Sontag fashion, the novel itself begins with a self-conscious intrusion of theory and authorial presence.From this interesting and auspicious beginning, \\"In America\\" seamlessly glides into the narrative proper, the story of Maryna Zalezowska, a much beloved Polish actress who, together with her husband Bogdan, her son Piotr, her paramour Ryszard, and an entourage of friends and followers, emigrates to America in 1876. Landing in New York, the group spends a brief period living in Hoboken, visiting the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia and exploring New York City before embarking on a voyage to the West. After a brief sojourn in San Francisco, they move down the coast to Southern California, where they establish a small settlement in Anaheim. Maryna, the leader of her band of ardent disciples, sees their vineyard and farm in Anaheim as a kind of acting out of Fourieristic ideals, a little Brook Farm of Polish emigrants in the Wild West. Life is hard, however, and the utopian dream soon becomes a dystopic unraveling as Maryna goes back to San Francisco, has a brief affair with Ryzsard and returns to the theater. Her husband, Bogan, remains at the Anaheim settlement until it can be sold and then rejoins Maryna in San Francisco, where she has become an overnight theatrical sensation, her Polish stardom now burning brightly in America.From this point, the novel becomes almost exclusively the story of Maryna. She changes her name to Marina Zalenska, travels to Virginia City and, eventually, New York City (and even, briefly, London), and attracts fans and admirers wherever she goes. Her life becomes a self-centered, exhaustive tour of America, performing with her own repertory company and making stage appearances with the Edwin Booth, the most renowned actor of the time. Pushing the narrative's other characters into the shadows, Marina Zalenska makes America her own, \\"In America\\" being not so much the story of what it was like for a group of Eastern Europeans to emigrate to America, but, rather, the story of Marina Zalenska's personal triumph in America.Susan Sontag is a brilliant writer, her prose supple and lithe. Reading this book is effortless. Sontag also uses a range of stylistic devices-journal entries, letters, theatrical dialogue, monologue-which make \\"In America\\" a fascinating literary construction. However, the quality of the writing does not redeem the listless tenor of the tale or the shallowness of the characters and ideas which Sontag propogates. At one point, Maryna says, \\"an actor doesn't need to have an essence. Perhaps it would be a hindrance for an actor to have an essence. An actor needs only a mask.\\" Unfortunately, Maryna's view of acting seemingly permeates this novel, the view of the character becoming the practice of the author: the characters and the ideas of \\"In America\\" are not essential, but only superficial. Like the post-modernist beginnings of Chapter Zero, the reader only gets a shallow tale, a tale that glides on a sparkling smooth surface with trivial and uninteresting characters; while the writing is easy, the story fails to hold the reader's interest and, hence, the reading becomes difficult and soporific. \\"In America\\" is perhaps worth reading, but it is not deserving of the National Book Award."},{"Title":"In America.","review":"This book tells the story of an actress, Maryna Zalezowska, a character Sontag tells us is loosely based on the career of Helena Modjeska, a famous turn-of-the-century Polish actress. The basic story is of her acting life in Poland and subsequent move to the \`promised land' of America, where she sets up a commune with fellow artists and friends, and continues her acting triumphs.Throughout the book Sontag blurs fact and fiction. Real-life characters, such as the American actor Edwin Booth, interact with the fictional characters. Similarly, we hear of Sarah Bernhardt, described as Zalezowka's greatest rival, and of key moments in American history. Sontag is clearly trying to retell the American myth in fiction, and this is certainly not the first time a writer has used the method of using both real and fictional characters - Cervantes's Don Quijote is an early example. However, with this book, Sontag fails to convince on either the fictional side or the depiction of the reality of emerging America. Character description is poor and it is extremely difficult to engage with the heroine. This is partly because there is so little context - we get no sense of her struggle with her adopted country, and no picture of any of the minor characters, with the possible exception of her husband, Bogdan. This is a shame, because the other characters are potentially extremely interesting. One commits suicide - we have little idea why. We don't really find out what any of the Poles think about their new land, or their new neighbours. At the end of the book they simply go back to Poland. Again, it's not clear why, or whether they feel they have succeeded or failed in their artistic endeavour. Similarly, Sontag seems to have little of interest to say about the new land. America is seen as the place where \`everything is new', where \`money is important' and where you can \`create your own future'. No major insights there! There are things to enjoy and appreciate in the book - the descriptions of theatrical life being particularly interesting - but these are are few and far between.Sontag is an extremely self-conscious narrator, constantly reminding the reader that she is there, commenting on the story she is telling. This prevents her from losing herself in the story, and the reader from doing the same. This is partly a problem of the novel of ideas. Yet plenty of other authors have managed to bring a novel of ideas alive, Milan Kundera being a good example. Sadly, as in her other fictional work, the reader of In America feels the presence of the theorist/philosopher too strongly to be able to enjoy the book as a work of fiction, and is left feeling frustrated."},{"Title":"In America.","review":"Electing to read IN AMERICA beacuse of its awards I found this bloated novel to be a bit heavy on author intrusiveness. As many have pointed out, the first chapter (actually a 27 page paragraph) makes the author analyze a room of Polish people and, without knowing the language or actually hearing conversations in toto, assign them roles as if casting the play that follows. I think this is why we are left with incompletely fleshed out characters. The premise of the book ( expatriation from European nobility to American homgenation) has been written before and better. There are pages of beautiful descriptive writing to be sure - Sontag is well practiced at her craft - but in the end we are left not really caring about the stolid, laborious venture through which we've waded. Though Sontag is hypnotized by studies of history's influences on the present, I think she writes better when she sticks to her own metier."},{"Title":"In America.","review":"I read this book because it won the National Book Award for fiction this year, and I am trying to read all such winners so I figured I should read this year's winner.

They shouldn't. It would have helped me if I had read the back of the title page, which tells whence Susan Sontag drew her inspiration, and how this book relates to the factual setting of the period. I found this book once the central character and her group decided to come to America very interesting reading, and consistently holding my attention. Extra tidbits which interested me were the stray references to events and people referred to in the story: e.g.: Mayne Reid? Do you know who he was? I looked him up in a reference work. Ditto as to the novel and play East Lynne. This is a historical novel where the factual historical references are accurate so far as I can tell, not like some historical novels. I remember how bothered I was by Sir Walter Scott's Kenilworth, which had no chronolgical consistency to it that I could see. (The story is laid in the period 1574 and 1575, but Amy Robsart actually died in 1560; Shakespeare appears in the book, but was not even born before Amy Robsart died.) Give this book a chance, I say."},{"Title":"In America.","review":"Susan Sontag won the National Book award for \`In America'yesterday. Having just finished this book I wonder why? It is a goodbook, but not a great one.Another reviewer here attacked \`InAmerica' because it did not have much plot. That reviewer might becomplaining that long passages of the book are letters and excerptsfrom a diary laid out in chronological order. It is true this is nota fast-moving page-turner, but plot is not why one usually readsSontag. Rather the insight that is typical of Sontag's book-lengthessays is what you would expect to find in her novel.If there isanything insightful here it must in the in the interplay between thethree major characters in the novel. They are the famous Polishactress Maryna, her husband Bogdan, and her bachelor friend Rysard.The opening scene of the novel is so far fetched as to be not evenbelievable. We are at a cocktail party in Poland. An unnamednarrator, who does not speak of world of Polish, relates what ishappening. Yet she claims to understand the events that transpirearound her. That is ridiculous and annoying.From this oddbeginning the novel picks up speed and becomes more interesting.Maryna surmises that she cannot remain at the pinnacle of Polishtheater forever. She wonders, \`The public is fickle. My public wantsto love a newer, younger face.' This is her reason she wants to quitPoland and move to America. She gathers together her retinue afriend who is a painter, a doctor, and other hangers-on andretreats to the mountains. There most of her circle decides to moveto the New World and establish a commune.The commune is establishedin Anaheim, California. At that time (19th century) the countrysidewas mostly empty having been recently settled by German immigrants.The farm that Maryna and her friends establish is called a \`commune'by some other book reviewers. But to me it seems that Maryna was ableto convince her friends to move with her largely by the weight of herpersonality. I did not find that she said \`let's establish acommunistic commune'. Yet that is exactly what her neighbors did inSouthern California. There were several patterned on the Brook Farmand the writings of Fourier. These were true communistic ventureswhose plight and origins are described by Edmund Wilson in \`To theFinland Station'.Maryna is pursued across Poland and then inAmerica by her writer friend Rysard. He writes articles on the Polishactress and on his own journey to America for Polish newspapers.Rysard seeks the love of Maryna. (It appears they were loversbefore.) Maryna's husband for reasons that I never learned evenencourages them to travel to San Francisco together. Would you sendyou wife off with someone who was seeking her affection?Maryna leftthe commune she had established and moved to San Francisco to seek toreenter the theatre. Her main motive appears that the commune wasrunning out of cash, but she also wants to prove that she can succeedin the English-speaking American theater. The commune falls apartwhen the \`expatriate intellectuals' as they callthemselves prove inept at making a living growing grapes. Therewere also domestic difficulties such as perennial fights between oneof the married couples there. Each commune dweller drifted away forhis or her own reason.Maryna says \`Every marriage, every communityis a failed utopia. Utopia is not a kind of place but a kind of time, those all too brief moments when one would not wish to be anywhere else.'Anyway, as other reviewers have already pointed out, Maryna returns to the theatre and triumphs. This return did not seem so triumphant as it was written by Sontag at the onset. It appeared more happenstance. But later descriptions of Maryna on-stage and the resultant accolades make the reader more convinced that Maryna deserves to be called a great actress.The character Rysard might be Susan Sontag's alter ego. Rysard, the writer, says that he cannot stand people, but the love of people is required in order to be a writer. Rysard makes several other comments on the craft of writing that perhaps come from the opinions of Susan Sontag."},{"Title":"In America.","review":"What a disappointing bore! Our reading group expected an interesting and vibrant story about the utopian communities that formed in California in the 1870s.

In terms of both style and content, our book club all agreed that this was the most poorly written book we've read. Some of the books we've thought had interesting, thought-provoking stories include: Tales of Genji, White Oleander, Yellow Raft on Blue Water, and The Poisonwood Bible. We didn't feel that there was any beauty to the writing in Sontag's book. We agreed that we would have been interested in discovering more about the characters and their lives.

Astoundingly irritating!"},{"Title":"In America.","review":"\\"In America\\" is a strange, beautiful and difficult book among Susan Sontag's oeuvre. Better known by her non-fiction, this one is a quasi-departure from her milieu. Likewise her previous fictional effort, \\"The Volcano Lover\\", this is a historical novel, loosely based on true events. But, Sontag is an artist, therefore, her work is more than simply retelling a real story.As she tells in a brief introduction, this work is inspired by the life of Poland's most celebrated actress and her immigration to America. \\"Inspired by... no less and no more.\\" With these words, we learn that Sontag has appropriated of the characters and made them her own. This is certainly one of the most intriguing aspects of \\"In America\\" - how an artist recreates life the way it pleases her fiction. This theme is very suitable since it is a novel about an artist (the protagonist) who has to reinvent herself in order to survive when her dreams of a utopian society go astray.The character is Maryna Zalezowska, Poland's most celebrated actress of her time, who has conquered hearts and minds with her art. Tired of this life, she immigrates to America, taking with her, her husband, son, lover and some friends. America appears to her as a dream, as something that could never go wrong, a place where money meets dream and they are happily married.After Maryna's idealist community doesn't work out, she has to recreate herself, and return to the stage. Once a celebrated actor, now like a newcomer she has to prove her talent. The approach of art - especially theater - is different in the States from Europe. But she is a smart woman capable of giving audiences what they want - even if that means corrupting herself somehow sometimes.It feels like Sontag is telling us this is the art of being an American. The art of reinventing one's self whenever and however it is needed. Maryna is the intersection of both worlds - the Old and the New one. Love has a role in her life, as well, but smaller than art. Maryna lives and dies for the theater - in other words, for her art.While Sontag is very known by her essays on culture, politics and so on, her novels are distinctive for dealing these subjects inserted in a fictional account. Despite being written a decade ago, \\"In America\\" is tremendously up to date. This is a story about what makes one country, and what immigrants find in their new country. America is receptive to Maryna once she is able to give what her audience wants. What do they want? That is a very tricky question. Love, for once. But they are also delighted with death. But above all, they want to be more than Europeans. Noble titles, as a character says, are very impressive to Americans - and who cares if they are real.As a post-modern novel, the opening and closing chapters, are quite interesting. Both of them are a first person account of Sontag herself entering in Maryna's world and departing from it. However difficult they are for a reader - they are a single paragraph twenty-page long - these sequences in \\"In America\\" are beautiful and meaningful. The strange feeling they give us is certainly related to Maryna's own strangeness of a foreigner in a country in the making."},{"Title":"In America.","review":"I expected to like this novel; Sontag has a wonderful reputation and the storyline had potential.

On the cover it says it won the National Book Award of 2000 and awards mean a good read. The plot is great - a famous Polish actress decides to emigrate to America with her family and friends and start a community in southern California. The story follows their decision to move to America and the eventual failure of their community and the reinvention of self - a homage to the American dream where you can be anything in America.I wanted to like this book, its full of great detail, moments of brilliance but I couldn't. I hated the writing style. It was like walking across mudflats at low tide, you sink to your thighs in the mud and each footstep is an effort but you press on thinking all the time how great it will feel to get to the other side and surely it will get easier at some point. When you finally get to the other side you are covered in mud and too exhausted to be excited about having conquered the mud flats. You just look back thinking why did I bother.Meredith Brocklebank author of In the Realm of the Golden Queen"},{"Title":"In America.","review":"In a long and very public career, Susan Sontag has made a great many pronouncements, and inevitably some have come back to haunt her. Certainly her characterization of the white race as the cancer of history seens like a grandiose bit of breast-beating. But hey, there's no point in beating up on her new novel for a statement she made nearly 25 years ago. &quot;In America&quot; is by no means a perfect work of fiction--to call it a novel of ideas is in fact the highest compliment AND the lowest blow you could aim at it. Yet it's packed with strange and cerebral wonders that only Sontag could dream up. And the protagonist is a truly memorable, realistically erratic diva, who cuts a dramatic (in every sense of the word) swathe across late Victorian America."},{"Title":"In America.","review":"The best feature of Sontag's novel was the narative style which did not fail to change from Chapter to Chapter. Sometimes it was in an omniscient voice, and other times in the character's own first person narative, in writing and speech, which brought us into the minds and thoughts of the various fascinating Poles in the story. The plot of the story is ineresting in itself to a certain degree, but the idea of leaving Europe and forging a new life in America must have been re-done many times over esp. in the original immigrant literature. The irony of how the Europeans went to America to leave what they were used to behind, to escape the fetters, but seem to pursue the exact same fetters in America is present in Sontag's novel. It also brings out the other ironic element of wanting to do something different and unexpected, but falling into the mold in wanting to form an utopian community which was fashionable at the time. I enjoyed the flow of the storyline and the characterisation of Ryszard as the writer and Maryna as an actress, artists who without art will lose their self, and their use. The first Chapter of the book also leaves one wondering -- was that the author as a persona -- Sontag imagining her characters into play? As a writer would? To see their world, enter it, and develop it? Or was it a neutral observer preparing is for Maryna's plan to leave for America? Sontag's novel of immigration, America, Europe, art, religion and relationships is thought-provoking and a fascinating study. Highly enjoyable."},{"Title":"In America.","review":"Our book club agrees totally with L.A. Readers Anonymous. Terrible.

Boasting some of the most gorgeous prose ever committed to print, it is bursting with heartfelt yearning and promise for the future as it traces the path taken by the celebrated stage actress Maryna and her community of friends, who embittered by their history of colonisation by the Russians, chose to leave Poland in the late 19th century to build a utopian commune in America. Their grand agrarian experiment to rediscover the vitality of simple living and return to basics fails. Due to lack of experience or otherwise, Maryna's commune comprising scholars, writers, painters and their families, breaks up and some of them return to their former lives in Poland. Maryna herself, after a brief period of self imposed exile returns to active professional life and quickly establishes herself as a celebrity once again but this time in her newly adopted country. &quot;In America&quot; raises a whole cache of fascinating ideas. It contrasts the inherent cynicism and corruption of old world values with the innocence, optimism but also shallowness of new world morality. Sontag's ambitious novel starts off promisingly, using an unnamed female narrator who then mysteriously disappears, never to show up again. The narrative then segues seamlessly into a penetrating and fascinating peek into the Polish soul. Using a blend of shifting perspectives, the experience is both insightful and mesmerising. But when the utopian commune breaks up, some of the magic in Sontag's writing also evaporates. Certainly I found the final 100 pages or so a little pedestrian. The use of a jumble of literary formats including letters, poems, rotating confessions, etc also gives a slightly disjointed and unstructured feel to the book. The concluding section featuring a soliloquy by Edwin Booth emerges from nowhere to close the book ! Talk of abrupt endings. However, the high points were so absorbing I was too far away in seventh heaven to notice or mind. &quot;In America&quot; is an outstanding literary achievement. It may not make easy reading but it'll repay your effort many times over. Don't miss it !"},{"Title":"In America.","review":"I read this book as my first Sontag excursion. I picked it because it won the National Book Award. I was incredibly disappointed in the book. True enough, Sontag is an excellent writer and an expressive one as well. However, in this book, she seems to have been carried away by a desire to show the reader, just how many different writing styles she seems to perceive herself to have mastered. She slips into perhaps six different styles of writing in the book, ranging from the epistolary, to the stream of consciousness to the plain prose. The book is more an experiment in stylized writing techniques and the plot and story are just plain droll. I found myself wishing I was at the end, by the time I got to the half way point. While it is unusual for the NBA to give their award to such a mediocre piece of literature, it would be my recommendation to any would be reader that they NOT WASTE THEIR TIME reading THIS BOOK. It is not worth the investment. I would have rather reread the plays by Shakespeare and others that she constantly references in her book, just so the reader understands she has a complete knowledge of classic thesbian literature. I will not bother to read any of her other works, nor any future ones either."},{"Title":"In America.","review":"After the intruiging, if slightly awkward, opening chapter in which Sontag insinuates herself into the narrative, this high brow soap opera begins to skirt terrain already charted by the likes of the far less gifted Isabel Allende in, say, &quot;Daughter of Fortune&quot; or &quot;The Infinite Plan&quot;, though it never abandons its philosophy in favor of melodramtic plot twists, as did those unfortunate books. Indeed, there's far more substance and interest here in Sontag's dissection of cultural displacement, artistic integrity and sexual mores than there is in the fairly listless plot, which always seems to be moving forward without ever gaining steam. Even the most dramatic of events (the collapse of the Anaheim compound, for instance) is rendered with such clear-eyed dispassion that it can be hard to care about these characters or their various fates. That said, this novel is so wrought with provocative ideas, the prose is so elegant, that only the most shallow of readers will fail to be drawn into the world (or, rather, worlds) which Sontag has beautifully delineated: the Old World vs. the New, the material world vs. the interior (artistic) world. If this book fails to reach the narrative and intellectual heights of &quot;The Volcano Lover&quot;, it offers enough rewards of its own to make it worthwhile reading. And every new Sontag book is a welcome addition to the shelves, whatevers its flaws."},{"Title":"In America.","review":"This odd novel is like a charming house surrounded by an imposing edifice. While I found the idea of the first chapter very appealing - we observe the author considering her characters and gradually entering their lives - the lack of paragraphs and sustained distance were frustrating. I kept turning to the blurbs on the back to give me faith that the book would achieve motion. When it finally did, it felt like a railroad train developing steam and then chugging right along. The stories of New York and Anaheim at the turn of the century were wonderful, as were the carefully researched tales of trouping in America. Maryna, both a diva and marvelously complex woman, was grand enough to carry the novel and most of the major characters on her back. The novel's coda, unfortunately, was as dense and forbidding as the opening. While I enjoyed reading Edwin Booth's reflections on a life in Shakespeare and was fascinated by the fate of the Booths, more of my attention was commanded by Sontag than either Booth or Marina. Perhaps that brought the act of imagination full circle with the author once again facing her creation, but I missed the livelier environs of the heart of the book, when Marina was stealing the spotlight and creating the illusion of something larger than life."},{"Title":"In America.","review":"In this novel, a Polish theater star travels to America with her troop of blindly smitten friends and family in the late 19th century to live off the land and hide from the spotlight. When her plan for self-sufficiency on the farm fails, she challenges the American theater stage.The beautiful Polish actress, Madame Zalenska, whose self-centeredness is nauseating, does offer a level of sharp wit and intelligence that at times makes her likeable or at least respectable. There are rare glimpses of Sontag's tendency for profound insight throughout the novel in terms of her ability to recognize and document the subtle delicacies of human relationships. Kernels of Sontag's views on American culture, sexuality, race, and art are present in the novel but in the context of the shallow story they appear out of place.The novel contains far too many boring lists of Madame Zalenska's numerous performances and far too many hyperbolic descriptions of Zalenska's seemingly superhuman acting ability and feminine charm.Zalenska's brief venture into the role of a farm wife in Santa Ana, California was the most interesting part of the novel as it offered some respite from the \\"star quality\\" of Zalenska that had become tiring early in the novel.The novel ended abruptly coinciding with the introduction of a character who had been merely mentioned prior.

Like most such communities, it failed, and so, with a newly Americanized name, Helena Modjeska launched a second career as her adopted country's leading Shakespearean actress, touring coast to coast with such celebrity actors as Edwin Booth.These are the skeletal historical facts on which Sontag bases her second novel: Helena Modjeska becomes Maryna Zalenska, Henryk Sienkiewicz becomes Ryszard Kierul, although Booth gets to keep his name. This local slice of Anaheim history was rediscovered by Sontag and stuck with her; the novel's genesis is re-imagined in the opening Chapter \\"Zero,\\" one of the most brilliant examples of metafiction ever published. A twentieth-century writer is walking through a winter storm in Warsaw when she happens by a party inside a hotel--a scene, of course, that takes place wholly in her mind. She listens in on their conversations and realizes that the celebrants are planning to leave for America; although theirs is not the story she had planned to write (\\"having tried to conjure up a hotel dining room from the same era in Sarajevo\\"), she \\"decided to follow them out into the world.\\"\\"Into the world\\" means \\"into America,\\" and, for an immigrant, Sontag's Zalenska is a bit too perfect, too confident, too understanding--in spite of her affairs and her failings. She's almost a nineteenth-century romantic fantasy figure of imported aristocracy. Sontag sets this feminine ideal against the starry-eyed, comic naivety of the actual and imagined eccentrics who surrounded Modjeska/Zalenska, including a closeted husband with an eye for the local youth and an endearingly irritable voice teacher.The real-life Polish immigrants left behind a rather generous body of texts--journalism, diaries, letters, memoirs--that Sontag made liberal use of when composing her novel, and \\"In America\\" similarly alternates among these various genres during the course of the narrative. The incorporation of scattered passages from the original texts without setting them off from her own writing led to charges of plagiarism against Sontag, although all the excerpts, while obscure, are in the public domain, and one would be hard-pressed to say she tried to hide their use.Such perceived impropriety would have been forgiven, in any case, if Sontag's experiment had resulted in a more cohesive work, but the book occasionally has the whiff of being the product of a writing seminar. The final result is a novel whose chapters fluctuate from postmodern brilliance to family scrapbook. Nevertheless, I still found the story of the Modjeskas/Zalenskas almost consistently fascinating enough to excuse the relatively minor shortcomings of the methods Sontag used to re-imagine their tale."},{"Title":"In America.","review":"Once the gassy raconteuse of Chapter Zero has been endured (this device may have been charming in brief, but does not remain engaging for more than a few pages), there is a brief, disorienting feeling of freedom as the unknown frontier of the novel is broached. Unfortunately, this exuberance dissipates immediately.Not that there isn't a terrific novel hidden In America somewhere.I can't help but wonder why Sontag chose to tell much of the novel from her female protagonist's perspective, since her male narrators are so consistently vividly imagined and effective, and her female characters are not. A scene in steerage and an excerpt from Maryna's husband's diary are much more provocative than Maryna's musing... since the actress-protagonist is a motivating force and an object of adoration, there really isn't much for her to do besides inspire and wonder. Interestingly enough, this imbalance, this failure of imagination when portraying male and female perspectives, is also evident in The Volcano Lover (a much more fully realized book).Perhaps the questions Sontag asked herself in writing this book were never satisfactorily answered for (asked by?) the author... or perhaps the book means to evoke the aridity of both failed dreams and success, as well as the narcissism of the theater and the heavy blankness of the American gaze.Regardless, this is not generally a diverting reading experience, nor is it particularly engaging as a novel of ideas."},{"Title":"In America.","review":"The designation of &quot;National Book Award Winner&quot; has lost all credibility.

At the end we enjoy a visit from an alcoholic Edwin Booth as he soliloquizes re his life, a famous actor-father, Shakespeare, and the brother who killed Lincoln. We see America embrace theater; a thorough, insightful, picture of America in a bygone era. I found this journalistic, historical novel ... very boring for the most part. Certainly not a page-turner. Another disappointment of works picked to receive an award."},{"Title":"In America.","review":"i have not read other sontag works and was really looking forward to this novel by way of introduction. however, other than the highly creative and stunning &quot;chapter zero&quot; there was little to this book. the storyline seemed boring if not trite, and i did not find the writing style particularly interesting either. maryna had my attention off and on, but she and many of the other characters seemed flat to me, alternating between not-quite-alive to over-alive. short of RAVE reviews for some other piece of writing by her, i won't be sampling her other works any time soon."},{"Title":"In America.","review":"I finished reading In America a bit more than a week ago, but it still lingers in my mind. I read the novel with quickness and fascination from beginning to end. Those who have panned it may not recognize (or value) its uniqueness. It blends the form of the script with the form of the novel. For example, it ends with a fascinating soliloquy by Edwin Booth, who goes on for pages as Maryna has before him. It's about the self-obsessed, intriguing, grand lives of great performers more than it is about \\"coming to America\\" or \\"setting up a utopia doomed for failure.\\" It's about self-obsession and not being able to stand the reflection of yourself that you see in others who are like you... It doesn't hold together in a linear way. It's more like Morrison than Frazier or the like. It's inventive in form and style, and I found it fascinating."},{"Title":"In America.","review":"In 1876, a group of Polish immigrants flee the Russian authorities that control their native land. They establish a commune in Southern California. The person behind the journey is Poland's leading actress, Maryna Zalewska who has given up the stage to be with her husband and son IN AMERICA. She persuades several individuals and families to join her on her quest for freedom.However, political and social freedom does not necessarily mean economic freedom. The commune fails, leaving its bankrupt members wary and disillusioned with their taste of freedom. Maryna, not one to sit around and mope, returns to the stage where she becomes the &quot;American&quot; rival to Sara Bernhardt. She wonders about her future IN AMERICA and the dreams that died with the collapse of the commune. With novels like THE VOLCANO LOVER and IN AMERICA, Susan Sontag has become the novelist of choice for historiographers and anyone who enjoys a well-researched period piece. The story line is filled with the abject lessons of American history that is not covered in American classroom settings. Maryna is an intriguing character and her ability to adapt to circumstances is admirable. She fails to gain reader empathy because nothing really disturbs her except her own ennui. Fans who enjoy a well-written historical novel will find Ms. Sontag's tale enchanting and entertaining.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"In America.","review":"I wish I had come to Amazon.com and read all the negative reviews before I wasted $... on this junk. I read the rave reviews on the back of the book and foolishly bought it. It is a rambling collection of pages about a period of history in which I have no interest (the 1800's) and the writing in very choppy and boring. The back of the book gave no clue as to the time period or the nationality of the characters. The &quot;coming to America&quot; stories are my least favorite. I never, ever throw books in the trash-I usually give them to charity or to the library. I threw this one away. I want this book off the street, so no other poor soul would make the same mistake I did and read this drivel."},{"Title":"In America.","review":"Unlike many of the reviewers on this site, I started reading In America expecting not to like it. That's what happens to me with most novels by American Intellectuals. By the end of chapter zero, I was sure I would enjoy hating this book. Only an American Intellectual could listen to a discussion in Polish, without having spent a minute studying the language, and understand the essence of the conversation. But then came the rest of the book, which was a journey through time and interesting places. For me Sontag's California and Poland were the stars of the novel. I especially enjoyed Sontag's pictures of Zakopane in the days before it was taken over by tourists. Sontag's writing reminded me of I.B. Singer. The characters were not as strong, but the flow of the book had that old county feel. So, if you raise you sights a little lower and forget that Sontag is an American great and that this novel won awards, you might actually enjoy it as a light autumn read."},{"Title":"In America.","review":"Sontag had fun recreating all this history and I enjoyed reading it, to a point. What was that long monologue by Edwin Booth - a character who did not appear in the book until nearly the end - doing as a conclusion to a book that was about Maryna? I skipped it. Why not conclude as she began with the conceit of the writer being drawn in by the characters, at the end drawing away and telling the reader how their lives went on?"},{"Title":"In America.","review":"It was great experience to read this book. Yeah! it's great."},{"Title":"In America.","review":"Reading this book is like having someone snatch a particularly juicy feast out from under your nose before you've had the chance to enjoy it properly. &quot;In America&quot; is a rich tale to savor, but slices of it are underdone and it comes to such an abrupt end that the reader is left wondering what happened to the final course.Starting the novel with an awkward Zero chapter--meant, I think, to better explain the characters--Susan Sontag tells of Maryna Zalezowska, the leading Polish actress of the 1870s, who comes to California to open a utopian commune near Anaheim. The commune quickly fails, and Zalezowska begins the task of reinventing herself as an American actress. She does this brilliantly, and begins a new career traveling across the United States in a private train car performing everything from Shakespeare to the 19th century's favorite sob-fest, &quot;East Lynne.&quot;The sections on how an actress of that age learned and prepared roles, and the insight into nuts-and-bolts workings of 19th century American theater are marvelous, as are the stunning monologue chapters expressing the three main characters' internal and external struggles (the book ends with a devastating monologue by Edwin Booth that is one terrific piece of writing). On the other hand some of the characters are barely sketched and &quot;In America&quot; simply ends. There's no resolution, no sense that the last page of the book should be the last page-in fact, you'll probably turn that page expecting a concluding chapter. And you'll feel cheated.There's something mean about allowing readers such access to characters' minds and emotions and then chopping the narrative when there is obviously so much to come. Is it that Sontag can't sustain the narrative? The novel reads that way.It is hard to know how many stars to give &quot;In America.&quot; I found much of it fascinating, but felt slighted by the lack of resolution. Yes, even though I know that the real-life model for Maryna, Helena Modjeska, had a long and successful career before retiring to the remote Southern California canyon that still bears her name, I feel robbed of the chance to follow her there, guided by Sontag's masterly hand."},{"Title":"In America.","review":"Award winning literature should provoke thoughtful questions. Susan Sontag's &quot;In America&quot; prompted my bookclub to ask: 1) Where the heck was her editor? 2) Was it simply Susan Sontag's turn to win the National Book Award? 3) If &quot;In America&quot; was penned by an unknown author, would it have even been published? 4) Did the guy who was quoted on the back cover actually read the book? Would he please tell us where the &quot;hilarious&quot; parts are? 5) Why did the chapters that were 1 paragraph yet 17+ pages long irritate us so? 6) Does a single interesting premise like &quot;Immigrating to a new country allows you to reinvent yourself&quot; merit 387 tedious pages? and finally 7) Why the heck did our bookclub pick this book?"},{"Title":"In America.","review":"I share the same sentiment that others have expressed: Why did this book receive the National Book Award? From its disconnected beginning, to its rambling stream of consciousness ending, the book lacks cohesiveness, character development, and theme. Even the plot is trite and fails to captivate. One senses that Sontag was rushed in the writing -- perhaps hoping to fulfill a contract? Although she bothers to take some time in the beginning to explore Maryna's desire to retreat to America, her family background, and initial delvings into the theatre; Sontag literally whisks the reader through the middle of the book to its conclusion -- dabbling at Maryna's theatre excursions in San Francisco and her touring trip with her husband. More frustrating is Sontag's constant fluxing of writing style -- from hypothetical letters, to experimental conversation in which she addresses multiple people (upon Maryna's brief return to Poland), to the gibberish of a soliloquy delivered by Edwin Booth.Ultimately, the book fails to achieve a unified theme. Sontag hints at the destruction of a utopian society, at the strange interworkings of a marriage of convenience, at an actress's chameleonic personality, at the &quot;plight&quot; of the privileged immigrant. However, none of these themes is explored in depth, nor does any one seem to be the author's driving motivation behind the book. Similarly, none of the characters' behavior offers convincing explanation; and therefore, not a single character won my sympathy or understanding.For a captivating book on immigration to the West, as well as the profound, analytical exploration of two very different people in a marriage, I highly recommend Wallace Stegner's Angle of Repose instead. In America is a weak, languishing similitude of that great book, at best."},{"Title":"In America.","review":"I have enjoyed the depth of Susan Sontag's lucid, witty essays in the New Yorker magazine, and recently we saw her on Cspan Book -TV. A caller asked what would be the best introduction to her writings, and she suggested her novel \\"In America.\\"This book was surprisingly disappointing to me. I kept waiting to get swept up into it, but came to the last page with only a sense of duty for finishing. The characters are drawn well enough ,the time frame (post-Civil War America) is interesting, but the book failed to engage me somehow. Sontag has an affinity for the movies and for actors;she has created as the lead character a Polish actress who finds stellar success on the American stage.I will continue to enjoy Sontag's essays but doubt I will read another of her novels."},{"Title":"In America.","review":"Generally, the reviews of In America here are dazzylingly unfair. Certainly, reading this novel is not like sitting down and watching TV, or even reading the Sunday New York Times. The novel demands that the reader read changes of style, tone, shift in narrative focus, change from letters to first person narrative back to third person narrative, to a sort of interior monologue. What is wrong with this, if it is done with control, as Songtag does, except for the fact it demands that readers fail to be lazy? So, this is not a novel for the easily frazzled. It demands faith from the reader, but rewards the reader for this trust with a deep investigation of what it means to be an American and human."},{"Title":"In America.","review":"This book is the first I have read by Susan Sontag. But I thought, National Book Award, it must be excellent. I was disappointed, however, when I had to force my way through the quasi-historical prelude to Chapter One. Relieved to make it to the first chapter, at least by now the characters are making sense. I literally force myself to finish this book. None of the characters are appealing, form Maryna, the actress, to her husband, Bogdon, or her lover, Ryszard, all Polish immigrants. Surely the most self-involved of all is Maryna, her main topic of interest being herself and her effect on other people. The plot and sub-plots all revolve around this woman. She dominates the entire landscape of everyone's thoughts. Why? &quot;Frankly, my dear, to borrow a phrase, I don't give a damn.&quot; All the historical detail in the world cannot save this book. I also purchased THE VOLCANO LOVER, but after this experience, I think I'll pass both books on to those obsessed with 18th century verbage. Historical is one thing, mind-numbing is another."},{"Title":"In America.","review":"In America intends to be an \\"important\\" act of \\"literature.\\" It is not. It is not even a good read. In the whole story of Maryna Zalezowska, a Polish actress who emigrates to America with a horde of friends and admirers, fails to found a commune farm, and returns to success on the stage, the only remotely memorable moments are snapshots of local color that are almost digressions from the story itself.The account of two of the characters' sea passage across the Atlantic, focusing on the contrast between their first-class accommodations and those in steerage, actually is touching. There are descriptions of 19th century New York, early Anaheim, and Comstock Lode silver mining towns that might make a die-hard jingoist shed a tear, not because they are flattering of America, but just because they portray her painted large in all the false glory of the gilded age. The last chapter, a long, rambling, almost humorous monologue by Edwin Booth as he half-heartedly tries to seduce the protagonist by telling her how pathetic a person he is, is worth reading (or maybe that was only my impression because it was the end of the book).But these highlights are actually digressions from the story itself. The real story, revolves around Maryna, who is terribly uninteresting. She possesses a self-centeredness that enables her to do whatever she wants and entrain those around her in her wake, but when one looks closer to see what aspects of her character this self-centeredness might stem from, there is nothing. No innate charisma beyond being a beautiful woman, no grand ideas other than those lifted wholesale from 19th century French social theorists, no traits of human mobility, as if a present-day purveyor of postmodern literature could condescend to believe in such a thing. By authorial fiat, Maryna is the center of her world, but she lacks the attributes that might enable her to be the center of the reader's.Since Maryna must be the focal point of the book, on several times another character's subplot is developed just to the point of becoming interesting, only to be promptly aborted. One couple in the commune, Julian and Wanda, have latent marital problems that America brings into much clearer focus. Wanda makes a suicide attempt, and then the characters are shipped back to Poland and mostly forgotten about. Maryna begins an affair with her persistent admirer Ryszard. It turns stale and ends. We discover Maryna's husband Bogdan is sexually attracted to the Mexican farmhands in Anaheim, but this goes nowhere as it is immaterial to Maryna's career, and by extension the book. Basically, the whole novel revolves around an innately uninteresting person, and all other characters must become even more completely two-dimensional to avoid supplanting her.In America contains nothing worth caring about. It contains a few digressions that aren't enslaved to Maryna's story, and in these digressions, Sontag shows she is capable of writing a much better book. However, she did not do so."},{"Title":"In America.","review":"The plot of \\"In America\\", Susan Sontag's National Book Award-winning novel, is adumbrated in her introductory note, where she describes the real historical life that inspired the fictional work. In Sontag's words, the novel was \\"inspired by the emigration to America in 1876 of Helena Modrzejewska, Poland's most celebrated actress, accompanied by her husband, Count Karol Chlapowski, her fifteen-year-old son Rudolf, and the young journalist and future author of \`Quo Vadis' Henryk Sienkiewicz, and a few friends; their brief sojourn in Anaheim, California; and Modrzejewska's subsequent triumphant career on the American stage under the name of Helen Modjeska.\\" While Sontag strongly emphasizes that the characters and actions depicted in her novel are purely invented (and there is no reason to believe the contrary), the plot largely follows the biography that inspired it.\\"In America\\" begins in a post-modernist fashion, the book's \\"Chapter Zero\\" being the first person narrative of a contemporary authorial voice who finds herself coming out of the cold winter of an unidentified Eastern European city, shivering, into a party in the private dining room of a hotel more than a hundred years earlier. There is seemingly a disjunction of time and place. The narrator does not understand the language the people are speaking, \\"but somehow, I didn't question how, their words reached me as sense.\\" From this point, the authorial voice, the imagination, begins naming the people in the room-in effect, begins creating the characters that will populate the tale to follow-and begins probing the animated conversation she overhears, the snippets of enigmatic dialogue that will gradually accrete into the novel. As the narrator suggests at the end of this Chapter Zero, in words resonant of a theme by Virginia Woolf, \\"each of us carries a room within ourselves, waiting to be furnished and peopled, and if you listen closely, you may need to silence everything in your own room, you can hear the sounds of that other room inside your head.\\" Thus, in typical Sontag fashion, the novel itself begins with a self-conscious intrusion of theory and authorial presence.From this interesting and auspicious beginning, \\"In America\\" seamlessly glides into the narrative proper, the story of Maryna Zalezowska, a much beloved Polish actress who, together with her husband Bogdan, her son Piotr, her paramour Ryszard, and an entourage of friends and followers, emigrates to America in 1876. Landing in New York, the group spends a brief period living in Hoboken, visiting the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia and exploring New York City before embarking on a voyage to the West. After a brief sojourn in San Francisco, they move down the coast to Southern California, where they establish a small settlement in Anaheim. Maryna, the leader of her band of ardent disciples, sees their vineyard and farm in Anaheim as a kind of acting out of Fourieristic ideals, a little Brook Farm of Polish emigrants in the Wild West. Life is hard, however, and the utopian dream soon becomes a dystopic unraveling as Maryna goes back to San Francisco, has a brief affair with Ryzsard and returns to the theater. Her husband, Bogan, remains at the Anaheim settlement until it can be sold and then rejoins Maryna in San Francisco, where she has become an overnight theatrical sensation, her Polish stardom now burning brightly in America.From this point, the novel becomes almost exclusively the story of Maryna. She changes her name to Marina Zalenska, travels to Virginia City and, eventually, New York City (and even, briefly, London), and attracts fans and admirers wherever she goes. Her life becomes a self-centered, exhaustive tour of America, performing with her own repertory company and making stage appearances with the Edwin Booth, the most renowned actor of the time. Pushing the narrative's other characters into the shadows, Marina Zalenska makes America her own, \\"In America\\" being not so much the story of what it was like for a group of Eastern Europeans to emigrate to America, but, rather, the story of Marina Zalenska's personal triumph in America.Susan Sontag is a brilliant writer, her prose supple and lithe. Reading this book is effortless. Sontag also uses a range of stylistic devices-journal entries, letters, theatrical dialogue, monologue-which make \\"In America\\" a fascinating literary construction. However, the quality of the writing does not redeem the listless tenor of the tale or the shallowness of the characters and ideas which Sontag propogates. At one point, Maryna says, \\"an actor doesn't need to have an essence. Perhaps it would be a hindrance for an actor to have an essence. An actor needs only a mask.\\" Unfortunately, Maryna's view of acting seemingly permeates this novel, the view of the character becoming the practice of the author: the characters and the ideas of \\"In America\\" are not essential, but only superficial. Like the post-modernist beginnings of Chapter Zero, the reader only gets a shallow tale, a tale that glides on a sparkling smooth surface with trivial and uninteresting characters; while the writing is easy, the story fails to hold the reader's interest and, hence, the reading becomes difficult and soporific. \\"In America\\" is perhaps worth reading, but it is not deserving of the National Book Award."},{"Title":"In America.","review":"You can't ignore the self-consciousness of the author in this book, but in away she deals with this and does away with it in the prologue. The mystery of this book is the borderline between Sontag's consciousness and the protagonists. What it is really about is the violation and domination of the minds of others. Not only is the protagonist an actress as a character but a historical person acting out her consciousness through Sontag's mind. Rather than some mystical conjuring act this is an active method of recreating ideals. The feminine ideal is an endless performer: one who is constantly made-up and at the same time natural. It is this contradiction which is explored in the protagonist's life. Sontag is testing the merge of actor (ficional being) and actual person. The performer is inevitably lost, but paradoxically in this novel the performer is pushed back on stage. Is this where she naturally belongs? This is what you should ask going into In America. It is about ideas concerning identity and its conclusions are highly sophisticated."},{"Title":"In America.","review":"This was a fascinating book. Written in Susan Sontag's unique writing style it is a many layered work. It entails a woman's search for her own itentity, the idealism of commune life, the nature of love and much more. We start off with a group of Polish idealists starting up a commune in California with no idea of what they are doing and end up seeing a picture of the theater life in America at the end of the 19th. century. Only a writer with skill like Susan Sontag could pull off a transition like this so smoothly. The only objection I have is the ending---the book simply ends. There are no obvious loose ends hanging, but the story definately lacks a conclusion."},{"Title":"Evaluation Thesaurus","review":"Actually the same could be said of the man himself. The evaluation thesaurus is difficult to define and place. It is not so much a thesaurus or dictionary as a series of mini (and not so mini) essays from one of evaluation's leading philosophers.Michael Scriven has strong views about the place, role and requirements of evaluation, and he uses this book, amongst other things, to lecture on these subjects. The book starts with an extended introduction to (Scriven's view of) the place of evaluation within the academic world, much of which is focused on an over-extended geographical metaphor of academic disciplines. The point of this is an attempt to stake elevaluation's claim to independence as a &quot;trans-discipline&quot; servicing other disciplines in a similar fashion to statistics. (Despite this declaration of independence, Scriven himself is employed within a School of Education)More useful are the entries themselves, which alert readers to issues such as the &quot;Harvard fallacy&quot; (the assumption that a programme must be good because of its outcomes, without considering any advantages that it might derive, for example from having exceptional student intakes) and the fact that evaluators cannot avoid making value judgements.You do not have to agree with Scriven, but you need to address the issues he raises if you are serious about evaluation."},{"Title":"Evaluation Thesaurus","review":"Scriven is one of the &#34;grandfathers&#34; of evaluation and it does provide background that quite a number of writers refer to.

As all classics of German philosophers, Hegel's masterpiece is almost inaccessible. I&iexcl;ve heard that Hegel&iexcl;s Phenomenology of the Mind is one of the three most abstruse works in the Western philosophy. The other two are Heidegger&iexcl;s &iexcl;Being and Time&iexcl; and Whitehead&iexcl;s &iexcl;Process and Reality&iexcl;. These works are thorny to comprehend, not to mention just to read through, for the originality of the idea presented in the works. So they are littered with the neologism even their contemporaries never heard of. The established terminology is not suitable to articulate totally novel thoughts. Hegel&iexcl;s work is not the exception in this regard. The Phenomenology of the Mind is regarded as the culmination of German idealism: Hegel presented his answer in the works to the enigma Kant put in &iexcl;The Critique of the Pure Reason&iexcl;, &iexcl;Ding an Sich (Thing in itself)&iexcl;. And the answer was the unknown framework at that time. That kind of thought can&iexcl;t be put in terminology at hand, but should be minted with coined word on its own. But such wording can&iexcl;t be easy to grasp for the author himself must be not satisfied with his own wording. This book is about the terminology of Hegel&iexcl;s Phenomenology of the Mind. The author explains organizing concepts appeared in the &iexcl;Preface&iexcl; and &iexcl;Introduction&iexcl;. The preface and introduction of Hegel&iexcl;s Phenomenology of the Mind is notorious for its inaccessibility. Those parts don&iexcl;t introduce readers to anything, but recap all of the following chapters in its own neologism. That lengthy introduction could be understood only if you finished the last page of the book. Actually the introduction is the conclusion of the book. Hegel&iexcl;s stance in the &iexcl;Introduction&iexcl; could be reached only through the incremental logical ascending of the following chapters. Terminology in the &iexcl;Introduction&iexcl; could appear only when that kind of argumentation finished. So usually they are recommended to read the &iexcl;Introduction&iexcl; as conclusion. But such feature is a good point to get the gist of the book. So the author of this exegesis positioned there to overview Hegel&iexcl;s world. W. Marx&iexcl;s approach seems effective. It&iexcl;s the good spot not only to outline Hegel&iexcl;s points, but also to compare Hegel with other German idealists like Kant, Fichte and Scheling, and such comparison is the best way to understand Hegel. This is the strategy W. Marx took and it seems he make it. But this book is not that easy to follow if you have not preliminary knowledge of Kant, at least. This book is not a primer for beginners but for at least graduate student. Anyway I haven&iexcl;t seen other book that explains better Hegel than this book."},{"Title":"From memory to history: Using oral sources in local historical research","review":"This is a great introduction to the uses and limits of oral history, and demonstrates what is often its great veracity, especially in illiterate cultures.

With the amount of research that Elleh put into this work, the potential is there for a truly great book."},{"Title":"African Architecture: Evolution and Transformation","review":"I have not read this book from cover to cover, but I have read a bit of it, and more importantly I have a personal relationship with the author, as Dr. Elleh has overseen my own graduate thesis work and I have sat in several of his lectures.The bigger picture here is that in the early 1980's, Dr. Elleh, a scholar originally from Nigeria, found himself attempting to work on building a deeper understanding of Architecture, Power, and Africa when he came to the United States as a student. Yet there was very little ground work for this study, and so as a grad student, he built it himself. This book was actually his own master's thesis.It has many flaws, mostly dealing with the writing, yet with very little to work with, Elleh contributed greatly to the foundation for the study architecture and Africa. His work has since gone a great distance and his held in high regard by the international community of architectural historians.This book isn't perfect, yet its flaws will forever fail to undermine its significance."},{"Title":"African Architecture: Evolution and Transformation","review":"Dear Sirs,When I have ordered the book I thought it will be excellent sourse for me before studing some particular topic. But I was disapointed when I read it from the very begining. It is simply poor. African architecture is very rich. It is hard to imagine how the author could write such a poor book. Photos are also not very good. Everyone who understand and can &quot;read&quot; arcitecture would write that there is not enough information even on the subjects which are described in the book.I would say this book should cost less."},{"Title":"Why God's Word is All We Need (Today's Issues)","review":"When I ordered this book, I expected it to be a defense of the Protestant position of Sola Scriptura, but to my surprise it is instead aimed at correcting liberal Christian views of how we form relationships with God. The book opens with a story of a Christian woman who was waiting for God to tell her directly that she should make amends with her estranged parents, when a friend told her to open her Bible to Exodus 20:12 and read.The book proceeds in this direction emploring the reader to use his or her Bible as a means to form a personal relationship with God rather than expecting God to speak by direct revelation. It also briefly defends the authority of the Bible against such attacks as higher criticism and the Jesus Seminar.Despite the &quot;Why&quot; in the title, I would have to say that it is more pastoral than apologetic. Even so, I recommend it."},{"Title":"Encyclopedia Of The Palestinians (Facts on File Library of World History)","review":"The first edition of Encyclopedia Of The Palestinians appeared in 2000 and there have been vast changes in the region since, prompting the need for this substantively revised edition, which offers new entries about these recent developments. Articles have all been updated, photos of important leaders and events added, and fifty key documents included. Encyclopedia Of The Palestinians provides depth and detail on Palestine history and issues, making it a recommended pick for general-interest college-level history holdings, as well."},{"Title":"Mind, character, and personality: Guidelines to mental and spiritual health","review":"This is one of the best compilations of Ellen White's writings on a specific subject. This book shows that Ellen White (1827-1915) was way ahead of her times in the area of psychology. Even before psychology had become acceptable science, she had experience with the basic fundamentals of psychology and sociology. This book should be required reading for all Christians who work with people, whether you are a parent, teacher, pastor, counselor, social worker or whatever.Ellen White had amazing insights in the area of personality traits and personality development, the issue of nature and nurture in character formation, mental health, and behavioral modification. While I'm sure she might have reflected some of the current thinking of her times, she still was ahead of her time considering the fact that a lot of the issues she dealt very well with were confirmed by the sciences a century later.Volume 1 (which is what I've read so far) deals with the study of the mind, how religion helps the mind, emotions, prenatal influence on character formation, parental influence, nature vs. nurture, love, infatuation, sexuality, self-respect, dependence and independence (an important topic), guilt, doubt, marriage, principles of motivation, and principles of education, study and learning.UPDATE: I previously had doubts about the idea of \\"prenatal influence on character formation.\\" This was written at the turn of the century, and it certainly did not sound very scientific. BUT, I just attended a panel discussion at Notre Dame between biologists and ethicists, and a study was described that proves that there apparently is a prenatal influence on character formation. Ellen White was way ahead of her time!"},{"Title":"Mind, character, and personality: Guidelines to mental and spiritual health","review":"This is an execellent book. The author is truly inspired by God. She addresses practically every conflict or controversy that may arise in life. Anywhere from concerns of the roles of a husband and wife in a marriage to how a single person can survive as a Christian or, even how diet effects an individual's mind and spirit.

He was especially known for advocating \\"the highest degree of scientific rigour in the design of psychological experiments and [being] very critical of much loose thinking current at present under the guise of \`psychology' (from the cover).In the course of his career he produced several pioneering books demystifying psychology for the general public: in particular a seminal trilogy (later expanded to a quartet) for Penguin, He was an exceptionally lucid and entertaining writer, and the books sold millions of copies and were translated into several other languages. The quartet comprises:Uses and Abuses of Psychology(1953)Sense and Nonsense in Psychology(1957)Fact and Fiction in Psychology(1965)Psychology is about People(1977)Interestingly, in the light of what was to come later, the author was already being described (in an Editorial Foreword) as \\"controversial\\"; and in his own introduction, he not only accepts this appellation but embraces it:\\"...indeed the writer has become so used to this term that he feels almost a sense of deprivation when the chairman at a meeting, in introducing him, forgets to use [it].\\"But he goes on:\\"However, the word \`controversial' has two meanings, and it is important to discriminate between them. You may say that an issue is controversial because people are in fact arguing about it, and are having a controversy. In this sense, the flatness or rotundity of the earth is controversial; there are still flat-earthers [...] From their point of view, therefore , we might say that the shape of the earth is still a controversial matter. However, from the scientific point of view, I don't think one would agree that this is so [...] [T]here is no controversy on this point, and therefore it is not \`controversial' any longer.\\"To say this is not to say the some of the points made in this book are not controversial...\\"Indeed. Among the chapters that made this book famous is one entitled \\"Little Hans or Little Albert?\\" containing perhaps the most comprehensive and damning review of Freudian theory and practice yet published in a popular work. It cites (inter alia) the studies of Wolpe & Rachman, which use Freud's own data to show that his claims were completely inconsistent with the facts. This is followed by \\"New Ways of Curing Neurosis\\", documenting the successes of Behaviour Therapy (of which Eysenck was a pioneer in the UK) and contrasting its results with those of psychoanalysis. \\"Therapy or Brainwashing\\" then confronts head-on the criticisms being made of the methods described in the previous chapter. Of particular interest, in view the way both mores and the law have changed since the time of writing, are two pages (194-195) devoted to the morality of so-called \`treatment' of homosexuality, which was of course illegal in Britain at that time. (Lesbianism, however, was legal - reportedly because Queen Victoria refused to believe it existed.)Other chapters describe a psychological laboratory, contrasting it with the analyst's couch of the popular perception; a model for the physiological mechanism behind introversion and extraversion, introduced by a hypothetical \`Eysenck's Demon' along the lines of Maxwell's Demon in Physics; and an explanation of crime and conscience in terms of conditioning.This last, in addition to being thought-provoking in itself, raises some thorny ethical issues about \`fairness': for instance, it is well established that extraverts respond differently to rewards and punishments than introverts. If a particular legal penalty (e.g. a fine or prison sentence) is appropriate to deter an introvert, it may well not deter an extravert - still less a psychopath. But should we then design all legal penalties for psychopaths?A broad-ranging, closely-argued and fascinating book."},{"Title":"Fact and fiction in psychology (Pelican book)","review":"Hans J&uuml;rgen Eysenck (1916-1997) was a British psychologist of German origin, known for his work on intelligence testing and personality. This 1965 book was one of three books published by Pelican Books (the others are Uses and Abuses of PsychologySense & Nonsense in Psychology.In the Introduction, Eysenck states, \\"This is the third of these 'entertainments,' to borrow a term from Graham Greene to describe this trilogy of popularizations of modern psychology... What I have dealt with in the present book are mainly topics relating to personality, its nature and measurement, and also to the way in which personality is implicated in neuroses, in accidents, in criminal behavior, and in other social interactions.\\"He includes chapters such as, \\"Therapy or Brain-Washing?\\" \\"Accidents and Personality,\\" and \\"Crime, Conscience, and Conditioning.\\"Here are some representative quotations:\\"The first interesting feature of the case is that the case material on which Freud's analysis was based was collected by little Hans's father... The father had several discussions with Freud concerning Hans's phobia, but during the analysis Freud himself saw the little boy only once!\\" (Pg. 108)\\"I cannot pretend to be devoid of feelings of revulsion for homosexual practices, but equally I cannot feel that these feelings of mine should necessarily form the basis for other people's conduct.\\" (Pg. 194)\\"The question of free will is a philosophical one which need not really concern us very much. It is doubtful whether in fact the term 'free will' has any meaning.\\" (Pg. 288)"},{"Title":"Fact and fiction in psychology (Pelican book)","review":"Eysenck wrote a series of four books introducing the common reader to psychology. This is the second in the set.The book is divided into two parts. Part One is entitled and covers the subjects of hypnosis and suggestibility, lie detectors, ESP and the interpretation of dreams. Part Two is entitled covering personality tests, conditioning, the psychology of politics and the psychology of aesthetics.I found the chapter on hypnosis and suggestibility the most interesting in the book. It provides a historical survey of the subject along with a detailed discussion of the phenomena covering special subjects such as \\"Who is more susceptible to hypnosis?\\" Eysenck is a strict scientific empiricist so it came as some surprise to me that the subject of ESP is treated favorably leaving the reader with the informed opinion the there may certainly be something real in the belief. I found the chapter on aesthetics interesting but the least convincing that psychology had something to say on the subject. I am afraid the experiments reported seemed very simplistic, underestimating what we would call 'beautiful' when we look at a complex painting."},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"I received this book in perfect condition, and very soon after I ordered it.

Some of the parts could have been said in fewer words, while some of the parts were not as much as touched upon. Not recommended for those people looking for slightly more action in a book.

If you ever wanted to know how mummies were made, this is the book. It's an education as well as a highly satisfying read.

Pure Genius!"},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"We have to remember that Mika Waltari wrote his books in the 1940s, long before other writers such as Ken Follett began their carreers in historic fiction. In fact, Waltari is one of those authors that made historic fiction a popular genre of literature. His books (\\"The roman\\", \\"The etruscan\\", \\"Secret of the Kingdom\\", among others) are all based on great and accurate historic research and a central character, greatly developed and inserted in his background. One other thing that is repeated along his books is the presence, in different levels of transparency, of Christian elements (yes, even if it's ancient Egypt, as in this case).The egyptian of the title is Sinuhe, an orphan raised by an elder couple. Sinuhe's adopted father is a physician on a poor neighboorhod in Thebes, Egypt's capital at the time (circa 1300 b.C.). Sinuhe chooses the profession of his father, but the difference is that he becomes the Pharao's physician, immersed in the court's game of deception, rivalries and connections. Sinuhe's time is the time of Pharao Amenhotep IV, who tried to change egyptian religion from polytheism to monotheism. The cult of Aton - the only god - was not well accepted by the religious class nor by the population, and the self-renamed Akhenaton (former Amenhotep) was one of the most hated rulers of all times.Sinuhe is a believable and complete character, although developed in an old-fashioned way. In fact, the whole book, its writing style and its characters have an old aura about them. Some of the situations and dialogues are extreme, and sometimes don't ring true, but those are rare occasions. Sinuhe and his faithful servant Kaptah travel through Egypt, Syria, Crete and back to Egypt, collecting information, meeting kings, girls and enemies. Sinuhe's life is full of things happening all the time. Waltari tells Sinuhe's envolvent story through the book. He was able to blend true facts with fiction in an excellent way, stablishing himself as one of the \\"fathers\\" of historic fiction.If you've never read Mika Waltari, \\"The egyptian\\" is a great way to begin.Grade 9/10"},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"In addition to all the great things already said about the Egyptian (the story, the historical re-creation etc..), I would like to add that it is narrated in such simple and limpid style, poetic and musical at times, that I thoroughly enjoyed the way the book was written. Considering that I only read a translated version of the book... what an achievement the book must have been in Finnish!"},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"Penned by Finnish author Mika Waltari, The Egyptian is superlative in every aspect from cover to cover. This is right up there with the best from Pauline Gedge. However, it is much more than an ancient Egypt fiction novel. It is the story of Sinuhe, a young man of moderate means growing up in Amarnian Thebes. What is unique about this story, is its essence of human commonality. Although set in ancient times, Sinuhe's portrayal by Waltari could indeed be the story of any young man in any era. The character depth of Sinuhe is extraordinary, and he exemplifies the best and worst in all of us with a natural and sometimes embarrassing crystal clarity. In eloquent simplicity, this is the ancient story of everyone. I have read thousands of books, and this one is in my top ten."},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"As a young adult, I read this book and was instantly transported, launching a lifetime interest in ancient Egyptian history. I have re-read it through the years (the original copy to tatters!) and have ever been entranced and enthralled each and every time. As an armchair Egyptologist, I found this book to be amazingly accurate and fascinating. Mr. Waltari's research on the subject was flawless, and even 50 years later reflects current thought on the 18th Dynasty's religeon, politics and day to day life. A must read for anyone interested in ancient times, in Egyptian history, in a man's incredible life."},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"One of the best things an historical novel can do is create a long-ago time and place for us . . . and convince us that what it has given us is how things might really have been. This THE EGYPTIAN does in spades.The tale of an ancient Egyptian physician's life and times, this book follows the events and travels of the aptly named Sinuhe, surnamed He Who is Alone, from his mysterious birth through early childhood into young adulthood and, beyond, to the waning days of a long and troubled life. Cast out and dishonored because of youthful folly (a folly, indeed that he never seems to outgrow), Sinuhe flees the ancient Egyptian capital of Thebes and enters the wider world where he becomes a true man of that world, adventurer and sojourner, physician and spy, while, all along, offering us an up-close look at that world as it might really have been. With him, we visit ancient Babylon and Hatti (land of the Hittites), and Crete where the bull dancers plied their trade. And we are carried back and forth through Egypt and Syria as Sinuhe becomes absorbed in the great events of his day as they worked themselves out on their ancient stage.Unfortunately, Sinuhe is also a somewhat tiresome, and even foolish, character who is not always fully sympathetic as he consistently makes doltish choices and throws away what he should hold onto for his very life. He is seemingly caught up in every roiling current the world sends his way, unable to set his own course and, inevitably, an evil fate dogs his tracks for this great failing. But he is, in the process, witness to the rise and fall of the visionary pharaoh Akhenaton and to the great wars which rocked his ancient world and which eventually precipitated the fall of the mighty civilizations of the Bronze Age.In the end, the mood is one of sorrow and resignation in the face of existence itself, a mood that is very redolent of the spirit found in the writings of those ancient times. And so Sinuhe, named for another mythical Egyptian traveler whose story has come down to us in the archaeological records, is very much a creature of his world and that, surely, is an accomplishment for any writer of historical fiction.This is a fine piece of historical writing and one of the better renderings of ancient Egypt and its Bronze Age world that I have found. Aside from Sinuhe's foolishness, I was a little troubled by the somewhat meandering narrative approach with lengthy dead spots and constant coincidences where the same characters consistently run into each other. But basically this was a good one and the fine narrative \\"ear\\" for time and place more than offset the book's other failings. My kind of book!SWMauthor of The King of Vinland's Saga"},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"There are a million reviews of Waltari's work out there already, so I won't plague the internet with yet another in-depth one. I will, however, comment on what I perceive to be the central question that the book asks:\\"Is it better to live a life shaped by ethics and compassion, and thus die alone? Or would one rather turn a blind eye to suffering and gather all earthly wealth around oneself?\\"And the book doesn't pass judgement on either form of living, even though the protagonist leans towards the ethical, and his faithful servant towards the material. I think, from that relation between Sinuhe and Kaptah, there springs a certain analogy for the human psyche - no matter how we wish to strive for the light, for the truth, for purity, the material cannot be shafted away - it must always follow us, even through our convoluted course of the search for meanings and maintain us, sometimes unwillingly, in this life. That is what is magical about this book - it is an epic historical adventure, spanning the entire life of Sinuhe, and the rise and fall of several pharoahs; but most importantly, it is a thoroughly profound look at the human condition, and the struggle raging in each individual."},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"Though published decades ago, this slam-bang novel, full of sex, violence and accurate history, seems to be the forerunner of the novels like Aztec."},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"This was the second Mika Waltari book I have read-the first being the Wanderer.

It arrived on time and I would reccomend others to buy for this organization."},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"In The Egyptian, Volume 1 (English translation), Mika Waltari takes us back to one of the oldest civilizations to tell one of the most classic stories there is: a young man rises from humble beginnings, makes a foolhardy choice, then is impelled to go out in the world and seek his fortune. He travels to other lands, learns about other customs, experiences different sides of life, and rises in stature by smartly applying his knowledge. Then he returns home again, where old friends and enemies await him.I very much enjoyed The Egyptian's vibrant, convincing portrayal of ancient people's daily lives, superstitions, and familiar human flaws. Its timeless observations of how human societies operate still feel fresh. Rarely in Sinuhe's world is someone not exploiting, victimizing, or swindling someone else. When countries aren't terrorizing or fleecing their neighbors, they're wallowing in decadence, mired in poverty, or caught up in religious zeal. Who knows how historically accurate the depictions of the Syrians, Babylonians, Hittites, Cretans, and others are, but I liked the insights into different cultural personalities. It's not hard to make connections to the unrest of Waltari's own time.The story is somewhat less compelling, at least in Volume 1. Sinuhe goes from place to place as a physician, heals people, learns about the local culture and politics, then moves on. There are only a few characters that stick around long to become interesting. The one I enjoyed the most was Sinuhe's groveling, self-aggrandizing servant, Kaptah, whose personal badge of honor is that he doesn't steal more than a reasonable amount from his master (rendered in a delightfully Monty Python-esque voice in the audiobook). For a book from 1945, it's surprisingly full of sex, which Sinuhe seems to procure for himself everywhere he goes (apparently the author had his own Bohemian days). That said, Waltari's portrayal of women is a bit crude, with their role as sex objects being their main feature in the protagonist's eyes.Unfortunately, Volume 1 ends pretty abruptly, with a lot of unanswered questions left for Volume 2. The war and political chaos that Sinuhe is to witness has yet to unfold, though the region is teetering on the brink. I listened to the audiobook, which I got a few years ago, but seems to be out of \\"print\\" now. The narrator reads in an old school British theatre voice that suits the vaguely Biblical style of the prose well, though the recording isn't the best -- you can hear the saliva smacking in his mouth as he talks (which goes awkwardly with the sexy moments)."},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"I read this book long ago but I am reading it again.

The characters are simply fantastic (sinhue e Kaptah)... It's pure magic to read"},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"I watched the movie based on this story several times and finally found the book it was based on at Amazon. This is my take on the novel.The protagonist is Sinuhe, an Egyptian physician who lived at the time of Pharaoh Akhenaten about 1300 years before Christ. Sinuhe is translated as \\"he who is alone.\\"The story begins as Sinuhe is an old man writing his memoirs in exile somewhere in what is now known as Palestine. He had been the royal physician but had to flee after the death of Pharaoh Akenaten.Tutankhamen, the boy king, also plays a peripheral part in the tale, but generally the story is a fly on the wall first person view of Egyptian life, art, architecture and religion.The Egyptian is probably one of the first historical novels that gave the life of ancient people in a first person account more or less like what we call a romance novel or boy's adventure story.I would guess that Edgar Rice Burroughs, Jack London, and Herman Melville are likely influences of Finnish author Mika Waltari but the writing of The Egyptian is only fair at best. The descriptive passages are the best but the dramatic development is thin. There are fairly uninteresting romantic undertakings of the various characters introduced as the story develops.For those who always complain \\"the book is better,\\" in the case of this novel I assert that the movie was better. Although not a prizewinner by any stretch of the imagination, the epic movie by Fox used premium inputs like CinemaScope, TechniColor, director Michael Curtiz, and a raft of big stars like Gene Tierney, Jean Simmons, Edmund Purdom, Michael Wilding, Victor Mature, Bella Darvi, and Peter Ustinov.With my knowledge of the film I came expecting a good story to read in the 500 + page novel but found the good parts few and far between. The screenwriters apparently got everything they could out of the book even though the movie was overlong and not always coherent.A product of Chicago Review Press, the novel is paperback, 512 pages, and is suitable for reading on a long trip or if you cannot sleep. I went to sleep with it several times so it does serve for bedtime reading material."},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"Axe of Iron: The SettlersThe Egyptian is a sweeping saga of ancient Egypt, set during the 18th dynasty during the reigns of the Pharaohs Amunhoptep, Akhenaton, and Horemheb. The story revolves around the life of Sinuhe, a man of common birth without family-an orphan-who subsequently overcomes all obstacles to become a physician. Later he will become the friend and personal physician of Pharaoh Akhenaten, but not before a lifetime of intrigue, near death experiences, heartache, and the glory and status of close association with the Pharaoh.This book has all the elements one would expect of such a saga: sex, terror, periods of extreme danger, friendship, intrigue, and a meticulously researched storyline.The only downside is, rather than carry the story with dialogue; Waltari went into pages of descriptive text to set-up the story of a society that was to become, at the behest of Pharaoh Akhenaten, monotheistic, complete with a new god, unfamiliar and unloved by the masses. His attempt to shove this god down the throats of his subjects led the country inevitably into chaos, with all that state of affairs would suggest.Sinuhe does all he can during this time, pleading and cajoling with his friend and monarch to the best of his ability. His efforts did not end well for either of them for the outcome was inevitable and foreordained.If you stick with it through the parts that drag you will have read a classic historical fiction tale."},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"The biggest obstacle in reading this for me was the dated language. Whether this is because it's a translation or because it was written a long time ago, it doesn't read like modern historical fiction, which I really like. However, if you can put up with the long drawn out sentences and you really enjoy ancient Egypt, you will probably like this book about such notable historical figures as Amunhotep, Horemheb and Nefertiti."},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"The Egyptian is a classic in the truest sense and an epic (not a word I use lightly) tale resonating with truth, power and poignant insights into the human condition that bridge the centuries.It was written by Mika Waltari who, according to the back of the book, is widely considered the greatest Finnish writer of the 20th century. Regardless of his provenance, he is simply a great writer. That The Egyptian was sent as a gift by a Finnish friend and book blogger (thanks Niina at, shameless plug, For the Love of Reading) made it all the more intriguing.The book chronicles the life of Sinuhe, the lonely one and son of the wild ass, an orphan who becomes physician to the pharaohs and serves as a witness, and architect, of momentous events in Egyptian history. His life, travails and loves intersect with key political events and battles that shape the future of Egypt, including the origins of King Tut.According to the back of the book, The Egyptian was condemned as obscene when published in the U.S. in 1949. There are many veiled references to sharing mats with women or grasping the loins of lovers, etc., and one particularly cruel scene involving a royal and monumental cuckolding, but it's not the sex or the empowered women (possibly more so than capable within their era), that made the book obscene. In 1949 America, it was dangerous.Sinhue has a slow awakening across the decades - thanks to his roaming throughout the various lands and his proximity to the leaders - that all religions are false and all governments are equally ineffective and powered only by greed and the petty desires and shortcomings of those in power. \\"No nation is either braver or more chickenhearted, crueler or more compassionate, wickeder or more virtuous than another.\\" That notion would not have set well with American exceptionalism, especially as McCarthyism was festering to fruition.It's probably dangerous by today's standards as well. As religions clashed and priests and lords scrambled to control power, the poor were caught in the middle. I saw much of the politics of the present day reflected in the careful description so that ancient Egypt seemed alive and well and all around us.I always worry about translations, and how much of the original lyricism and power is lost, but in this case, in which a Finnish writer endeavored to capture an Egyptian style, it seemed to work well with much rending of garments, oiling of heads and gnashing of teeth. I also wonder about the accuracy of the portrayal of life in ancient times because, as a work of fiction, there are no discussions of research or source material. I do know this: After reading The Egyptian, I will always think of it when I imagine life in 14th century B.C.E. That's a powerful book.I highly recommend it and suggest adding it to your \\"to read\\" list because \\"Our time is short, and no one knows what tomorrow may bring...\\""},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"Good book, funny to think that in the 1940's it was banned for being to graphic . . tame by todays standards!"},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"I love this book - how could I not, I am a Finn after all - but I also feel I have to correct something another reviewer claimed. This book is not a part of any trilogy, it is a work of its own. Waltari did write several historical novels, but the rest have nothing to do with Ancient Egypt. If you have a chance, read The Dark Angel; it's the best, in my opinion."},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"Reading and re-reading this historical novel, and turning people on to it over the years, has multiplied my own delight.

The characters he describes could fit in any period of time, buthe folds them into the culture of ancient egyptas delicately as the papyrus that Sinua, the physican wrote the story of his life. Every aspect of our nature is depicted in this work ofart: love, hate, fear, passion, war, incests, nothing is left untouched. Written so tastefullythat its almost hard to believe its fiction"},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"In this epic novel, Mika Waltari traces a portion of Egyptian history through the eyes of Sinuhe, the physician to the Pharaoh Akhnaton. His humble and mysterious origin colors his views as he bears witness to the winds of change in Egypt as the Pharaoh supplants the old gods for a new one, much to the dismay of his citizens. He also is witness to the rise of Horemheb, whom he calls a friend, as this military general defeats the encroaching Hittites and eventually becomes the next Pharaoh. Brilliantly illuminating life in ancient Egypt, Waltari entertains readers with a tale of love and loss, of war and tragedy, of friendship and betrayal. \\"The Egyptian\\" sometimes comes across as plodding or dry by modern standards, but the fascinating and flawed main character entrances readers to reach the final pages."},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"After comparing this book with two non-english translations, it is obvious that this is an abridged version of the novel. The story is certainly still good, but I would like to see an unabridged english translation of this book. It is a shame that there is only one english edition available (the web site of a book store in mexico offers at least 4 different editions in spanish!)"},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"This is one of my all time favourite books. A totally irresistible masterpiece came from a very distant country - Finland. In this book you can see the influence of personal experience of Waltari - he lost his father at 5, witnessed a bloody civil war in Finland at 10, had a complicated personal way to find God and then saw his country struggle desperately to survive against the unspeakable evil of Stalin's USSR. Waltari took part in war effort - as propaganda specialist - and he witnessed his country being saved by an authoritarian warlord, Marshal Baron Carl Gustaf Mannerheim - in the book you will recognise him in the person of general Horemheb.All of these experiences are clearly visible in this magnificent book, which tells the story of Sinouhe, an Egyptian living in the troubled times of pharaoh Ekhnaton religious revolution. This is the story of great travels, a revolution and a contrrevolution, a great dream gone really bad, a great war and great love. Now this book is full of pessimism, which, together with description of evil (even sadistic) and impossible to understand women, is a trademark of Waltari's writing.But then, there is the humour, which shines even brighter in the dark surroundings - here it is provided mostly (although not exclusively) by the personal servant of the hero, Kaptah, a street wise slave, one of the greater characters I ever found in any books...A book to read, absolutely, and once you finished, try the rest of Waltari's books. They are worth it."},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"So glad they \\"rediscovered\\" this classic and made it available again. A memorable story not only tells you a new story but also reminds you of many familiar old stories. That's the special charm of this story.The 1300 BC was a very exciting period in the world of Eastern Mediterrenean. The author's knowledge of his material is very impressive! Of course the author took some liberties with a few historical facts but he kept it at the minimum to make the story more exciting and to include more information. The main story follows the structure of an Egyptian Middle Kingdom best seller, \\"The Story of Sinuhe\\", and even names the main character Sinuhe. Following Sinuhe's life and travels, it cleverly woven in many familiar stories of neighboring cultures and religions. Incorporating the old Egyptian writing style, the author transports you in time and space to ancient civilizations populated with lively characters, each beaming with dreams and sufferings, from different stratus of societies. As it's a \\"memoir\\" of an old man, it is also ripe for the deposit of wisdoms and regrets.This book is multifacited with many threads to follow. You can read it as the life story and exploits of the fictional Sinuhe, the account of the rise and fall of the heretic Akhenaten, or the missing chapters of Horemheb's climb to power. You can even read it as the rise of the Hittites, the fall of Crete, or the decline of the first Babylonia. I have always been partial to Horemheb who wrestled order and victory out of chaos and disaster of the end of the 18th Dynasty to establish the foundation for the most glorious 19th Dynasty. This book made him very human and even reminded me of another of my favorites, Julius Caeser.It's such a pleasure to read a well written story with finely crafted and believable characters surrounded by historical events. Wonder what other books this intelligent author had written?"},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"This work was first published in 1949. I can well remember my mother reading it to me in 1952. Since, I have read it myself, several times. This is the fascinating story of one, commoner, living in the land of Egypt over 1000 years before Christ. It is the story of the common man's life. Waltari, in his time, was one of the most popular writers of the historical novel. He should probably still hold that place. Waltari, a writer from Finland, was well published and accepted in Europe. As his books were translated, they became quite popular in this country. I was glad to see that there are now recent reprints. Recommend this one for anyone loving well written historical fiction. This work sort of established the standard for what was to come."},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"\\"The Egyptian\\" came about as a result of Mika Waltari's experiences during WWII. Published in Finland in 1945, this book is truly a commentary about the terrible social upheavals experienced by Europe during the war years. The abomination of war, the waning belief in religion, and the unravelling of society are some of the themes that resonate from ancient Egypt to mid-20th Century Europe.This historical tie notwithstanding, the real beauty of this book lies in the way Waltari uses small details to transport the reader to a bygone era. The period that starts with rise of Amehnotep IV (later Akhenaten) and concludes with reign of the great general Horemheb is one of the most compelling chapters of Egyptian history, and this book succeeds in making it into a gripping tale of idealism, stupidity, courage, and politics.It is truly amazing to see the historical figures fulfill their appointed roles, acting before the background of the first monotheistic religion (doomed to fail through good intentions), a war of conquest, political manipulations, love and loss, and ultimately, fate. In the best tradition of Waltari, the male characters are richly three-dimensional, with moments of courage and moments of cowardice, with hints of idealism and hints of opportunism, and above all, with human frailties.Truly a delightful read, even if it forces the reader to ponder issues well beyond the action that takes place on the written page."},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"I join the list of reviewers who read this book when they were very young. I was 13, in love with Ancient Egypt and though the librarian was not sure at all that I should read it (it was 1961, a very different era than the present one)I believe I devoured it in less than a week. Waltari has given us a sensitive portrait of the human condition. His scholarship is meticulous - his evocation of the time in which the book unfolds is haunting and believable.I note one review above which takes exception to the chronology of the late 18th dynasty as Waltari has presented it. Current scholarly opinion would probably fault Waltari, but one must not apply modern opinion to a book that was written in 1945. The book is fiction after all. Look for scholarly opinion in scholarly journals. You will find that there are as many allegations as allegators! *grin*This is one of the best works of fiction that I have ever had the pleasure of reading."},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"I read this book many years ago..

I must have read it over forty times. It was the first thing I read in the morning and the last thing I read at night; and in between, it followed me to every meal and trip to the bathroom. Sinuhe was my first crush, and Egypt was my first love.I just read it again, fifteen years later, and it was like no time had passed at all. I was worried that the book would have lost some of its luster and spell-binding charm, but all the feelings I experienced in childhood came flooding back, and new ones emerged."},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"About 1300 years before the birth of Christ, in what was then the greatest civilization in history, the new Pharaoh, Akhnaton, decreed that all gods were false, except for one, Aton. Aton was a god of peace, he said. He was a god who believed all men were created equal, even servants, and slaves, and people with black skin. He was a god who cherished even the lowly-born. Naturally, there was a great deal of resistance to Akhnaton's new decree, and the resulting chaos brought about his downfall, and almost spelled the doom of mighty Egypt.That fascinating bit of ancient history is the centerpiece of this great novel by Mika Waltari, but the novel is also much, much, more than this, and in fact gives us a dazzling, up-close view of the entire ancient world as it existed thirty-three centuries ago.The story is narrated by Sinuhe, a doctor, trained in the temple of Ammon, the predominant Egyptian god of his youth. His skill and luck bring him into contact with the most powerful men of Egypt, one of whom asks him to travel through the nations of the known world, in order to determine their strengths and weaknesses. With him we visit bizarre Syria, opulent and decadent Babylon, austere and fierce Hatti, the land of the Hittites, and finally artistic Crete, with its own share of barbaric, cruel customs. All of these places are fascinating, and the author gives us loads of detail.It is then back to Egypt, where he shares with us the Akhnaton adventure, and the political intrigue that surrounded his reign. We get to meet Horemheb, the general who succeeded him, and also, surprisingly, King Tut, who was pharaoh for only a short period of time, and who died at the age of eighteen. Sinuhe plays an integral part in the proceedings.But his own story is quite interesting as well. His first love leads to the ruination of his family. His greatest, life-long love was a Cretan girl whom he met in Babylon. (She was the victim of a shipwreck.) And then there is the beautiful, mature saloon-owner whom he comes to love in his later life. All come to a tragic end.The author really brings ancient Egypt to life, more so than any other novel I've read. There is the taste of the beer and wine, his description of the \\"black earth\\" of the river valley, the grandiose monuments, horrific desert chariot battles, religious rites, gods and goddesses, barbarism, unusual sexual customs, Akhnaton's new city, and the House of the Dead. It is marvelously rich.It is also very wise. Akhnaton, for example, when told that the Hittites are massing at Egypt's northern border, suggests that Egypt disarm to show the Hittites that the they are a peace-loving people! What a fool! And how interesting that the author predicted Jimmy Carter thirty years before he came to office! (Of course, there have always been and there always will be political naifs.) Here is Sinuhe, sadly reflecting on Akhnaton's altruistic desire for equality and brotherhood among men: \\"Even were the time to come when there would be neither poor nor rich, yet there will always be wise and stupid, sly and simple, for so there have ever been and ever will be.\\" Inevitably, the peace Akhnaton seeks to achieve leads to war, and the brotherhood he seeks to impose leads to civil strife.This is a terrific, fast-moving, wise and well-written novel, loaded with interesting historical tidbits. It very much reminds me of another great novel having to do with a vanished civilization: Aztec, by Gary Jennings, which was quite popular a few years ago. Both are great, and deserve wide audiences."},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"How I wish that all of Waltari's works would be reprinted and easily available! The Egyptian is simply one of the all-time best pieces of historical ficion ever written. If you're a fan of this genre, then grab this author's books. The Etruscan is a bit more mystical, but is an excellent read and Secret of the Kingdom takes a Roman viewpoint of the times leading up to Jesus's death. The Dark Angel is just that - a bit darker than the other novels, but all are chock full of unforgettable characters and settings.

This book really is just about life in general, it makes you think. Give it a try!!"},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"Thebes, the Nile, the pyramids sitting in the background: the setting for this remarkable novel of ancient Egypt. Told through the eyes of the physician Sinuhe, this is a dramatic recounting of one of the most unsettled times of this nation, as Amenhotep IV, self styled as Akhenaton, attempts to throw out all the old gods (and their associated priesthoods) and install in their place his vision of a single god, Aton, a new version of the sun god Ra.Sinuhe is a finely drawn character. We follow him from childhood through his initiation into the priesthood and physician's school, and his first infatuation with a 'noble' lady - a lady who strips him of all his wealth, even down to selling his foster parents' home, a rude introduction to the adult world for Sinuhe. Beggared, with a price on his head, he is forced to travel to other countries, Syria, Babylon, Crete, in fact most of the 'known' world of that time. From this position, Waltari presents a comprehensive portrait of the lives of both the rich and poor, noble and slave, the various cultures and religions that held sway at that time. Throughout these travels, he maintains a very positive engagement with the maturing Sinuhe, showing how the events of his life drive him towards a philosophical viewpoint that is partially in accord with Akhenaton's vision of a brotherhood of all mankind, a man prone to a certain amount of romanticism, but more and more leavened with a sense of hard practicality. When he finally returns to Egypt and becomes enmeshed in the political swirl of events surrounding the Pharaoh, it is as a significant player, with a viewpoint that enlightens both the promise of the Pharaoh's dream and the actions that others, from Horemheb to Nefertiti, feel are necessary to save the kingdom.Waltari has adopted a style that consistently evokes the sense of living in that time, a little distanced from the directness of most modern novels, but where the sights, the scents, the people, the attitudes, the living style of that time leap out from the page. Along the way, he presents a tremendous amount of detail that, if presented in a standard history book, would be deadly dull - but here it is a very necessary part of the engrossing story. The level of medical arts displayed by Sinuhe may surprise some people, but just about every procedure described in this book is well documented as being in use at that time. Just as detailed are his descriptions of a society where social mobility was not just possible, but common - again defying the impression many have of an Egypt that was totally caste locked. Battle techniques and weapons, city architectures, sailing prowess, trading policies, clothing, even the Egyptian mummification procedures all are carefully presented, each piece both historically accurate and necessary to the story.A fine novel of character, a careful representation of the historical period, and a quietly underplayed depiction of one of the early battles between monotheism and polytheism which provides more than enough material for careful rumination. Not many historical novels approach this one in terms of readability, engagement, or accuracy - a book that literally makes its chosen time and place become alive.--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)"},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"I bought this book for a friend and she loved it.

Having read the original this seemed to completely ruin the book, leaving out way too many nuances from the story. I haven't found an uncut english version yet."},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"I read this book sometime ago. I see no reason to recreate the wheel now. There are already dozens of competent, in-depth reviews of the literary contribution and the story. Let's just say it is a fast-moving action fiction, set among the lives of Egyptians about 1300 BC, written by a Finnish writer living in the throes and aftermath of World War II.I am just giving my take for the sake of my own Amazon friends who might wander into this book as I did. I have a good sense that what other reviewers declare as the historical accuracy of the book is well founded. In that case, the reason I read these books of historical fiction is to add animation and mystery to my travels.I read and think about this book in preparation for my planned trip from Nice through Ajaccio, Palermo, Crete and Malta en route to Egypt and Israel to cover the ground of the Napoleonic Army. I get nothing out of visits to places unless I can construct an imaginary time travel to match my impressions of the places and relics that are visible today. Based on my other research (as laid out in my list Along the Nile), I believe this book did for me some of the things I needed to make the experience of Egypt more accessible. I recommend it to others also for that reason.On the whole, The Egyptian still resounds in my memory. So, I can recommend it again now on the basis of its durable impression.At first, I was not sure about the book. Although I remember it was fun to read for all the reasons that other reviewers have described, the one thing I am very sure of is that the book is much richer than the 1954 movie by the same name, though reviewers love the movie too. As for me, I am stuck on all the most modern production values, and wilt among most movies dated prior to 1970. I will watch the 1954 version when it arrives but I would like to see an epic remake.I cannot relate supremely well to the realism of the book because I have not yet visited Egypt and Israel where the epic is told (although plans are in the works). What I am going to do about this before I can go is to read Waltari's other book, The Etruscan, and relate it to my recent visit to Tuscany -- wherein I did get pretty close to the Etruscan artifacts of that specific age.From this perspective, I will later return to this review and declare further my sense of the author's depth of research and preparation. While I trust others on this, I am not yet fully convinced of it myself. What I see and feel in the book is a Finnish writer telling me about Egyptians -- but writing about the horrors of World War II in an uncertain time potentially taken over by fascism.Meantime, as we are all necessarily learning more and more about Muslim and Arabic culture, I think a good historical novel is in order and I have read enough historical novels to say this is a good one, which in some way tells the story of every age, from a fictional time, place and perspective."},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"The Egyptian is probably the best book I've ever read. It's so interesting and believable, it doesn't feel like fiction at all. The only thing I don't like in this book is its translation. Altough it isn't so bad, the original Finnish version is much better. I'd definately give this book 6 stars if that'd be possible."},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"Mr. Waltari's storytelling style comes forth in colorful detail and complex characters. The mix of history, intrigue and involves the reader in a way that one feels as if one is in these ancient places with these people.

But Mika Waltari did an amazing job."},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"I first encountered this enchanting masterpiece at my local library when I was in ninth grade. But as is often the case with the most beautiful treasures we find on the road of life, I didn't realize this novel's true value when I first clapped eyes on it. Already, I was a teen in love with Ancient Egypt, and when I saw the title on the spine, that instantly caught my interest.But when I skimmed it over, I was confused. The prose was so unlike anything I'd read before and seemed to have a lot of \\"dead spots\\" which bored and alienated me. Plus, when I looked at the author's name, I thought it was Japanese, not Finnish, which made me assume \\"Great, I bet this book was written by some dude halfway around the globe who's never set foot in a major museum or even picked up a good, solid, book on Ancient Egypt.\\"So I decided that I could go find a better book that wasn't some impossible puzzle to figure out. Well, to paraphrase a quote by Lord Meren, The Eyes And Ears Of Pharaoh,(and the star of a brilliant mystery series himself,)\\"Nathan, you have the wits of an oryx.\\"I'm a freshman in college now, and I've had the great luck to once again, find this novel in our vast library by chance. Now, I'm much wiser. Now, I appreciate the lyrical style of the archaic writing. Now, I see how epic this book truly is.I adore didactic novels, ones that both teach as well as entertain, and are so rich with detail that you feel you're in that person's head. Many of the ones I've read however, as much as I enjoy them, have just one slim barrier between you and the full experience. It can be difficult after all, to get a reader emotionally involved.But Waltari did that and more. There were times as I read, that I felt so sorry for Sinuhe that I got teary-eyed. I consider myself a manly man, but the last fifteen pages or so dealing with the love of his life, Minea, and the cruel end she met didn't just break my heart, it shattered it.And there were occasions when I got so furious at some totally moronic thing he did, especially when I felt certain that he'd know better this time, that I wanted to shout out \\"You blew it again, you dumb dodo bird!\\" and just throw the book across my dorm room.I marveledatHoremheb'sstrength,determination,levelheadedness, and cunning. I was also dismayed at his ruthlessness, bloodlust, and sometimes cold nature.I laughed at the hilarity displayed by Sinuhe's one-eyed slave Kaptah, was amazed at how sly and wily he was, and was moved by his gentleness and loyalty.I fell madly in love with the incomparably beautiful Nefernefernefer, and still can't get the image I have of her out of my head. I'd definitely call her \\"my sister\\" and start dating right away. But beware, 'cause her body burns worse than fire, as our protaganist found out the really hard way. In fact, it would be a very good idea to listen to the song Poison by Bell Biv Devoe a few times if you want to know what Nefernefernefer's real nature is like. If I were you I'd take precautions...... As I read this book, I was right there to see the heretic king Akhenaton cultivate his religion of the Aton, and usurp the priesthood of Amun along with myriad other deities to form what he honestly thought would be the beginning of a brand new day of peace, solidarity, bliss, and advancement for Egypt. And it made me wonder if perhaps, just perhaps, the king I dismissed as a screwloose iconoclast obsessed with his batty religion wasn't such a screwloose after all.Finally, as I finished this book, I felt that I'd learned a lot, and not just about Ancient Egypt. No, it was that exsistence itself can throw us for a real loop, and we can't be certain of where our path will take us, but we must just keep trudging on.To read this novel shows that then as now, we are all human, and it's an inescapable fact that we each have powerful strengths as well as dismal weaknesses that DO affect the people around us in a very real way. At the end of our lives, some of us will have fallen by the wayside, while others will have soared as high as any eagle. But you know what? If you can look back on your life like Sinuhe and realize that you've lived your life for just the mere simple sake of it, then that's all that matters.I can't travel around like Sinuhe did, but I do know where I'm going to go after interim ends.

Besides Sinuhe, the Egyptian, I've also read Turms, der Unsterbliche (Turms, the Immortal), Johannes Angelos, and Kuka Murhasi Rouva Skrofin (who murdered Mrs. Skrof). My favorites are Sinuhe and Johannes Angelos, but the others were good, too. I'm now reading Komisario Palmun Erehdys (Inspector Palmu's Mistake), which is a sequel to Kuka Murhasi Rouva Skrofin.Sinuhe, the Egyptian, is really typical, I think, of Waltari's historical novels. It's really neat how he provides an interesting history of Egypt, but still writes a really good novel at the same time. I like Waltari's heroes because they always learn the hard way about women and honesty. I think he's just as cynical as I am, maybe more so from his longer lifetime experience which he had. I have the impression that most people only care about his historical portrayal of Egypt, but I think it's the story and the sad irony which makes it one of my favorites."},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"Mika Waltari's \\"The Egyptian\\" tells us the story of one physician of ancient Egypt, Sinuhe, set against the background of the reign of the fourth pharaoh Amenhotep, whose attempt to impose monotheism on his polytheistic country was one of the strangest and most fascinating experiments of early civilization. Sinuhe is a foundling, adopted by a lowly physician, and in the tradition of ancient times, trained to follow in his adopted father's footsteps, coming of age at the same time a decisive event is about to take place: the death of the reigning pharaoh, Amenhotep III, around 1380 BC, and the accession of his son, Amenhotep IV, who styled himself Akhenaton.Sinuhe is a loner and a wanderer, whose self-imposed exile from his native country takes him to Syria, the ancient Hittite kingdom of Hatti, and Crete, before finally returning to Egypt, at the same time that Akhenaton attempts to overthrow the reigning god Ammon and his priests, and install his own vision, Aton, the one and eternal god, in Ammon's place. As a political move, trimming Ammon's power in Egypt may have been a wise idea; the priests' power had grown so great that it was challenging that of pharaoh himself. But as a religious experiment it was a disaster, especially in a country as rigidly conservative as ancient Egypt where change of any kind was anathema. We see Akhenaton as a visionary out of touch with reality and with his people, a tragic figure doomed to failure. And we share Sinuhe's ambivalence about this enigmatic figure, intrigued by pharaoh's vision of one just god who brings equality to all mankind, but repelled by the spreading social chaos this vision brings with it, especially when it threatens his own security and the lives of those he loves.Waltari bring us some of the people that have only existed in the pages of history books -- Akhenaton himself, his incredibly beautiful wife Nefertiti, his scheming, conniving mother Queen Taia, the boy king Tut, and Horemheb, the military general who became pharaoh after Akhenaton's death plunged the country into near anarchy. But \\"The Egyptian\\" fortunately doesn't read like a history textbook; Waltari makes ancient Egypt and his characters come vibrantly alive. And Sinuhe himself is wholly believable; a man of his own time and all time, sometimes wise, sometimes foolish in the extreme, trying to find his own place in his world, sometimes succeeding and sometimes not. Waltari is not only a great novelist but a fine historian, and he kept the background scrupulously accurate. The book is true to its time and its location, and Naomi Walford's excellent translation into English keeps the reader moving along effortlessly from the first page to the last. \\"The Egyptian\\" is Waltari's masterpiece; it's one of the best historical novels ever written."},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"If one reads no other novel by a Finn, one must read Waltari's &quot;The Egyptian.&quot; It is arguably the greatest work of Finnish literature in much the same way that Dvorak's New World Symphony is arguably the greatest work of Czech music. Each brings a national influence to what has essentially been an international masterpiece from its very inception. An American bestseller for a period after its first publication in English, The Egyptian has remained stubbornly popular throughout Europe with every new generation of literate readers.Mika Waltari was a prolific and versatile writer whose historical fiction, of which The Egyptian is the premiere and defining opus, treats the great turning points of world history with a voice and perspective that bring to mind the sweep of a James Michener, the gently ironic familiarity of a Mark Twain, and the authorial presence of a William Faulkner.The Egyptian ostensibly relates the autobiography of Sinuhe, a baby boy found in a basket among bullrushes who rises to become a doctor and advisor to pharaohs, during the coming of age and regency of the pharaoh Ekhnaton, who attempted to overturn established religions and replace them with a new one worshiping a new god. (Waltari contrives to make this element of the plot vaguely suggestive of the birth of Christianity more than a millennium later.) Through his travails and his travels, Sinuhe meets people of all stations of life in many areas of Egypt and its neighboring countries, informing us on many details both grand and minute of ancient Egyptian life and history.But the true genius of The Egyptian is that it is really not about Egypt or ancient times at all. Rather it is about every nation and every civilization, every people in every time in every place of the world. It is about each of us readers, the joys and sorrows of our own lives, and about the social and governmental institutions to which we find ourselves subject. He records with dispassionate clarity the entire spectrum of human and social behavior, from the most exalted of aspirations, emotions, and deeds to the most debased, in himself as unflinchingly as in others. Whoever we are, wherever and whenever we live, we cannot help but recognize ourselves and our own times.Most endearing of all is the voice in which Sinuhe addresses us. By turns grave and common, earnest and witty, nave and sly, it cannot be captured in a brief review. However, this personal translation from Finnish of the opening paragraph may provide a taste:&quot;I, Sinuhe, son of Senmut and his wife Kipa, am the author of this work. I write not to glorify the gods, for I am weary of gods. I write not to glorify pharaohs, for I am weary of pharaohs' deeds. Rather for my own sake do I write this. Not to flatter gods, nor to flatter kings, nor out of fear, nor out of hope for the future. For I have experienced and lost much in the years of my life, and am untroubled by trivial fears; and I am weary of the hope of immortality, as I am weary of gods and kings. Only for my own sake do I write this, and in that respect I believe that I am different from all other writers past and future.&quot; [Paragraph excerpted and translated under fair usage provision of international copyright law for the purpose of literary review.]If I could carry with me through life only a single novel as an enduring source of inspiration and sound perspective, I would mourn the loss of many others - but I would choose The Egyptian."},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"The Egyptian set in the Amarna period of Ancient Egypt during the reigns of the pharaohs Amunhotep III, Akhenaten and Horemheb, covering the concluding years of the 18th dynasty of the New Kingdom (1386 - 1293 BC), an ear in Egyptian history that was marked by significant religious and political upheaval. The Egyptian is Sinuhe, a physician of unknown birth origin who was wrapped and cradled in a reed boat floating down the Nile. As he narrates his life story, which transcended years of warfare, plague, and fierce battle between gods. On the outside The Egyptian delineates the history of Egypt through its inveterate religious devotion to many gods. At the core of the novel finds one man's lifelong journey through many countries, like Babylon, Crete, and Mitannia, to knowledge. Sinehu possessed such lonely idealism that motivated him to devote his life searching for something so intangible yet greater than he beyond his understanding did. He was not ready to merely worshipping the gods - in fact, he insisted on questioning traditions and thus marked him as an outsider of his own culture.The spine of the novel concerns the ferocious contention between Aton and the Ammon. Pharoach Akhenaten sought to disestablish the old gods with a relatively unknown deity called the Aton as the Ammon, the present godly sponsor, had accumulated so much wealth and power that the Ammon priests began to rival to that of the Pharoach. In order to achieve balance of power between Ammon and the throne, Akhenaten deposed the ancient gods and established Aton as a new state divinity. No sooner had Akhenaten adopted the new deity than Sinuhe ineluctably became entangled in conflict between tradition and innovation. Sinuhe must choose between the way of the heretic Pharoach and the old corrupt system that had blinded many and robbed the freedom of Egyptians.Miki Waltari deftly uses a prose style evocative of ancient texts that is comparable to Naguib Mahfouz's work in modern Egyptian literature. Unlike Mahfouz, Waltari's book is the first major novel set in ancient Egypt during the 18th dynasty of the New Kingdom in 14th century BC The Egyptian, comibing history, research and imagination, is a timeless re-creation of such largely forgotten era over a prodigious interval of time. The book captures the nuances of war, intrigue, power struggle, wassail, romance, horror, and lavish scnenes of violence. From Sinuhe's intransigence to worshipping false gods springs forth a tale of death and love, man's corruption, cruelty, and lust for power and the warfare between two value systems and religions that amazingly reflect our world today.2004 (19) MY"},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"I first read The Egyptian when I was 14 and just beginning to understand the beauty of more complex books. The first chapters didn't appear very interesting to me, but as I continued reading, I suddenly realized I had been swooped into an amazingly realistic ancient world full of excitement, sorrow, wisdom and more. The whole experience was memorable since it's been very few times when a story I've been reading has felt as incredibly real as Sinuhe's story did. The Egyptian jumped right on the top of my list of best books.Mika Waltari truly is the most skillful writer I know - where he learned it, I have no idea. His books, especially The Egyptian, have something that appeal to all kinds of people from all over the world. Perhaps it's the art of describing the feelings that each human being experiences sooner or later, and the way he is able to make a story from ancient Egypt seem like it could happen even today. People don't change, only their surroundings do.The Egyptian is a wonderful and sad story. Especially recommended to everyone who likes history, but I really think that it's a great book for everyone who's interested in mankind - and in particularly good stories."},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"Fifty years ago, my High School english teacher asked the class to write an essay on a favorite book. I chose to write about Mika Waltari's \\"The Egyptian.\\" I started my essay with the opening sentence from the book. That sentence still resonates with me today and I still can recite the opening paragraph by heart. I have read many books in the years since that High School assignment, and \\"The Egyptian\\" still holds a special place in my heart. It remains a favorite. I highly recommend this book as one in which the reader can be carried along by a wonderful story told by a consumate writer. The universal question of what in this life really matters is skillfully explored. People who have seen the awful movie adaptation may shy away from the novel. Don't. If you like to become totally engrossed in a compelling story, you will be hard pressed to find a better book. If you have an interest in ancient Egypt (which is not necessary for enjoyment), you will be absolutely blown away by the meticulous research behind the narrative. \\"The Egyptian\\" was a huge success when it was first published, and is a real classic that deserves to be read from generation to generation."},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"I remembered seeing this film as a young person over a half a century ago and decided it was time to read it. I am a fan of historical fiction, but would certainly not limit my recommendation to read this book only to those who love the historical genre. This book belongs in the collection of every serious reader. The book flows smoothly from start to finish and leaves no doubt in the readers mind why Mr. Waltari is considered one of the great Finnish writers and why this book was the number one international best-seller in 1949.Set in 14th century BCE Egypt, it is a fascinating tale of a man pulled from the Nile in a small reed boat as a baby -- and this is not the only similarity to incidents found in the Bible -- who ultimately becomes Paraoh's personal physician. This is the era when Egypt and its ruler Ahkenaton experimented with monotheism and Waltari's narrative weaves its magic around the theological turmoil that resulted from a nation unsure of its very culture.More specifically, however, The Egyptian tells the tale of Sinuhe the physician who travels the extent of the then known world in search of himself. Despite the loyalty of his personal servant Kaptah, despite his friendship with Pharaoh and his boyhood friend Horemheb who rises to generalship, and despite his physical and emotional relationships with a number of intriguing women, Sinuhe leads a lonely life. That loneliness is set in motion by a mother who abandoned him at birth and cuts him to the heart and follows him for the rest of his life following three separate nights with a woman of pleasure that cost him dearly. You must read this book to understand why.Waltari's research is complete, but the strength of the book is the story itself complemented with strong and superb character development.Even a casual reader would find great satisfaction in this book, but the serious reader will feel fulfilled when he has read the final page. Five stars is not enough."},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"As a Finn I feel slight guilt over not having read Waltari at all before 2003. Prejudiced towards his era's Finnish authors or just against his name which for some peculiar reason represented something for \\"old generation\\" and boring, unenthusiastic way of story telling (who can claim Kalle P&auml;&auml;talo doesn't sound like a boring author too..). I read couple of his earlier works which haven't been translated into other languages I think and after those I was convinced that prejudice had ecclipsed the masteful story telling abilities of Mika Waltari. The Egyptian is the third Waltari book I have read. Doctor in ancient Egypt?? Written by a Finn and gotten huge success all over the world? Somewhat uncommon framework for a book and I had no idea what to expect. I did some cautious non-spoiling background digging in order to establish some sort of an idea of the book. I learned that egyptologists consider the book amazingly accurate description of the culture in that era and that Waltari had done his Egypt + surrouding areas research very well but had never visited Egypt. It is said that he didn't make notes about the facts but just remembered and understood the essence and wrote the book.I found the story telling captivating and humour embedded in especially Kaptah's long monoloques in a dialoque with Sinuhe were hilarious. Yet this story has a lot of philosophical pondering which always fits the storyline and doesn't seem separate from the story. Hence a combination of things that make one stop to think and digest every once in a while and the entertaining and uplifting humour and tragicomedy. Simplicity and complexity of characters, cunning manipulation and clever psychology all coats the story with even more interesting aspects not to mention the adventure Sinuhe and Kaptah go through. I found the book good from page 1 all the way to the final page. What more can one want from a book?The Egyptian has many scenes which underline the cruelty, ruthlessness, power of love, loyality and the power of fear. All these are exhibited as extremes at some point in the book. Made in 1945 after second world war had it is rather easy to understand the certain pessimism throughout the book and distrust in people's ability to change and peacefully co-exist. Waltari shows how humanity often escapes in horror when war becomes intense. Book has a lot of descriptions of vileness, ultimate cruelty, torture and complete ignorance towards human life. Waltari also brings out the concept of loyality in very extreme forms. Some female characters in this book are almost exclusively somewhat detrimental for men's mental sanity. Nefernefernefer has not only a catchy name but is also a prime example of deceiving woman whose limitless power is in her beauty and manipulation omnipotence! While she draws all will-power away from Sinuhe and seals his fate in many ways at the beginning of the book, she gets a payback later from Sinuhe but gets still the last laugh in a way that one can only smile at in disbelief.No need for details. Just give this book a chance and you may find yourself quite immersed in it."},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"Recently read this book for the first time and I know it won't be the last, this is one of the best works of historical fiction I've ever read and a timeless piece of literature. Originally published in Finnish during the 1940's and set in ancient Egypt around the 14th century BC, it is still a story very relevant to modern times.The main character and narrator is Sinuhe, a man born in Thebes, who has written the story of his life in Egypt and his travels to Syria, Babylon, Crete and the land of the Hittites. I especially loved the descriptions of Crete and the people who danced with the bulls. This is much more than an adventure or war novel though, Sinuhe is a deep thinker &amp; searcher for answers about the nature of man and suffers from much inner turmoil. The greatest part of this turmoil is lived out in the battle between the spiritually motivated pharaoh and the materially minded priests and military.If you are looking for a page turning adventure that is also really great literature don't miss this one."},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"I first read this book when I was a girl junior in high school. That was in 1967, which was 22 years after it was written. I just finished reading it again and love it even more. I am 53 now and have read many novels but none compare to my favorite book, The Egyptian. And now that I am older I have come to appreciate the complexity of the characters, their sorrows, their joys, their virtues and vices even more. The writting style is rythmic and lyrical with ancient language like the Songs of Solomon. Yet the plot is easy to follow and the story is enthralling because it is based on historical events and people.I fell in love with Sinhue as a teenager and have yet to find a more strangely attractive male character in any other book. Sinhue is not a man of action, but a thinking man who loves deeply and is loyal and compassionate. Yet he is also flawed in a way that makes him all the more mysterious and vulnerable. His wiley slave Keptah, the love of his life, Minea, who dances before the bulls in her homeland of Crete, the Pharoah Anknaton, the princess Baketamon and many more characters both fictional and factual are skillfully created and come alive in the beautifully described setting of the ancient world.I was very gratified to read the other reviews. It seems I am not alone in my life long love of this magical novel. Read it because if you don't you will be missing something in life. But I warn you, no other book you read afterward will ever quite measure up to it."},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"In all the best selling novels sold today; there is love, lost love, hope, hopelessness, dispair, tragedy, and hope again.These elements (in whichever order the author chooses to give them to the reader) are essential to good character development and indepth plot construction. In &quot;The Egyptian&quot; Mika Waltari not only manifests these 'essentials' with the gifted hand of a Houdini; he weaves them into a historical setting that virtually brings ancient Egypt alive.No one can read this book and not experience the strength of true love; the foolishness of the human heart; the dreams men have dreamt throughout the ages; or fail to see the insight with which one man perceives himself, and those he comes in contact with. This is a must book for all:Physicians, lovers, dreamers, and psychologists alike will walk the streets of ancient Thebes and smell the fish broiling on open braziers as the sun slowly settles into the Land of the Dead.Walk the Black Lands. Flee to the Red Lands. Love the beautifull Nefernefer. Stand beside Pharoah. Savor the best life has to offer, then shiver at the bitter taste of misfortune. Learn life as it has never be taught before, or since.Published originally in 1945, The Egyptian was an instant international success. It has since been translated into at least five different languages.

Although the titles may appear to be of a mold and rather boring, the stories are anything but. My favorites are the Egyptian, The Wanderer and The Adventurer. Wonderful historical flavor"},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"While impressed with how skillfully and casually Waltari draws upon an astonishing number of details about daily life in ancient times, I at first wondered if this book was going anywhere or had anything worthwhile to say. As the protagonist returns to Egypt from his journeys and finds himself caught up in a battle between the supporters of the gods Aton and Ammon, I realized this is that rare book that works on many levels - it's an adventure, a love story, a story of political intrigue and religious faith. Its overarching theme is the constant conflict, both in society and in the soul of the protagonist, the physician Sinuhe, between nave idealism and cynical pragmatism.My only complaint is that, even while the book feels incredibly accurate, Waltari goes beyond merely filling in the major historical facts with fictions of his own; rather, in many instances he contradicts them. For instance, in the novel Akhnaton is immediately succeeded by Tutankhamun because the heir apparent, Sekhenre, is murdered. In fact, after Akhnaton's death, Nefertiti and Smenkhkare ruled for several years before Tutankhamun ascended to the throne. Another example is how in the novel Horemheb's army defeats the Israelites and destroys their Arc of the Covenant, even though historical sources suggest it was still around when the Romans sacked the Temple of Jerusalem in 70 a.d. But those minor issues aside, this book is entertaining, informative, and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"I'm going to read it again after I find a good Ancient History map. I loved all the characters and look forward to reading other Waltari novels."},{"Title":"The Egyptian","review":"I expected a rehash of the screenplay. Definitely not.... Almost like expecting \\"Gone With The Wind\\" to be \\"The North Won....\\" The folks that did the screenplay cut most of the book.... Which is probably OK, because it's LONG....The negatives are that, whether it's because of the translator (the original's NOT in English), or Waltari's intent, the language tries to look like Ancient Egyptian (whatever that was), and includes some idiomatic expressions that are a little tough to get through. Reminded me of the original \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" TV series where certain common words were replaced with something slightly different. Something like \\"Yarn\\" for \\"Year\\", for example.... Waltari's book, at least, doesn't do that, but some odd stuff (\\"spit on your couch\\", for example) wander in without explanation, and some change depending on where you are in the text. Otherwise, as somebody who really liked the movie, the differences are a little annoying at times.The pluses: Sinuhe and Kaptah turn into real people.... Not to mention Merit and Horemheb. The other major characters, and some \\"new\\" ones (not in the movie) also play their parts well. Some irony, too, but you'll have to read the book to find it....Also, some fractured history, I think.... But maybe not. There's not a lot of agreement today on the dating of some of what's reported here, and Waltari may have picked a chronology that's no longer in good odor. I find that interesting rather than important....You have to be prepared to read this - it's kinda \\"deep\\" compared to the movie, or much popular writing. I enjoyed it, though. No regrets....(Am I the only one that noticed that \\"Kaptah\\" could be \\"Capta\\", which is \\"slave\\" in Latin? Actually, \\"captured\\", but you get the idea. Naming a kid \\"Thoth\\" in that time period also may have been problematical, too, but who knows. My Egyptian isn't good enough, but \\"Dedicated To Thoth\\" would be more likely. Even Sinuhe comments on the \\"Thoth\\" name, btw....)Not \\"sit on the beach\\" reading, and not for the bluenoses, although PG-13 probably would fly.

It is rather steep, at $49.95, but I think well worth it. Alderson, who revised the 3rd edition, is noted children's book historian in England. It deserves a place on any children's literature reference shelf.If you are interested in a deeper historical perspective of British children's literature, this is the book.As far as a \\"text\\" for the history of BRITISH children's book, I think it is one of the best. Here is a description from the book jacket:\\"Harvey Darton said of his book, first published in 1932, \\"Not a collection of queer facts or antiquarian scraps,\\" but \\"a chronicle of the English people in their capacity of parents, guardians and educators of children.\\" Certainly, literature --albeit a \\"minor literature\\"--was his central theme, but through it he wove biography and the facts of social and commercial history, the \\"human aspect.\\" When \\"Children's Books in England\\" was published it proved to be a work whose insights and authority transformed our understanding of its subject.\\" In preparing this new edition, therefore, the publishers have been at pains to provide a text that will sustain Darton's reputation for a new generation of readers. The editor, Brian Alderson, has checked the multitude of small details in the book in an effort to ensure that they are accurate by the standards of modern scholarship; he has added a number of bibliographical notes; and, in a supplementary chapter, he has filled out the discussion of children's books during the late Victorian and Edwardian periods, which formed a natural end-point to Harvey Darton's history. In addition, more than sixty new illustrations have been added, in order to expand upon facts and arguments put forward in the text.\\""},{"Title":"Designing Visual Language: Strategies for Professional Communicators (Part of the Allyn & Bacon Series in Technical Communication)","review":"This book serves as a very general introduction to visual design, but it doesn't have much \\"meat\\" to it. Specifically, it might tell the reader to do something, and it might explain why the reader should do something, but it provides no references to all the research and studies that back up the theory.That's perfectly fine for people who want to just get some general concepts, but it's completely unacceptable for advanced college students (especially at the masters or PhD level) or those who are truely interested or experienced in this area.If you want a truly definitive book on design theory--especially with respect to paper (and to a lesser extent online) design theory--you MUST get Karen Schriver's \\"Dynamics in Document Design: Creating Text for Readers\\" book. It is THE definitive document design theory book for people who want not only the theory, but also the research and references to go digging deeper.Unfortunately, \\"Designing Visual Language\\" merely scratches the surface of this discipline. I can only recommend this book for beginners/novices/undergraduates, and I would do so hesitantly at best.Also, be aware that this book is not representative of the Allyn & Bacon series in Technical Communication. Some of their other books are quite good/useful--though occasionally lightweight on references."},{"Title":"Designing Visual Language: Strategies for Professional Communicators (Part of the Allyn & Bacon Series in Technical Communication)","review":"This book was required for a graduate course in visual communications. The book is written in a style of chest-puffing academic balderdash that renders it useless and unreadable. Crummy paper and truly ugly illustrations add to the miasma.

Some of the pages look like they were printed on a photocopier running out of ink. The text is fine, but the graphs look terrible. One would think that a book about design would have put more thought into their own design and production run.My gripe is simply that this book is too much money for the truly piss-poor physical quality. $76 for a book whose binding became unglued in the first week? $76 for a text whose pages look like they were printed on with an empty toner cartridge? This is a sick joke! Designing Visual Language is a piece of junk and Allyn & Bacon should be ashamed of themselves for having no quality control.Addendum...I'm wondering why people have not found this review helpful. Is it because they want to buy a book that is poorly made? If so, I invite you to buy the book.

But it does extend rhetorical theory into the visual realm. This may work for readers who have some understanding of verbal rhetoric but little to no understanding of visual design. However, someone, maybe an instructor, is going to have explain some of the convoluted writing and abbreviated topics.It has the following weaknesses on first read through:* Circuitous style of writing -- overly academic and wordy;* Horribly inaccurate from a professional's standpoint on design. The chapter on typography is particularly egregious;* It is woefully dated (I did read the 2nd edition) and found the chapter on data displays to show that particular weakness. Further, the writing style choice of case study narrative would not have been my personal choice in showing writing conciseness;* Limited in its approach regarding visual theory. Focusing on Gestalt and the author's own cognate approach it ignores any other theories of visual perception;* A critical lapse was not addressing color theory at length. Color is mentioned in a subsidiary manner towards the supra graphical analysis and as a casual element in other chapters but nothing of note.Frankly, I would NEVER choose this book for a course nor recommend it to either a professional or someone wanting to learn the field. You would be better off using Lipton's _Practical Guide to Information Design_ and I hate to say it, Kimball's _Document Design_ which has very quick summations on large topics but at least it addresses those topics unlike Kostelnick. For people wanting to learn design then Krause's Design Basics Index, Golombivsky's _White Space is Not Your Enemy_ , Williams' Non-Design series and anything by McWade would be a good start."},{"Title":"Designing Visual Language: Strategies for Professional Communicators (Part of the Allyn & Bacon Series in Technical Communication)","review":"It reads kind of like a text book, but the information is very good.

By 1938, the year the Nazis invaded Prague, he was dead. His brother Josef died a few years later in Bergan-Belsen. But this book is not about those sad events. This book is about a year in the life of a good gardener, how ever extraordinary a writer he might have been.During his lifetime, Capek realized that humans were becoming enslaved by fascism and run-amuck technology. The ancient and cyclical daily practices of humans were dying before his eyes --the beet farmers stacking their fall harvests at the railroad stations; the wagon loads of manure that could be delivered for garden beds; the nursury men who understood plants giving way to &quot;market garden centers&quot; staffed by those who regularly misidentify plants and stocked with items that &quot;move&quot; (produce a high volume of sales).THE GARDENER'S YEAR is a reflective book. You don't have to garden to appreciate it, but if you garden, you will probably laugh on more than one occasion. Where is the gardener who has not struggled with a hose; Who has not looked with greed on a bald spot and attempted to squeeze six more phlox plants in, only to discover a dormant sping plant; And, where is the gardener who has not wandered about the yard with a plant in each hand trying to find just one more place for a perennial. Capek understood the gardener's soul. We are a greedy lot, obsessed with dirt, happy in a wagon load of s___, and hostile to many-legged life forms, but, we are also the best sort of human beings who understand the meaning and importance of life.Capek's writing reminds me of that of Henry Mitchell who wrote two columns (one on gardening the other on &quot;everyday&quot; philosophy) for the Washington Post. Like Mitchell Capek had the gift of converting his own gardening experiences into tales that inform, enlighten, and illustrate the best and the worst of human nature. &quot;I tell you there is no death, not even sleep. We only pass from one season to another. We must be patient with life, for it is eternal.&quot;"},{"Title":"The gardener's year,","review":"There is humor and self-deprecation in The Gardener's Year...This is a book that will appeal to the gardener, the philospher, and the Zen deotee, the reader of self-help books, as well as the humorist.

I expected something a bit different, a bit more practical, perhaps, but after leafing through the pages, I read the entire book before I gave it to her. Written by the man known to most of us as a European author of the early 20th century on more weighty subjects, this man's witty description of himself as the sometimes manic master of his small domestic garden both amuses and somehow comforts those of us who share his enthusiasm. I laughed long and loudly at Capek's description of what ensued from his planting of the seeds from just one packet, at the many dozens of little plants in little pots, all of which became bigger and bigger, and had to be taken outdoors, finally, to find places in a tiny garden patch.

It lets us know if recent weather is truly unusual. It warns us of typical variations in weather that we can expect. It helps explain some details about past history. It can help show the effect of weather on society. And it can show the effects of natural phenomena, such as volcanic eruptions and sunspot cycles, on our weather.By the way, the author uses the word \\"climate,\\" not \\"weather.\\" That may be correct, but I always thought \\"climate\\" was more applicable to averages over many years. That is, climate is what you expect. Weather is what you get.Anyway, just what has our weather been like for the last several centuries and more?Ladurie begins by looking at tree ring data from Arizona and elsewhere in the Western United States. Then he discusses wine harvest data from France. Next is the rate of withdrawal of the Rhone glacier. Detailed data are in the Appendix.There are discussions of atypical years. One that he spends some time on is 1816. The spring was cooler than normal. June was cold. The temperatures in Paris in June, 1816 were 3.5 degrees Celsius lower than normal. And the ensuing winter was deadly. In the original edition of this book (1971), Ladurie, to my surprise, did not mention the cause of all this, namely the major eruption of the Tambora volcano in 1815. In the Afterword, written in 1982, he finally mentions it.Well, in a nutshell, what can we conclude about, um, worldwide climate? It was relatively cold from 500 BC to 100 BC. It was warm from 50 BC to 200 AD. It was cold again from 400 AD to 600 AD (giving historians of the collapse of European civilization at the time some food for thought). It was warm again from 650 AD to 1100 AD (explaining some of the ease with which the Vikings prospered in Iceland and travelled to so many faraway places). It was cold again from 1150 AD to 1300 AD. It got a little warmer from 1350 AD to 1450 AD. But then came the \\"Little Ice Age\\" of 1600 AD to 1850 AD. And it was warmer in the twentieth century than in the nineteenth.I found this book intriguing.

The first one contains a discussion of what forgiveness is, what it means for our lives and how it can be achieved. Albeit brief, this section provides an invaluable route map for whomever might be in need to overcome injuries of the past.In my view, the second past is the less usable. It contains a general description of 9 fictitious characters and analyzes how forgiveness can help them in their lives. A little vague and simplistic, I think this section could have well been done without.Finally, the excellent third part analyzes how prayer and, in particular, centering prayer, can help you to forgive and achieve a whole live. The writing is very clear in this section, despite dealing with very complex topics.The book is openly Christian.

He offers a quite insightful look of their service throughout the War For Southern Independence. Some of the personal accounts of these brave men of colour are wonderful, leaving us to question the bigotry of those who use revisionist tactics in portraying the War For Southern Independence. I believe the unfortunate &amp; temporarily successful block of the racist organisation NAACP against a proposed monument in the Commonwealth of Virginia, that was to have been erected to the memory of the thousands upon thousand of blacks who wore the grey &amp; butternut &amp; bore the Saint Andrew's Cross of the Southern Confederacy, is such an example."},{"Title":"Forgotten Confederates: An Anthology About Black Southerners, Vol. 14 (Journal of Confederate History Series)","review":"Forgotten Confederates: An Anthology About Black Southerners is an informative text that introduces the reader to an ignored, overlooked, and often times denied chapter in the history of the War Between the States. The editors have compiled a collection of modern essays, period news articles, obituaries, personal recollections, and Confederate records that provide readers an opportunity to either educate themselves or to pursue further exploration of the role that African Americans played in the Confederacy. The anthology includes sections that 1) deal primarily with the actual historical events, 2) sociological and anthropological studies concerning the social structure when the conflict occurred (providing the reader with a basic understanding of the times that purely historical texts often lack), and 3) personal remembrances that give the reader insight into the actual thoughts of those African Americans who worked with or for the Confederacy. The book is imminently readable and its format permits the reader to continue through the text as written at his leisure or to concentrate upon records, historical texts, or contemporary musings if he wishes. Two aspects of the work created a great impression upon this reviewer. The first aspect is the objectivity of the text. While the potential for a biased point of view is great in subject matter of this sort, the editors did an excellent job of presenting all aspects of African-American Southern involvement in the conflict. The records that were presented reflected the nature of the contributions of both slaves and freemen and numerous references were made to individuals who served in both sides of the conflict. Additionally, there were no obvious attempts at apologia for the reasons behind African-American participation in the Confederacy. The editors again were objective in their selection of source materials and where conclusions are drawn by either contributors, past historians, or participants; the editors let those conclusions stand. Moreover, in records or lengthy discourses that required editing, the editors summarised the passages without loss of factual information. Secondly, an extensive reference is made available to the reader who chooses to pursue additional information on the topic. This resource includes a description and page number of each particular relevant reference, for which this reviewer was particular grateful. This reviewer highly recommends Forgotten Confederates to any student of the Civil War, students of sociology or African American studies, or any reader with an interest in the more obscure details of the American Civil War as an excellent introduction to the role that African Americans played in the Confederate States."},{"Title":"Forgotten Confederates: An Anthology About Black Southerners, Vol. 14 (Journal of Confederate History Series)","review":"The common conception of black Southerners in the Civil War has described a people unified by their opposition to the Confederacy and resisting the Southern war effort, either passively and actively.This view can only be maintained by ignoring a mass of research material that strongly suggests that black opinion, like other opinion, was represented across the spectrum, and was strongly influenced by sectional, local, and family loyalties which have largely disappeared in the modern world, but which were of paramount importance in the nineteenth century. Many blacks, free and slave, in fact, considered themselves Southerners first and blacks second, and served the Southern cause enthusiastically.This unconventional view is supported here by a wealth of clippings, rosters, memoirs, photos, archival records, and other data to convincingly demonstrate that the matter is more complex than the simplifiers of history would have it, and to show that the actual record of the black Southerner leaves no firm ground for those who would cite his experiences for modern political purposes.(The &quot;score&quot; rating is an unfortunately ineradicable feature of the page.
