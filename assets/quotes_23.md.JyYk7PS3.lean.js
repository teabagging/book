But it's probably from the same time period. It seems that the Victorian and Edwardian eras had all the really good stuff.

Cleopatra was the first of them to bother to learn Egyptian; her predecessors commanded their Egyptian armies through translators! The Ptolemy marriage vows included the promise not to poison your spouse, and killing a cat was a capital offense. Cleopatra, Caesar, and Mark Anthony spoke to each other in Greek, the language of the educated. Cleopatra learned nine languages, the ones required to deal with the inhabitants of North Africa (including Aramaic, the language of Jesus). During twenty years of her life, the trading language of the Mediterranean changed from Greek to Latin; Latin was the last language she learned. She was the richest woman of the Mediterranean world of her time (50 BCE grosso modo), and Alexandria was the most magnificent city--Rome was still a boondock. That should be enough to give your an idea of how interesting and well written Schiff's Cleopatra is. . . ."},{"Title":"The Heart of a Dog","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. It is by that immortal writer of collie and dog books, Albert P. Terhune. It is a collection of collie stories, some about his own dogs, including the famous Lad, and some about fictional dogs.

Other than some of the stories already being featured in Terhune's other books, all of the stories were excellent.

The stories were short, but had much variety and excitement.

The reader becomes invested in the lives of the well developed characters. I recommend this book to everyone who loves a book that lets you escape into another world. Ballou's writing style is clean and highly poetic at times. I look forward to more tales from this young author.

Because there's so much potential and so many great characters I'm disappointed it ended!!! This is a great new take on the epic fantasy genre, rethinking a lot of the old standards and offering something to fans of intrigue, sword and sorcery...any of the fantasy genres.The One King is Katrise Doolin, a young woman new to the throne. Generations ago the world was united by her ancestors into a great empire, but the golden age was short lived due to intrigue. Now the regent Dukes have cemented their power and fear the coming of a new King, especially one as uncontrollable as Katrise. At the same time, the Mage Clans have seen their long-term plans to rule the world shattered by the coming of a new King, causing unlimited intrigue among the magic-users of the land. Katrise and her clan of Doolin warriors are feeling pressed from all sides, leading to a climactic battle for the world..."},{"Title":"The One King","review":"While a fantasy novel is not my usual read, I could not put down this book! The characters that Ballou creates in her new world of Llandsbar are well-developed and fascinating.

I was so excited to be able to purchase a new copy. My children are grown now and I have shared this book with them. My husband and I just laugh over the anecdotes in this book. We quote them to each other quite often. We just reread the book out loud to each other and often we would have tears rolling down our faces from laughing so hard.

Then he betrayed Gilbert by flying back to the US unannounced, and signing a contract with a publisher to write the book on his own. In addition to being unethical, he was cuckoo.

For the first time that I know of Holly Lisle's main character isn't an idiot. That doesn't mean her other books aren't great, but they are a little more gut-wrenching. The author creates an Hell you can believe in, and a God you want to believe in.

I was glad it wasn't any longer than it was. Although I was glad it wasn't longer, it felt like it needed to be. Everything and everyone in it seemed very shallow.Was the book supposed to be funny? I think I maybe chuckled once. I didn't find the characters all that interesting, and Hell, Lucifer and the demons were all very cliche. This book offered nothing particularly new. I couldn't really swallow the idea that of all the people in the world, God found Dayne alone worthy enough to listen to. The whole conflict seemed very causal and relaxed. I didn't get much of a sense of danger, and I certainly didn't worry about if anyone would succeed. I saw most of the plot twists coming and was surprised by very little. Plot-wise, not all that much happened. There's plenty of witty dialogue and a few more thought-provoking discussions. That was kinda it.I could summarize this story in a sentence or two, although I won't because that would be giving away spoilers. There was a brief bit with a few prank phone calls, which I thought might go somewhere - but it never did(unless I missed something, which I don't think I did...) and I had trouble believing in the depth of Dayne's feelings for the love interest, which seemed to develop awfully quickly. I also felt a little cheated that there wasn't any conclusion about Torry(her dead husband). Since Dayne's prayer for the souls of hell to be given a 2nd chance was partly because of her despair at thinking him suffering for eternity, I'd have liked to know if he ever did repent for his sins. Finally, I didn't found the Doctor with the God complex (forgot his name) to be a particularly believable character. Nor could I honestly believe that doctors would be allowed to subject their patients to such cruel \\"heroic measures\\". This character seemed to exist entirely as a catalyst to make Dayne despair and pray to God.I'm glad I didn't pay too much for this book. It's not worth spending more than a few dollars, or even better, borrowing from a library. Good to pass the time, though to be honest, there are much better books out there. This is probably best left to the Holly Lisle fans only.I struggled to decide what rating to give this book. Two stars almost seems too harsh, but 3 would be much too generous and might mislead other readers. 2.5 would be fair, but Amazon don't allow half a point to be given. I decided to vote this book 2 stars, as it's poor points are stronger than it's good points."},{"Title":"Sympathy for the Devil","review":"This is a sweet book, where the good prevails the evil.

Original, with interesting characters and a humourous view of life in Heaven/Hell. I recommend it highly"},{"Title":"Sympathy for the Devil","review":"Dayne Kuttner has made a challenge to God that the deity cannot refuse. To give the damned souls of Hell another chance to repent. The ineffable deity has responded to Dayne's challenge in an unexpected way releasing several thousand Hellspawn into the State of North Carolina. And while heaven may be offering them a chance to repent, Hell has other plans. They are to tempt more souls into hell, starting with the soul of Dayne. Holly Lisle delivers a book that is full of fun and hilarity, and some food for thought as well as she takes a look at the institutions of heaven and hell and the world of humanity in between.As with most of Holly Lisle's writing, there's a good dollop of humor in this story, keeping it from becoming darkly serious and overdramatic. This allows the story to be thoughtful without becoming overly preachy. Our heroine Dayne is delightfully tough and intelligent, a strong adversary for the fallen angel Agonostis. And while most of the devils and demons remain more comical than outright darkly evil, and some even downright likable, the characterization feels appropriate to the tone of the story.Despite the humor, there are moments of true poignancy and epiphany that keep this story from being merely fluff. It's the reason I keep re-reading this book even though it's beginning to fall apart on me and I'll need a new copy soon. While the look at religion is not necessarily the traditional one (Holly Lisle plays fast and loose with some of the conventions) there are still profound messages that Ms. Lisle conveys about the essence of faith, the nature of good and evil, how Heaven can exist if there is a hell, and what does it truly mean to be a human being.One of my few complaints with this book is that while it offers a satisfying conclusion to the protagonist's story, it leaves an open ended teaser ending for the next story in this trilogy-and these books are a bit difficult to get a hold of. Readers who enjoy humor, fantasy and romance and don't mind a rather tongue in cheek look at the denizens of Heaven and Hell are encouraged to give this book a try. If you enjoy this one, the second book in the trilogy is THE DEVIL AND DAN COOLEY, and the third is HELL ON HIGH. And you may also want to check out GOOD OMENS by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett.Happy Reading! Shanshad ^_^"},{"Title":"Sympathy for the Devil","review":"This is a deceptively simple book; the basic story can be set up in a few sentences: in agony over her life as a nurse, the death of her husband and theological platitudes, Dayne Kuttner tempts God to give the damned of Hell a second chance--and he does, though not quite in the way she expected. What follows is an oftentimes funny helter-skelter ride of escaped demons and other assorted damned-souls loose in North Carolina. Of course, Lucifer (Puissant Lord of Evil, Utmost Originator of All Things Foul, Master of the Netherworlds, Purveyor of Anguish) sees the opportunity and grabs it: he sends his lieutenant Agonostis into the mess to tempt more mortals to their doom--and to seize Dayne herself for Hell.Lisle's rewritten the Bible and Christianity here. Don't expect every event or presumption of the book to follow rigorous doctrine. Instead, look for the mass of real-life medical and theological questions bubbling under the surface. She covers issues like euthanasia and the responsibility of medical practitioners to their (dying and nearly-dead) patients. But the philosophical meat is the theology: how can Heaven and Hell co-exist? Is this even morally possible if God is wholly good? What sends a person to Hell? Does anyone ever deserve to be there? And what exactly _are_ good and evil? How close together can they get?I'm making the book sound heavy, but on the surface you can view it as a light-hearted comedy. This level was enjoyable on the first read, but I found myself returning later to the questions couched between the lines and the allegory they create. If you're just after a good, fun read, go for it; but if you want more, you'll definitely find it. I haven't read anything quite like it before or since; I even created a new personal category for it, which is the title of this review."},{"Title":"Sympathy for the Devil","review":"Just pick up the book and read the first page. If you're not laughing out loud enough to embarrass yourself, then this is not the book for you.Doubting and disgusted, heroine Dayne challenges God to let the demons in Hell have a chance. Just like physics, for every action Hell's got an equal and opposite reaction. In this case, Satan sets demons loose in North Carolina to claim as many souls as they can including Dayne's.The story examines good and evil, heaven and hell, but with a light brush. \\"Sympathy\\" is both amusing and thought-provoking. IMHO, the best of Holly Lisle's work so far."},{"Title":"Sympathy for the Devil","review":"My title about sums it up. Although you always have a few of an author's rabid fans show up with 5's, to maintain that this book is a work of great literature that deserves the highest rating is just ... wrong.Holly Lisle has an interesting concept, and she pulls it off in solid, but not brilliant fashion. Once the main event comes off that sets up the story for the rest of the book, the events are pretty predictable. A LOT more could have been done with this plot idea.It has amusing moments, but its not the laugh riot some of these other reviews claim. I'm under the impression that this book was a relatively early effort for the author. She definitely improves in this series as it moves along.In fact, if I had the read to do over again, I would skip the first and second books of the series and go straight to book three, \\"Hell on High\\". It had a couple of problems, but is definitely the most engaging of the three books. Since the stories are only connected by the basic premise (minions of hell turned loose in NC by God), you don't really miss any important prerequisite information by doing so.In \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\", I kept feeling like she was pulling scene ideas from some of her favorite soap operas and filling in her story. To flesh out her primary plot device, I felt that deeper and more powerful plot elements were called for to truly bring this story to life. For a story about minions of hell living legitimately on Earth, I felt there should be some surprises in store, and I found none here.This effort wasn't bad enough to make me put the book down mid-read, but neither did it really draw me along with any fascination. I like a book to make me sad that I've hit the last page, in this case I was a bit relieved to get there."},{"Title":"Sympathy for the Devil","review":"Convinced her ex-husband is burning in hell, Dane asks God why he could allow such a thing and begs him to give the souls of the damned a second chance. God answers, and frees a number of souls into the world. They may do as they will, provided they do not harm anyone or coerce them into harming anyone. That, and they have to stay in North Carolina.If you go to Holly's website, you'll find that she was under a lot of duress while writing this. The anger and angst she went through shows here and makes for a wonderful examination of religion in general. It starts off very bitter, but becomes something greater. In the end, she does not hate God, but it seems she comes to terms with him.Sympathy for the Devil is funny, introspective, and even romantic. This is a hard book to find, but if you can get it I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Sympathy for the Devil","review":"I recently read the Hell books by Holly Lisle (or at least the first three). The books are concerned with the presence of the hellraised on Earth and the interplay between Heaven and Hell.In SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL a young woman who is convinced that her ex is in hell offers up a prayer to give everyone in Hell a second chance. The request is so pure that it must be answered. Since everyone in Hell already has a chance for redemption, Heaven sends residents from hell to North Carolina. These hellraised equal one percent of the population of the state. The woman is made a target for temptation while the rest of the state has to get used to its new residents.Overall a pretty good story and an interesting handling of Heven and Hell and they way they interact with the mortal world."},{"Title":"Sympathy for the Devil","review":"This is a deceptively simple book; the basic story can be set up in a few sentences: in agony over her life as a nurse, the death of her husband and theological platitudes, Dayne Kuttner tempts God to give the damned of Hell a second chance--and he does, though not quite in the way she expected.

I laughed at her views of the computer in not only our world, but in Hell (which is to say a little of Hell will be ever present though out the rest of our lives.) This book also shows in the difficulties of and choices we must make on the basis of our feelings. I think that Holly Lisle is one of today's greatest writers, and all of her books have brought the delight of fantasy into my small literary collection. Any person, who is a fan of fantasy and humor, would do well to read this novel, or any of her other fantastic books."},{"Title":"Sympathy for the Devil","review":"Holly Lisle's Sympathy For the Devil is great book focused on the inherent conflict and paradoxof a Heaven and hell existing simultaneously. The story is set in modern times reflected not onlyon Earth, but in Heaven and hell as Satan and God spend their days reading flow charts on incomingsouls and researching wishes on their computers. The action begins when nurse Dayne Kuttner makesa perfect ten wish; one of the truest sincerity and challenges God to give all of hell a second chance.Holly Lisle masterful intertwines comedy with seriousness and makes even the strangest possibilityseem completely normal. This is a simply wonderful book and great way to escape on a lazy Sundayafternoon. Also, for anyone enjoying this type of satirical &quot;fantasy&quot; then I would also recommendSimon Hawke's The Reluctant Sorcerer series."},{"Title":"Tops: Building and Experimenting With Spinning Toys","review":"I thought this Book was GREAT!!

Thank you Mr. Nisenson for this good piece of writing......."},{"Title":"'Round About Midnight: A Portrait of Miles Davis","review":"If you want the ultimate Miles biography, get the Jack Chambers one. This book, at 300 pages, is sketchy in comparison. It is almost criminally negligent about Miles' music of the 60's and 70's.What makes it worth reading, however, is Mr. Nisenson's personal memoirs. The preface is called &quot;Hangin' Out with Daffy Davis&quot;. In it, he tells how he went from idolizing Miles when he was a teenager to a situation where his phone would ring late at night and he would groan, &quot;Oh no, it's that damned Miles again!&quot; We've all heard that Miles wasn't a saint; this edition of Nisenson's portrait confirms it.Despite my earlier comments, Nisenson is an excellent author and &quot;'Round About Midnight&quot; is a very enjoyable read. So if you buy all good books on Miles or you'd like to hear something a little different about him, get it. (After you read it, by the way, think about the fact that this guy did not rate one mention in Miles' autobiography.) If you want only one Miles bio, however, it's got to be the Jack Chambers or the Ian Carr one."},{"Title":"'Round About Midnight: A Portrait of Miles Davis","review":"A truly engrossing book, full of classic stories and memories of recording sessions. A great primer for the new Miles fan. Check it out."},{"Title":"'Round About Midnight: A Portrait of Miles Davis","review":"This book is made awesome by the recollections by its author, Eric Nisenson. To read the excerpts from Nisenson's interactions with Miles gives the book a closeness that is only attainable by personal experiences. The reader is drawn to it, the riveting detail transforms the words into a vivid picture in which the reader sees him/herself in Miles' living- room, hearing that classical rasp of his. Definitely a must read for all those interested in Western music."},{"Title":"'Round About Midnight: A Portrait of Miles Davis","review":"I really enjoyed this book, and tore through it as fast as I could while still reading it carefully. Author Eric Nisenson is to be commended for the insights he provides into the career and character of Miles Davis. Nisenson covers his entire career and life, from birth to death, even though many periods are summed up too quickly, and I was often left wanting more detail.That said, if I had not read this &quot;updated edition&quot; of the book, I might not be so full of praise. Nisenson's original version of this biography was released in 1982, and this updated version came out in 1996. Nisenson adds a Preface, and a few chapters to the end of the book. These additions are, to me, the heart of the book. As I said, Nisenson does a fine job covering Miles's career in the body of the book, and the author appears to have a greater understanding of the character and true essence of Miles Davis than anyone else that I've read. This is definitely the story of Miles Davis through the lens of the author's experience, and Nisenson knew Davis personally and understands him well. However, it was the new material that provided the greatest insights for me.First, in the new Preface, Nisenson writes about the time that he knew Miles Davis, when Miles was in &quot;retirement,&quot; and when they were working on this book together (Miles pulled out of the project later because publishers insisted that he help publicize the book, and he was not interested in doing so at the time.). These glimpses into Miles's personal life and character are revealing. Most startling to me was the revelation that Miles Davis had, in Nisenson's words, &quot;beaten and abused women throughout his life.&quot; Nisenson laments the fact that, despite the fact that Miles &quot;brutally abused women&quot; was &quot;well known throughout the jazz community,&quot; few, if any, jazz critics or biographers, have seen fit to mention it. I give Nisenson a lot of credit for taking himself to task for not addressing the issue in his original edition of &quot;'Round About Midnight.&quot; He writes:&quot;But now, after ther O.J. Simpson affair, I really think it is time to view such activity for what it is--sick and evil. I guess when I wrote this book I still thought of Miles as a friend, but there is really no excuse. It amazes me how people like Miles can scream about the evils of racism--rightly so--and then continually abuse women. What utter hypocrisy.&quot;Bravo, Mr. Nisenson. It does not serve anyone well to deify this musical genius without remembering the &quot;sick and evil&quot; parts of his character.Nisenson also adds a couple of chapters to the end of the book. These were extremely revealing to me. In the chapter called &quot;Phoenix,&quot; Nisenson provides great insight into the post-&quot;retirement&quot; phase of Miles's career, the utter absurdity and banality of which has always perplexed me. The final chapter, before a useful abridged discography, addresses the question &quot;who was Miles Davis&quot; and debunks and deconstructs the oft-repeated myth that he &quot;changed music four or five times.&quot;The reason for the lack of a fifth star in my rating is due to a two flaws in the book: One, it lacks detail too much of the time and sums things up to quickly. This book should be about twice as long as it is. And two, there are some mistakes in the not-detailed-enough documentation of Miles's recording sessions.Despite these flaws, I strongly recommend the purchase of this book."},{"Title":"'Round About Midnight: A Portrait of Miles Davis","review":"MILES, ONE OF THE MOST POTENT TRUMPETS TO COME OFF 52ND STREET.

The editor has compiled an amazing assemblage of material, with the most creative and literate approach to erotica writing you'll find anywhere. The concept of using geographical locations as a theme works wonderfully well and there are some real surprises to be found here, particularly in the closing story, which is a travel tale of a VERY different nature.

That's one possibility, but it only addresses one issue: the editing. Unfortunately, it was the nature of many of the stories themselves that I found off-putting, because of the heavy handed handling of the subject matter. Eros is a state of mind and as such it takes many forms, but an over reliance on descriptively graphic details of \\"orifice plugging\\" is not, in my opinion, erotic; that's about as sexually stimulating as pulling weeds.\\"Mitsuko\\", however, is solid gold."},{"Title":"Erotic Travel Tales","review":"Author and editor Mitzi Szereto has corralled together an astute group of writers, both novice and experienced, for this sensuous odyssey of erotic adventures and mishaps.

His encounter there with the realist movement led to the first three truly realistic (defined as against the prevailing moralism and/or melodrama of Victorian fiction) novels in English literature proper: A Modern Lover, A Mummer's Wife and Esther Waters.Of the three, Esther Waters is the most fully developed and it is certainly the most engaging for a modern reader. In it, a woman has a child out of wedlock, and not only survives (through a variety of trials that are dispassionately but unflinchingly depicted) but in a manner of speaking prospers (Compare this for example with Elizabeth Gaskell's *Ruth*, written some 40+ years earlier).A great read.

Nearly all teachers get little or no education in what popular culture is all about, but yet popular culture has a powerful influence on shaping the self-images, values, and ideas young people have about themselves, their peers, and the larger society.The authors of this work start from the premise that &quot;The ability to read and critique popular media is significant for at least two reasons. First, in an age of expanding consumerism, children and young people who learn to question how their identities are constructed by the various forms of popular culture that they elect to take up are likely to make more informed decisions about how they live their lives. Second, the abundance of media messages (both image based and verbal) in the home and community suggests that there is an urgent need to help students learn how to evaluate such messages for their social, economic, and aesthetic contents.&quot; These authors go on to tell about the ways they approached or observed the teaching or use of popular culture in the classroom. Topics such as the differences between the Backstreet Boys and Puff Daddy, the Spice Girls, self-identity and images of young women in popular texts, and the various approaches to the pedagogy of popular culture are explored. The authors offer no cookbook strategies to take to the classroom, but they do provide a framework for teachers interested in introducing popular culture in their classroom.Finally, I would like to say it's significant that this work is published by the International Reading Association, for &quot;reading&quot; popular culture is very much a part of how young people read their world. For far too long adults have assumed that the adult world is the only world to read and understand. In this approach, we have allowed the media and popular culture to educate our youth, while we assumed that the &quot;adult,&quot; canonized world of school could have a greater impact. Well, it's not. We need to come to grips with that. We can use popular culture to help young people understand and become critically aware, as the authors explain, of how the social, political, and economic messages emanate from different forms of popular culture.I highly recommend this work to my fellow teachers."},{"Title":"Popular Culture in the Classroom: Teaching and Researching Critical Media Literacy (IRA's Literacy Studies Series)","review":"I have used this text as basic reading for pre-service and in-service teacher seminars that focus on issues of popular culture in education.

My son was literally failing to learn to read, almost living in the principals office, and struggling socially. His reading is now at or above grade level (with some remaining phonemic challenges). Four weeks ago, he started at a public charter school where he is no longer labeled as being &quot;bad&quot; for his &quot;ADD&quot; behaviors. And socially he will be part of a structured program to teach him appropriate behaviors. This book not only explains the challenges that interfere with these children's abilities in all areas of their lives but gives solutions. Solutions that schools and parents can implement for success. My son is living proof of how important this information is to changing the direction of a child's life."},{"Title":"Rethinking Attention Deficit Disorders","review":"This book examines the many systems that come into play in the mind, and attempts to analyze how they interact. It goes way beyond a child's inability to pay attention in class or sit in a seat.For example, the authors discuss the question of motivation -- a big one for kids who are often blamed for not trying hard enough. They cite the importance of meaning to motivation, and point out that external motivators, such as tokens and teacher exhortations, are not likely to be effective with the child because they have little real personal meaning for the child.As I read this book, I often think that at last I am reading descriptions of ADD that match the complexity of what I actually see in my child.The book seems intended for professionals rather than parents. It is pretty technical in its discussions of the brain, neurotransmitters, etc., and cites a lot of studies. It is not light or quick reading.On the other hand, if you're tired of reading the same simple descriptions of ADHD, with a prescription for a token and reward system, you might welcome the depth of this book. It doesn't soove your problems, but it helps you gain a deeper understanding."},{"Title":"Winter Thunder: Retold Tales","review":"Compiled and edited by Anne Dunn, Winter Thunder: Retold Tales is a compendium of forty imaginative tales drawn from the Anishinabeg oral tradition.

Since that time I have read whatever I can find of his--the most recent being \\"Sweet Cork of Thee\\". It is basically a travelogue style of writing wherein Gibbings describes his experienceswhile going about in County Cork, Ireland, his birthplace. Many of his pen and inksketches accompany geographic locales. But far more interesting are his descriptions of various people he meets as he travels. His writing is very lyrical--almost poetic at times. Each page has at least one smile and the whole book leaves a lovely feeling about what kind a person Gibbings was. Perhaps a quote from the final page serves best, a poem:\\"Here's health and life to you,The man or woman of your choice to you,Land without rent to you,And death in Ireland.\\""},{"Title":"Chimp Math: Learning about Time from a Baby Chimpanzee","review":"Chimp Math is a story of a baby chimp who was born at the zoo and his mother would not take care of him.

The authors didnot jump to conclusions for the sake of links to famous people or events. I found this to be a great guide for the novice researcher because it emphisises caution on assumptions. Tells you straight out if there wasn't enough proof for them to be positive but listed the information in case proof comes later It is easy to read and follow though the many generations. There are enough interesting tales, writings, wills etc to cause you to forget your original purpose and to begin to read as if it were a history book. Which may or maynot be a good thing.The problem I see as the owner of both books Volumn 1 and 2 is that the index is in the 2nd book and you seem to be offering only the 1st book and this will leave researchers lost who don't know who is in which geneation, exact dates of birth, locations and which given name applies to your relative (some of which are repeated by every sibling in the family when naming their own children and on and on for generations). I suggest you make the 2nd book available to your customers too. It contains wills, property titles, lots of later date relatives witness to legal events and much more. The 2 books are of equal value to a genealogy researcher."},{"Title":"The Fruits of Atterley","review":"The Fruits of Atterley is the story of two childhood companions raised together on a rice plantation in South Carolina. Gus is the son of Zachary Riley, the owner of Atterley plantation and his wife Rebecca, a founding member of The All Saints Ladies Benevolence Society.Promise is the personal slave of Gus. The daughter of Abraham, Atterley's African born blacksmith and Cora a former New Orleans prostitute.Promise is educated and given the finest of everything by Rebecca. Promise longs to be just like her mistress. She feels that she isn't like the other slaves. She doesn't have to work hard like the rest of he slaves.Promise and Gus share a close childhood friendship. When Gus is sent to a Military Academy their friendship is reduced to letters and the lavish gifts Gus sends to her. When Gus returns home the family tries to push him and his cousin Georgeanna together. Gus realizes he is in love with Promise and when their relationship turns from friends to lovers their lives are forever changed and complicated by racism, the master slave relationship and a series of horrific events that force Promise to realize she isn't any different than the rest of the Atterley slaves. This book is deeply rooted with the roles of southern society, political tension and slavery. I enjoyed this bittersweet novel rich in character and very well defined. A vivid walk back in time that cracks the heart. I highly recommend this novel. A remarkable story. A historical novel of importance.Reviewed byDawnny2005"},{"Title":"The Fruits of Atterley","review":"Angela Banks has done an awesome job portraying the Master and Slave relationship from infancy to adulthood. This is a love story also where the fact that racism is taught and not a born attribute is clearly displayed. Some of your characteristics and decisions you make are due to your upbringing. Promise and Gus are bestfriends, have a brother/sister relationship, and are raised together. Promise has so much to offer Gus and is a survival guide for him, as they grow up, she is still an essential asset to him, but unfortunately because of the environment and historical time, there relationship cannot remain the same and this is where the boundaries are crossed and the differences are clearly identifiable. There are some hard lessons learned for each character of this story and even Masters don't always have things there ways. Georgeanna is the product of the superficial, racist, spoiled, inherited riches. She is the one character in this story that I wish I could transform into character and jump into the pages and give her something that her great grandchildren would remember. This story also shows how back in time, Incest was tolerated amongst people. So many people also didn't know the truth even if they could read, because they had interpreted even scriptures incorrectly to support their way of living. This is not another roots or queen story, this depicts a different side to slavery and the emancipation. I really like the way Angela Banks brought these characters to life and this is a book that I would love to see made into a movie, but it will need to be a movie that is based solely on the book. Very well written and I look forward to reading more from Angela Banks in the future."},{"Title":"The Fruits of Atterley","review":"I really enjoyed this book, it has romance but it is far from a romance novel. (as a man, these are generally not my favorite...) The central theme to this novel is the interaction between slaves and slaveholders just before the Civil War. It was a rough time in American history and bad choices were made by good people. Each side is portrayed in a fair light, and there are no caricatures. The characters and their relationships develop naturally and I really began to care for them. I am anxious to find out what happens to Gus and Promise in a sequel...."},{"Title":"The Fruits of Atterley","review":"Angela Banks novel The Fruits of Atterley, portrays the perils of slavery and how it affected a family. The Rileys owners of Atterley Plantations are predominate political and social figures in their community, however when the love their son has for one of the slaves is exposed, it set off events that could ruin their lifestyle and reputation.. This author gives us a portrayal of slavery that you often do not get from history books. Even though the characters used in this novel are fictional, she uses past history and actual letters pertained from the historical societies to bring these characters to life. This novel raises questions and makes you think about how these characters especially slaves lived through those trying times of slavery.Review by Jen MurphySistaGirl Book Club"},{"Title":"The Fruits of Atterley","review":"The Fruits of Atterley transports the reader back to the Civil War era and examines the complex interrelationships of the slaves and slave-owning families who reside at the fictional South Carolina rice plantation, Atterley. The novel depicts the social attitudes of the day and cleverly incorporates historical facts, philosophies, and personalities through the adventures of the main characters.The novel begins with the birth of Augustus (Gus), future heir of Atterley, and Promise (a mulatto slave) and follows them through to adulthood. Gus's father, Zachary Riley, has political ambitions through his dealings with the powerbrokers of yesteryear. We are exposed to some of the more popular viewpoints and rational used by land owners and statesmen to justify South Carolina's succession from the Union and their stand for slavery. Gus's mother (Rebecca) is a genteel Southern Belle who sympathizes with her slaves until the \\"unthinkable\\" happens. Gus and Promise grow from childhood playmates to adult lovers only to have their passion doused by the harshness of reality. A terrible scandal ensues, the Civil War erupts, and Atterley and its descendents, like the fruits of its orchards, are left bitter, bland, and mealy.If you're familiar with novels of this type, the passages on the horrors of slavery will seem familiar because the author thoroughly intermingles the injustices and ugliness of human servitude in the stories of surrounding characters \\" endless back-breaking labor, the beatings, the rapes, the family separation, attempts toward freedom, wrath of the master's wives upon female slave competition, etc. However, one unexpected and somewhat refreshing aspect of this novel is the liberties that Promise and Hannah (another slave) take in their speech and behavior. Even though this is a work of fiction, it seemed as though they were a bit blatant and disrespectful (by yesterday's standards) at times in their actions toward their owners. Promise's educational level and her openly teaching other slave children to read also seemed a bit far fetched but easy to overlook. I would have liked to see other characters developed more but understood it to be a story of the South in a turbulent time and told through the lives of Gus (a white man) and Promise (a female slave).I enjoyed this book and look forward to reading its sequel.Reviewed by Phyllis"},{"Title":"The Fruits of Atterley","review":"Angela Banks did a great job of composing a story that entails the lives of a plantation slave and her relationship with her-playmate, master, and eventually lover. Fruits of Atterly describes the lives of the southern families all looking for freedom but in different aspects. While the story clearly deals with the hard truths of racism and brutality of slavery it is not so painful that it takes away from the compassion shown between Gus the son of the plantation owner and his friend and lover, Promise.This is a good book and especially a great selection for book clubs."},{"Title":"The Fruits of Atterley","review":"This book was full of symbolism, round, full characters, and great descriptive language. I was extremely impressed by Ms. Banks' ability to make every character and every event become real. I would definitely recommend this book for anyone who wants to think, feel, and also to discover things about themselves and others that they might never have known or thought of before."},{"Title":"The Fruits of Atterley","review":"The Fruits of Atterley is a very well written and well researched piece by a first-time author. It brings to life the turmoil and confusion of the times shortly before the Civil War, and the conflict between the inevitablity of Emanicaption and the desire of the southern planters to maintain life as they have always known it.The author shows that she has a way with the written word in the prose used to describe settings and daily goings-on at Atterley. The reader is literaly transported back to the plantation.Banks effectively recreates life on a South Carolina Low-Country plantation where the master is benevolent and kind-hearted, which is not typical, yet believable in her storytelling. It brings to mind the stories we've heard in recent years of Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemmings and countless other slave masters who have dared to allow themselves to feel human emotion and even love for those individuals who, by tradition, culture and politics, were otherwise destined to be treated as less than human.Banks transports the reader to the days shortly before the Civil War in South Carolina. You get a feel for the political manuverings and the deal-making that went on. The atmosphere is palpable with tension, both political and moral. The debate over slavery and succession is made real. Her characters are for the most part believable and sympathetic. One truly gets a feel for life at Atterley.However, the sense that the slaves were allowed to speak to their masters as equals and even demand certain priviledges from them, does not sit well with the general historical record. The slaves in Banks' book call their masters by their first names and have a level of familiarity that rings untrue. I'm sure that there may have been instances of that, but it rings as unbelievable given the historical record.The author is less successful in handling the flash-forwards to the new, present-day owners of Atterley. This is not well written and the story could have best been told without a reference to a modern day connection. It is a story best told from the perspective of history. And that is when it is most effective.On the whole, I enjoyed the book and it held my attention, especially the second half of the book...P>It is a worthy first effort for a promising writer."},{"Title":"Guide to Software Export: A Handbook for International Software Sales","review":"This book helped me organize, start, plan and get going an international software export program.

I read this book as a novice reader of LDS Church history, and I loved nearly every page. The life of Joseph Smith and the history of the church he restored include some of the greatest stories of all time. This detailed account of the Kirtland years does not disappoint in its research and inspiring narrative, leading the reader through the triumphs and trials of the saints in Ohio. Readers like Launius may ridicule the book's lack of objectivity, but the truth is that Joseph Smith really was called of God and that the church he restored really is true. This book contains many evidences of these truths, and I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Heavens Resound: A History of the Latter-Day Saints in Ohio, 1830-1838","review":"The book arrived just a day or two after I ordered it. It was a hardback in great condition. The price was very low, and it was just what I was hoping for. Thanks!"},{"Title":"The Heavens Resound: A History of the Latter-Day Saints in Ohio, 1830-1838","review":"This is the most detailed and probably the most significant--if only because it is the sole--general history of the Kirtland experience. Milton V. Backman Jr.'s, &quot;The Heavens Resound: A History of the Latter-day Saints in Ohio, 1830-1838&quot; was originally conceived as one of the sixteen volumes on Mormon history sponsored by the Latter-day Saint church in commemoration of its sesquicentennial in 1980. Unfortunately, this book is both exhaustive and exhausting. It provides an exceptionally rich base of detailed information about early Kirtland, the Mormon stronghold in Ohio. Backman is a meticulous researcher. No amount of effort was apparently too much to obtain the stray fact; no amount of checking of the documents and the context and the details of the episode was enough. Backman not only surveyed literary sources, but also reviewed census, tax, probate, legal, land ownership, and other government records. In the process he helped to construct a snapshot of Mormonism at Kirtland that had much more depth than ever before. The result is richly detailed if somewhat pedantic coverage of the Mormon church in Ohio between 1830 and 1838.But if Backman's research was voluminous and the facts piled into &quot;The Heavens Resound&quot; immense, they were also too often misleading. He concentrates on the sacred story of the Kirtland years, the religious activities of leading men--and they were all men that Backman emphasized--the revelations of the founding prophet, the doctrines espoused, and the spiritual manifestations taking place in the era. Backman's commitment to telling the sacred story is both honest and obtrusive. He sees the events in Kirtland only through the eyes of faith, explaining the point of view of the institutional church. Too often he acts as Joseph Smith Jr.'s defense attorney, arguing the case on behalf of the founder to revise revelations as he sees fit, to implement policy and doctrine flexibly, to deal harshly with both rivals and upright people holding honest differences of opinion, to create organization structures and make decisions in seemingly incongruous patterns. In that regard, Smith is depicted as being pursued by evil conspirators who brought &quot;vexatious lawsuits&quot; on a persecuted innocent. Backman never gives alternative positions equal time and neither Smith's motives nor his actions are ever challenged, and there is much room to do both when considering his activities.In a few instances Backman ignores facts that contradict the sacred story he is reconstructing for present-day Latter-day Saints. For example, in describing Smith's &quot;Civil War prophecy,&quot; he places it in its &quot;Nullification Crisis&quot; context and then announces its fulfillment in the Civil War three decades later. The implication for Backman, as it has been for so many other believing Latter-day Saints, is that Joseph Smith was a true prophet and that this revelation is firm proof. Backman fails to indicate, however, that the &quot;Civil War prophecy&quot; was given against the backdrop of Mormon millennialism and that its last section states that the predicted war will lead to the overthrow of the United States and the advent of a Zionic theocracy. Viewed in that context, the major point of the prophecy did not come to pass and refutes Backman's suggestions of Smith's prophetic leadership.I wish there were a better book available on the history of Mormonism in Ohio. Unfortunately, it will have to await a more diligent and skillful scholar."},{"Title":"Tales of Mendele the Book Peddler: \\"Fishke the Lame\\" and \\"Benjamin the Third\\" (Yiddish Classics Series)","review":"This work is certainly a &quot;must&quot; for anyone interested in Jewish fiction. &quot;Tales of Mendele, the Book Peddler&quot; is a rich source of information about a Jewish life all too often forgotten and neglected, life amongst the Jewish vagabonds, rascals, the poorest of the poor. Even within the scoundrel of society you may find the deepest human feelings and faith in the values rooted in Jewish tradionts, here represented by the character Fishke the Lame. What a lovely character! The message is clear: because the Jewish community isolated itself from the rest of the world, a stigma was created which contributed to a growing prejudice against that same community. &quot;The Brief Travels of Benjamin the Third&quot; is indeed brief! Althogh some critics rightly draw a parallel with &quot;Quijote and Sancho Panza,&quot; no doubts this novel falls short of Cervantes classic. The initial impetus of the work promises a great journey, but soon it dwindles and the reader is left with the impression the writer gave up and went about into other matters.

The street is in the heart of Jerusalem's bustling Jewish life. From its rooftops, one can see almost see across to the Temple Mount, the source of inspiration for Jews throughout the ages.This volume contains within it some a critical analysis of Jewish life in 19th and early 20th century Europe. Focusing on the down-and-outs of Jewery, Mendele portrays a hypocritical society and one that is much to blame for its misery. Fishke the Lame is a heart wrenching tale. Built as a story within a story, in a manner reminisant of Kabalistic thinking, the book lambasts everything from the poor to Jewish learning and practice. Benjamine the Third is light-hearted and humorous, but the underlying themes are the same - the foolish Jews of Europe living in their insular world.I wonder what Mendele would make of his namesake street?For one that seemingly saw little value in the traditional life of European Jewery, would he be pleased that all around there are Jews whose commitment to the Law is unshaken by the barrage of criticism launched by the enlightened Jews of his age?Despite its themes, this is a worthwhile volume for anyone who cares about the Jewish past and what it means for a jewish future."},{"Title":"Tales of Mendele the Book Peddler: \\"Fishke the Lame\\" and \\"Benjamin the Third\\" (Yiddish Classics Series)","review":"S.

Many writers could have made a bigger book out of half the adventure Starkell had. But this is a real trip, not an ego trip, and it's an epic one. Starkell is no poet, but he is brutally honest. He reveals himself to be difficult, stubborn, a bit of an angry jerk at times, but exactly the kind of person who could go beyond imagining an adventure of this size. Ditto for \\"Paddle to the Arctic\\", except he's a few years older, a bit more stubborn and angry and even more determined.

The author, fresh from a devastating divorce, started planning this epic father-and-sons canoe journey from Canada to Brazil. After some years of cooling off and preparation, amid the usual hail of well-deserved dire warnings such adventures generate, he actually pulled it off.From the cover blurb, I assumed I'd be reading another insipid, feel-good father-son story, and I was prepared to dislike it. Boy, was I wrong. Most of the text is pulled directly from Don's actual journals written during the trip, words he appears to have kept for himself and only later decided to share with the world.The tale is heart-wrenchingly frank about everything from the constant physical and emotional challenges to Don's personal doubts to occasional and agonizing strife with his sons. Rather than distracting, it richens his descriptions of the journey itself--filled with colorful notes about the terrain, animals, plants, and (especially) bugs along the way--and helps point the harsh light of reality on the adventure. Particularly delicious are his observations on the ever-changing nature of local human behavior along the 12,000 miles. Also, Don's references to tales of the long-ago explorers who visited parts of the journey's route have given me a wealth of new books to put on my reading list.By no means would I call this a feel-good book, though I finished it feeling inspired and delighted--and yes, good. Though an easy read, the book did no hand-holding through any of the journey's rough spots; the story is regularly gruesome, occasionally hair-raising, now and again embarrassing, but through it all jaw-dropping.

I just finished reading this magnificent true-life adventure of a father and son who traveled 12,000 miles in a canoe, from Canada to the Amazon, the longest journey by canoe ever. Short of giving a book report, I'll just say the story blew me away. Simply incredible. Upon finishing this marvelous epical and daring adventure, I placed the book back in my bookcase, where it now prominently sits as the trophy it is; a glorious triumph between two covers. Even now, as I type, I glance over and see it awaiting my return, calling out to me, reminding me of the glories and harrowing moments of courage within its pages. I will walk by this book everytime I leave my home office, and everytime I walk into it. I love seeing the book on my shelf, alongside all my other books.

Although Starkell and his boys DO have some quiet carefree times...the majority of this trip includes an astounding amount of obstacles that very very people would chose to endure. Numerous problems arise from the natural world...but the most frightening adventures are the frustrations and threats that the Starkells recieve from their fellow man.This is an amazing book and a must read for any canoe tripper. Also, anyone interested in true life adventure stories will surely not be disappointed. It's a gripping tale from start to finish. It's also a feat that will probably never be attempted again.The only big question I have after reading this book is..Why hasn't someone made this gem into a movie?

A father and son on a two year trip 12,000 mile canoe trip from the middle of Canada to the mouth of the Amazon. The writing is crisp and honest. The tale is amazing.

I was sorry it ended."},{"Title":"Paddle to the Amazon: The Ultimate 12,000-Mile Canoe Adventure","review":"This is the story of Don Starkell's incredible 12,000 mile canoe Trip from Canda to Brazil using various river systems and unfortunately a lot of dangerous coastline. A journey he started with his two sons, Dana and Jeff. Starkell says at the beginning of this book &quot;If I'd known we were going to make it, the challenge would not have been the same.&quot; We, as the readers, of course know that he does complete his voyage - but it is by no means either straight forward or easy and in fact it contains many twists of fate along the way. I was quite surprised at just how good this book is - not just the story of the trip, but the writing. It is quite matter of fact and Don spares few punches about either his own behaviour or that of his sons. It is told mostly through what seem to be edited diary entries, there are good number of maps - each chapter has its own small map which makes following their physical progress much simpler. A very worthwhile and adventuresome read."},{"Title":"Paddle to the Amazon: The Ultimate 12,000-Mile Canoe Adventure","review":"What a great adventure. It is the only book that I have read four times. If you like adventure, this is for you."},{"Title":"Paddle to the Amazon: The Ultimate 12,000-Mile Canoe Adventure","review":"This is an amazing account of courage and commitment to a long term goal. What I find remarkable about Starkell's style of writing is that he is very forthright about stating any errors of judgement he made during this expedition (as he also was in 'Paddle to the Arctic'). The man is obviously able to laugh at himself. Another interesting aspect of this book is how the father and son relationship is affected during the journey. My only complaints are related to the graphics, the text itself warrants 5 stars. These concerns are; a) there should be more photographs, b) there should be only 1 photograph to a page (especially with a paperback), c) the maps should be much more detailed. Any books by Starkell have alot of practical value to people who do backcountry travel."},{"Title":"Paddle to the Amazon: The Ultimate 12,000-Mile Canoe Adventure","review":"I started reading this book with high expectations based on the other reviews posted here and Don Starkell's reputation as an outstanding adventurer. I was disappointed in both the book and the author. In fact, many stretches of this book left me completely dumbfounded, unable to believe that this is not a comedy.For example, I thought it was a funny idea of Don Starkell to paddle into the center of the Colombian drug trade while displaying big US Coast Guard decals on his canoe. Even funnier was that he started wondering why that made people slightly suspicious and they subsequently intended to kill him. It was a bit repetitious, though. I guess after he unsuccessfully tried to get himself killed by paddling into Honduras and Nicaragua at a time of political unrest, he probably thought that this could be accomplished in Columbia.Completely immune to reason, this \\"world class paddler\\" obviously thinks that safety gear such as personal floatation is only for whimps and just keeps relying entirely on his luck to be rescued, e.g. after capsizing and being swept out to sea in a turbulent river mouth. Much to his surprise, the next river mouth is just as turbulent and he faces similar problems on the next, and the next, and the next...One particularly hilarious moment ensues when Don Starkell harasses a 20ft, 300 pound Anaconda for kicks, which he mistakenly believes to be a Boa Constrictor, falsely relying on the water-avoiding behaviour of the \\"Boa\\" for protection. Or, imagine Don Starkell's surprise after entering Brazil, where sometimes he was able to understand the Brazilians with the Spanish he learned along his trip, but more often than not, it appeared to him \\"as if they were speaking an entirely different language\\". I think he might still be trying to figure this one out...This list goes on and on - and in what appeared to me as a bad mixture of the \\"Three Stooges\\" and \\"National Lampoon\\" the Starkells clown their way down the coast and finally, against all odds make it to the mouth of the Amazon.On the downside, I thought that the way Don Starkell, a well-off Canadian, relied on mooching supplies and shelter from some of the poorest people in the countries they visit was just sickening. He proudly writes about his method of identifying a leader in a group of strangers and wooing him or her with golden Canada Maple Leaf pins to gain access to the supplies they need. He could as well have brought glass pearls. Don Starkell aptly named his canoe 'Orellana' after \\"the first white man to navigate the Amazon River in 1541\\". And quite often his behavior seems to be that of a modern-time Francisco Orellana, who gained a sorry reputation for raiding settlements along the river for supplies and burning down entire villages, including their inhabitants. I was left with the impression that most of the people the Starkells \\"visited\\" were rather happy when they were gone again.I was most interested in Mr. Starkell's motivation for performing this trip. He writes at the beginning of the book that he mainly did it to compensate feelings of insufficiency after a rough childhood and a painful divorce. As a consequence, his interest in this journey is mostly centered on gaining bragging rights. He doesn't actually seem to enjoy any of this trip, other than the four-month long stay in Veracruz, Mexico. His only drive to get up in the morning is mileage. Because of this, Starkell's saga is often not much more than the description of a \\"canoe treadmill\\" experience. It remains obscure to me why somebody would think that spending two years on such a lost quest for psychological completeness would be a sane idea. It probably did for him what a big truck or butt-implants did for many midlife-crisis shaken fellows, i.e. nothing. Therefore, the almost complete lack of reflections or attempts to find meaning in this journey came as no surprise.To add insult to injury, Starkell seems to regard his son's as mere paddling power - motors desperately needed by him to complete his insane task. As for the father/son dynamics in a small boat over two years: we can only guess about this complex and intricate topic, because the author doesn't really write anything about that, which is probably the greatest disappointment of the book."},{"Title":"Paddle to the Amazon: The Ultimate 12,000-Mile Canoe Adventure","review":"The majority of people who knew of this adventure from the beginning had a hard time believing it was possible.

Imagine paddling from Canada, down the Mississippi river and out into the ocean. And boy, when the Starkell's reach the Gulf of Mexico, the adventure gets even better! Their experiences were fascinating, harrowing and enviably exciting! I hated to reach the last page. This is one of those books that I plan to reread!* * * * * FIVE STARS!"},{"Title":"Paddle to the Amazon: The Ultimate 12,000-Mile Canoe Adventure","review":"Well, maybe you can but it would take someone with a great deal of imagination to do it.Having canoed the Florida Everglades, some of the Gulf of Mexico and some on the Great Lakes I like to consider myself a bit of an adventurer and (at least) a moderately good canoeist. However, Don Starkell's tale of adventure makes my experiences seem very trivial and insignificant. His canoe journey of over 12,000 miles, through some of the most intimidating environments on the planet, seems impossible.What a terrific story of triumph over virtually every type of adversity one can imagination. If you're an adventurer, nature lover or interested in how far the human spirit can take you this book is a \\"must read\\". The book is so good there is now interest in making a movie based on this adventure."},{"Title":"Paddle to the Amazon: The Ultimate 12,000-Mile Canoe Adventure","review":"Hard to imagine taking an adventure like this. The book is very well written and it keeps you intrigued the entire time."},{"Title":"Paddle to the Amazon: The Ultimate 12,000-Mile Canoe Adventure","review":"This is one of those books I read to the very last page and wanted to continue reading. It is undeniably one of the most audacious adventures ever undertaken. It's a good lesson in what's possible given the courage, drive and ambition (and wrecklessness). I think it's a good father and son story and I envy the adventure this father was able to give to his son. I appreciated that the author didn't spend a great deal of time on his life or his relationships. When \\"adventure\\" books stray into those areas I lose interest.Much of the book reads like a diary (and probably is as he wrote it on the trip). There aren't any great insights but there was enough depth to hold my interest. Like the actual trek there was always something new around each bend. There is ample description of the people, animals, foods and history along the way.

It has spiritual undertones and an essence of an important life lesson passed down time and again in a family. The illustrations are wonderful, (Pinkney's artwork is always great) and it is evocative of the island's mystery and danger. The two main characters' friendship is strong, bi-racial and surprise! The friend proving loyalty is the white man to the black man. This is a new one. It is the black man who has good fortune and is getting married! We need more examples like this in children's literature of mixed friendships, different ways to look at the world, new culture, strange new lands, and ties that bind people together rather than the tired old stereotypes. The students in my classroom loved this tale, because it was so fresh and new. As a teacher who is caucasian teaching in a predominantly black school, I look to Robert D. San Souci for interesting stories that appeal to the population I teach. The students always enjoy his stories such as The White Cat, etc. All are folktales with strong, interesting themes."},{"Title":"The Faithful Friend (Caldecott Honor Book)","review":"This book represents the length that a friend will go to help and care for a true friend. These two young men have built a very strong bond that holds them together like brothers. This story takes place on an island with many twists and turns that make it a very exciting story. I think it is very important to let children know that we should be loyal to others in time of need. This story really hits on the true meaning of friendship, although it is fiction. My students love the illustrations which are done in scratchboard. Robert D. San Souci is a very good author for folk literature. I also like his book, The Talking Eggs. His work is good for teaching good values, or morals to students through unreal happenings."},{"Title":"The Faithful Friend (Caldecott Honor Book)","review":"The Faithful Friend is a very noteworthy book. When I first opened the book the illustrations are the first thing that caught my eye. At first glance I felt the sharp scratchy lines almost looked messy and cluttered but as soon as I turned the page I knew I was wrong. From the beginning the story has a smooth flow to it. The author uses the first page to bring the reader up to speed on the two boys' relationship and that's all he needed. By the second page the reader can already see the personalities of the characters. I was unaware the story was a folk tale when I began reading. As I went on I could see certain characteristics of folk tales in the story, for instance, when they make the moral choice to bury a beggar, when the three zombies began to cast curses on them, and again when the evil uncle gets what he deserves for his wrong doing. The Faithful Friend shows friends with great character and true love for family. It draws the reader into the story and has them hoping for a happy ending. The writing is very descriptive and the illustrations have a movement to them that draws the reader right in to the where the boys are. Each page flows around the characters and the words and I found myself studying the pictures a little longer than normal taking in all the colors and movement. I really enjoyed this book and would definitely use it in my classroom library."},{"Title":"The Faithful Friend (Caldecott Honor Book)","review":"This was a fascinating folktale about friendship. I liked the fact that the story is based on a black and white friendship because it shows children to look past race and see a true friendship. Children will love the plot in the story and the characters journey's throughout the story made me want to read more and more. I really enjoyed all the illustrations as well as the story."},{"Title":"The Faithful Friend (Caldecott Honor Book)","review":"The faithful friend is an intriguing tale about friendship. Since the story is based on a white and black friendship, it shows children race doesn't matter, and loyalty is a important trait to have in a friendship. This book is particularly my favorite because friendship is something important in a person's life. The characters adventure makes you want to read on and has a plot that children will be fascinated in. Not only is the story unique, but the illustrations are just as good. I would definatly use this folktale in my classroom of elementary children!"},{"Title":"The Faithful Friend (Caldecott Honor Book)","review":"I read this book with no prior knowledge of the author or any of his other literary work. What first captured my attention were the two young men of color on the book cover. Second thing that captured more of my attention were the well done, scenic, and colorful illustrations by Brian Pinkney. Author Robert D. San Souci even added a glossary for the words that young readers of the English language may not be familiar with. For example, words such as Bon-Die, Bonjou, Monfi, and Monsieur.\\"The Faithful Friend\\" tells the heartfelt story of just that...a faithful friend. Clement (of Martinique in the Caribbean) and Hippolyte (of French descent) were friends, yet as close as brothers. They embark on a travel for Clement to propose marriage to a young woman that he fell in love with by sight of a picture only. Along the way they discovered the dead body of an old beggar in a banana grove. The good hearted young men provide a burial for the body and continued on their journey. After reaching their destination, all was well with the woman... but her Uncle did not care for a marriage between the two. The Uncle was also a wizard. He attempted to cast a spell on the young man who sought a wife, but the faithfulness of a friend caused none of the spells to work. On their journey home the friendship is demonstrated in more ways than one. The mystery that surrounds the spells and the faithfulness of the friend captures the readers attention. At one point I thought that I could predict the ending, but the author was too slick to let his readers be disappointed by having a predictable ending.Overall, this is one book that I will highly recommend to young readers because it is well done from beginning to end (story and illustration). It is like an old folks tale with a French & Caribbean flavor. It may also spark a young reader to want to learn a foreign language, which is a valuable skill to acquire.Review by:Pamela Jarmon-Wade"},{"Title":"The Faithful Friend (Caldecott Honor Book)","review":"Set on the French West Indies island of Martinique, this classic telling of two inseparable friends who would give their lives for each other, offers more than mere fairy tale. Clement and Hippolyte are as close or closer than brothers, even though they do not share the same race. They have been raised together since birth and cannot be parted. On a journey to find Clement's true love, they find and bury a homeless man, run from an enraged uncle, and dodge three curses cast upon them by a quimboiseur (a wizard).At first I wasn't sure I would like this tale, as I made my predictions while reading. I thought I had completely guessed the ending. \\"How predictable,\\" I surmised. \\"Too easy to figure out.\\" As I continued to flip the pages, my predictions began to unravel."},{"Title":"The Faithful Friend (Caldecott Honor Book)","review":"When author Robert San Souci isn't writing yet another version of the Cinderella story (this man has done everything from skeletons to Cajuns, I kid you not) he can be found writing the film script to the Disney film Mulan, adapting every folktale known to man, and collaborating with some of the best living children's illustrators out there today. He can probably tile his floor with his Coretta Scott King Awards at this point and that Caldecott Honor he acquired from \\"The Faithful Friend\\" probably doesn't look too shabby either. Of course, Mr. San Souci hasn't a degree in folktales nor has he ever worked in a professional capacity when studying them. My response? Capacity schmapacity. This guy does his research, knows his stuff, and produces some of the best darned picture book folktales out there today. If his backgrounds just in advertising and film reviewing, so be it. At least he has a healthy respect for the genre and a great ear for folktale text. \\"The Faithful Friend\\" is an excellent example of both.On an island in Martinique, two boys grew up on a sugar plantation. One boy was Clement, a brown-skinned boy who's father owned the estate. The other was Hippolyte, Clement's white companion and servant of the house. The boys grew up together and one day Clement told his friend that he'd fallen in love with Pauline, the niece of a man rumored to be a wizard. Hippolyte worries that there may be danger in going to visit her, but his friend won't be talked out of it. Together they travel along the coast road and, as they go, bury a poor beggar they find dead along the road. When at last the boys meet Pauline she's charmed by Clement but her uncle is not impressed. Though she swears to marry her new (some might say instant) love, the uncle vows to stop them at whatever the cost. Now Hippolyte must save his friend and insipient bride from zombies, poisoned fruit, nasty water, snakes, and that awful fate of turning to stone. Friendship has never been so good.In an Afterword of the book, San Souci gives a riveting account of the many variations of this tale and gives a mighty compelling explanation of why exactly he chose this particular version. Turns out that this story is a Martiniquan version with an alluring chance to incorporate ghosts and grateful dead (sans Jerry Garcia) to the mix. He makes several allusions to \\"The Types of the Folk-Tale\\" by Antti Arne, which lists every single folktale variant and gives each one a number. Hence, your average grateful deal/the dead man as helper tale is tale type 505 while the rescued princess/the grateful dead man story is more along the lines of tale type 506. I don't know about you but I'm now itching to get my hands on this \\"Type\\" book to find more stories that fit certain molds.When he chose to tell this tale of a black character and his white hero sidekick, San Souci switched the genre from the typical white-guy-and-his-magical-black-friend story found in every bad movie and book to something original and interesting. Race is not necessarily a factor in this book, allowing the viewer the chance to concentrate far more on the story than the politics. Because San Souci is throwing every folktale trick into the mix (from the ghostly to the ghoulish to the ghastly to the gorgeous) you might think that he's in danger of spreading himself too thin. Quite the opposite turns out to be the case. Though he draws from a variety of different sources, San Souci finds the perfect balance between the fabulous and the meaningful. This is a story about friendship, plain and simple. It just throws in a few zombies here and there for kicks.San Souci has paired with every conceivable illustrator in the past and in this particular case he has been put together with the very well-known Brian Pinkney. Personally, I much prefer Brian Pinkney's pictures to those of his father Jerry Pinkney. His pairing with San Souci has always been particularly inspired, and I consider their work on \\"Sukey and the Mermaid\\" to be an example of one of the best picture books available to kids today (and certainly the top mermaid picture book every made). In this picture book Pinkney engages in full-throttle no-holds-barred scratchboard and oil pictures. The result are lush full-color spreads that shed delicate pink/purple light from oil skies onto scratchboard faces or delicately swirl circular winds of power around hot orange mangoes in a zombie's hand. Speaking of the zombies, I don't know how San Souci pictured them when he wrote this story down, but Pinkney has made them somewhat hot. These are good-looking zombie women. An odd but interesting choice on the artist's part.You know, I don't usually like scratchboard picture books. When Mr. Pinkney wrote and illustrated, \\"The Adventures of Sparrowboy\\", I felt the technique was completely unnecessary. Seeing it in the context of this story, however, it not only works but compliments the story itself. All in all, \\"The Faithful Friend\\" is everything a good children's folktale should be. Creepy and lovely and with a good moral that is not moralistic. A jolly good read altogether."},{"Title":"The Faithful Friend (Caldecott Honor Book)","review":"The Faithful Friend is a French tale base in the Caribbean on the island of Martinique. Two inseparable friends, Clement and Hippolyte, are on a journey to propose marriage. After a beautiful woman named Pauline accepts Clement's proposal her uncle sets out to destroy them both. Three zombies have cast spells on the couple and it's up to Hippolyte to save them. The content seems to be appropriate for the ages indicated on the back of the book. However, there are some fairly complex words within the text, but a glossary has been provided at the beginning of the book. The Faithful Friend is definately written for young children, yet adults will enjoy the tale as well. Each illustration brings more meaning to the text. It uses bright, beautiful colors that words could never describe. They are also very accurate and consistent with the story. The artist uses a scratchboard technique throughout the entire book.

Reading this book was the first time I felt things really start to change for real.

It's an easy read, but at the same time it's not that empty pop-psychology stuff. She gives hundreds of practical methods to overcome your anxiety. I like the fact that her stance on medication is pretty much neutral because although I'm on medication now, I don't want to rely on it for the rest of my life. This book gives me hope for my future.

During those years of suffering I underwent treatment by psychiatrists, psychologists, and hypnotherapists. I took various prescribed medications and read many books such as this, but experienced little relief. And then, after I began taking a daily supplement of chelated magnesium for another seemingly-unrelated ailment, for the first time I began experiencing significant diminishment of anxiety. There seemed to be no explanation for this wonderful change until the publication in 2003 of the book The Miracle of Magnesium by Dr. Carolyn Dean. In her wonderful book Dr. Dean reveals that a major cause of anxiety and panic attacks is deficiency of magnesium and that magnesium deficiency is quite common in the U.S. Therefore, I beg all sufferers of anxiety, panic attacks, and agoraphobia to purchase and read The Miracle of Magnesium by Dr. Carolyn Dean and try the magnesium supplementation which she recommends.

The story engrossed me throughout, despite the unlikability of Major Reno, and I never found that, at any point, it became implausible. It's a very human story about a legend that has now grown out of control."},{"Title":"An Obituary for Major Reno","review":"This well researched historical novel gives an account of Major Marcus Reno, one of the commanding officers with Custer at Little Bighorn. The loss of Custer and the scale of the defeat led almost immediately to finger pointing, and Reno found himself to blame. The charges were unfair and unfounded. But the mixture of character flaws and weaknesses in an otherwise commendable officer led to his eventual discharge from the Cavalry. He spent the rest of his life trying to regain his lost honor.Wheeler takes on the task of providing a fair appraisal of the man, giving us a warts-and-all portrayal. A large section of the book is dedicated to the 7th Cavalry's search across the prairies of Montana for the Indian bands they were to encounter at the Little Bighorn. More is devoted to an account of the battle itself, from Reno's point of view. The second half of the book concerns his fall from grace, and it is sometimes a painful journey.There's a lot to put into this story of a complex and contradictory man. Wheeler keeps you turning pages, shaking your head sometimes at Reno's poor judgment, sympathetic with him at others for how fate and circumstances turn against him. You read to the end before finding some resolution for your mixed feelings. Wheeler's book belongs on the bookshelf of battles set at key points in history. It cuts through the myth while revealing how myths come to be."},{"Title":"An Obituary for Major Reno","review":"Marcus Reno ranks as one of the most interesting and tragic figures from the Little Big Horn campaign. His tale should be an interesting one. Richard Wheeler's novel on Reno does not take full advantage of a fascinating subject and that is what proves frustrating about this book. Wheeler sets the stage well. The first few chapters where a reporter interacts with a dying Reno are excellent. Once the novel turns to the Little Big Horn campaign, the book seems rushed. The familiar events of the campaign are replayed but, to be quite frank, the drama seems lacking. The urgency of Reno's desperate fight can not be found in Wheeler's book. Even the terror of Reno being splattered with the blown brains, blood and skull fragments of one of the chief scouts of the 7th cavalry is neatly put in a sentence or two. The endless array of courtmartials and Reno's downfall also seems rushed. Wheeler certainly has strengths as a writer and these include his solid use of secondary characters, preserving their historic integrity while still offering them important roles in the book. He does an excellent job with Godfrey, Benteen and General Terry. The Custers hover in the background and it would have been interesting to see Wheeler give them a greater role. Based on his use of Terry and Benteen, I suspect Wheeler would have done a fine job with George and Libby. But Reno himself, at least as Wheeler presents him, is not the type of character that a novel should be based around. At the start and end of the novel, Wheeler, through Reno and later in his brother in law, maintains that the early death of Reno's first wife explains much of his character. The problem is Wheeler tells his readers this and does not show them. This is a book that frankly could have used a few more chapters to flesh out Reno and the events that led to his tragedy."},{"Title":"The Bad Back Book","review":"This book is a must have for anyone suffering back pain.

Unfortunately, he did not understand the mechanics of the back and I got better in spite of his treatment. I later got good advice from a diagnostic orthopedic doctor, who did understand the mechanics of the back and instructed me on how to deal with it. A friend gave me a copy of this book and I was a total skeptic before reading it and trying the exercises. It works and I have given fifteen copies to others over the years. At age 72, it has helped me live the normal life I never expected. Thank you Jerry Wayne."},{"Title":"The Bad Back Book","review":"In adolescence, I experienced a pars defect at L4, which led in early adulthood to a spondylolisthesis with excruciating pain in my back, radiating into my buttocks and one leg. Fortunately, by this time I had been on the staff for several years of Rancho Los Amigos Hospital in Downey California a major rehabilitation teaching hospital, and part of the University of Southern California School of Medicine. This is significant, because the first \\"problem back pain\\" treatment unit was established by Vert Mooney, M.D. at Rancho in the early 1970s. He has recently been awarded the Wiltse Lifetime Achievement Award by the International Society for the Study of the Lumbar Spine. This is significant because he and other orthopedic surgeons at the hospital were real medical scientists and objectively studied the results of available back surgery techniques, usually reporting a mixed bag of outcomes. When I hurt my back, I asked for some guidance and one of these physicians recommended Jerry Wayne's book, soon after it came out in 1983. I used it successfully myself and then began to recommend it to my own patients who were participating in \\"work hardening\\", a program that I developed at Rancho in the mid-1970s. Over the years, I have purchased and given away more than a dozen of these books, generally hearing back that the story was engaging and believable and the exercises were useful. Later in my career, I spent 10 years on the editorial board of the journal Spine and had the opportunity to peer review dozens of papers addressing symptom control and rehabilitation after low back injury. I've also had several of my own papers published in this and other scientific journals. The bottom line is that surgery should be avoided until the possible benefits of exercise have been exhausted. The only two scientifically supported approaches to exercise for the relief of low back pain of which I'm aware are the \\"work conditioning\\" approach developed by Tom Mayer and his colleagues at PRIDE, and the \\"mechanical low back pain\\" approach developed by Robin McKenzie of New Zealand. Although the approach described by Jerry Wayne in this book has not been scientifically studied, it is consistent with the philosophies of these other approaches and, at least on an anecdotal basis from reasonably sophisticated readers, quite effective. Until the United States gets away from the \\"piece rate\\" approach to medical care, many orthopedic specialist physicians and physical medicine and rehabilitation physicians are not going to take the time or effort to educate their patients (for which they do not get paid), but will either cut or inject as their primary solution to problem spinal pain. Jerry Wayne's book provides another alternative that, in my opinion, is worth considering."},{"Title":"The Bad Back Book","review":"When I was sentenced, years ago, to two weeks bed rest for sciatica lower back pain, a neighbor lent me the book.

I had done the same thing with my older son with no problem, but on this day I felt something pop, and over the course of the next few hours I developed excruciating back pain. For years after that I had back spasms, sometimes as often as once a month. Various doctors told me that the underlying problem was weak back muscles, or disks that had lost their elasticity, or stenosis of the spinal canal. Physical therapy helped somewhat with the acute pain, but it usually took me two days or so before I could even make it the car to drive to the physical therapy office. And moderate pain could persist for weeks. Several years after the initial episode I came across The Bad Back Book in a used book shop. On impulse I bought it, read it, and began using the exercises. I was very skeptical at first, but the exercises were simple and did not take up much time or energy, so for some reason I kept doing them. After two months without a back spasm I was convinced. Gradually I began to test my new-found freedom with sports and other activities that had been banned from my life. For more than ten years I've been doing these exercises almost without fail in the morning, and then I do whatever I want or need to do for the rest of the day.

I suffer from occasional low-back pain, and whenever I start to feel it I perform only the first 3 exercises to get back into shape. It is remarkable and I have given the book to several my friends and family members that also suffer from back pain.

One weekend I stayed up from 9:00pm to 1:00am finishing the book. I absolutely could not put the book down. The book had so much action and excitement. That is what I look for in a book.Felicia, the protagonist, is tall, slender, brown eyes, and long brown hair. Her personality traits are nice, caring, helpful, concerned, generous and courageous. She showed she was helpful by helping out at the Burger Basket. She showed she was courageous when the Burger Basket started on fire and people were still trapped inside the building. She went inside and cleared the fire with her telekinetic powers. She has a couple of strengths and weaknesses. Her strengths are that she has telekinetic powers. Her weaknesses are that she cannot control them. They just go off when ever they feel like it. An example is when she was in school, she felt the powers swell inside of her, then they just burst out and a row of lockers began to tremble and books began to slam against the lockers.Felicia seems like a nice girl.

However, everyone knew she had these powers and that her two best friends were dead as a door nail because of them. Rather than staying where she was, Felicia ran away from her family and friends to a small town called Shadeyside. There she meet two new wonderful friends. Their names were Zan and Nick. They got her a job cooking hamburgers at a local resturant, and seemed pretty nice. Zan Nick and Felicia stayed friends for quite a long time. One day, Felicia, overheard two boys talking about how they can't watch a man's cat while he was on a vacation anymore. She needed the money and a place to sleep at night, so she asked them if she could watch the cat. They said sure,why not. The next day at work, Zan told her to change the light bulb in the storage room. When she got there, the room was flooded with water like an indoor pool. When she took the light bulb out of it's socket, it started a fire. No one was hurt and everyone got out safly.

With mom away on a Saturday, that's exactly what Kevin gets to do. First, he and his dad clean the house together, and then it's time for some baseball and even a movie. Told in Kevin's words, this lovely picture book evokes the excitement, pride, pleasure and love a boy can experience with a father who includes him in both the work and play of a weekend day.\\"-- Excerpted from synopsis --With Father's Day looming on the horizon, I'm sure plenty of folks arestarting to think about buying a meaningful gift for the man in their life. Well, any dad with a young son would undoubtedly appreciate this timeless classic, first published a decade ago, by Irene Smalls, the award-winning author of 15 children's books and 3 interactive storytelling CDs designed with African-American youngsters in mind.Over the years, Kevin and His Dad has proven to be increasingly invaluable given the unfortunate statistics on the state of the black family. For this reason, I heartily recommend this socially-relevant book which nourishes the notion of black boys bonding with their fathers. Neither sensational nor fanciful in tone, it rather relates a simple day-in-the-life of a father and son content just to be in each other's company.Delightfully-illustrated by Michael Hays, the matter-of-fact narrative unfolds in a way which suggests that Kevin takes all the pleasure in the world in such seemingly-mundane experiences as doing household chores, playing catch, or going to see a movie, at least when he's next to his dad. Credit must go to the insightful author for subtly driving home such a salient point, for besides simply having a natural way with words, she's a cultural historian with degrees from Cornell and NYU on her impressive resume'.Ever so subtly, she weaves a richness right into the fabric of her carefully-crafted tale which reflects a deep understanding of how to touch on the African-American condition in an understated fashion while simultaneously exploring a very universal theme to which people of any ethnicity can readily relate. Ms. Smalls has dedicated Kevin and His Dad to the source of her inspiration, namely, her nephew Kevin who was adopted by his altruistic Aunt Irene at the age of 7. I couldn't think of a better Father's Day gift than this truly touching tome.[...]"},{"Title":"Smoked Beers: History, Brewing Techniques, Recipes (Classic Beer Style)","review":"Unlike most of the books of the \\"Classic Beer Styles\\" series, Daniels and Larson don't go into the details of how to brew beer. This is fortunate because there are a myriad of other books that cover that topic and the actual brewing process isn't different from most beers. Instead, they cover in depth what imparts these flavors into beer - the malt. They also detail a history of smoke in beers and introduce an intriguing concept; many beers at one time tasted of smoke because of methods used to dry the malt. Today it is definitely a specialty but from Alaska to Germany to Japan, I was surprised to find out how many different types of smoked beers are produced. I was also surprised to find out how relatively simple it is to do it for yourself.Like in his previous works, Daniels consistently cites sources so you know you are reading fact, not fiction. Larsen's experiences both at his brewery and while traveling demonstrate his passion for his subject. This has translated into a book the truly captures all aspects of smoked beers in a very entertaining package.

In the modern home of smoked beers -- Bamberg, Germany -- we found pilseners and weizens with a hint of smoke along with marzens and bocks with enough smoke to cure a sausage! In addition to detailing the many smoked specialty beers of Germany, we also cover the vast range of smoked beers now made in America.Whatever your taste for smoke, we've written this book so that you can make a beer that perfectly satisfies your mood. Along the way, we review subjects like the history of smoke in beer and the chemistry of fire and smoke. In the end though, it comes down to practical realities: simple smoking methods for malt and recipes for all levels of brewers who want to make great smoked beers -- from either home- or commercially-smoked malts.Whether you are a casual brewer with a taste for smoke or just a casual beer traveler looking for new flavors to explore, &quot;Smoked Beers&quot; will add new entries to your beer diary."},{"Title":"Smoked Beers: History, Brewing Techniques, Recipes (Classic Beer Style)","review":"Cool book.

Out of all of the brewing books, this one is unique, as it deals with a character added to the malt, and not necessarily the malt type or yeast. Definitely a good read, and should serve as a standard for which the other brewing books should try and live up to."},{"Title":"Contextual Design : A Customer-Centered Approach to Systems Designs (Interactive Technologies)","review":"I've been searching all over for good guides to the *process* of human-centered design as opposed to the techniques for good UI: This book is excellent on two counts1.

The lack of competition, but this doesn't distract from the quality of the book.There are lots of books on how to do UI, but they all concentrate upon the widgets. This is the only one I have seen that really tells you how to go out and collect customer data, and then, what to do about it.

The authors do a good job of starting at a higher level, then going into more detail in following chapters. You need this detail before you go on to the next section. This is not a theoretical book; the authors have been using these techniques for years to design real, complex products. It resonates well with my experiences in software user interface design.If you design products intended to be used by humans, you NEED this book.

Dorothy Bass's book has been a revelation to me--she shows me that I can inhabit time differently, more graciously. There is so much practical wisdom in this book. I have been particularly helped by thinking about my days, weeks, months and years not as made up of blocks on the calendar, but as part of the rhythms of work and rest, feast days and ordinary days. I've been trying to follow some of Bass's suggestions for giving shape to each week, by observing a sabbath day of rest. I am finding out two things: that by preparing for a sabbath day I am more productive on my work days and that on the day of rest, time seems to open up, get larger somehow. Bass draws on the best wisdom religious traditions (Christianity primarily, but also Judaism) have to offer about how to give shape to our days and offers it to the reader in a form and a language that resonates with busy, contemporary people. I am so grateful for this book."},{"Title":"Receiving the Day: Christian Practices for Opening the Gift of Time (The Practices of Faith Series)","review":"The most striking point made in this book, from my perspective, was the notion that the Jewish concept of day from sundown to sundown reflected the creation story of Genesis in the sense that first God acts, later people are drawn into the equation. If insights such as that excite you, you will enjoy this book.The book is written in a very personal style - how Dorothy C. Bass has come to see and use time. This results occassionally in some reader disconnects e.g. her assumption that a church could not refrain from Christmas carols during Advent - I come from a church that does not use Christmas carols until the Christmas vigil. But these &quot;disconnects&quot; also are a strength for the book - she is not giving you a list of how-to's, but rather inviting you to reevaluate time in your life ... with a recognition that that will have similarities and differences from what it means in her life.This book is recommended for everyone - and especially needed by individuals planning liturgical season."},{"Title":"Receiving the Day: Christian Practices for Opening the Gift of Time (The Practices of Faith Series)","review":"Bass doesn't preach at us from on high, but rather bears witness to her own struggles to keep sabbath and receive time as a blessing and gift instead of as a problem or enemy. Bass describes how \\"receiving the day\\" can become a way-of-life practice, and she relates this activity to other core practices that give life character and integrity (see &quot;Practicing Our Faith: A Way of Life for a Searching People,&quot; which Bass edited.) Bass grounds her analysis of time in contemporary research from a social scientific perspective, such as A.R. Hochschild's &quot;The Time Bind&quot; and R. Levine's &quot;A Geography of Time.&quot; Bass's deeper grounding, however, is in the practical wisdom of the Jewish and Christian traditions for living faithfully in the rhythms of days, weeks, and years. Drawing on the biblical story of the creation of time (Genesis 1), Bass invites us to consider what difference it would make in our lives if we viewed dusk instead of dawn as the beginning of each new day. Observing how digital clocks now synchronize our global economy, Bass notes with irony how Benedictine monks invented the clock to call the community to prayer at set hours during the course of the day. The challenge for us today is not to \\"turn back the clock,\\" of course, but to learn how to live freely and humanly within a 24x7 society. I enthusiastically recommend &quot;Receiving the Day&quot; to anyone who cares to ponder how we dwell together as creatures within time. This book prompted deep personal reflection about the ways I spend my time, and it also inspired the design of a playful worship service for our congregation's annual Family Camp. A great book for adult study groups and sermon ideas.

This deeply spiritual book is sure to change the way you view your life, your creator and the world we share."},{"Title":"Receiving the Day: Christian Practices for Opening the Gift of Time (The Practices of Faith Series)","review":"As an avid reader, I find that an increasing number of the books I read simply re-hash old, familiar ideas. I read this book in preparation for a Church retreat, and was expecting a typical, look-at-your-priorities to prioritize-your-activites type of book - time management with a spiritual slant. What I found was much deeper than that.The book proposes a fundamental shift in our psychology of approaching time; changing our entire attitude to one of gratitude, reverence, an attunement to natural (divine) rhythms. But don't think it's all abstract philosophy - the book is every bit as practical as it is philosophical. I don't know that I'd go as far as to call it life-changing... But it's definitely nudging me in a whole new mental direction.Highly recommended for the (like me) hassled and harried."},{"Title":"Receiving the Day: Christian Practices for Opening the Gift of Time (The Practices of Faith Series)","review":"Without a doubt, this little book is one of the most helpful spiritual books of the new century.

Bass in this book about the meaning of a day and the potential in each day. It is a book not only of ideas but also of suggestions for Christian practice in order to truly live each and every day.The book holds chapters with inviting subjects such as, \\"Learning to Count Our Days\\" and \\"Living in the Story This Year.\\" I was particularly taken by the chapter on Sabbath keeping with its emphasis on worship and rest. Both of these are human needs and all too often people assume they can do just fine without one or the other or both. You have heard people say they can worship God wherever they please and so have I, but there is something remarkably powerful about worshiping God in God's house, hearing God's word and sharing in God's music. Also we have heard people say, \\"I don't need more than a few hours of sleep a night,\\" but all people everywhere have a deep need for rest from our labors (or our frenetic enjoyments). As Bass says, when we keep a Sabbath holy we are practicing for a day the freedom God intends for all people.\\" (Page 63)In the chapter on \\"Learning to Count Our Days\\", we are reminded of the finiteness of earthly lives and the importance of remembering. As Bass says, \\"Whenever death comes near, I am prompted to ponder my own death and thus my life.\\" (Page 116) When we live in tune with creation and contribute toward the well being of others, we can make the highest, the best use of each day.Also, Bass talks eloquently about the gift of hospitality and the full measure of time that is given when one truly welcomes another. Those who have pondered the \\"better part\\" that Mary chose, of sitting at Jesus feet, will appreciate this section of the book.Dorothy C. Bass is an historian of American religion and the director of the Valparaiso University's program called \\"Practicing our Faith\\". She has acquired a strong following of readers who are eager to explore the Christian journey in her company. I encourage you to become one of them."},{"Title":"Receiving the Day: Christian Practices for Opening the Gift of Time (The Practices of Faith Series)","review":"I enjoyed Bass' book about Christian practices generally and looked forward to more in this work.

Gives excellent insight into how he became a great leader. The segments on his stint in the New York legislature were fascinating, as was the discussion of his fight against the corrupt bosses.This would be an excellent selection for a book club. Lots to talk about and would generate some good discussions on what makes a leader who can stand on principle against a great deal of opposition - why did he keep fighting for good government? How and when did he win?The description of McKinley was brief but interesting. Again, a new light on someone I'd heard of but never knew anything about.

It is full of wonderful stories, such as TR and reporters combing NYC for policemen who were corrupt or not doing their jobs, the first bicycle policemen which TR organized, his successes and failures, his gift for publicity and cultivation of his image.With the help of a lot of caffeine, TR worked very hard and learned to work with the less than honest machine politicians. The research seems through and the writing impeccable. A true gem. But, then, the material could not be finer."},{"Title":"I Rose Like a Rocket : The Political Education of Theodore Roosevelt","review":"TR has always been one of my two favorite Presidents (the other being JFK), and this book is more than just your typical biography on him. It takes the unique angle of writing only about TR's life and political career before he became President, starting with his childhood and going through his political development, service in government, personal triumphs and tragedies, stint as a Rough Rider, time as Vice President, and finally having the last chapter be about his famous late-night ride to take the Oath of Office after President McKinley finally succumbed to his gunshot wound. We learn about how his experiences during this part of his life formed his political philosophy and development, making this incredible human being into the astute incredible President and politician he became over time. Mr. Grondahl really knows how to do his research and how to make it interesting and relevant instead of just some dry recounting of facts, names, and dates. It was also an added bonus how the author lives in the same area as I do."},{"Title":"I Rose Like a Rocket : The Political Education of Theodore Roosevelt","review":"A fascinating book. Paul Grondahl shows TR's political rise as an explosive combination of two different factors or forces -- one internal and one external.These forces are on display on the cover of the book. The title (\\"rose like a rocket\\") suggests the circumstances that quickly propelled TR into political opportunity. New York, and the nation, were ripe for a patrician reformer. Yet, as the book makes clear, Roosevelt's life consisted as much of sorrow as of opportunity. So external events are insufficient to explain his success.The subtitle (\\"political education\\") suggests the more important factor -- TR's intellectually aggressive approach to life, which enabled him to constantly improve by learning from his mistakes. Roosevelt himself seldom admitted to mistakes. So it takes a great journalist and historian like Grondahl to extract those lessons for us. A very enjoyable piece of detective work!"},{"Title":"I Rose Like a Rocket : The Political Education of Theodore Roosevelt","review":"In today's world, Teddy Roosevelt would be classified as a sickly geek. As a boy, he had severe bouts of asthma, wore thick glasses and even at age 23 only weighed 130 pounds. This book reveals the people and events that shaped his life. He lost a substantial portion of his inherited wealth when the cattle market collapsed in the 1890's.Teddy really had multiple concurrent careers, he wrote lots of letters on a daily basis, and he also wrote lots of books and magazine articles, which became the backbone of how he supported his family. The salaries for the various political positions that he held were meagar but he had a terrific work ethic and almost unlimited amounts of energy.This book is also a ray of sunshine and hope. The 1880's and 1890's were full of corrupt political hacks and yet Teddy found a way to succeed without sacrificing his integrity.This is a great read and it is my pleasure to recommend it to one and all.I so enjoyed this book that I wish the author would write a follow-up book on his presidency and the remainder of his life.Linda MooreDallas"},{"Title":"I Rose Like a Rocket : The Political Education of Theodore Roosevelt","review":"It is amazing how Teddy made it to adulthood, let alone bull his way to the top of New York's political scene.

I just recently replaced it by buying it on Amazon.com and am looking forward to re-reading it. Paul Grondahl is a great author and Teddy Roosevelt still is an inspiration to me."},{"Title":"I Rose Like a Rocket : The Political Education of Theodore Roosevelt","review":"With all the biographies of Theodore Roosevelt available, it might seem superfluous to add this one to your reading list. But this valiant endeavor by journalist and author Paul Grondahl has several aspects that recommend it in addition to, or even instead of, its competitors.First, \\"I Rose Like a Rocket,\\" as its title implies, focuses on the rapid political ascendancy of the young Roosevelt, especially on his early careers in Manhattan and Albany. And his was a meteoric rise, from Assemblyman (two years) to civil service commissioner (six years--\\"the longest he remained in any job\\" before his presidency) to police commissioner (two years) to assistant secretary of the navy (one year) to New York State governor (two years) to Vice President (six months). The book closes with Roosevelt boarding the train that will take him to the presidency after McKinley's assassination. This account is greatly enriched by the author's meticulous research into Albany's public archives and private collections.In each position, Roosevelt pursued his persistent, if uneven, battles against corruption and cronyism, and his adversarial style ranged from an early petulance and arrogance to the maturity of an operator who balanced \\"seduction and flattery\\" with \\"intense anger and grudges.\\" Only the office of the Vice President, a \\"trifling position as McKinley's understudy,\\" seemed a \\"political dead end.\\"In addition, the author blends in a masterful account of Roosevelt's personal life: his intensely devoted relationship with his sister Bamie, his short-lived first marriage, the dual tragedy that nearly ended his career, his subsequent life as a family man, and the occasional strains his ambitions brought to his second marriage. Making full use of the hundreds of letters Roosevelt sent to his sister, Grondahl shows there's more depth to the future President than the caricature of the weakling-turned-strongman that Roosevelt himself was so eager to present in his public writings. This is no hagiography: Roosevelt's aims could be as self-serving as they were honorable.And, finally, the almost-novelistic prose of \\"I Rose Like a Rocket\\" is compulsively readable. In spite of its academic vigor and scrupulous research, it's one of the quickest 400-page biographies you're ever likely to read."},{"Title":"I Rose Like a Rocket : The Political Education of Theodore Roosevelt","review":"This new biography focuses greatly on the political career of TR from his early days as a New York State Assemblyman, through his career as a Washington bureaucrat, back to New York City as a Police Commissioner, back to Albany and the New York Governor's mansion, then skillfully bobbing his way to the Vice Presidency, and his fateful ascension to the top office after the assassination of President William McKinley in 1901. This book has asides on his youth and his non-political life, but the book stops right upon his ascension to the Presidency, for this is all-too familiar territory. What is amazing to contemplate, though, is that TR was only 42 upon becoming President, yet he had nearly two decades of politicking behind him. How so many biographies have glossed over his pre-Presidential political life is beyond me. For it was in these earlier incarnations that the man who became a pro-business, pro-middle class Progressive was born. From his earliest pugnacious encounters with senior politicians ready to literally sandbag him (quoth TR, in response: \`I'll kick you, I'll bite you, I'll kick you in the balls. I'll do anything to you- you'd better leave me alone.'), to his strained but admiring relationship with reform-minded Democratic New York Governor and later President Grover Cleveland- including such tidbits as TR's role in shepherding New York's first civil service law, which reduced the power of political patronage brokers, to Cleveland's desk- the book allows insights into TR, the politician and man, from his overt, risk-addicted personality to his covert, subtler manipulations.The book also sketches a personal side of TR not oft-explored, at least in its relation to his politics, such as his first marriage and widowerhood, and his numerous writing commitments to serial magazines of the day, on a whole assortment of topics. It also details how the man's principles often hampered his overall rise, which was less rocket-like, and more bulldozer-like, especially in his resuscitation of the office of assistant Navy Secretary. Of course, his style of politicking earned numerous enemies, who conspired to defeat his bid for the mayoralty of New York City, stymied many police reforms, and then even tried to deny him renomination after a successful governorship, instead conspiring with him to get him the Vice Presidential nod just to get him out of the state. This was because, despite being a wealthy scion of a centuries old New York Dutch clan, TR had a social conscience- displayed when he championed Jacob Riis's seminal tracts on urban poverty, or when hr took up union leader Samuel Gompers' challenge to visit the vile tenements of the city he was born in. Yes, many of these exploits were media manipulations, but what set TR apart from such latter-day phonies as Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, is that his care for the oppressed was not dependent upon the media glare. He also was pro-business while being pro-corporate responsibility- shrewdly building public support of the state's first tax on corporations. He knew wealth must first be created before it can be distributed. He also gave state employees an eight-hour workday, one of the first such laws in the country.In short, this book is well worth the read, and has less of the calculated polish of a historian's attempt at hagiography, with none of the self-important puffery, and more of a down and dirty muckraker's attempt to tell a reader about a man who stood up for himself. Ontogeny recapitulates biography, or something like that. Bravo!"},{"Title":"I Rose Like a Rocket : The Political Education of Theodore Roosevelt","review":"Another excellent addition to the biographies of Theodore Roosevelt, Paul Grondahl writes well and offers further insights to the political achievements of one of our greatest and most colorful presidents. Recognizing the necessity of including biographical information to drive the political ascendancy of Roosevelt, the book covers the life of Roosevelt including his family, his adventures, his personality, his value system, and mostly how others reacted to him. From his early days in the legislature, through police commissioner, to governorship, and eventually the Presidency, Roosevelt led a full life of rugged individualism, scholarship, heroism, and unparalleled energy.Grondahl's obvious background in journalism serves him well in this reporter style biography. Excellent writing, thorough unbiased presentation, and a nice balance of politics and personality make this a complete look at Roosevelt's unusually vigorous and young rise to the top of the political world. The research is precise, comprehensive, and incorporates quotes from Roosevelt and others. The occasional interpretation simply gives another look at the complicate man and provides a more complete picture.Occasionally the political events and abundance of names gets overwhelming as does the Tammany information. While the focus of the book is on the political structure and Roosevelt himself, there are times when a closer look or a micro-historical glance at the people and how their lives were affected by Roosevelt's decisions would have given the book a more \\"common man\\" feel. Hinting at the complexity and difficulty surrounding his own family, the story seemed to avoid dwelling deeply on those aspects that might have deeply touched Roosevelt, thereby affecting his political machinations. In spite of the attempt to blend the emotional and personal with the global, a reader still gets a perfunctory glimpse into the character of TR.Overall this is an outstanding contribution to the multitude of volumes on Roosevelt. \\"I Rose Like a Rocket\\" is highly recommended for Roosevelt fans and anyone curious as to his political rise to the top. For me, it simply whetted my appetite for more knowledge. Readers need to know that the chronology ends at the start of TR's presidency and does not include any political or biographical information afterward."},{"Title":"Leaving Eden","review":"Leclaire's coming of age narrative, &quot;Leaving Eden&quot; is more about growing up and finding out that your dreams of leaving lead you instead back home.

After Dinah Mae abruptly leaves her diligent, devoted husband Luddy for the hopes of realizing her life-long ambition of becoming a Hollywood stgar, her bright, inquisitive but disaffected daughter must confront her own demons and ask herself questions she is not initially prepared to confront.Without the comfort and security of her mother, Tallie lacks \\"context\\" for her life and yearns to see the \\"whole picture\\" instead of the \\"jangly bits and pieces that didn't seem to fit.\\" Insecure with her own physical appearance, a social outsider whose anxieties are exacerbated by an intolerably smug and critical maternal grandmother, Tallie has yet to discover that \\"things don't always have to be laid out straight as string to make sense.\\" Trying to make sense of his own loneliness, Luddy takes to drink to obliterate pain. One parent dead, the other remote and silent, Tallie seeks answers through involvement in the Klip-N-Kurl beauty salon, where the town's women congregate to share gossip, secrets, and occasional comfort.Just as quickly as she had left Eden, Dinah Mae returns, but with even more unanswered questions. The novel pivots around the issue of unresolved dreams and wants. Both mother and daughter must face how to fulfill the lives they have been given while being true to themselves and the one they love. In desperation, Tallie turns to the town's pariah \\"witch,\\" whose Queen of Cures causes more consternation to Tallie than comfort. Tallie muses, \\"It's hard to figure out what will kill you and what will cure you\\" and even more difficuilt to figure out the difference, she unknowingly sets an outline for her own life.The second abandonment is even more wrenching, more final as Tallie must observe her mother's unsuccessful battle with cancer. LeClaire is nothing less than brilliant in her exploration of an adolescent's existential anguish and resounding pain at the loss of a beloved parent. Tallie yearns to have her mother tell her \\"everything\\" she needs to know about life. As she rails at the unfairness of her mother's death, Tallie also castigates herself for her own inability to ask the right questions, provide enough solace and deflect physical pain.As Tallie discovers \\"wanting is a powerful thing,\\" she embarks on a bumpy road of self-discovery in which her sexuality, capacity for truth and ability to deceive combine to compel her to an act of self-defintion and discovery. She learns that dreams, \\"the conceiving of possibilities that stretch\\" beyond the single person, necessarily must animate life; the act of want transcends its attainment. Tallie ultimately will come to grips with one of life's greatest dilemmas, a choice between regret and remorse.Interspersed in this fast-paced narrative are bite-sized morsels of Tallie's wisdom, written in her private journal. Each aphorism derives from experience and love, from the intricate web of friendships Tallie has created in Eden and from the solitude of suffering and desire in her own heart. Anne LeClaire has created a genuinely moving description of wisdom's costs and love's possibilities. \\"Leaving Eden\\" will leave readers profoundly moved."},{"Title":"Leaving Eden","review":"This is a good beach read for a hot summer afternoon. It is about a young girl, who thinks the grass is greener on the other side. I am assuming she got this opinion of her mother. I had the impression that her mother moved away the second time, but it isn't really that way. It was heartbreaking and moving to read about how much she misses her mother. Makes you think you don't really know how much you would missing something until it is gone.So Tallie lives with her dad, who works and drowns his sorrows in a nearby bar. She goes to school and also works at the local beauty salon. After her mother comes back the first time from LA, she is filled with all kinds of emotions. She doesn't know whether to be mad, sad or happy. She is lacking a female her in life after her mother passes, but her mom's best friend is there.I didn't expect the story to turn out like it did. I love it!"},{"Title":"Leaving Eden","review":"I read LEAVING EDEN first and was so thrilled with the book and the author's style that I immediately ordered everything she has written.

During this summer in Eden, Virginia Tallie's mother returns from a stint in LA, looking for stardom, and Tallie is keeping her fingers crossed that her mom is now home for good. Alternating between the present, to past flashbacks, LeClaire begins painting a picture of Tallie's life, as she goes through the joys and pitfalls of being a teenage girl. To make extra cash, Tallie is employed at the local salon, the Klip &amp; Kurl where the buzz of the local community women keep her in the know of all the lastest goings on. The highlight of her summer and quest for her summer savings is getting a Glamour photo makeover-Tallie and the salon women can't wait to transform themselves. As we discover, deep in the hearts of these different women, is the common bond to look and feel as glamorous as a celebrity.Tallie's journey includes feelings of isolation as an outsider from the &quot;popular&quot; group, finding true love, and uncovering some painful and surprising secrets. LeClaire's writing and story are both humorous and touching."},{"Title":"Leaving Eden","review":"Tallie Brock is the kind of character you don't forget. Sixteen, hardworking, and alert to the wisdom of the women around her, Tallie has an interior life that stands in sharp relief to the hot, dusty Eden roads she bikes, the trailer home she keeps clean, and the Klip'N'Kurl where she sweeps up hair. Though the novel is set in 1992, flashbacks to events in 1988 provide insight into Tallie's drive to escape Eden and discover her mother's secrets.Anne D. Leclaire writes beautifully, capturing both Tallie's naivety and her resolve. At the end of each chapter is a page from Tallie's Book, a notebook with bits of advice in it like: people are full of surprises, and women with fat faces shouldn't wear bangs. Though the idiomatic language provides some humor, parts of the story are sad, and quite painful to read. Leclaire creates other unforgettable women in this book: Martha Lee, Mama's best friend whose face is ugly enough to stop a truck; Raylene, who teaches Tallie about generosity of spirit; Lenora, who can read the future in your shampoo suds. The men in this book are not as memorable. There's the quietly drunken father, the popular guy Tallie likes, and the not-so-popular guy who likes her. Though they are needed for plot, the men here fade next to the vivid world of the town's women. The only other flaw in the book is that the ending is not very well grounded in the rest of the story. Leclaire's prose is strong enough that she can still carry it off.As the story progresses, items in the notebook change gradually from other people's truisms to Tallie's own truths (\\"It is a mighty and terrible possibility that a person can do great harm without the least intention\\"). How she comes to learn these truths makes an absorbing story. A good read, but keep the tissues handy."},{"Title":"Leaving Eden","review":"Leaving Eden by Anne D. LeClaireIn this warm hearted coming of age story, twelve year old Tallie Brooks is missing her mother one summer. Though her mother has gone away before, in Tallie's heart, she knows it will be a long time this time before her mother's return, if at all. Her father works long hours at the mill, leaving Tallie alone in the house most days, and even for longer periods of time of times when he stops at CC's Bar after work, which is most evenings. Tallie works at the Klip \`N Kurl, with a boss who claims she can \\"read\\" soap bubbles like others read tea leave. Tallie sweeps the floors, folds the towels and helps in general. Tallie amuses herself by keeping a book of all the things she has learned at the Klip \`N Kurl, small lessons she savors that become bites of wisdom for us readers. Since Tallie's boss hosts \\"Glamour Day\\" one day, Tallie dreams the same dream her own mother die - to become a movie star, and this one \\"Glamour Day will be her big chance.

A must read."},{"Title":"Leaving Eden","review":"Many aspects of this book didn't work for me. First, the faux folksy, Southern-fried dialogue. It was as if the author tried to used this cornpone-inflected dialogue to give life to her rather boring, cliched characters. The timeline was confusing, and for the first half of the book I was never sure how much time had passed, how old Tallie was, etc. The author kept jumping around incoherently. The bit about Sarah was just dropped in, with no buildup or seeming connection to the rest of the story. Of course, that segment did lead the the book's denouement but it seemed artifical and jarring. It didn't flow organically from the rest of the story. Other things didn't make sense. When did the story take place? Given some comments about movie stars and musicians one could guess that it could be anytime in the last 15 years. But the characters acted as if it was the 1950's in many ways. I know small Southern towns are traditional (I grew up in one) but this was ridiculous. For instance, why didn't Tallie's mother ever have a job? Apparently they were barely getting by on her dad's millworker salary. You'd think that Dinah Mae would have done something to contribute to keeping the family afloat. And that brings us to the character of Dinah Mae herself. I agree with the shrink Tallie saw briefly, that she idealized her mother. Of course that angered Tallie and she flounced out. Dinah Mae was a pretty, fun-loving woman who was also vain, selfish, self-involved, irresponsible and at best an indifferent wife and mother, and one who never did or accomplished anything. I had no sympathy for her at any point and found it odd that all the main characters seemed so besotted with her, even when she treated them very badly. None of the characters were deeply drawn, and their motivations were often unclear. In sum, I thought this was a poorly written book. The basic storyline, if cleaned up quite a bit and fleshed out, might make a moderately enjoyable Lifetime movie. As fiction, it's sorely lacking."},{"Title":"Midnight Silk","review":"Ah well, another gal wanting her own way.

She clearly knows both the period and the setting, which is a refreshing change from so much of the bad CW fiction currently on the market.

Bowie's and Maria's journey across Texas, fraught with perils, hidden dangers, became real to me as I rode in the cotton wagons with them every step of the way. I loved how Ms. Grant wove history with fiction in relaying details of the Kenedy Ranch in Texas. Ms. Grant's book makes me clamor for more westerns of a different style, those that are smooth-paced with real history, and immerse one into the Americana culture of yesteryear. Reading books like hers makes me realize how little American history I absorbed in high school, and how much I have picked up simply reading romance. I highly recommend this book for lovers of all historical romances.

His father feels Bowie is a coward for not joining the military and makes it clear publicly how he feels about his son.By 1863, Maria is no longer a pampered belle of the south as she keeps the books and even works in the fields. When he learns of the plot that Lance Webster has for Maria to further his own well being, Bowie intercedes. However, the rescue has just begun as the Union Army, Confederate bandits, and their families seek the fleeing duo, who allow their love for one another to surface.MIDNIGHT SILK is a solid Civil War romance that brings to life the diverse opinions that further divided the Confederate side of the conflict. Bowie's dad Sam cannot see how courageous his son is by supporting the effort in as dangerous an occupation as soldiering. The story line is fast-paced and action packed, but it is the star-crossed lead protagonists that turn on the romance inside a vivid historical tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Midnight Silk","review":"Love civil war era books and to the extent that this includes little known facts about it, such as the cotton wagon trains to shore up funds for the south, and the actual historical accuracies of texas ranches, it is enjoyable. However as a novel, historical romance, I found it extremely lacking on character depth. Our southern belle spends the entire book trying to not-too-subtly get the overseer's son to bed her and wed her. I found her bold and brassy in her efforts. The love interest, bowie beckett, spends the book avoiding her obvious attempts to seduce him because he's \\"not good enough for her\\". A real creative story line. It was also short of realism. When has a band of \\"banditos\\" attacking a train of 10 wagons been scared off by one woman toting and shooting a gun while riding her mare!And then our belle shoots the spy/bad guy while sitting a horse with her hands tied.

I asked a clerk at Ottawa's House of Speculative Fiction if he could recommend someone really unusual - I had my fill of early Stephen King at the time - and he immediately whipped out a book and thrust it at me. &quot;Land of Laughs,&quot; he said. &quot;It's unbelievable... really different.&quot;I had never even heard of Jonathan Carroll before and I generally knew my horror authors, so I was perturbed. How good could he be? Published in 1980 and the New York-born resident of Vienna's first novel, The Land of Laughs lived up to the clerk's billing. Highly imaginative and very frightening, it showcased the talents of a writer who excels at setting a macabre stage by allowing the horror to creep up on you v-e-r-r-r-y slowly. His tales are happy, funny and whimsical to start with, but chapter by chapter, Carroll adds sinister elements. Before you realize it, you're staring death squarely in the face. His second, Voice of Our Shadow, is even more shocking for its sinister stealth.Kissing the Beehive is Carroll's tenth novel; one of the more recent ones, The Panic Hand, is a Bram Stoker Award-winning anthology that I highly recommend. As with the others, Beehive begins innocently enough, with a few stragglers rather than the swarm yet to come. Author Sam Bayer is in a slump, meeting with his agent in an attempt to untangle the cobwebs responsible for his terrible writer's block. His pending divorce is really creating havoc. Later, at a book signing, he meets an incredibly gorgeous fan, a California blonde named Veronica Lake. She really knows her Bayer, down to her business card, which contains an image from his novel The Tatooed City.Bayer jogs his sluggish memory in an attempt to birth ideas. He drives to his hometown of Crane's View, visits old haunts, looks through high-school yearbooks and greets former acquaintances. The trip is the perfect panacea for his blues, as Bayer delves into an unsolved boyhood murder mystery, that of a free-spirited young woman named Pauline Ostrova. Her nude body, which had spawned so many adolescent fantasies, had been found by the young Bayer. Over the years, he had shunted the awful memory aside, but now he seizes the opportunity to gather important facts and unburden his soul.During the excitement, unable to get her out of his thoughts, Bayer contacts Veronica Lake, they meet again and make love. He tells her about the burgeoning plot for his new novel and she is thrilled about her confidante status. Remember, she is his number one fan, like the character in Stephen King's Misery... only much more dangerous.Bayer heads back to Crane's View, his teenaged daughter Cassandra in tow. He meets up with Frannie McCabe, childhood bad-boy turned chief of police, and brings up the Ostrova mystery. The police chief has his own take on the dossier and suspects that the town's crime boss, Gordon Cadmus, since murdered, had something to do with her demise. She had been seeing his son David, now a Hollywood film producer... and the old man as well.In typical Carroll fashion, the story begins its slow spiral into madness just as Bayer and McCabe initiate their joint sleuthing. Also, something is terribly wrong with Veronica Lake. Bayer uncovers unsettling facts about her, most notably the fact she was two-time porn movie headliner Marzi Pan and a member of an infamous suicide cult. He decides not to see her any more, which first saddens and then infuriates her. Meanwhile, someone with knowledge of their unofficial Ostrova investigation is following Bayer and McCabe around, as well as videotaping unspeakable things, like the murder of David Cadmus on an L.A. street.Lake, whom Bayer is trying to ignore, is in-his-face throughout. She slyly interacts with all his witnesses, subtly threatens his daughter and her boyfriend and, after McCabe barely survives an attempt on his life, befriends the cop. We also learn that she is a deft film technician and has been taping lots of footage, including shots of Bayer taken in a suit he had discarded years before and explicit images of them having sex.The horror escalates when Cassandra goes missing, every father's nightmare but nothing compared to Bayer's ultimate scenario. His novel has taken the most sinister twist possible.Jonathan Carroll is still unknown to many fans of mainstream horror literature, rather surprising in light of the stellar quality of every single one of his works. The author humbly pays homage to &quot;Pat Conroy, Stephen King, Michael Moorcock, Paul West - Friends, Mentors, Wizards&quot; - in the dedication, but I dare say that he has earned the right to appear right up there with them on that marquee.In Doubleday's press release on Kissing the Beehive, King is equally complimentary, one master of the macabre to another. &quot;A stunning novel of obsession and memory by the always amazing Jonathan Carroll. A brilliant writer - Jonathan Carroll is as scary as Hitchcock, when he isn't being as funny as Jim Carrey.&quot;-30-Kissing the Beehive Nan A.

While I adored &quot;Bones of the Moon&quot;, &quot;Kissing the Beehive&quot; is only the second of his works that I've finished completely satisfied. I can live without the usual magical plot devices if I get the plot and character quality of this book in its place."},{"Title":"Kissing the Beehive","review":"I've long been a fan of Jonathan Carroll's work and only recently picked up _Kissing the Beehive_. It's an excellent tale of a blocked writer (see Donald Westlake's _The Hook_) who goes back to his boyhood hometown to look into the mystery surrounding the death of a girl, whose body he discovered floating in the Hudson River. He intends to write the story of what he discovers and he ultimately discovers the secret. Along the way, we're treated to a slowly unfolding, very gripping story, including the tragic figure of a wild fan who first intrigues, then scares our protagonist. Carroll has a gift for writing some of the most poignant characters and scenes--things that really get under your skin and drag you in feet-first. I'm thinking about one memorable scene in which three of our main characters are sitting on the porch, sharing jokes and stories, and the writer-protagonist says something along the lines of &quot;I'm very glad I have both of you in my life.&quot; I'm very glad there's an author like Jonathan Carroll in mine (too cheesy?)."},{"Title":"Kissing the Beehive","review":"Some who are familiar with Jonathan Carroll's books have, oddly enough,not been quite as satisfied with &quot;Kissing the Beehive&quot; as with his other books. They seem not to have respected or understood Carroll's desire as an artist for a direction change, which to me seems rather intolerant. For once he wanted not &quot;only&quot; &quot;magic realism&quot;, but something else in &quot;addition&quot; - and he has the right to! After all HE is the one who writes hours and hours for us, he is the one who nourishes our senses, who creates the worlds we cannot create, the worlds we want to inhabit, the worlds we flee to. He is a artist and draws from his fantasy, HIS own unique imagination which he generously allows us to share. I was fascinated by this very book and feel honored to have been allowed access to yet another part of Carrolls vision - the ability to write a thriller which, until the end, leaves you breathless and in complete oblivion - not your typical thriller - an unearthly thriller which searches unforseeable depths and facets of human nature and human behavior. It is hard to put this book aside. Throughout, one is both intrigued and at the same time repelled by certain characters,another reason why this book is so fascinating. Beehive is a piece of Carroll's repertoire that &quot;slightly falls out of place&quot; (...&quot;aus der Reihe tanzen&quot;) - One can say it is different from the others, and that is why it is so interesting. Carroll writes about what his soul longs for. I recommend this book and all of the others he has and will write. Jonathan Carroll is one of the most reliable writers around - he is always fun, smart, witty, insightful. Each of his books is rare."},{"Title":"Kissing the Beehive","review":"Carroll is one of my favorite authors and he doesn't dissapoint with &quot;Kissing The Beehive.&quot; However, this novel is much more a straight mystery story than Carroll's other efforts that always seem to have several fantastical elements to them. I gave the book only four stars because it was missing that bizarre twist that seems to surface halfway through other Carroll novels (e.g., the dog talking in Land of Laughs). Regardless, I do recommend this book. As with all of Carroll's work, it keeps you totally engrossed in the story till the very end."},{"Title":"Kissing the Beehive","review":"This is an amazing book. A total page turner (or on the kindle a \\"next clicker\\"). Kissing the Beehive will creep you out, keep you guessing and make you rave about Jonathan Carroll to your friends. When I finished it, I loaned Beehive to a buddy and now he's a big Carroll fan as well. The book is nostalgic, sweet, funny in places, scary as hell in others and one hell of a tale."},{"Title":"Kissing the Beehive","review":"Jonathan Carroll, a remarkable author, gives us another gift -- a beautifully written novel with an interesting plot and intriguing characters.Unlike many of Carroll's other works, this is pretty straightforward. Sam is a successful author who's in the middle of a divorce and has writer's block. With his publisher breathing down his neck, Sam decides to revisit his home town where, as a teenager, he discovered the body of a beautiful and mysterious girl from his high school. He wants to investigate the murder for his next book, and when he arrives in Crane's View NY, he finds that one of his less reputable friends, Frannie McCabe, has become the town sheriff! (McCabe later shows up as the main protagonist in a more surreal Carroll outing, The Wooden Sea.) Together they begin an investigation that will take Sam for a wild ride and end, perhaps, in a new tragedy.If you haven't read anything by Carroll, please take a chance. He is incredibly exciting and a superb writer, with fascinating characters skillfully developed and natural dialogue. Also, check out his web site for screenplays and short stories: jonathancarroll.com"},{"Title":"Kissing the Beehive","review":"'Kissing the Beehive' is too, too short. At least for this fan. One thing I love about Carroll's work is his ability to create an appealing reality with likable characters and then pull the rug from beneath your feet, leaving you flat on your arse. That this doesn't happen with 'Beehive' is only a minor gripe as the writing is as ever economically beautiful. However I feel that the plot is wrapped up far too quickly, leaving me wanting more reflection from the narrator on the events that have taken place. I love the stuff on the business of writing and fandom and guess that at least some of this is self-conscious, autobiography.(really, Steve?) I'd definitely recommend it to anyone, with a special caution for Carroll devotees-don't expect the unexpected!"},{"Title":"Kissing the Beehive","review":"This book had me captivated from the first page. Great mystery. Great characters. Good story!One of the few authors that can leave the genre I discovered him in (fantasy/scifi) and still captivate me. The only other I can think of off the top of my head is Graham Joyce.Carroll is great at keeping the reader off balance."},{"Title":"Kissing the Beehive","review":"I loved this book, as I love all of Carroll's books. He is my favorite author. His imagination, intelligence and wit, not to mention fabulous characters, plots, and dialogue, consistently amaze me. Many of his books are out of print and hard to find, but every second spent searching for his books will be rewarded. Find his books and read them!"},{"Title":"Kissing the Beehive","review":"I am a big fan of the author's work but found this not quite up to his standards. It didn't have that Carroll edge to it that I find so appealing. Thoughtful and well written - maybe 4 stars for some other author."},{"Title":"Kissing the Beehive","review":"&quot;On the level of sheer sentence-construction and his pellucid prose, Jonathan Carroll is among the most purely pleasing writers of the decade. Yet his elegant, entrancing novels have real depths, as they present a series of reports froma world unique to its creator... The small town, mystery-suspense plot (of KISSING THE BEEHIVE) kinks into wholly new, unexplored territory, which sets up a very moving, unsettling and tragic finish.&quot;excerpt from review in &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper of London"},{"Title":"Kissing the Beehive","review":"I bought this book the moment i saw it. I'm a big fan of his work. I read this book straight thru, I didn't want to put it down. But it did leave me somewhat dissatisfied. The plot is interesting, it is typically somewhat bleak, the characterisation is generally good, except for the main female character who seemed rather sketchily drawn in. Also it felt like a book that should have been longer. The build up was good - but then it felt like he rushed to the ending rather than building up the characters / tension. After Silence felt the same too. I'd recommend any of the earlier books - but i think most of them are pretty hard to get hold of. Go for Sleeping in Flame first.."},{"Title":"Kissing the Beehive","review":"Kissing the Beehive is Jonathan Carroll's latest offering, and it's not really a fantasy book--or whatever genre you want it to be--but more of a thriller, though it does have Carroll's brilliantly quirky characters here.The best of the lot is Veronica Lake (so perfectly named), who becomes the Sam Bayer's new girl--on his third divorce, burnt out from that and previous novels--and he mets her at a book signing. Their relationship is never easy, with mishaps along the way, and becomes one the centres to the book, as long as the old murder that Sam Bayer is setting out to solve so he can become overcome his writers block and write his new novel--of course, as with all old murders in sleepy towns, there is something still lurking around...I will give no more away.The prose is clean and perfect, but then that is what one expects from Carroll; the book isn't all that long, so the plot burns away; and the characters are well drawn, making them easily likable. One of the delights of the book is Sam's relationship with his daughter.The one problem with the book, though, is that by the end of it, you don't really care who did the girl in so many years ago.So there: Kissing the Beehive is no Outside the Dog Museum, but is on equal par to From the Teeth of Angels, Carroll's next best peice of work. That's in case anyone wanted it compared to other novels of his."},{"Title":"Kissing the Beehive","review":"Kissing the Beehive starts well, but the storytelling deteriorates pretty quickly. It's a great premise for a book: a blocked writer goes home and finds the story of his career--a thirty-year-old murder mystery. But Carroll isn't able to sustain a credible storyline. Clues start arriving out of nowhere. His hero hooks up with an unstable woman (named Veronica Lake, if you can believe it) who seems to be an authorly creation rather than anything human or real. The denouement is clever, but it ultimately diminishes the book, since it's a little too neat. All in all, a disappointment."},{"Title":"Kissing the Beehive","review":"Jonathan Carroll's novels usually start off calm and then something magical happens to turn everything upside down. This novel, unlike his others, keeps its feet firmly on the ground and never becomes unnerving. Carroll is a terific writer and some of the lines in this book rival his best. Unfortunately, this is not an exciting story. It is the first novel that I've read by Jonathan Carroll (I have read them all and have enjoyed every one except &quot;After Silence&quot;)that is completely predictable. Please Jonathan, return to talking animals and Los Angeles wizards! Readers, hunt out &quot;The Land of Laughs&quot; or &quot;Bones of the Moon&quot; rather than this one."},{"Title":"Kissing the Beehive","review":"Unfortunately, this is the first Carroll book I have read, so I cannot compare its literary quality with others. I found it started very slowly, meandering just as its hero, trying to find a path for his plot. Soon I was amused - Carroll does dedicate the book to Pat Conroy as well as other authors: - the hero's daughter Cassandra begins to sound very much like the inappropriately mature child in Conroy&quot;s BEACH MUSIC.The story becomes pretty predictable, with little depth of character, &amp; the weird Veronica Lake thrown in for good measure. I found it very strange that a man such as the hero was supposed to be, kept allowing himself to be hoodwinked by Veronica's sophomoric behaviour &amp; games.Then we have the old rough &amp; tough cop, the old buddy, the addicted war hero - nothing new here either. The old home town hasn't changed a lot, &amp; the poor village idiot is still there reciting commercials.Who committed the murder, &amp; why are there still more murders going on? How are they connected - or are they? Why is it so important, after so many years, to solve this one particular homicide - I know: so that the book can be written!Towards the end, the sophisticated mystery/murder reader begins to ask himself: OK - a writer has to wind down - I can see only so many pages left - so who dunnit? Who has the most to gain &amp; nothing to lose? That's when the answer falls plunk into your lap &amp; it's over.From title to finish, I found the book contrived &amp; barely enough to keep me turning pages. I finished so that I could understand why I didn't like it very much."},{"Title":"Kissing the Beehive","review":"This was my second Carroll book, after the fantastic Land of Laughs. It was pretty good for a while, but it got a little boring eventually and really fizzled out at the end. But I'd say it was still worth reading for his wonderful style of writing. I especially loved the interaction between Sam and his daughter in the first half of the book."},{"Title":"Kissing the Beehive","review":"I have to say the irony of the plot is amusing. Carroll is an excellent author of literature, trying to make his way into the &quot;mainstream&quot; by writing about a pulp novelist who wants to write his first &quot;real book&quot;. While Kissing the Beehive is certainly more original and worthwhile than most novels, it is sub-par Jonathan Carroll and you would be better off spending time with his A Child Across the Sky or From the Teeth of Angels."},{"Title":"Dogs of Myth: Tales From Around the World","review":"Its a good book but Cats of Myth (another book but is about Cats instead of dogs) is a bit better! It is tales from the world abut dogs! Nice illastrations! Any animal lover (like me) Would love Dogs of myth or Cats of Myth!"},{"Title":"The Adam of Two Edens","review":"Unless your interest is specifically political poetry, I recommend reading &quot;Unfortunately, It Was Paradise&quot; before reading &quot;The Adam of Two Edens.&quot; The former is slightly more mature poetry and slightly better translated. While the selections in &quot;The Adam of Two Edens&quot; are poems of political exile, Darwish is not a poet of Palestinian radicalism so much as a poet of the human race. In his poetry, he moves easily between cultures that have inhabited Palestine - Mesopotamian, Kurdish, Greek, Roman, Jewish, Islamic, Christian. This comprehesive view gives his poetry a wisdom and universalism rarely found in contemporary poetry. His poetry is concrete with subtle surprising use of language: &quot;We have only one dream: / that friendly breezes blow / aromas of Arabian coffee / to our hills surrounded by / summer and strangers.&quot; OR &quot;The night is the exact size of my horses.&quot;In an odd way Darwish's understanding of exile is closely related to that of Jabes. Therefore, it seems reasonable to me that Darwish be taught in Israeli schools (see editorial reviews above). &quot;This is my absence, a master who imposes his laws / on the descendants of Lot / and sees no scapegoat for Sodom but myself.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Adam of Two Edens","review":"So I have read the original work by Darwish (in Arabic) and heard recordings of some of the poems in the book. I bought the book in English as a gift for a friend of mine, and the translation was a bit disappointing. I did not feel the easy flow of Darwish's distinctive style. It might be that Darwish does not translate well, or that this particular translation is less than perfect. I think the latter is more likely.I still do recommend it."},{"Title":"The Best Short Stories of 1920 and the Yearbook of the American Short Story","review":"This is the great and very interesting book to read.So for your great experience, pls. try it as soon. :-)"},{"Title":"The Best Short Stories of 1920 and the Yearbook of the American Short Story","review":"Very good collection of stories published from period magazines For this review they required eleven more words so here they are !"},{"Title":"Many lifetimes","review":"Joan Grant's books have been an important inspiration on my quest for personal understanding. \`Many Lifetimes' is a distillation of her philosophy of life and death making it a useful over-all picture to her work. The book was written in tandem with her third husband, Dr Denys Kelsey, a practicing psychologist, and he brings a fascinating insight to reincarnation theory and how it can be useful in dealing with current psychosis.I first read this book in the 1970's and at that time was more interested in Joan Grant's chapters. I chose to re-read it for the purpose of reviewing it in Psychic Tymes and found that Dr Denys Kelsey's input had stood the test of time and had in fact improved. The first time around I had skipped a lot of his detail.Joan Grant's chapters are always interesting, inter-lacing her philosophy of existence with paranormal experiences. She is one of those people gifted (or cursed) with psychic ability. The reason I took to her works was due to her \`far memory' and the concept of the \`long years'. Reincarnation always seemed a basic truth to me, as I could remember being other people at other times. Joan wrote about that as if it were a natural thing rather than a mental aberration. Reading her previous lives biographies (Winged Pharaoh, Eyes of Horus, I as Carola et al) and the explanation of them in her own current life's autobiography \`Far memory' was a homecoming. This book distills the wisdom that can be found in her other works into a single volume.The book ends with the touching story of Joan and Denys' friend Ray, who is dying of cancer. It is a wonderful tale as Ray explores the lives that she feels are holding her back on her karmic journey. In expiating them she feels that she can die with grace and dignity, showing her nearest and dearest that death is not to be feared, but is just another beginning. Ray's story is a living example of Joan Grant's philosophy and is an inspiration to us all.Read this book, and then go on to reading Joan's other works. You will learn a lot, as I did."},{"Title":"Many lifetimes","review":"Joan Grant and her husband Denys Kelsey take turns writing their accounts of life in France during and after WWII and how they use her gift of seeing into the far past--past lives--to help psychologically maimed patients. The tone is very humble and yet matter-of-factly and helps us understand our own continuity and moral responsibilities. Suffering is indeed unnecessary and death is nothing to be afraid of."},{"Title":"Many lifetimes","review":"I could not put this book down, have highlighted and turned down pages and will reread and refer to time and time again, and for me that's a huge statement as I have been in the field of metaphysics for over 60 years. Chapters alternate, one chapter by Joan, the next by her husband who was in the field of Psychiatry and a practicing Hypnotherapist. His medical background along with Joan's natural ability of \\"far memory\\" (a skill learned throughout her many lifetimes), combine to offer every imaginable angle to practical matters applicable to everyone's daily living: parenting; relationships/marriage; death and the dying process; birth; intra-uterine life; illness/surgery/anesthesia; ghosts; proper development of the five senses; psychotherapy and reincarnation, and so much more. My personal favorite, which I have not seen addressed by other authors in this way or in such detail, is regarding the \\"supra-physical\\" body.

Maybe we haven't configured OIW or LIS correctly, maybe activesheets doesn't work in 4.6...I'm not sure.The book is not ONLY about how to use the ActiveSheets to do reporting, but that IS a large part of it. So if you don't have OIW/LIS up and running in SAP...don't bother..There is some good info in the book regarding business objects, what kind of reports might be good to be able to deliver to end users, some info on SIS, - but it is NOT, as the cover indicates, &quot;The complete and only book you need to create robust reports and ebusiness applications with SAP R/3&quot; (unless you can get ActiveSheets to work!).

Definitely a bargain at this price!"},{"Title":"Egyptian Religion.","review":"This book on ancient Egyptian religion is certainly not for the newcomers. It is dense, full of textual references and words in Hebrew and Greek - which are not translated at all - and Egyptian texts in specialized transliteration, all of which will become a hard burden for the unnoticed reader. A comparison between the original German edition and this English version is annoying: the latter being many times quite free regarding the former, as to even change the spirit of some passages. For the learned in the field, it is, even with all these hamperings, a good-researched and scholarly text which provides many thought-provoking questions never proffered before in a (supposedly) &quot;general interpretation&quot; of the religious creeds of ancient Egypt. An indispensable tool for the researchers in this field, not doubt at all."},{"Title":"Egyptian Religion.","review":"For the ancient Egyptian their civilisation and their religion were one and the same. To this end they developed over time a complex cosmological structure of the interactions of man and the gods, with the emphasis being on creation and the afterlife. An additional feature which sets this book apart from the numerous others in its field are the comparative and interactive analyses with the religions of Ethiopia, Greece and Syria. Available both in its English translation and the German original, it is a superb reference which ably demonstrates that religion was the fundamental basis of the Ancient Egyptian civilisation. It is highly recommended for all academics, scholars and laypeople."},{"Title":"Egyptian Religion.","review":"This is not your typical book on Egyptian religion. The author takes concepts of Egyptian religion (such as what came first, Egyptian ritual or myth) and tries to prove the author's point (at times very poorly). Other topics include: How man related to God? Consciousness of sin (yes sin)? How the Egyptians viewed fate? Etc., etc.There are two reasons why I did not like this book. The first one is due to the author's constant reference to Judaism and Christianity. I would have preferred more information on Egyptian religion than Judaism or Christianity. The second reason why I did not like this book, is constant display of Greek and Hebrew? phrases. The author (or translator) does not explain what these phrases mean or if they are from the original text he is reading from. These phrases are so consistent they become annoying."},{"Title":"Egyptian Religion.","review":"The book was useless to me and very bare, I can understand why it wasn't returnable to the seller."},{"Title":"Tales from a Child of the Enemy","review":"TALES FROM A CHILD OF THE ENEMY by Ursula Duba compels us to realize that the past is a state of mind. She carries us back into her childhood in post-war Germany, and then quietly returns us to the present. There, through our own time, Duba again carries us back, this time further and deeper and into the psyches of those who were witness to the inhumanity of the Third Reich. We realize that the events of another time and another place envelop and profoundly affect the way our present is seen and tolerated by certain individuals, people whom we might very easily know. We come to realize that their struggle, their understanding, and their insights can have profound influence on the world around us. That this is true, especially for those of us who presumed that our realtionship to the events of WWII and the Holocaust were non-existent or at least, very distant, is stunning. We are inescapably drawn into Duba's mind and heart by the deceptively conversational tone of her poems, by her easy description of events and issues which so quickly become as familiar to us as the events in our own lives. The lives of others and the &quot;then&quot; which has impacted so strongly upon them today, becomes a part of our own lives, our own now"},{"Title":"Tales from a Child of the Enemy","review":"This book belongs on the same shelf as Art Spiegelman's Pulitzer Prize-winning &quot;Maus: A Survivor's Tale&quot; and &quot;Schindler's List.&quot; Duba really gets inside her characters -- victims, perpetrators and those in-between. Her poems will leave lasting impressions and have readers returning to the pages many times."},{"Title":"Tales from a Child of the Enemy","review":"In reading Duba's book, my first inclination was to be suspect of this German gentile who had the audacity to portray the Jewish experience of the Holocaust, but as I read the sequence of story poems that, like blocks, built a picture of the complex, multi-layered experience of all the participants, I began to soften and ultimately came over to join her in viewing the experience from her vantage point. Duba is brutally honest with herself, requiring me too, to examine my prejudices and stererotypes. Her courage to face herself and to face up to others gave me the encouragement to examine my experience, to face down some of my haunting demons and the manadate to speak out. - Second generation Holocaust survivo"},{"Title":"Tales from a Child of the Enemy","review":"This beautifully written gem should be required reading for anyone who feels they understand the Holocaust.

For those readers looking for detailed descriptions of the engineering designs of the ISS, this book does not contain them and only provides the most general of descriptions (at least from my point of view as a NASA engineer). It does, however, provide an excellent summary of the history, on-orbit operations, and construction, of what has been termed \\"The greatest engineering project in the history of mankind.\\"As one would expect, the book opens with a historical overview of the world's first space stations: NASA's Skylab and the Russian's Salyut 1, and covers the lessons learned from these early endeavors. After these introductory chapters, the next section examined the successful Russian Salyut series of space stations that set many endurance records and demonstrated that complex on-orbit repairs are possible. In contrast to the Russian effort during this time, the NASA space station efforts were directly primarily at numerous paper studies.The book next moves into the development of the US Space Station Freedom (SSF) projects, from the go ahead directive given by President Ronald Reagan, through the first George Bush years till its finale during the first year of the Clinton administration and covers all the early designs like the Dual Keel through the various Clinton redesign Options. While many may view the SSF project as mainly a paper study, it is clear that this project had a significant impact on the final design, development and operation of the ISS.Again, in contrast to NASA's paper studies, the Russian space program had successful on-orbit programs with the Salyut space station and the Mir. These programs continued to show that humans could easily work in space by performing routine maintenance and emergency repairs. It should be noted that the cosmonauts aboard Mir still hold the endurance record over a full and continuous year in space. I should point out, as is documentation here, that a lot more has happen in the Russian space program, both good and bad, than is ever reported in the press.The final section of the book, which is approximately half of the book, examines the construction of the ISS from the Shuttle-Mir partnership to the final mission of 2001. This portion of the book thoroughly examines the inclusion of the Russians into the NASA project and the various problems that occurred during the early stages of this joint venture including funding and numerous cultural differences. Once these problems had been over come, the book chronicles, in great detail, each ISS construction mission from liftoff to landing (or burn up for the Progress resupply missions). For each mission, the authors cover liftoff and any associated problems, the crew, the Extra-Vehicular Activities (EVAs), what was added, maintenance, crew rotation, etc. This book is so complete that I expect it will become the standard outlining the construction of the ISS for years to come.A few final thoughts. As is typical of the Springer-Praxis series of astronomy and space exploration books, this book also contains many numerous high quality photographs and drawings, which I come to expect from this publisher. Furthermore, it avoids most of the NASA-ese use of acronyms to describe just about every piece of hardware. I found only one minor error and that was only related to the naming of an EVA construction tool. And finally, since the ISS is a work in progress, the book only covers those missions completed by the end of 2001 and in the future will either need to be updated or have a second volume."},{"Title":"Creating the International Space Station (Springer Praxis Books / Space Exploration)","review":"As mentioned by the other reviewer, the coverage of this book ends in 2001, and thus does not include the addition of trusses in 2002 (or activities scheduled for 2006 and later). As with similar books on Mir and Soyuz, the focus is on station operations in orbit, rather than construction, engineering, or the science program.The main downside, however, is that the first half of this book does not actually cover the International Space Station, but instead provides an overview of operations at earlier stations: Skylab, the Salyut stations, and Mir.There are numerous high-quality black and white photos which illustrate the phases of construction between 1998 and 2001."},{"Title":"Racial Myth in English History: Trojans, Teutons, and Anglo-Saxons (NONE)","review":"An excellent book which details the way in which English history was corrupted. The resulting myth is, unfortunately, still being taught by several websites. I have read only the 1982 edition, but I believe there was a later edition in 2005. Perhaps that gives information on the advances in DNA testing and philology which have occurred during the past decade, paticularly work by Oppenheimer, Sykes and Forster. We now know that if there was a invasion by Angles and Saxons in the fifth century AD, then only very small numbers of those peoples came to England. It is also possible that we were speaking what became English well before that time and may heve been doing so when the Romans arrived in AD 43."},{"Title":"Racial Myth in English History: Trojans, Teutons, and Anglo-Saxons (NONE)","review":"A typical college level textbook in which the usual lame liberal attempts are made to rob any sort of racial pride or identity from people of white European ancestry.

When I first read it several years ago, I was struck by Hoare's thoroughness, his dispassion, and his wide-ranging research. While this book may not be flawless, it's certainly good enough, I believe, to be the current standard biography of the man.Despite Coward's reputation as the quintessence of high-class sophistication and airy panache, Hoare shows how the man was shaped by his distinctly unglamorous childhood. His days as a hard-working child actor are thoroughly explored, as are his relationships with colleagues, lovers, competitors, and friends. While not prurient, Hoare clearly loves a good story, and doesn't mind dealing dish (as they say) on his subject when he has one to tell.Though not really a devotee of theater generally, I am a fan of Coward's. Having read a few titles about the man, I don't hesitate to say this is the best of the lot. Whether you're a student of the man or a casual acquaintance who wants to know more about one of the outstanding talents of the last century, Philip Hoare's biography is a resource to read, enjoy, and keep close to hand."},{"Title":"NOEL COWARD, A BIOGRAPHY","review":"Philip Hoare has compiled the most complete of all the Coward biographies and I think I have read them all save Cole Lesley's.

These teachers were from both Southern and Northern temples and taught a blend of styles from those temples. The lessons, philosophy and teachings that were instilled in me have had a life long impact.I was hesitant to buy this book because of a number of negative reviews I read on thisr forum. It was not until I did purchase and read this book did I realize all the negative comments had been made in light of comparing Shaolin to what one experiences today in martial arts gyms. Or by comparing the book to what is coming out of China's Communist state run newly created Shaolin Temples. The Chinese government has \\"restored\\" several of the temples and now have \\"warrior monks\\" traveling around the world performing for money. They even have branch temples here in America. The so called monks are nothing more than actors who perform an acrobat art called Wu Shu, which was invented by the Communist government in the 1950's.When I read this book it was as if I had stepped back in time and was listening to my teacher. This book portrays the essence of Shaolin philosophy as it has been preserved by its monks for centuries. I did find some minor differences, but that is to be expected. If you are truly interested in what genuine Shaolin is about, regarding its philosophy as well as the styles of Wugong (Kung Fu) that was taught then pick up this book and read it carefully. I am happy that somebody is preserving the true history, art and philosophy of Shaolin."},{"Title":"The Shaolin Grandmasters' Text: History, Philosophy, and Gung Fu of Shaolin Ch'an","review":"I have this book and it's definitely a very interesting read especially for those unaware of the significant link between the practice of Shaolin martial arts and the practice of Chan Buddhism.But like many books on Shaolin (and martial arts in general) it is largely based on hear-say: stories and legends told to them by their instructors or stories that were picked up in other \\"English\\" martial arts books. And they are very common Shoalin \\"legends\\" found in many texts and heard in many schools, here at home and abroad in Asia. And when compared to actual historical facts, those stories just don't hold up. Which was the same problem with another interesting but weak Shaolin title \\"Shaolin-Do: Secrets from the Temple\\".The greatest deficiency of this book is it lack of an academic level of historical research in Chinese. How you can write a book about Shaolin and not have even one reference to Kang Ge Wu's work, as he is THE most prolific martial arts historian in Asia. His seminal work, \\"Complete Authentic Chinese Wushu\\" http://plumpub.com/sales/chinese/chinbks_trad8.htm is a phenomenal resource on the origins of nearly every martial art style of China. And then there is his English book \\"The Spring and Autumn of Chinese Martial Arts - 5000 years\\" which documents very clearly the historically significant points of martial arts for the past 5000 years. And most disturbing is the absence of Shi De Qian's life's work \\"The Shoalin Encyclopedia\\". How could these significant resources be missing from their reference list? Was anybody doing any research outside of their comfort zone?There are many other historians they should have researched before this was published such as Ma Ming Da, Xu Zhen and Tang Hao to name a few. And that's my biggest complaint: the lack of an Academic level of research. Martial arts writings have come a long way and have become a significant topic of research and become more historically accurate. So I'd recommend Meir Shahar's book \\" The Shaolin Monastery: History, Religion, and the Chinese Martial Arts\\" as that has a significant level of solid research.I don't want to dismiss this book entirely though. It is an entertaining read with a lot of good insight on the significance of Buddhism in the practice of Shaolin martial arts. Which, among English titles, is rare to find and refreshing to see. But it has some glaring faults that really pull it down from its potential height of success."},{"Title":"The Shaolin Grandmasters' Text: History, Philosophy, and Gung Fu of Shaolin Ch'an","review":"I've been studying Buddhism and practicing Kung Fu for over 10 years, and this book is the best source I've found on the history and philosophy of the Shaolin order. Some readers may be made skeptical by the anonymity of the authors, or may naively think that the \\"real\\" Shaolin monks must be in China. However, the reasons stated by the authors for fleeing China jibe well with historical fact, and the their views on the essence of Buddism vs. the practices of the various sects are right on target.(Recommended reading: \\"The Buddha Speaks\\" + anything by the Dalai Lama) The authors are also very modest and realistic with respect to the certainty of the claims in this book. The more I read, the more I become convinced that the authors of this book are the real deal.I have the utmost respect for the Kung Fu of the Shaolin monks on tour with \\"Wheel of Life\\". In fact I own a copy of the DVD. Their Kung Fu skills are nothing short of inspiring. However, anyone who understands Buddhism would realize that touring the world to attain honor for one's self or one's country is a contradiction to the basic goal of any Buddhist: abandonment of the ego. This is not to say that the monks in China are not true Shaolin at heart, but only that they have compromized on some aspects of the Shaolin way for (probably pragmatic) reasons that those outside the temple could only speculate about.My advice: Be equally skeptical of all sources, READ THIS BOOK, and then decide for yourself."},{"Title":"The Shaolin Grandmasters' Text: History, Philosophy, and Gung Fu of Shaolin Ch'an","review":"I bought this book because I have a keen interest in Kung Fu, and wanted to gain more insight into the historical and philosophical background of the Chinese martial arts.Initially, I was rather sceptical of the book because it was from a group based in the pacific NW in the US. I though, \\"uh, oh - what have I just bought?\\" However, after reading several pages I began to realise that I had just bought a gem. The book gives a good insight both into Shaolin Zen (Ch'an) philosophy, and into the historical reasons of why the \\"authentic\\" Shaolin now reside in the US and not in China. There is also some discussion of some basic techniques and training, although this is not the focus of the book. What I like about the book is that it is well-written in a non-evangical tone. The underlying principles of self-knowledge and respect, as follow by Zen Buddhists, comes though in the text.If you are interested in some philosophical background to the Chinese martial arts (specifically Shaolin Gong Fu) and wish to know more about Shaolin Zen Buddhism, then this book is for you.

Most of the information we've had on Shaolin has come to us filterd through the Chinese government's censorship.The rebuilt temple is little more than a tourist attraction and combat kung fu is still forbidden.This book written by the Order of Shaolin Ch'an is based on the last true abbot of Shaolin, the 2nd highyest ranking monk, and the abbot of Fukien temple's teachings. The three grandmasters escaped to the U.S. with lower ranking monks to practice the traditional teachings and kung fu of Shaolin.In this book those who practiced under them now share the true history, philosophy and fighting styles of pre-communist Shaolin, and dispel many of the misconceptions that grew out of films and Chinese government censorship."},{"Title":"The Shaolin Grandmasters' Text: History, Philosophy, and Gung Fu of Shaolin Ch'an","review":"This book is unique in that it focuses more on the system of belief used at the Shaolin Temple than on the martial arts that are practiced there.

I found myself, as a Christian, having little , if any, trouble accepting their philosophy. There were so many similarities I sometimes thought they were quoting from the Bible. It really helped me increase my level of compassion and peace. As a Praying Mantis kung fu stylist and American karate black belt, I found the presentation of Shaolin martial arts to be highly informative and accurate. I strongly suggest any martial artist, kung fu or karate, purchase this book, not only for its technique and exercise instruction, but also for its help in making us more responsible as we gain martial skills. I am a better martial artist, and person, for having read this book recommended to me by my Praying Mantis instructor Chuck Shultz."},{"Title":"The Shaolin Grandmasters' Text: History, Philosophy, and Gung Fu of Shaolin Ch'an","review":"I waited for the Grandmasters Text with great anticipation and was not disappointed. I found the discourse on philosophy of Shaolin Buddhism very interesting (8-fold path is a quality path). The discussion of the communist regime's hijacking of Kung-fu and the Temple in particular is entirely unsurprising. As a decade long practitioner of Wing Chun, I found great interest in the dissertation of styles. Grading Systems were a minor point of interest. The focus on Bruce Lee as No.1 Wing Chun proponent seems a deliberate attempt to get the westerner interest. I would find great difference between the limited wing chun of Bruce Lee (though no doubt a proficient martial artist in his own right) and and historical patrons/heroes such as Leung Jan, Leung Bik (Fatshan). Whilst i understand the modesty and rejection of ego of the grandmasters, the absence of an author is always going to cast doubt over the accuracy/validity of the work.

The mystery to solve this time involves subterfuge and espionage.The story is told primarily through the perspective of the young, idealistic and terribly naiive Vanya Andreevna who has come to the Balkans to be nearer her earstwhile fiancee (and comrade-in-arms.)I thoroughly enjoyed the suspects, red-herrings and plot twists that Akunin threw in my path as I attempted to solve the mystery. What impresses me the most about Akunin, though, is how varied stylistically his books are. _The Turkish Gambit_ is very reminiscient of Doyle's Sherlock Holmes as opposed to his other novels. The writing (and translation) were elegant as well, which only served to be the icing on the cake.I highly recommend _The Turkish Gambit_, as I do the previous English translations of his work."},{"Title":"The Turkish Gambit","review":"For a short while this book puzzled me, because Erast seemed so much different from his character in the second book. Checking the dates in this book asnd the previously released one in this series, I finally realized that they were published out of sequence, and this book should have come out before \\"Murder on the Leviathan\\". Once that problem was settled, I sat back and thoroughly enjoyed the story set out before me. Erast is in the book, but the action doesn't revolve around him this time, but rather around the young Russian girl with whom he becomes acquainted. There's war and mystery and treachery and murder, all of the things that make thrillers so interesting, and a villain whose identity isn't revealed until almost the end of the book. It's well done, as usual, and I look forward to the next book in the series, and I hope that it it published in the right order!"},{"Title":"The Turkish Gambit","review":"Turkish Gambit is my second Boris Akunin novel having read \\"Murder on the Leviathan\\". This is nearly altogether a different style of story from \\"Murder\\" but a good one on it's own merit. \\"Murder\\" is more a fictional story ala Agatha Christe murder mystery while \\"Turkish Gambit\\" is more spy novel wrapped around a historical context. It is definitely a historical fiction novel rooted in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878. The facts of the war are fairly true to life from the Russian General Skobelev to the siege of Plevna and Akunin nicely weaves in his fictional characters into this setting. Surprisingly, Akunin's familiar Erast Fandorin character is not a major player but has a lead supporting role (the book jacket is a bit misleading in this respect since Fandorin is the most prominent figure on the cover). The book starts out good but get's a bit bogged down early in some \\"historical\\" background of Pasha's and Turkish politics and such. This part was a bit confusing and not very engaging but thankfully once you press thru it the story picks back up. Akunin seems to have most of his historical facts straight and has good character development(though the premise of this young Russian feminist seems to me to be a bit of a stretch but Akunin pulls it off well). The dialog is very good and engaging. Some of the Russian surnames are a bit hard to follow (now who was that again??) Personally, as a history buff I would've liked more detail on the war, why it occurred and details of the battle but the book does well without this. The mystery is there without being in your face and Akunin does a good job of \\"hiding\\" it until the end. Overall, another nice read from Boris Akunin. With this effort he has now made it on my \\"must read\\" list."},{"Title":"The Turkish Gambit","review":"After The Winter Queen, I was very disappointed with this sequal. More of a romance novel, the mystery doesn't even develop until about one-third of the way through. Then, it becomes a romance story/dialogue about the doldrums of Russian military camp life, occasionally punctuated by references to the actual mystery. There are only a handful of sections where the mystery figures heavily into the plot, and the story is mired down with many boring exchanges and side plots (not to mention several pointless characters). I hope Akunin writes another story like The Winter Queen, but if the rest of them come out like this, he will have at least one very disappointed reader."},{"Title":"The Turkish Gambit","review":"I picked up 'Turkish Gambit' while my stay in Paris. I have to admit, that it was a rather good book written on a subject (Russo-Turkish War) that I possessed a wealth of information about.However, I was disappointed about the lack of historical accuracy this book demonstrated. The author, Akunin, underestimates the Turkish defence of Plevna by suggesting that it was because of the work of a spy that the Turks held out for so long. Any military historian would know that this was not true. Instead of developing an intrigue story with real facts around it, Akunin changes reality in order to adapt it to his plot.The truth is, the Turkish defence held out due to: 1) better tactics on behalf of Osman Nuri Pasha 2) Better weaponry 3) Russian mistakes and 4) foreign support. Moreover, as Akunin suggests, the Turkish garrison DID NOT try to break out via the way it was stated in the book (attacking Russian besiegers with the deception of 'giving up).So, if you want to read a good mystery novel, than go ahead and read 'Turkish Gambit'. However, keep in mind that there are many historical flaws and counter-historical bits to the novel. But I simply ask you to not take this novel as reality!"},{"Title":"The Turkish Gambit","review":"I liked Winter Queen very much and Murder on the Leviathan not as much but this one ...

I was a fan of his other books but I just found myself thinking that \\"This is too much work and for what payoff?\\" Basically I would read the words but not be able to enjoy. Maybe it's something to do with the translation? Oh well, I'll try again with the next book."},{"Title":"The Turkish Gambit","review":"Boris Akunin's Erast Fandorin series has been spectacularly successful in Russia. Akunin's books have sold millions of copies there. Akunin, whose real name is Grigori Chkhartisvili, was born in (Soviet) Georgia. He grew up in Kazakhstan and then Moscow. Highly educated, Akunin was a student of linguistics, editor of a scholarly literary journal and a Japanese-Russian translator. He turned to writing these stories at age 40 during his self-described mid-life crisis. He saw a niche between the serious tomes that marked Russian literature (Tolstoy, Solzhenitsyn, etc.) and the mass market pulp fiction that dominated the low end of the post-Communist literary market. His book sales both in Russia and in Europe and the United States have proved him correct.Turkish Gambit takes place in 1877. Russia is at war with Turkey after Russia and Serbia came to the aid of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Bulgaria in their struggle to free themselves from rule by the Ottoman Empire. The war had important implications for all of Europe. The war was concluded at the Congress of Berlin, a congress that pretty much stripped the Russians of the gains they had made in the war. The Congress of Berlin humiliated the Russians and paved the way for future unrest in the Balkans that eventually led to the First World War. Newspaper reporters and others (including assorted spies) flocked to the battlefront from all over Europe. This is the historical context in which we find Fandorin and the Turkish Gambit's cast of characters.The story centers on a young lady, Vavara Surovova. Like many children of the Russian aristocracy she considered herself progressive, smoked, enjoyed the pleasures of the flesh, and had a great disdain for Tsarist rule. Nevertheless, she decides to travel from Moscow to meet up with her fianc&eacute;, a Russian officer serving in the corps of cryptographers. No sooner does her journey start than she encounters a life threatening situation. It is here that Fandorin makes his initial appearance. Although she has no small amount of disdain for the man who rescued her they make their way to the front, near the town of Plevna where the Russian army is laying siege to a Turkish stronghold. As the story progresses Vavara soon becomes the focal point not only of the romantic advances of the soldiers and reporters encamped near Plevna but also of the spies and counter-spies who are trying desperately to influence the course of the war. The intensity of the story and Akunin's writing builds as the siege reaches its conclusion. As was the case in both Winter Queen and Leviathan nothing is truly as it seems and the layers of mystery created by Akunin are peeled away slowly by Fandorin. Akunin does an excellent job in maintaining the mystery throughout, even for those very familiar with plot devices and red herrings in stories of this sort.One of the more interesting aspects of this series of books has been the marked change in the style of each book. Winter Queen may be described as an action-adventure yarn with the young, optimistic and idealistic Fandorin racing from pillar to post, Indiana Jones-style, saving the world, or at least Moscow from some spectacularly murderous evil-doers. In Leviathan, we see a more subdued, thoughtful Fandorin playing the role of Hercule Poirot in an Agatha Christie parlor mystery. Fandorin was not center stage but would appear at critical moments to use deductive reasoning to advance the story and solve the mystery. In Turkish Gambit we see Fandorin in 19th-century spy mode reminiscent of Joseph Conrad's Secret Agent. Fandorin is more involved in the action than in Winter Queen but is placed a bit off-center as Vavara and her mishaps takes center stage.Turkish Gambit should not disappoint any Akunin fan that has been awaiting the publication of his third story in English. The Turkish Gambit is a highly enjoyable period piece marked by good writing and better than average characterizations. Turkish Gambit is the third Erast Fandorin mystery series translated into English, following the publication here of Winter Queen and Leviathan. However, Turkish Gambit was the second in the series published in Russia. For those new to Akunin's Fandorin mysteries I suggest beginning with Winter Queen, followed by Turkish Gambit and then Leviathan.So far there are a total of eleven Fandorin mysteries published in Russia. Akunin has also written another four books in which Fandorin's grandson is a detective in contemporary Moscow. I eagerly await the publications of these volumes. Turkish Gambit was a delight and I do not hesitate to recommend it to anyone interested in a good yarn."},{"Title":"The Turkish Gambit","review":"I purchased the Turkish Gambit because the novel takes place during the interesting but relatively unknown Russo Turkish War of 1877. The novel's backdrop is the memorable seige of Plevna, a bloody precursor to the trench warfare that Europe would experience during the Great War.The hero of the novel is Erast Fandorin an agent of the Russian Secret Police charged with shutting down the network of a master Turkish spy. The novel's greatest strength is the rich atmosphere in which Boris Akunin places his story. With its haughty noblemen,dashing hussars and cosmospolitan foreign correspondents, I was reminded of Agatha Christie's Orient Express.In my mind, The Turkish Gambit falls into the realm of the Victorian Adventure story. Like Harry Flashman or Sydney Riley, Erast Fandorin travels the Victorian world going from one adventure to the next. However, unlike Harry Flashman or a young Winston Churchill, Fandorin is never in the middle of the action. In this novel, he spends most of his time in camp searching for the Turkish spy. In temperment he is closer to Sherlock Holmes than Richard Burton. It may sound callow but I would have given this novel five stars, if Fandorin had been a more physical character. However, this is the first book in the series that I have read and I am impressed enough to purchase a second book.For anyone else interested in the Russo Turkish War, I highly recommend Captain R.W. Von Herbert's, \\"The Defense of Plevna\\", a first hand account of the seige by an Englishman who served as a Turkish officer. It is out of print but can easily be found. This is a well written account in the same vein as Winston Churchill's early books."},{"Title":"The Turkish Gambit","review":"Turkish Gambit is the 3rd novel in the Erast Fandorin series published in English (after 'The Winter Queen' and 'Leviathan'), but actually it's the second in the series.The book takes place during the Russian-Turkish war in the Balkans and follows the real events, mixing fact and fiction seamlessly.There are several things which, I think, contributed to it being published after 'Leviathan'. First - the hero of the series, Fandorin, is not as much of a central figure here, as he is in previouse books. Second - this is more of a war story, then a detective story. There is a search for a spy in the Russian camp, but mostly is about men (and a woman) at war. As a result, the book does qualify as a mystery, but just barely. As was said before (by me, and other reviewers), each Fandorin novel is different in style, and explores another sub-genre of mystery literature. It helps the series remain fresh, but it also can put off some readers, who prefer their mysteries to be more standard in structure:mysteriouse and/or horrible murder - detective takes the case - a pretty girl, related to the victim - some missing files/jewelery/artifact - a chase - some sex - a fight - girl is kidnapped - the villain revealed/girl saved (not saved if she is the villain) - the end.Sadly, while this book is not formulatic, the marriage of detective fiction and war fiction here is not as exciting and easy-going as the other Fandorin tales. Still, even when this novel drags a bit, it isn't lacking in style.The war of Russian Empire with the muslim Turkey gives Akunin a chance to speak some thoughts of the West-East conflict in general. These thoughts can be relevant to the current situation in the Middle East, but I have to point out, that in reality they are about Chechnya (the book was written in late 90s).P.S. A movie version of 'Gambit' was released in Russia just two weeks before the 1st American edition of the book, and it was an immediate box-office success. If you like the book, you would probably like it, too."},{"Title":"The Turkish Gambit","review":"Not as good as 'The Winter Queen' or even 'Murder on the Leviathan' (which I did not like all that much).Had a hard time keeping track of all the characters and military movements.I'm very disappointed, as 'The Winter Queen' was so entralling; a classic mystery if ever there was. Unfortunately, this series seems to be going precipitously down hill with each succeeding book.BUT... I hope the next one will be better."},{"Title":"The Turkish Gambit","review":"If you haven't tried an Akunin mystery do yourself a favor and order yours now. This is one of the most charming and delightful series I've ever read and I can't possibly enthuse about them enough. From absolutely out of nowhere this series popped into my life and now, after blazing through the first four available in English, I am wistfully sitting around waiting for the next seven to be translated from Russian. I am not quite sure how I stumbled on to these but I do know it was through rummaging around Amazon somehow. Kudos to whoever brought these to my attention. If you like History, Mystery, fun and aventure, you'll love the Fandorin series. It's something of a cross between the Prisoner of Zenda, Sherlock Holmes, and Agatha Christie only a lot more exciting and dashing.The year is 1877 and Mother Russia is at war with the Ottoman Empire (the book is fascinating simply for the explanation and history of this conflict which I had never even heard of before). Varya, an attractive young lady, steals away from Moscow to the front lines to be with her husband, a young communications officer. She gets somewhat lost in the Balkans, and nearly comes to a bad end in a seedy bar but for the timely intervention of Erast. They don't much like each other these two and both have to be rescued shortly afterwards by a Russian general and some foreign press corps. Arriving at HQ, Varya's husband is promptly denounced for espionage and Erast Fandorin is ordered back into service to uncover plots against the Tzarist war effort.This is a wonderful novel of war, romance, dash and pomp, battles won and lost, duels fought with swords and wit, set against the backdrop of the Balkans in conflict. Two vanished, but resonantly fabulous societies, the Imperial Russian and the Ottoman Empire, have at each other, flailing away with all the strength of punch-drunk boxers in the 14th round, both in the waning years of the 1800's and in the waning years of their empires. Against this backdrop, a bitter and demoralized Erast, still reeling from the assasination of his wife, must once again put his heart and mind to work for the sake of Mother Russia, foil the ploys of Ottoman spies, uncover the deviltry in HQ, clear the name of Varya's husband, while at the same time doing his damndest to avoid being caught up in the idiotic pageantry and pomp of the times. A first class and first rate tale for lovers of History."},{"Title":"The Turkish Gambit","review":"'The Turkish Gambit' continues the career of erstwhile Russian police detective Erast Fandorin in this the third in Boris Akunin's distinctive mystery series (which is wildly popular in Russia). The book is set during the 1877-1878 Russo-Turkish War (the Russian and Ottoman Empires fought some 11 wars altogether and this was the last one, excepting WWI).Fandorin, now in the Russian Army, but still stunned from his tragic loss in 'The Winter Queen' (the first book in the series), takes a back seat for most of the book to the primary narrative voice of the young radical Varya Suvorova. As usual Akunin's tale twists and turns with delightfully chameleon-like characters. The book's denouement centers on the Siege of Pleven - was a traitor providing information to the Turks? Or perhaps a murderous spy was afoot? Or was it just bad strategy implemented with poor tactics by the Russians?Actual historical characters such as the 'White General' Mikhail Sobelev mix with Akunin's inconstant inventions in a complex web of international warfare and intrigue. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Turkish Gambit","review":"I was disappointed in this second book. The voice of Erast was what made the first book so enjoyable in this one he has been silenced in favor of a rather annoying shallow girl."},{"Title":"The Turkish Gambit","review":"In this book (the 2nd of the series but the 3rd to be published in the U.S.), young 19th-century Russian police detective Erast Fandorin is recovering from the devestating tragedy at the end of the first book, \\"The Winter Queen.\\" Author Boris Akunin seems to deliberately take the focus off Fandorin and onto the proto-revolutionary damsel-in-distress Varya. Varya pursues a hapless fiance to the front of a Russian-Turkish war, and encounters Fandorin as he must uncover a saboteur in the Russian ranks. As in Winter Queen, Akunin stylishly conveys the culture of 19th-century Russia and has a tight rein on his plot, although the Russiain patronymics take some concentration on the part of the reader.Fandorin's emotional detachment is the believable result of what he went through in the first novel, \\"The Winter Queen,\\" and is all the more intriguing for being distant. As a result of this device a lot of Fandorin's brilliance happens off-screen, so to speak, reported only after the fact. Because of this, Fandorin seems well on his way to being more like Sherlock Holmes - brilliant but emotionally unconnected to everything around him. Readers will have to wait and see, it seems, whether Fandorin is doomed forever to a lonely life.Definitely wait to read \\"Turkish Gambit\\" until you've read \\"Winter Queen\\" first, or Fandorin's detachment will make him seem unsympathetic rather than sad."},{"Title":"The Turkish Gambit","review":"Boris Akunin is the best. I love every single novel about Erast Fandorin. He's an amazing character, such a perfect gentleman, every woman can dream about."},{"Title":"The Turkish Gambit","review":"Like other reviewers, having enjoyed \\"Winter Queen\\" and \\"Leviathan\\", I had looked forward to reading this. But the author has lost his touch. His detective-character, Fandorin, is absent for most of the story; when he does appear it is to deliver some ponderous speech. Instead, the main character is an uninteresting young woman.About a quarter of the way into the book (I was reading it on Kindle), there is a long and confusing digression which just slows down the action. The denouement comes not in action but in other lengthy speeches.His previous works counted as literary \\"thrillers\\", but there are no thrills here. I am left wondering if Akunin was instead trying to write a historical novel about the Russo-Turkish war of the late nineteenth century. If so, it fails on that count too, being far too confusing and, in fact, uninteresting.I'm giving it two stars, but that may be generous."},{"Title":"The Turkish Gambit","review":"The Book Report: Erast Petrovich Fandorin, titular counsellor of the Tsar's Special Branch (secret police, ugh), finds himself in the thick of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878. In a manner very like that of a skinny, stammering love-child of James Bond and Nero Wolfe, Fandorin arranges things so that the party responsible for the sudden and inglorious halt of victorious Russian armies to Constantinople, long the most urgent desire of Imperial Russian froeign policy, comes inevitably to light. His newly minted assistant, the silly and delightfully idealistic Varvara Andreevna Suvorova, takes the center stage for much of this wild, careening caper; a good choice for misdirecting attention, that, and yet the author *scrupulously* plays fair and puts all the clues before the reader...yet Varya's goosey honkings about irrelevancies and her young woman of middling class and wealth scruples, presented with great and genuine affection by the author, do screen the actual malefactor's malefactions quite neatly. One scene, a sword-fight, is particularly nicely handled; Varya's emotions of fear, disgust, and slightly tickled vanity (it's over her honor the parties fight) are so believable that it's hard to imagine the author hasn't had the same thing happen to him. (I doubt much that it has, though.) Quite a wonderful piece of writing (and translation), and not the only one.My Review: All hail friends with reading addictions! My friend's praise tipped the scales for me, causing me to get these books. I don't regret this, though I am sorry that I waited so long. Still, that means I've got a lot of time before I run out of them! There are over ten in the series so far.Very high-quality escapism, written and translated very ably, and presented in a point-of-view that's different enough to make the well-worn genre of lone wolf solves problems for Big Government, and then runs away from the limelight, feel fresh and new. Recommended to all who have a yen for solving puzzles...I didn't figure this one out until halfway through!"},{"Title":"The Turkish Gambit","review":"Don't beleive anyone who dumps this book. It happens to be quite good, can be little confusing due to similar sounding Russian names and also the fact the story is mostly told from a woman's point of view. However, the writer did fail to give a more nuanced characterization to the woman's character. Or it was severely edited...Do read Jason Goodwin's Yashim Series if you wish to know more about the Ottoman Empire in the 19th Century.."},{"Title":"The Turkish Gambit","review":"\\"Gambit\\", literally \\"tricking somebody\\" is usually applied to military operations or chess strategies. In order to achieve the ultimate win some losses have to be accepted along the way. Both contexts fit here beautifully. Boris Akunin, Russian pen name of Georgian writer Grigory Chkhartisvili, has taken an actual episode from the 1877-78 war between the Russian and Ottoman empires to spin yet another successful yarn around young Erast Fandorin, secret agent in the Tsar's Special Division. The author fills a niche market in Russia, as he himself sees it, between the serious literature of the likes of Dostoevsky and Tolstoy and the usual light detective stories of today. For the international reader this new genre of Russian \\"espionage mystery\\" - the subtitle of the original - in a specific historical context is a fun read that at the same time provides some insights into the society of the day.At the end of the previous, first novel in the series, Winter Queen, Erast Fandorin's world was shattered; the repercussions of the drama seem to have resulted in a change of character. Now, he tends to stutter and is introvert and reserved. Has he lost his detective's touch as well? En route to the Russian military command headquarters outside Plevna, in Bulgaria, where a secret mission has sent him, he literally stumbles across Varvara Andreevna Suvorova. A vivacious and \\"modern\\" young woman, she is intent on following her fianc&eacute;, a volunteer soldier and cryptographer stationed at the same camp. Varvara, Varya for short, takes over as the primary protagonist of the narrative and Akunin exquisitely develops her character and describes her increasingly important position among the expanding entourage of admiring men. One of these is Sobolev, the White General, for the Russian reader easily recognized as General Skobelev, the real-life hero of the battle for Plevna. For the Turkish side, Akunin also bases some of his characters on actual personalities in the conflict. Furthermore, he introduces an illustrious retinue of international journalists, who mingle with the senior military and are \\"embedded\\" at the front lines. Akunin's subtle sarcasm at their doings and mishaps shows through and gives the story a certain actuality to current issues surrounding media observing military conflicts. The drama builds when it becomes evident that a saboteur must be at work: Russian attack positions are pre-empted by Turkish troops. Can the culprit or culprits be apprehended before more lives are lost? Like at a treasure hunt, Akunin leads the protagonists and the reader on a few wild good chases. Will Erast Fandorin's ingenuity and sharp deductive talent, help or hinder the investigation?Erast Fandorin has become a household name in Russia where millions of copies of each Akunin book are sold. The English speaking world is slowly catching on with now eight novels available in translation. This highly entertaining, this fast moving, action-packed and character-rich story, the second in the series, will delight any reader, beyond the already established Akunin fans. The author brings the intricate Russian historical events of the late 19th century to life with wit and a great sense of irony and humour. [Friederike Knabe]"},{"Title":"The Turkish Gambit","review":"Akunin is a great writer who tells historically-based tales that combine a mystery with the timing of a thriller. His books are a delight and this one is no exception."},{"Title":"The Turkish Gambit","review":"Turkish Gambit directed by Dzhanik Faiziyev is an vivid film protrayal of this wonderful Russian noevl. The acting is great and the stars, Yegor Beroyev (as Erast Fandorin) and Olga Krasko (as Varvara Suvorova) play their roles flawlessly. I enjoyed the novel and was overjoyed to find this DVD which is in Russian language but has Chinese subtitles. I highly recommend watching this film. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Turkish Gambit","review":"This was my first encounter with the writing of Boris Akunin, and it was almost my last. He started to lose me early on, and by mid-book I was about ready to give it up. There were too many characters and none of them had much personality, although the historical setting was interesting and informative. I am glad I stuck with it, because the second half was an intricate and exciting search for an undercover agent. Akunin clearly has intelligence and talent, so I'll try another of his books."},{"Title":"The Turkish Gambit","review":"My wife got me this book. Although the historical time frame, 1877 siege of Plevna, was of great interest to me, I was a little hesitant to start the book since I wasn't familiar with the author. Once I started though, couldn't drop the book until I finish. Five stars."},{"Title":"The Turkish Gambit","review":"This was the first Fandorin I've read and believe it or not the best book overall in quite a while. It is precisely to my taste, somewhat in the vein of G. MacDonald Fraser's \\"Flashman\\" books humorous historical-adventure-romance -wise. Loved the way the heroine was able to cleverly get through to the end with no sex at all. That aspect alone set this storytelling apart from the vast mainstream of the flooded fiction market. Can't say, really, how faithful the translation may or may not have been (much less the historical accuracy) but the language was HIGHLY readable and even more so enjoyable. I immediately ordered the previous 2 books for myself, and I'm definitely recommending the Russian versions available on Amazon to my friends."},{"Title":"The Turkish Gambit","review":"This is the first book of Akunin I read and I found it very good. It is essentially a spy thriller with the story built around the Russo-turkish war of 1877-78, which ended with the liberation of a great part of the Balkans (and especially Bulgaria) from the turkish yoke. One of the most dramatic moments of that war was the siege of Plevna where Osman pasha pinned down the Russian Army for 143 crucial days. Looking at those events through the eyes of a young lady who travels to Bulgaria to meet her fiance, Akunin weaves a fine story of mystery, courage and betrayal with many unexpected turns and twists untel the end. The characters are well presented, as well as the atmosphere of the era where the extreme violence in battle went hand in hand with the noble courtesy to women. A nice adventure with some dose of Balkan history."},{"Title":"The Turkish Gambit","review":"Four stars is based on the character of Fandorin and the potential he has. I also enjoyed the writing style and I think that this works well as a 19th century mystery. It is enjoyable reading. The mystery itself, however, is not terribly engaging. For the most part, it seemed more like a 19th century artistocrats' social club, but with only one lovely lady to go around. The promise of international intrigue didn't quite develop. Fandorin, however, seems like a fascinating character and the real mystery is why the \\"principal\\" character isn't present very much. I've looked at other mysteries and yes, Fandorin does live up to his potential. I will read more books by this author but I would not suggest this book as the intro."},{"Title":"The Turkish Gambit","review":"My first Akunin book, so maybe that was the problem. I had trouble keeping the characters straight and often had trouble plowing through the prose. Maybe it's just not my style."},{"Title":"The Turkish Gambit","review":"She's young, beautiful - and abandoned. Varvara Suvanova, a \\"modern woman\\" in late 19th Century Russia, has been deserted by her \\"guide\\" in a remote Bulgarian inn. Rescued - in a manner of speaking - by a diffident, but clearly significant, middle-aged man, Varya quickly finds herself embroiled in a web of war, intrigue and contrary values. Russia is [again!] at war with Turkey, a conflict viewed with concern by the European Powers - especially Great Britain. Varvara is seeking her fiance Pyotr, who is a cryptographer at Russian military headquaters. Her rescuer, Erast Fandorin, is a man of mystery, and Vavara is brought into his machinations by becoming his assistant. With this opening, Akunin launches a tale of Chekhovian proportions. In fact, describing this book as \\"Chekhov light\\" would be fitting.A dispatch concerning Turkish military dispositions around Plevna launches the complex situation embroiling Varya and Erast. Hardly equipped to deal with state secrets, she can only mourn the easy victory that became a disastrous rout for the Russians. How did the Turks manage to intercept the battalions before they were even disposed for the planned assault? On this question, the entire story pivots as it becomes increasingly clear that the defeat was neither chance nor hinged on superior Turkish military skill. Something else is involved, here, and Fandorin's job is to determine what that is and who might be responsible.As this story progresses, each new character is introduced with his [they are all men] pedigree trailing along behind. You can almost hear the military fanfare for each officer, and national anthems for the Europeans. For there are \\"observers\\" resident at this headquarters to report on activities. There is the Frenchman \\"Paladin\\", the Britisher McLaughlin - who is actually Irish, and a Bulgarian nobleman. Varya is continually plagued by indecision as to her role in this conflict. She doesn't wish to be treated as a \\"frail female\\", but is insulted when proper deference to her gender isn't given. She has no nursing skills, breaking into tears at the sight of wagonloads of wounded. Resentment at the hierarchical structure of Russian society is offset by her patriotism for the Motherland. The challenges are many and varied - more than once leading to fatalities.While all this sounds terribly grim and foreboding, Akunin keeps the pace fast and the dialogue rich and delicious. It's hardly an example of Slavic despondency usually encountered in Russian fiction. The author is writing to a new market in Russia - middle class readers seeking entertainment without it being farce. Without contrivance, he keeps the reader smiling at Varya's struggle to maintain her self-generated identity. Her foil is Fandorin, who, although hardly an easily defined character, keeps offering surprises for her to cope with. Not the least of which is what drives him to his feats. A fine tale, well worth any reader's time. Fans of intrigue will find it a real gem. [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]"},{"Title":"The Turkish Gambit","review":"Even though this is the third \\"Erast Fandorin Mystery\\" to be published in English translation, it was the second written by \\"Akunin\\". Because of the way the series is written, the occurances in \\"Murder on the Leviathan\\" do not in anyway suffer from this out of chronology publication. Nothing that happens in 'Gambit' change the way you would read 'Leviathan'.Once again our intrepid young (twenty-one) adventurer is working for the 'third section' (diplomatic intelligence) during the Russo-Turkish War in 1878 helping to liberate Romania and Bulgaria from the Ottoman Empire. The war had been going well until the army arrived in front of Plevna where for some reason the 'Turks' seemed to know exactly what the Russians planned to do (sometimes even before the Russians did).Erast has been ordered to find out if there is a traitor in the Army and if not, how the Turks are getting their information and from who. Our young man has been saddled with a young 'modern' Russian woman (Varvara or Varya) who had traveled to Bulgaria to be with her 'future fiance'. Erast doesn't lack for suspects and is led a merry chase by the actual culprit who constantly is able to remain one step ahead of him. But as in all great stories good triumphs and the bad guy is caught and brought to justice. Erast then goes off to Japan (where his sea voyage is the scene of \\"Murder on the Leviathan\\").This series is in many ways a parallel to George MacDonald Fraser's \\"Flashman\\" series. They both occur around the same time (mid- to late- nineteenth century) and use the \\"Great Game\\" in Asia between Russia and Britain for their background. The difference between the two series is that Fandorin is truly an intelligent man. He is articulate and well read, whereas Flashman is a comedic figure who is always finding the diamond in the manure pile he has fallen into.Unlike Flashman, Fandorin is more historically tied into the period and much less broad in satire. Flashman is much more polemic in the way that both the main character and the British as a whole are treated, more of the Moliere type farce. Fandorin on the other hand is more of a Pinter or GB Shaw, tongue-in-cheek (wink, wink, nudge, nudge, know what I mean) and is more subtle in it's skewering of the other characters. At this time only five of the eleven books have been translated, but it's worth looking out for each new volume as it comes out."},{"Title":"The Turkish Gambit","review":"I found this on a remaindered table and was pleasantly surprised. The Turkish Gambit, somewhat stuffy in its presentation (in a nineteenth century sort of way), is in fact a breath of literary fresh air. The mystery central to the storyline, such as it is, arises from the question of who is the Turkish spy, Anwar-effendi, who is running the Turkish secret service and making a fine hash of Russian battle plans in its mid-ninteenth century war with the Ottoman Empire?The \\"Serbian volunteer\\" Erast Fandorin, the protagnoist in this tale, is secretly attached to the Russian secret service and is, in fact, a rather distant, enigmatic figure who seems to mostly lurk in the background, observing, thinking but engaging in little interaction with the others in this tale. Nor are we treated to much information about his working out of the problems he's confronted with, as he struggles to figure out just how close their clever Turkish adversary is.The inevitable murders don't actually begin until well into the book and then they happen quickly as the Russians find the Turks blocking their every move. Who is Anwar-effendi and how is he disrupting Russian war plans? These questions are less important in the end than what his game is. In fact, it's not so difficult to guess his identity. It's all but given away in one surprisingly swift scene midway through the book when the noble villain briefly steps out of character to demonstrate unlooked for prowess in a certain martial skill. But what makes the story surprising, even so, is to hear his confession regarding what he is actually after at the end.The story is ultimately rather thin (weak characters and a somewhat underdeveloped plot) and it takes a while to get going. But it's fast moving, once it does, as it proceeds to provide us a fascinating glimpse into the world of nineteenth century European politics from a Russian perspective. It successfully melds a vision of nineteenth century Russia and eastern Europe with a 21st century post-Soviet understanding of the dynamics of historical events which had Russia and other European states of the time in their thrall.As a mystery it's not that difficult to second guess. As a window into another era this book's a charmer. Intelligent, ironic and solidly rooted in the age it portrays, this is precisely the sort of historical fiction that deserves to be called that.SWMThe Fencing MasterThe Name of the Rose: including Postscript to the Name of the RoseHercules, My ShipmateThe King of Vinland's Saga"},{"Title":"The Turkish Gambit","review":"The Turkish Gambit is the third Fandorin story published in English, but chronologically it is the second tale following on from the events of the Winter Queen and proceeding the voyage to Japan as detailed in Levithan.One of the reasons that I enjoy the Fandorin series is that in each of the stories Akhunin seems to write in the style a well known mystery writer. Where the Winter Queen was for a me a homage to Ian Fleming and the James Bond series, and Levithan was drawn from Agatha Christie, for me the Turkish Gambit owes its style to Baroness Orczy and the Scarlet Pimpernel.The story chronicles Fandorin's participation in the Russo-Turkish war of 1878-79 as an unofficial intelligence officer, assigned to capture a Turkish say operating within the Russian headquarters. The narrator/ view point character of the Turkish Gambit is not Fandorin but rather Varya Suvorov. A rather innocent and idea idealistic young woman ho has travelled to the front disguised as a man to be with her fiance and who is enlisted to act as Fandorin's secretary. As the story progresses Varya finds herself surrounded by active heroic men who are vying for her affection but is slowly drawn to the quiet unassuming and obviously emotionally damaged Fandorin a seemingly humble man who is governed by logic but who proves himself again and again to be the most perceptive and aware of the stories participants."},{"Title":"The Turkish Gambit","review":"This is the first novel written by Boris Akunin. I was very pleased! The story, which takes place during the Russian Turkish War of the early to mid 1870s is, as another reviewer pointed out, a rather Victorian mystery and is filled with action. The author does a wonderful job of character development and his twisting plot line keeps the interest of the reader from cover to cover. It of course is impossible for me to compare this work with the previous works of this author, as I have not read them, but after completing this one, I certainly plan to. Unlike many translations of other work I have read, this is not stilted or forced and flows quite naturally. I must admit that I did have trouble keeping up with all the Russian names, something I always have trouble with when I am reading Russian history or other works by Russian authors, but by the second chapter this all came together. I will say that the reader with some knowledge of this time period, and has some knowledge of the geographical location, will probably get more out of the book than a reader who does not. This is not a major problem though...a good detective story is a good detective story.

Nonetheless, this is one author whose worst work is better than most others' best. On a recent plane trip to Seattle, I found two of the four stories merely diverting, and the other two equal to his best.&quot;The Partner&quot; is a grim tale of human weakness spiralling down to a predictable horror; whereas his humorously baroque &quot;The Inn of the Two Witches&quot; reminds me in its tone of Washington Irving in LEGENDS OF THE ALHAMBRA, though set in a later time period.What happens when you fall so deeply in love so fast that you can't act to save your life? Conrad gives his answer in &quot;The Planter of Malata,&quot; in which a successful loner named Renouard confronts the yawning vastness of an empty life. Felicia Moorsom is a bit two-dimensional and a prim and proper Victorian to the nth degree. This tale is a psychological thriller that does not let you breathe until the last line.The final tale -- &quot;Because of the Dollars&quot; -- is my favorite. It reminds me of ALMAYER'S FOLLY and OUTPOST OF THE ISLANDS with its shallow-draft vessels penetrating into the heart of remote islands. Captain Davidson is a classic Conrad hero caught in a trap: How he manages to escape it at the cost of a wife who doesn't love him and, by the way, his ability to smile is one of the author's most perfectly taut stories.It is amusing to read Conrad's preface to the stories: He seems to be wincing excessively in response to early criticism after circulating the stories to his friends. Needless to say, his friends were over-critical: WITHIN THE TIDES struck me as a treasure that I had somehow overlooked all these years."},{"Title":"Within the Tides: Library Edition","review":"Leavis called this \\"shockingly bad magazine stuff\\" (The Great Tradition), but I don't think it can so easily or contemptuously be dismissed. I would describe it as middling work, in between Conrad's best work and his worst work.

So the only thing I read was the 20 Questions with Harrison Ford, an article on Larry King and he had some great stories to tell during his years as a radio interviewer. The Music Poll results, Playboy After Hours, Sports, Men, Women, Dear Playmates and the Playboy Forum were the only article that I read and I found them to be much more interesting.As for the three pictorials, the one on the China Dolls was the best followed closely by Vanity. Eloise Broady - Playboy Playmate of the Month for April 1988 was an outright disappointment. Only in one picture is she semi nude and in the rest and that includes the main picture she is wearing clothes and there is no nudity.

Troy Aikman (Dorling Kindersley Readers). New York: Dorling Kindersley, 2000. HB, 48p., illus. list: 12.95, ISBN: 0-7894-6376-8This picture-packed bio traces the life of legendary QB Troy Aikman, from his boyhood in Southern California, to his struggles and success at Henryetta HS, OK.Troy first went to college at the University of Oklahoma, but transferred to UCLA after a year. He was more successful at UCLA, winning two bowl games, and becoming the Dallas Cowboys' No. 1 overall draft pick in 1989. Troy and the Cowboys struggled for a few years, but he then led the team to three Super Bowl wins in four years from 1992-1995. The Cowboys made the playoffs three more times in the latter half of the 90s, but did not return to the Super Bowl.One very nice feature of this book is the chapter on Troy's charitable work, much of which benefits young children (the primary audience for this book).Fred Goodwin, February 4, 2008"},{"Title":"A Brighter Dawn","review":"From the back cover:She picked up a rifle...and began a battle for love.Boston heiress Verity Talmadge marched into the one place a true lady dared not go--the Union Army's muddy, rancous campsite in Falmouth, Virginia. She had come to accuse Major Garrett Knox of being the Confederate spy who had caused her new husband's death. But no one would listen to her--a well dressed woman in buttons and bows, even if she knew how to prove her mettle, given the chance. So, disguising herself by slipping into a uniform, Verity Talmadge became a soldier...Garrett Knox needed a sharpshooter for a dangerous raid, and the best man for the job was a woman--the new recruit he recognized immediately as the beautiful widow Verity. As desire stirred, he needed to win her trust, and soon he wanted to win her love. As the woman he adored and the war he hated marched ever closer on a collision course of glory and destiny, he could only hold fast to his dreams--of a land reunited, of a love fulfilled. And tomorrow, a brighter dawn.And my review:I cannot believe the rave reviews on this page. This book was silly, implausible, had awful characters, and to top it all off, was really badly written.First complaint: terrible writing style. The author likes to mix up lots of little sentence fragments with run-on sentences. For balance, maybe? It doesn't work. The end result is a choppy writing style that the reader is never drawn into because the sentence structure is so awkward. Also, the author likes to have tons of dialogue with no prose to balance it out. I often had to find myself counting the lines of dialogue just to keep track of who was speaking. I shouldn't have to do that.Also, the author jumped so immediately into the plot that it was very difficult to get a handle of what was happening. The characters kept alluding to past incidents, but the reader wasn't informed as to what the backstory was. I was left feeling as confused as if I'd been dropped in the middle of a jungle and left to find my way out without a map or a compass.And the characters! Poorly sketched, and the heroine was just awful. She was such a screeching harpy. Immature to the point of idiocy. And full of ridiculous accusations to top it off! She leaps to immediate conclusions, adding two and two and geting about twenty. Garrett Knox must be a spy because he has a distant family member who's fighting in the Confederate army? And if he's a spy (a very big IF), then he's the one responsible for her husband's death? That's the same kind of reasoning that got American-born Japanese citizens locked up in internment camps after Pearl Harbor--they must be all spies because of their ethnic background! Which of course is a ridiculous charge. And her husband's dying declaration was that Garrett Knox was NOT the one--yet she still believes that he is. Why?It just made no sense at all.This story was just so contrived. As if we haven't all read the \\"woman posing as a man\\" storyline a million times over. I don't mind reading a plot device that's been done before, as long as the author breathes new life into it. That did not happen here. I couldn't force myself to finish this book. It was just way too much work. Not recommended by this reader."},{"Title":"A Brighter Dawn","review":"Stobie Piel followed up her wonderful saga of confederate Jerod Knox and Pippa, with this incredibly written story of yankee cousin Garrett and &quot;watkins&quot;. Great romance, great action, great history and characters with a sense of humor. I've just finished it and know I'll re read it again soon. I am into &quot;civil war&quot; historicals and to that end have ordered and read a hundred to date and this is one of my all time favorites. (Jarod's story is also a good read and a keeper.) enjoy....and thanks Stobie. Great job."},{"Title":"A Brighter Dawn","review":"This one is a winner even if the heroine is a bit too spunky at times. The great hero and the wonderful Reb characters make up for her. &lt;g&gt; Garrett is a fantastic hero with an acerbic delivery to his lines that I loved. There is also a wonderful secondary love story between a war veteran who feels he has nothing to offer a wife and the woman who refuses to give up on him. Piel doesn't stint on showing war in its true light along with its effect on the soldiers who fight them."},{"Title":"A Brighter Dawn","review":"A Brighter Dawn is incredible! Talented author Stobie Piel tugs at the heartstrings and tickles the funny bone in this beautifully researched, masterfully written book on the Civil War. She resists the temptation of moralizing, while painting a vivid picture of the war's poignancy and heroism. If I were you, I'd run to get this book. Cherish it. Save it for generations to come. It's a tour de force by wondefully gifted writer"},{"Title":"Business Germany: A Practical Guide to Understanding German Business Culture","review":"After living in Germany for two years, I can honestly say thatthis book does not go that much into their culture and businesspractices'.It does provide a lot of generalities, and stereotypes. The set-up is good, American style on the left, German on the right. But for an American trying to understand German business practice, it will not give the 20/20 that a professional needs.It leaves out things such as business hours. Which can be rather fustrating for Americans that are used to 24/7. They cherish their Sundays, and have very short business hours the rest of the week.I was able to read this book during my train ride from Nurnberg to Bamberg, on a RE train that only covered 56K. Which means it is a relatively short book.The German culture is much more sophisticated then the image written in the book. A businees professional that reads this book will trip over thier feet if they follow the guidelines.Yes they are organized, and yes they like punctuallity. But they are extremely friendly, and most American customs are welcomed.If you are about to enter into a German business agreement, learn the language. Just trying to speak their language will go a long way. My last bit of advice is don't be put off if they smoke in their office."},{"Title":"Planet Earth: The Final Chapter","review":"I guys have not read the book. All I can say is that the Bible is clear the beast is coming from Iraq. We are on the third seal of Revelation - famine in the north country (Iraq) see Zec. 6 if you want to under- stand the horses of Revelation. Jeremiah 25:11 is abut the 70 years where Babylonian kngs will rule the nations. Do you realize that they still have about 3.5 years of that 70 years left? See Zec. 5 - wickedness will arise in the land of Shinar Check the verses in the Bible about the Assyrian and the land of Nimrod that God takes down in the end. Nebuchadnezzar will be the beast - He will rule Iraq at the 4th seal - the man who will be Chaldean see Hab. 2:3 - the vision Habakkuk saw is in chapter 1 and is for the time appointed at the end it shall speak. Nebuchadnezzar numbered 666 - the amount he owes for destroying the temple of God 666 talents of gold given to Solomon. the amount of the freewill offering. Solomon only recorded the gold - he saw novalue in silver. There will be NO pre-trib rapture. It is a lie the people not chosen by God have spread to deceive you. Paul said 2 Thess.2 let no man deceive you that day shall not come till and then he names the falling away (defection from truth) and the man of sin who will sit in the temple of God and show to himself that he is God. The time of the beast is not 7 years - he will have 1260 days. Satan is kicked out of heaven after he and his wicked angels war with Micahel and his angels and then Satan has 42 months and comes after those who have the testimony of Jesus Christ (the church). Why no rapture first? - because we are all to be changed at the time when death is swallowed up in victory - the time when no other Christians can die. We have to wait till the dead are raised of the just first and Job in Job 14:12 wrote that man lieth down and riseth not til the heavens be no more (so would be in the 6th seal - the heavens departed as a scroll that is rolled together. At the 7th trumpet when then it is time to judge (separate) the dead and time for rewards - see Rev. 11:18 - we rise with the two witnesses of Rev. 11. see Rev. 22:12 and I Cor. 15:54 The beast was and is not and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into perditon. see Rev. 17 - a king that was is coming back and he lived before the time of John. He is the yoke of iron prophesied by Moses - use the KJV and search this out. Nebuchadnezzar is coming with Judas Iscariot as the false prophet - don't be deceived."},{"Title":"Planet Earth: The Final Chapter","review":"Hal Lindsey is a great author, and this is another one of his good books. He has presented insightful information on how Israel was founded, and why it had to be re-formed. How all of our lives are entwined -- believers and non-believers alike. And why we may be the generation that sees the final prophecies of the Bible unfold before our very eyes.Yes, Mr. Lindsey can get enthusiasic at times, but he does not date set in this book, as is correct. He provides a background where the reader can compare today's world with what is described in Bible prophecy. Is time short, as Mr. Lindsey contends? It is for the reader to decide, but Mr. Lindsey provides compelling examples, that should have the reader searching in his or her own heart for a response.As for those who may criticize Mr. Lindsey's enthusiasm for Bible prophecy as believing that we shouldn't &quot;make plans&quot;, because Christ is coming back soon.... I don't think Mr. Lindsey actually means we shouldn't &quot;make plans&quot;, but rather we should live with a heightened awareness that the plans that we make may, or may not come to naught. (It doesn't mean you shouldn't plan!)If we are indeed the generation that sees the final prophecies unfold, and Mr. Lindsey provides insightful reasons as why we probably are, don't you want to know what to expect?"},{"Title":"Planet Earth: The Final Chapter","review":"I read this in one sitting. I think Mr.Lindsey has an acute awareness of occidental politics, and I could not put the book down until I finished it. I imagine Mr.Linsey would view this as a left handed compliment, since religious prophecy is, I assume, the driving force in his writings, and I am sure his loyal readers buy his books for this reason. From a prophetic view point (I read &quot;Late Great&quot; circa 1975) both of these books are also interesting because of his unpretentious writing style. While he cleary has firm religious beliefs (which I respect but do not always agree with) he does not write with an &quot;I know it all&quot; style, which is what turns me off with so many other authors who write prophetic books. I recommend this to anyone who is drawn to books that discuss religion and politics in a non-volatile (hard to do!) but right-to-the-point way."},{"Title":"Planet Earth: The Final Chapter","review":"Hal Lindsey presents the near future as presented in biblical scripture. The data is analyzed carefully against world events and the increased knowledge of these times. The layman terminology makes the book easy to read and the focus is that the Bible is a Heaven sent book with real phrophecy in it, and that the end-times described in the Bible are at hand. I could find no error in Mr. Lindsey's findings and analysis."},{"Title":"Planet Earth: The Final Chapter","review":"I read this book just about a month ago, and I am still telling people about it. If you are like me and wanted to know what is happening in the world around us, this book points right to what you need to know. I have several friends already reading it. What really amazed me is that this book was written in 1998, yet many of the things that were spoken of, they are happening right now. This book is a must read for anyone that you care about who's eternal future is not secured. This will make you and them re-think what you want to do with the small amount of time that we as believers have left on this earth. No one will want to be here during &quot;Earth's Final Chapter&quot;."},{"Title":"Planet Earth: The Final Chapter","review":"My dad recommended this book to me. I couldn't put it down!

The bestseller of the 1970s indeed! Once again he takes his notes from Dallas Theological Seminary and rehashes them. Never mind all of those prophesized events that never occurred. For thirty years this guy has been encouraging hate and suspicion of our neighbors, whom we are exhorted to LOVE. He, and the religious right, encourages increased nuclear armament as being &quot;God's will&quot;. How conveniently for him that he doesn't think he will be around to experience the devastation. Instead of bemoaning the state of the world and hoping for the end, why don't we encourage each other to work toward making it better? Oh, that's right, peace is just the lullaby of the Anti-Christ and NWO. Instead of demonizing one another, lets try some empathy. And also try to remember that the year 2000 is completely arbitrary."},{"Title":"Planet Earth: The Final Chapter","review":"I think people who are intersted in this book will realize two things after they read it. First, Jesus and the Bible are meant to guide you to be a good person, to do the right things, follow in His footsteps- not predict the apocalypse. Second, Hal Lindsey uses this book and his others to take advantage of people looking to God for comfort and direction. Before you believe any of this, read Richard Abanes' book, End Time Visions. Don't let this heartless man change your life and beliefs for another penny in his pocket. Read it. Don't buy it if you don't have to. See the lack of evidence and the way Lindsey twists and mutilates the Bible. You have more respect for the Bible than that."},{"Title":"Planet Earth: The Final Chapter","review":"Hal Lindsey is just another one of these doomsday crackpots that tries to get us all scared with meaningless quotes from the Bible.

Every time he comes out with a new book, his situations change according to the latest media-inspired panic. People who enjoy this kind of stuff, please understand that ever since Christ promised to return almost 2,000 years ago, people have been looking for signs that the end is near. Not a volcano can explode, not a sun can be eclipsed without some Chicken Littles running around and squawking doom. The fact that the Book of Revelation was obviously written by someone who intended Christ to return during his own lifetime 1900 years ago goes over too many people's heads. Stop dreaming about a nonexistent future paradise and start working on establishing one on Earth! I believe that's the message Jesus wanted to impart anyway."},{"Title":"Planet Earth: The Final Chapter","review":"How many kids quit high school in the '70s because of this false prophet"},{"Title":"Planet Earth: The Final Chapter","review":"Once again Hal Lindsey presents more totally unsubstantiated assertions that he truly believes are true. Apocalypse, Satan, angels, prophets, salvation. Lindsey believes, as do most rigid biblical believers that every single word in the prophetic bible passages is true. This book is more suitable to the magical mind of a person from the dark ages. Lindsey fails to raise the question of why God gave us critical thinking abilities if he just wants us blindly believe every human who dredges up some obscure quote from the bible."},{"Title":"Planet Earth: The Final Chapter","review":"That Hal Lindsey write how my people, the Jewish people have survived for millenia the attempted destruction and the abuse and humiliation at the hands of our enemies. That our survival is Biblical prophecy and that our ingathering is a millenial sign. Yes all this is true, it cannot be doubted. But what hurts me and hurts every Jew that I speak to, it the fact that Xians speak of all these pogroms and murders as if they were looking from the outside. If they only looked down at their hands they would see the blood of my people staining their finger nails. The fact that they so easily cast it off and give no second thought to their barbacity, and the murder and hatred of their ancestor is insulting. A fell good book for murderers and oppressor as so how all this was ment to be and the world is good. Yes we have survived the murders and the attempted conversion to a pagan heretic false god, and we have maintained to believe in the G-d of Israel, but no thanks to you and your people!"},{"Title":"Planet Earth: The Final Chapter","review":"Have Been learning about the Bible - Being Catholic I have never read or had any education about the Bible.

It also examines biblical prophecy and makes an attempt to look at where current events may play a role with prophecy. One of these current events is the Y2K scare, which we all know by now, didn't cause the level of problems that people were concerned about. It's a small portion of the book and certainly computer problems could still be a catalyst for future events from cyber terrorists or a loss of the internet altogether so the idea of computer problems can still be relevant. So if you read this book for any reason, read it for the historical insight on Israel becoming a nation. Other than that some of the material is slightly dated."},{"Title":"Planet Earth: The Final Chapter","review":"Mr. Lindsey's 'Final Chapter' continues his asiduous efforts detailing the finish of mankind's history.For all who are enamored of eschatological study and so benefited from the myriad chronicles of Hal, 'Planet Earth' provides additional enjoyment, edification and education as our world threads through the final tapestry of this age.One imagines that perusing these works in retrospect during the millenium will astound many at how close the Captain hove to the line as he sailed the course set before him.TL Farley,author,Distant Reaches"},{"Title":"Planet Earth: The Final Chapter","review":"This book helped me to understand things that I hadn't before...it made the Biblical references so clear that I can almost follow along in the Bible as I watch the evening news.

The multicultural representation of twins as well as the inclusion of which twin is older by how many minutes makes these full-page black and white photos exceptional works of art and study."},{"Title":"Mary Ellen Mark: Twins","review":"To the ninety-eight percent of the population who is not a twin, we often are curious about how twins cope with being known as a pair. Despite being different people, they grow up always having each other to relate to. It forms a bond unlike any that typical siblings are able to form.Mary Ellen Mark's fascination with twins has inspired a remarkable portrait series. Traveling to Twinsburg, Ohio, for their annual \\"Twins Day\\" festival allowed her to photograph hundreds of twins. In the two consecutive years Mark visited the festival she used a complex set-up for the seemingly simple aesthetic. Every detail is captured through the Polaroid 20x24 camera Mark used. Between the camera and dynamic lighting every wrinkle, toned muscle, body hair, and freckle is visible. Using the studio, all attention of the festival is lost. Instead the attention is given to the twins themselves. A thoughtful decision that emphasizes Marks pure interest in her subjects. The final pages of the book are dedicated to bits of conversation Mark collected after shooting the photographs. Each fragment from the conversations revels more about each pair connecting the viewer even more with every photograph.As part of the festival, participants dress alike emphasizing their already very similar appearances. Their outfits give us a glimpse of the personality and lifestyle traits each set shares. It apparent that a majority of the twins are aware of the camera and Mark takes it a step further by posing several of the sets to accentuate their costumes and relationships. The only sense of individuality is provided through the facial expressions and stances of each twin. Even that allowance of distinction is not always utilized, leaving them looking entirely identical."},{"Title":"Mary Ellen Mark: Twins","review":"Haven't most of the rest of us all wondered at one time or another what it would be like to have a twin? It is amazing that two people can look so alike. And we can only imagine that there is a closeness there that most of us never experience in our lives.Though a picture may not be able to get inside someone's mind, it can sure come close with the right artist and Mary Ellen Mark has an ability to see inside her subjects that is nearly unequaled. And that may be why I find these pictures of twins so compelling. Looking at these twins you cannot help but notice the similarities at first glance. And Mark's poses encourage this: symmetries and mirror images. But this is just a trick that lets her camera look beyond. The more you look the more the differences--wisps of hair, injuries old &amp; new, the twist in a smile--jump out and are moving.I am a big fan of photographic portraiture and Mark is an expert in the genre. In twins she has chosen a theme that plays to her strengths. I would encourage everyone who loves photography to take a look at her work. And once you've studied these pictures to your heart's content, take some time to peruse the excerpts from the subject interviews at the end of the book. It adds another dimension to what you've seen.

Nagel, Sander, Arbus .. and is a perfect example of the ability of the camera, in the right hands, to go beyond representation. You can usefully pour over these images of apparently identical human twins for hours, to explore the layers of difference, emotion, experience, all the traces that life leaves as evidence of living.It brings to mind Jean Cocteau's statement that after the age of 30 a person is responsible for their own face.

Why? Because it's much more than an assemblage of photos of twins. For instance, one shot shows a pair of handicapped twins who just happen to have as their day nurses another set of twins. There are other equally interesting shots in the book that make it worth having on your shelf."},{"Title":"Mind Over Water: Lessons on Life from the Art of Rowing","review":"A book that aspires to describe perfection better start with a sentence that aspires to perfection.This is how Mind Over Water begins: \\"In the darkness, deep in silence, the lights --- green, red, a few of white --- surge ahead, in the rhythm of breathing.\\"If this were a class, Butler could riff for 10 minutes on that line. For now, let's leave it at this: You're in a long, narrow boat, with a skin that's just one-sixteenth of an inch thick and oars that extend fifteen feet. It's 5:45 a.m. on an October morning in Boston. It's chilly. And you are about to begin a race that is the equivalent of climbing Mt. Everest. On a Tuesday morning. Before work. Just for fun.Okay, Craig Lambert, a veteran oarsman and a stylish writer, is a little bit crazy. Well, so are the best rowers. And so is Harry Parker, the Harvard crew coach whose exploits first got Lambert, a gifted amateur, interested in writing professionally about the sport.You never heard of Harry Parker? He'd be thrilled. Recognition is the least thing he cares about. He's single-minded about something else: winning. And win he does. He became Harvard's crew coach in 1963, when he was just 27. For the next 6 years, Harvard did not lose a single intercollegiate race. His crews won 18 consecutive races against Yale. His winning percentage from 1963 to 1997 is .806 --- he is, very probably, the most successful coach in any sport in the whole and entire world.Harry Parker has some voodoo wisdom that Craig Lambert has absorbed. And then there are the home truths Lambert's picked up himself along the way. Some samples:\\"Speed demands that we risk our balance. Velocity comes with volatility... That which is stable is slow.\\"\\"Being part of a crew makes the individual shine; in rowing you pull harder and longer that you could ever alone because everyone else in the boat is depending on you.\\"\\"My years of rowing in eights [eight-man boats] convinced me that to succeed in this world we must be willing to do whatever is required despite what our mind says.\\"\\"Sometimes the best response to stormy weather is to unleash your own tempest. It is one way to restore equilibrium.\\"\\"Grabbing an early lead costs energy, an expense that may later haunt the front-runner... In practice, Parker would remind his rowers that when opponents jump out in front, you must make them pay the price.\\"\\"To build a winning crew, select the right athletes, place them in the proper seats, and allow for the freedom to create. In other words, hire the right people for the right jobs and manage with a long, loose leash.\\"If you're employed in almost any organization Butler can imagine, he'll bet that last idea is one you'd like to print out and slip under the boss's door. That's light years away from the sport of rowing --- and yet it's not New Age, hippy-dippy sloganeering. What it is, Butler submits, is writing at a level we're not used to seeing very often: prose that yokes close observation of the real world with deep wisdom about the world inside.\\"We are out here in the darkness to reveal ourselves, to discover who we are,\\" Lambert writes. \\"With the oars, we attempt things that we cannot do, we confront that which is beyond our capacities. Mind over water. The shells transport us into the unknown.\\"It almost makes you want to get out there some early morning and see how far, how fast, how smoothly you could make a boat --- or, really, your life --- go."},{"Title":"Mind Over Water: Lessons on Life from the Art of Rowing","review":"\\"Mind Over Water\\" falls into the category of the memoir, highly personal and considered memories and musings. It's about rowing and, as the subtitle states: \\"Lessons on Life from the Art of Rowing.\\" If you don't like this kind of book, steer clear. You also won't like \\"Green Thoughts: A Writer in The Garden.\\" On the other hand, if you do like this kind of book, \\"Green Thoughts\\" is also recommended.\\"Mind over Water\\" is about rowing internalized, what it means to row and race and how these lessons can be applied to life. As such, its primary goal is not so much instruction as translation. And translations, of course, are never exact, which may account for some of the animosity of other reviewers.So what is \\"Mind Over Water\\" really about? It's not so much about rowing as it is about what rowing means to the author. As such, you can't really fault it for not being the book you might write about rowing or for not being an instruction manual. It has humbler ambitions. Think of it as an off-water musing.In any case, I liked it. And, yes, I had to get to get out the highlighter. Among those who like the book, everyone is going to have favorite passages, as some of these reviews attest. Here are some of mine:\\"Edges form outlines. If our boundaries determine our identities, then we learn who we are by finding our limits.\\"\\"Sliding between dark and shadow, between sunlight and the obscure, is the region of discovery.\\"\\"Staying on course limits your attention to the boat and its rowers, who are, after all, the motor that takes you there. The goal does not disclose itself until it is attained.\\"\\"Mistakes shine a spotlight on our model of reality and show us its flaws. Unexpected outcomes help us refine our picture of nature.\\"\\"Tall smokestacks rise from the powerhouse and waft plumes of smoke into the sky, the epitaph of fuel burned into power.\\"If this kind of writing disturbs or bores you, look elsewhere. If not, you might find \\"Mind Over Water\\" as enjoyable as I did."},{"Title":"Mind Over Water: Lessons on Life from the Art of Rowing","review":"I had fun with this book. As a rower who has been on national teams and medaled at the Olympic Games,I resonated with this saga of rowing and what it means to those who do it. Some sports books I have read take the perspective of the outsider, the spectator. In sharp contrast, this one comes from someone who has really &quot;been there,&quot; who has experienced training, racing, winning and losing. This is the real thing. The author extrapolates down-to-earth, practical experiences to worldly, spiritual, and even cosmic insights. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mind Over Water: Lessons on Life from the Art of Rowing","review":"I don't know when I've read a more unfortunately flawed book -- unfortunately, because while there are snippets of truly inspired writing in it, they are overwhelmed by too many examples of what Strunk and White have told us all not to do. The author, evidently a successful journalist, seems to lose all sense of restraint in the book-length format: pithiness is absent as points are belabored to death; metaphors are piled three- and four-deep until all sense of the original subject is lost; and a sense of appropriate diction is tossed out the window in favor of florid, show-off vocabulary that causes the reader to wince in sympathetic embarrassment. Perhaps most telling, the author never seems to find an authentic voice. Compelling books on sports have been written from the perspective of both the insider and the outsider; Lambert seems to try for both, and is convincing as neither. He drops the names of rowing greats he has shared the river with, yet never seems to find his own place as a rower, the level at which he can simply put his head down and work at it without concern for what others are doing. Constantly fretting at his own inadequacies and questioning whether he has any right to consider himself a \\"real athlete\\", he articulates a series of vague goals that are best summed up as a desire not to be last -- or at least, not last by too much. The result, for the reader, is to end up wondering why Lambert is in this endeavor -- rowing or writing -- and if the author himself doesn't seem to know, why should the reader care?"},{"Title":"Mind Over Water: Lessons on Life from the Art of Rowing","review":"This book is a gem: beautifully faceted, rarely found, and precious to keep. Craig Lambert is as skillful a wordsmith as he is a rower, and reading his intelligence at work on what it means--and what it takes--to master this sport is a delight. One of the pleasures of Mind Over Water is the way Lambert teases insight out of all aspects of rowing, as in his perfectly pitched meditation on balance in the section called &quot;Equinox&quot;: &quot;balance is no settled state: it is alive, dynamic, constantly emergent. Even those ideal moments when our boat sets up perfectly, flying across the water in silent, level splendor, only mean balance now. A second later, we must take the next stroke.&quot; Lambert is a transcendental rower, and he brings an Emersonian eye to the mind-body connection, as in this, one of my favorite passages: &quot;The shell responds to motions of the body. The body follows the dictates of the mind. Hence the boat reacts to the rower's mind: when your mind quivers, so does your shell. . . . Conversely, a quiet mind levels the boat; stillness settles the body, and the shell, relaxing into agreement, takes the quietest, fastest route through the water.&quot; Lambert moves easily between the sublime and the prosaic, and when it's time to evoke the need to push the body to do more than it wants, he brings wit and humor to the task: &quot;Don't tell me that this isn't the finish line, I think. This has got to be the finish line; I am already on my fourth wind and there is no way I can row another hundred feet, let alone another mile.&quot; And when he does finish, &quot;I don't know about Tom [his rowing partner], but I have accomplished the impossible--several times over. Never mind that we were amazingly slow: we did it.&quot; Lambert has asked himself since childhood, Am I a real athlete? In other words, he's the perfect guide into the elemental and rarefied world of rowing. For those of us whose exercise regimes haven't been more ambitious than step classes, free weights, and weekend hikes, Lambert makes such a place accessible to the imagination. Mind Over Water is funny, profound, earthy, contemplative, even exhilarating. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Mind Over Water: Lessons on Life from the Art of Rowing","review":"I generally read fiction for entertainment. And, in fact, generally loathe books anywhere in a stone's throw radius of the personal development genre. However, Mind Over Water really touched me. Lambert's insights are packaged in such a way that they both are easily absobed and entertaining. I'm buying a copy for each of my closest friends with the suggestion that they read it once per year, about 5 pages at a sitting."},{"Title":"Mind Over Water: Lessons on Life from the Art of Rowing","review":"An on-again-off-again oarsman, I can appreciate Lamgbert's lyrical rendition of the sport and overlook its technical inadequacies...this is a great quick read. His philosophy may not stay with me, but the model will - a middle aged man drawing deeply from the nourishment of a great sport."},{"Title":"Mind Over Water: Lessons on Life from the Art of Rowing","review":"This book is a joy on several levels. Lambert writes a moving and educational tribute to the great practitioners of rowing, a sport of ancient rhythms and timeless beauty, and illuminates a number of unique personalities from the sport. He also tells a tale of personal awakening through his own participation in the sport, and speaks for &quot;everyman&quot; as he describes his middle-aged struggles to achieve athletic grace. Lambert's dry wit and keen eye for detail create some unforgettable and often hilarious images! And on a third level, Lambert extracts many intriguing insigts about teamwork and personal discipline which readily apply for any of us in our daily lives, and in our greatest personal dreams. Well done, Craig! A compelling and ultimately joyful jewel of a book."},{"Title":"Mind Over Water: Lessons on Life from the Art of Rowing","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and its musings, although I suspect that much of my appreciation can be explained by my: (1) being about the same age as the author; (2) having rowed occasionally and run daily along the Charles River; (3) having attended Harvard College and having heard much about Harry Parker and some of the Ivy League's great rowers; (4) having read &quot;The Amateurs&quot; and a number of other books on crew; and (5) appreciating good writing, no matter what the topic. Like some, but not all of the other Amazon reviewers, I found Lambert's analogies and life-lessons cogent and reaffirming. If you share any of my propensities, I highly recommend the book!"},{"Title":"Mind Over Water: Lessons on Life from the Art of Rowing","review":"Every so often I find a book that actually opens my eyes. Craig Lambert's \\"Mind Over Water\\" is one of those books. When I was first given it, I wondered what a memoir about rowing would have to say to me when the closest I'd ever gotten to rowing was riding in a glass-bottomed boat one summer in childhood. Within the first three pages, I understood. And I was hooked. It's hard to call a meditative memoir a page-turner, but this one is. I hated putting the book down, so hungry was I for Lambert's next graceful thought, his next provocative insight, his next flash of wicked humor. Yes, this little gem of a book is about the fascinating world of rowing and rowers, it's about feats -- both large and small -- of heroic and brilliant athleticism; but it's really about so much more. It's about the stuff that makes us alive."},{"Title":"Mind Over Water: Lessons on Life from the Art of Rowing","review":"I am a experienced rower in CT and I love this book. My dad bought it for me. It talks about rowing in a philosophical way. Well, I like this book because it is saying rowing is a mental sport aswell as a physical one. It is! No one can question me on that point. I have been into rowing since I was 4 years old. My older brother rowed and I would go out into the launch with the coach and get to tell him what to do. There I learned how to be a coach. I have been rowing for years. I row 2 seasons out of the year and run the other 2. At my high school we only have rowing in the spring and summer. I love the sport very much. This book is a GREAT book for rowers of all levels. So the next time you are about to do a race piece remember to relax your body not your mind. You need to keep your body relaxed even when you are start with a 36 and then your cox is telling you to do a power 30 at a 32, your legs are tired from the the start you did and your hands are bleeding because of the blisters on your hands. Yes, I have had the dreaded blisters. But after toughing my hands up instead of blisters I have calluses which are no better. Well, at least they don't hurt! HA!HA!HA! This book reminds me a whole lot of my summer coach, back to back '95(Finland) and '96(Scotland)lightweight women's pair world champion Ellen Minzner. It has really changed my mind about rowing, and now I row better because I have seen rowing through a different light. So I would recommend this book for rowers of all levels(club or world champions)."},{"Title":"Mind Over Water: Lessons on Life from the Art of Rowing","review":"Lambert's account of his return to rowing is like the Shell Game, more appropriate for the uninitiated. Lambert's account is a little better because it is more philosophical. While his inspirational messages do have their merits, Lambert spends much of the last part of the book discussing the inspirational techniques of Harry Parker, someone he's never really met. After paying him so many compliments the book seems stale."},{"Title":"Mind Over Water: Lessons on Life from the Art of Rowing","review":"Craig, just do not tell me that it is not about winning the race and that the gold medal around your neck is not the most divine feeling on Earth! What you fail to point out is that it takes some talent in addition to lots of hard work to get there. That talent is &quot;a gift of God&quot; and if you have it, it can turn you from a novice to an Olympian rower in only 2-3 years. It takes a great coach to discover and nurture that talent, and that is why my favourite parts of the book are your descriptions of some charizmatic rowing coaches from US."},{"Title":"Mind Over Water: Lessons on Life from the Art of Rowing","review":"I'm new to the sport, and unlike the reviews above I was NOT all that enthralled by this book. Go read &quot;Rowing Against The Current&quot; is you want good literature. I felt Lambert was always reaching to show he knew something (or looked it up for the book) more than expressing himself. Better reads for action include &quot;The Amatuers&quot; and &quot;Shell Game&quot;"},{"Title":"Mind Over Water: Lessons on Life from the Art of Rowing","review":"Lambert heaps pop philosophy with a shovel in huge, syropy dollops in this discursive essay on the sport of rowing.

Not terribly original and the philosophical ideas lack focus and are not integrated."},{"Title":"Mind Over Water: Lessons on Life from the Art of Rowing","review":"Though drawn to Lambert's book as an amateur sculler, I saw any value of his informative dribbles on rowing repeatedly negated by his arrogance in offering Lessons on (Leading a Self-Absorbed) Life.

I am a parent of 3 children who are rowing. The book helped me understand their sport and their passion for it. I also run a business. The book makes wonderful analogies about the application of individual and group efforts to the overall success of any undertaking. Its a great book to pass around the office. Craig is very insightful in this book. After reading it you will want to take up the sport of rowing or at least better understand how the principles learned in rowing can be applied to the rest of your life. The book is short. It can be read quickly. But you will find yourself going back to reread many of the pages."},{"Title":"Mind Over Water: Lessons on Life from the Art of Rowing","review":"For someone who has come to the sport of rowing at a relatively late stage, Lambert offers a remarkably perceptive insight into what motivates competitive oarsmen, their fears, aspirations, joys and pain. He elucidates particularly well the different mind-set of the single sculler as against the crew oarsman, demonstrating clearly the existence of a 'sport within a sport'. There have been a number of books on rowing - it is rare and refreshing to find one written by one with journalistic skill."},{"Title":"Mind Over Water: Lessons on Life from the Art of Rowing","review":"Not being a rower and never having been in a racing scull, I did not expect6 this book to hold my attention like it did. I had trouble laying it down. The suspense in the race which Lambert outlines so beautifully held me spellbound. The lessons in life which were outlined were beautifully phrased. I really think this book could be a best seller if it is promoted properly."},{"Title":"Mind Over Water: Lessons on Life from the Art of Rowing","review":"Other readers have criticized the author for being self-centered and somewhat uninitiated. In fact, this book is much more a series of intellectual/autobiographical essays than it is a book about rowing. This book is cerebral in exactly the way that rowing is not. In a way, Lambert's approach resembles the overthinking that many rowers have to conquer in order to compete well. As a portrait of the sport, it is mediocre, or worse. As a Montaigne-like series of essays which uses rowing as a metaphor, it succeeds fairly well. My guess is that people who enjoy personal essays will enjoy this book; serious rowers looking for a book about rowing will often find it unsatisfying."},{"Title":"Mind Over Water: Lessons on Life from the Art of Rowing","review":"Craig Lambert's Book 'Mind over water: Lessons on life from the art of rowing' attempts to explain how rowing can be a metaphor for life. 'attempts' being the key word there. Being a rower myself, I found that his ideas were so far fetched and in some cases I had no idea how they related to both life and the sport of rowing that we both share. I had to skip over many of the parts that were wordy, and it seems many of the paragraphs could be re-written to be half the length. I am not an english Major, but I did notice that he Author has not organized his thoughts very well. I found that one idea many times did not follow the next. Lambert included some unecessary bits of information such as where he played as a child, and much about his career as an adult. As much as I disliked Craig Lambert's book, he did at least use the correct rowing terminology. But all in all I would not reccomend ambert's book to my fellow crewmates."},{"Title":"Mind Over Water: Lessons on Life from the Art of Rowing","review":"Lambert is well informed about the people and places of the New England rowing scene through the 60's 70's and 80's. These were the years that Harvard's Coach Harry Parker transformed the sport, producing teams of highly consistent, superb performance. CRASH-B, the ergonometer competition was started during these years. And the Craftsbury Common Sculling Center trained thousands of people, who otherwise would not have rowed. There is much here about learning and practicing the sport as an adult. Where the book wanders from its purpose is in the attempt at mysticism. We are treated to quips about zen buddhism, tai chi, and the conclusion references the central metaphor from Carlos Casteneda's fictional shaman \\"Don Juan\\". These are presented as if they were received wisdom.There is unquestionably something elegant and poetic about the sport, captured since the 19th century in the paintings of Thomas Eakins and observed by most anyone who has watched crews, doubles and single sculls emerging from the morning mists of the Charles River. To dress this up with vague references to eastern religion, and the alleged words of an imaginary Yahqui shaman undermines Lamberts serious purpose. This said, the book offers direct observation of many of the critical years of the recent development of the sport in New England, and is worth reading if only for that reason. It is a sport with much quiet beauty and few have written, not just about the method of rowing, but the context of the community of rowers. The silent company of these people is one of the principle reasons to row. And this Lambert captures nicely."},{"Title":"Mind Over Water: Lessons on Life from the Art of Rowing","review":"I have read several books about rowing, and this is the first book I have read that approached this sport from a philosophical standpoint. I enjoyed his accounts of racing, because I have been there. However, to an experienced rower, his technical descriptions were extremely redundant. I would recommend this book to someone new to the sport."},{"Title":"Mind Over Water: Lessons on Life from the Art of Rowing","review":"Lambert's account of rowing, though seemingly poetic to the uninitiated, will dissappoint any avid rower for its sheer lack of &quot;having been there&quot; sentiment. The book is Lambert's chance to spout off about the magic that he sees in rowing and how lessons learned in the sport can be applied universally to any challenge in life. If you can look past his arrogance, without hesitation I recommend the book to non-rowers or novices who will see Lambert's lessons for what they are worth. But I strongly warn off any experienced or competitive rowers because you will be disgusted by Lambert's butchery of the sport. Try The Amatures instead."},{"Title":"Mind Over Water: Lessons on Life from the Art of Rowing","review":"This will be a short review. To use an example visit the sample extract that is offered on this web site. The author mentions a double head. He builds it up as something mythic and impossible. This is a joke. Six miles is nothing. Just nothing. Its a warm up for some. Sports writing is not easy but effort should be made to represent the true hardships of a sport, because if you fake it you also fake the joy that can be derived from the sport. Rowing is tough and you learn a lot about yourself from it but limiting it to oh its really cold in the morning and the hagiographies of US olympians is boring and misguided. I suggest Lambert visit a few more boat clubs."},{"Title":"Atoms,","review":"Very informative when it comes to chemistry."},{"Title":"Writing Game Hb","review":"The Writing Game is a complete single volume course on creative writing.

Multi-piece patterns are ready to copy and work on because the seam allowance is already included, and the pieces are separated. Block size is clearly stated. The block directions consist of a color photo of the block, a written list of the joining sequence for the pieces, and an exploded view of the pattern. Very easy to follow, although, I would recommend SOME paper piecing experience before attempting curved seams, or multi-piece patterns.At the end of the book are 8 amazing projects, with full color pictures, and very complete instructions with lots of drawings.You'll have a hard time choosing where to start :).All of the blocks except 2 (flower pot and picket fence) contain curved pieces. There is a learning curve to doing curved piecing (pun intended, lol), just as there was a learning curve to doing paper piecing. (I'm not very good at it yet, but I'm still trying, hehe). This book is about the technique of paper piecing curves, and thats what the projects include. If you are willing to learn a new technique and if you like nature designs, then I think you will enjoy this book and the projects it contains.

The primary author, J. Joseph Dunaway, who served as guest curator of the original exhibition, deftly handles complex and often difficult concepts in a narrative that beguiles the reader without compromising the intention of the creator of the brilliant and complex paintings. The artist's biographer, Anne Holliday, has contributed a lively profile of Stowitts rich in dance, art, and film history spanning the Jazz Age to the Atomic Age. Together these authors have admirably restored Stowitts to his rightful place at center stage of mid-Twentieth Century culture.

Although he wanted to return to Germany, because of his escapee status he had to live amongst the Bedouins for several years. The author wrote a very entertaining story of his life as an ill-supplied doctor treating suspicious tribesmen, and describes his efforts in helping them smuggle opium into Cairo. He meets with Banna (leader of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt) and is hired as a doctor for an Arab military unit fighting the establishment of an independent Israel. He notes his experience in watching several minor battles with Israeli patrols. He describes the fleeing of Muslims from Jaffa being caused by: \\"Fear of their own bullying and cruel compatriots spurred them to leave home and property, not less than the imminent occupation of the town by the Jewish besiegers\\" (p. 185). He describes his meeting with the anti-Zionist Grand Mufti of Jerusalem.

Yep, I'm hooked!"},{"Title":"More Quizzles: Logic Problem Puzzles","review":"Many of my math teachers in high school used to give these out as extra credit assignments or assignments to fill the time for students who finished tests early. I always looked forward to these puzzles as a student, so when I became a high school math teacher myself, I knew I had to start looking for this book as well as \\"Quizzles\\". It took me a while to find out the title (by Googling \\"logic puzzles\\") and even longer to find a new copy of the original \\"Quizzles\\" book [...].After our first unit test this year, I gave each student one of the basic puzzles as an assignment and they fell in love. Now I have students asking me for them at least 2 or 3 times a week.I recommend this book to any and all middle/high school math teachers who want to help students improve their logical reasoning (or anyone who enjoys logic puzzles) using a fun little game!If you're looking for more of these kinds of puzzles, check out [...]. They have a few for free online, as well as a catalog of older books you can order."},{"Title":"Egmont Passage: Tale of the Seventh Mystery","review":"This is a great book for kids who like adventures, or for kids who like to learn history in a fun way. This is the perfect book for homeschoolers. I live on the opposite coast, but learned a lot about Florida's history and geography. It would be really fun for kids who actually live in that area, because they could identify with some of the places, and follow the mystery much more closely. It makes the reader want to visit the places where the events are occurring. I thought the characters were realistic and well-developed. My only negative comment about this book is the type-face that was chosen. I thought that made it more difficult to read. Everyone should read this book!"},{"Title":"Living with Sheep: Everything You Need to Know to Raise Your Own Flock","review":"I got it for my son and it is very helpful. He mentioned it in a phone conversation or two."},{"Title":"Living with Sheep: Everything You Need to Know to Raise Your Own Flock","review":"Yes, the book arrived in good time. Content is as expected, simple, precise and informative.The problem is our copy. It's pages are beginning to separate and fall out as we read it. By nowit's much too much hassle to return it. Who's to blame? I don't know, but the binding is inferiorand the book will be ready for the trash as we read each page and it falls to the ground."},{"Title":"Living with Sheep: Everything You Need to Know to Raise Your Own Flock","review":"Thank you for writing a great book. This really will answer all your questions and teach you things you never even though of"},{"Title":"Living with Sheep: Everything You Need to Know to Raise Your Own Flock","review":"I truly enjoyed reading this book. I have no clue about sheep but have been contemplating trying them out of our pasture. This book is a great beginners guide to all things sheep. It is not an in depth text book style book but one that will give you great general knowledge for sheparding. I really loved reading all the different real life experiences that are found in it."},{"Title":"Living with Sheep: Everything You Need to Know to Raise Your Own Flock","review":"I have read several books in preparing for my new herd. This one gave me what I believe to be the best and easiest information."},{"Title":"Living with Sheep: Everything You Need to Know to Raise Your Own Flock","review":"I really enjoyed this book - the author hits all the fundamentals of raising sheep including but not limited to choosing your animals, fencing, handling, health care, births, and slaughter. I even had some good laughs as he describes leading this flock around with a bucket of grain because I have done the same thing with a herd of Brangus cattle. I could get them to do almost anything I wanted with patience and a treat of grain. My approach to cattle raising was much the same as the author's for sheep - free range, grass-fed, and minimally medicated. I very much appreciated the \\"The Shepherd's Year\\" calendar of tasks. This is an easy to read synopsis of what needs to be done and when. Picking up on someone else's comment about the book - you don't have to slaughter your own animals to be a farmer or rancher or put up your own fences. I raised cattle for 5 years and was forced to sell the herd because of the 2011 drought - not everyone is physically capable of putting up thousands of feet of fencing nor do they care to personally slaughter the animals they have come in contact with daily from their birth!"},{"Title":"Living with Sheep: Everything You Need to Know to Raise Your Own Flock","review":"I very much enjoyed reading this book. I have been considering raising a few sheep and this was my first book on the subject. I believe the author was very thorough and detailed in writing about the joys and headaches of owning your own flock. I am prepared if I decide to go forward and become a shepard. At least I will know what I am getting into! Nice photos and references too."},{"Title":"Living with Sheep: Everything You Need to Know to Raise Your Own Flock","review":"Living with Sheep is beautifully illustrated and well written. It is both enjoyable and educational.

You learn from the author's mistakes and knowledge. Recommend this book for everyone."},{"Title":"Living with Sheep: Everything You Need to Know to Raise Your Own Flock","review":"I loved this book. It was an enjoyable read, and really gave me the information I need to proceed on my path toward raising my own flock of sheep....... Lot's of common sense advice, and hard won experience from this author. The book is filled with wonderful photos of handsome sheep."},{"Title":"Living with Sheep: Everything You Need to Know to Raise Your Own Flock","review":"An enjoyable book that covers, in its eleven chapters plus appendices, most of the topics a prospective sheep owner would want to find. I offered my copy to an animal lover who had no intention of raising sheep because I thought they would appreciate it for the entertainment value and writing style.The breeds of sheep pictured (clear color photographs for a change) and discussed are written from a strongly New England (Vermont) perspective. This can of course be good or bad, depending on the reader. A twelfth chapter covering sheep breeds suitable for terrains, climates, shelter requirements, parasites, and pasturing styles found elsewhere in North America (it's a big continent!) would be a useful addition.I recommend this book not as the sole reference for a novice who is preparing to raise his own flock, but as a highly readable, entertaining overview of the essentials of raising sheep and harvesting their wool and meat, written with a lot of heart.I must end on a sour note: I demoted this book one \\"star\\" after learning the publisher saved a few cents by having it printed in China."},{"Title":"Living with Sheep: Everything You Need to Know to Raise Your Own Flock","review":"I used to work on farms and have dealt with sheep over years as an assistant. I've purchased a small farm and want to start of with a couple of dozen sheep and eventually maybe have a few hundred.This book was a real inspiring, detailed, easy-to-read, humble, rich and fun introduction to everything about keeping sheep. It gave me confidence instead of listing problems and hazards, yet brought to surface the reality. It covers every aspect of keeping sheep, from growing grass to butchering animals. The book doesn't go into detail about possible health problems and doesn't cover in detail how to machine-shear a sheep, but truly teaches you everything you need to keep sheep, and more inspired me to get sheep and is a really good starting point. It also gets your foot inside the trade, and then you can get one of those nifty 800 page sheep-health encyclopedias and discuss advanced topics with your vet after reading this book and getting a few sheep.I'd recommend this book to anyone with the slightest interest in sheep or farming. You don't need any experience to read this book, and I never had to go back and read a section over again, unless only to laugh about something twice. Neither is English my mother tongue, and I was new to all English sheep terminology as I approached these pages."},{"Title":"Living with Sheep: Everything You Need to Know to Raise Your Own Flock","review":"The basic premise of this book is, if you like sheep you can buy some from a neighbor or friend - pg.6 - which contradicts the sub title, \\"everything you need to know.\\" The exception being HOW TO BUY SHEEP other than neighbors or friends. A better title/descriptor of this novella might be, In Vermont we buy our sheep from friends and this is how much fun you can have with them! There is some basic info about what this guy does with his sheep. Scant info about breed specifics and veternary concerns."},{"Title":"Living with Sheep: Everything You Need to Know to Raise Your Own Flock","review":"We purchased this book because we are thinking of buying a farm and having sheep, amongst other animals. This book is enjoyable to read and full of great information. It is helpful to learn from the mistakes of others so you do not have to suffer the same learning pains. Like I said before, this book is not just informative but a pleasure to read which is not true for other books like this. Also, there are some wonderful photos. They author and photographer clearly enjoy what they are doing and pass that feeling on to the reader. We would highly recommend getting this book if you are interested in getting sheep."},{"Title":"Living with Sheep: Everything You Need to Know to Raise Your Own Flock","review":"My father passed away a few months ago and I was asked by our local library to choose a book to be donated in his honor. I was so excited to find this book because dad dedicated his life to raising his Suffolk flock, and didn't retire from the sheep business in Iowa, until age 93. Since I was raised on a sheep farm too I know what type of book I was looking for. One that would be interesting to an audience of all ages, educational and including all aspects of raising sheep. This book is easy to read and filled with beautiful colored pictures, and very affordable. It is just the type of book that dad would have enjoyed reading. I recommend this book to everyone that is seriously interested in raising sheep or just wants to learn more about them. I only wish the book was larger to show off the wonderful pictures, coffee table size, and was in hard cover."},{"Title":"Living with Sheep: Everything You Need to Know to Raise Your Own Flock","review":"I have a small spinner's flock & this is my favorite sheepy book. It doesn't have every single detail you'll ever need, but it does include everything you need to get started, and it's very readable, unlike most animal care books. Funny and realistic, highly recommended for the would-be small scale shepherd. (I also loved LIVING WITH CHICKENS.)"},{"Title":"Living with Sheep: Everything You Need to Know to Raise Your Own Flock","review":"In his introduction, the author states his desire for this book to provide clear answers to all the questions one would have when first stepping into the sheep world; answers which he found it difficult to find when he was first starting out. With that in mind, here's some thoughts:The Good:-I believe the author achieved his stated objective. He sticks to the basics, such as housing, fencing, lambing, and vaccines, while purposely avoiding advanced topics such as breeding.-He includes many stories from his own beginning experience, with some humorous anecdotes thrown in.-He doesn't try to scare the newby away with details about everything that could go wrong, pointing out that while it's fine to be aware of such things, most will never happen. He goes on to provide suggestions for caring for your flock that will help minimize the chances of those problems arising.-The book is filled with beautiful pictures and printed on high-quality stock.The Bad:-With a few exceptions, the beautiful pictures are almost entirely unrelated to the text. I like looking at pictures of sheep as much as the next person; however, if the text is talking about fencing, I want to see good and bad examples of the various types of fencing. If the text refers to trimming hooves, I expect to see pictures of the types of tools used and those tools in action. Etc.-Printed in China?! I don't care how nice the quality, if I had known beforehand that this book was printed in China I would not have purchased it. My recent purchases of books printed here in America have been priced similarly to this one, so why?Summary: As stated in the title, this book is great for anyone new to sheep. It answers many basic questions ignored by other references, and is written in a warm, engaging style. Still, I can't get past the fact that it's printed in China, so I can't in good conscious recommend it. Had it been printed in America I would have given it four stars."},{"Title":"Living with Sheep: Everything You Need to Know to Raise Your Own Flock","review":"A friend suggested that I take a look at this wonderful book. It gives you the first hand insights of a couple who moved to a small farm and took the plunge of raising sheep. That sounds pretty strange, but being someone who took the plunge, moved to a farm and started with goats it made plenty of sense.This book will give you all the reasons why you want to raise sheep. The types of sheep there are as well as insight into whether you are raising your sheep for meat, wool or just the plain fun of having sheep.If nothing else the pictures are amazing and well worth the price of the book. But I believe that you will enjoy reading about the personality of sheep, their &#34;stupidity&#34; that actually comes out looking pretty brilliant, and the fun that an owner has in building relationship with his or her flock.Animals have a wonderful way of settling you down when you are upset, giving you the love that no one else gives you, and they do it unconditionally and the friendship that you find hard to get with others now a days. It is fun to go out to the pasture and have your animals come running just to be with you.There will be guidelines on care for your sheep, the right food to give them, the treatment they need to flourish and then what the rewards are from doing a good job.Even if you don't ever buy any sheep this is a great little book.Finally, as a Pastor I find the information regarding sheep very telling, especially when you consider how often the Bible uses Sheep and Shepherds in analogies of how we should live the Christian life.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Living with Sheep: Everything You Need to Know to Raise Your Own Flock","review":"This is a very good book to read. It covers most of the areas you need to think about. My ownly criticism is that the authors only used Northeast farms for pictures and etc. I think if they had included more information about southern and western conditions and pictures it would have been a more complete book. ie, Florida grasses are totally different from NE grasses."},{"Title":"Living with Sheep: Everything You Need to Know to Raise Your Own Flock","review":"I like this book.

I was trying to decide whether to raise sheep or goats. I think it is a credit to how comprehensive and well written this book is that it convinced me that I DON'T want to raise sheep for several very good reasons! If you are considering whether or not to try raising your own sheep, this book will certainly give you enough detail and scope to make your decision--and should you CHOOSE sheep it will be a fabulous foundation of knowledge to help get you started."},{"Title":"Living with Sheep: Everything You Need to Know to Raise Your Own Flock","review":"This is a great book.

Armed with this funny and easy to read guide, my dreams of living with sheep may someday come true."},{"Title":"Living with Sheep: Everything You Need to Know to Raise Your Own Flock","review":"This book is not for farmers, nor is it written by farmers. The author recommends hiring someone to build fences and has never butchered their own animals."},{"Title":"Living with Sheep: Everything You Need to Know to Raise Your Own Flock","review":"I liked this book it has great glossy photos in it. Lots of storys and good advice. I would buy Storey's Raising Sheep book as a basic book but this one was a real nice read."},{"Title":"Living with Sheep: Everything You Need to Know to Raise Your Own Flock","review":"This book is great for beginner shepherds. I've read just about every book about raising sheep that I could find, and most of them just scare the crap out of you when you see all of the diseases they can get. Chuck Wooster puts it all in perspective and tells you all of the things that you really need to pay attention to, from feed to fencing. All done marvelously with a sense of humor. More than once I laughed out loud while reading about the author's experiences with sheep. I've been a shepherd for about a month now and I can tell you I've referred to his book more than all of the others. Raising sheep is a joy, and Chuck Woosters book is a joy to read."},{"Title":"Living with Sheep: Everything You Need to Know to Raise Your Own Flock","review":"Chuck Wooster has written a beginners guide to raising sheep. He makes sheep raising sound like fun. After reading it, I wanted to rush out and get sheep to nibble my lawn. The guide is aimed at a variety of readers: from those who wish to have a few sheep to nibble their grass, to serious farming for profit. Everything is covered, from the best sheep, the best food, the best fences, etc. Geoff Hansen's photographs add to the enjoyment."},{"Title":"Living with Sheep: Everything You Need to Know to Raise Your Own Flock","review":"If you are a newcomer to living on a small farm and are looking for information on livestock to keep on your small acreage, this is a great book.The author is very detailed yet understandable about every aspect of sheep raising and care.It is also written for people from every angle. If you want to raise your own lambs and slaughter them or, like me, you don't want to use them for any other purpose other than as pets who keep the lawn down, this is just the book for you. The author covers everything you will need and makes you look forward to getting your first flock.Really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Living with Sheep: Everything You Need to Know to Raise Your Own Flock","review":"Chuck Wooster begins his book with an explanation that he came from a suburban upbringing and had no knowledge of raising sheep when he started. From the very onset, he engages the reader in his discovery, his mistakes, and his excitement. Wooster brings a sense of wonder, and humor to his writing which conveys his deep appreciation of sheep and the art of sheepraising. Wooster openly shares his emotions about every aspect of sheepraising, thereby setting this book apart from other dry textbook offerings. This is a delighful read.I have never raised sheep, so I cannot speak to the accuracy of the information. From my amateur vantage point, the book seems to cover everything you need to know.Living with Sheep is filled with cute sheep photos depicting several different breeds. One added surprise not mentioned in other reviews I read: the paper stock is very pleasurably heavy and moisture resistant. Great for reading without fear of spilling your tea, or getting bath bubbles on it.If you have ever fallen in love while scratching the neck of a sheep and wondered what it might be like to own and raise one, I highly recommend you read this book."},{"Title":"Living with Sheep: Everything You Need to Know to Raise Your Own Flock","review":"In \\"Living with Sheep: Everything You Need to Know to Raise your Own Flock\\" the author covers exactly what the title implies, EVERYTHING you will need to know to raise sheep! Mr. Wooster writes in a very relaxed, and often humorous way. It's kind of like having coffee with a friend who's giving you pratical and essential instruction from 1st hand experience with sheep. Let me also say that the photo's in this book are excellent- bravo to Geoff Hansen!Amongst topics covered by this book are: Sheep history, picking your sheep, things you should think about BEFORE you even get sheep, how to handle sheep, the various type of sheep breeds (meat, wool, dual-purpose and heirloom), land support, sheep shelter, fences, hay, how to properly feed your sheep, pasture rotation, raising lambs, organic lamb meat, butchering, wool production, rams and sheep health. This book also has a wonderful Appendix section in the back. Among the Appendix list is: Ewe gestation charts, tools & equipment you will need, summary month-by-month of a shepard's year, and a listing of state sheep sources and breed associations.That being said Mr. Wooster really knows his sheep! I would invest in a hardback copy as here on Amazon it is cheaper than most retail paperback editions. The paper stock is thick, semi-glossy, flexible and will survive through repeated reading.A solid 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Living with Sheep: Everything You Need to Know to Raise Your Own Flock","review":"Reading this book has given me confidence to become a shepherd myself. In addition to many necessary details, he recommends learning the personalities of the sheep, being aware when the behavior pattern is different than normal and to trying to figure out why. He has learned the normal noises of the flock, and has learned not to ignore it when they are noisier than normal. Other lessons on sheep behavior include not making direct eye contact with sheep, but speaking to them reassuringly when you approach so they know it's just you and they aren't upset by your presence. There are many other lessons on sheep which are interestingly and sometimes humorously presented for the reader.I wish there was more on dairying, as I'm interested in that and there aren't many books on dairying sheep. I disagreed with the authors practice of getting rid of the slaughter left overs by leaving them out for carnivores to eat. (I will definitely be composting the parts of sheep the sheep 'waste'). The feeding of grain damages the digestive system of sheep, but I'm not an expert. I would like to read more about keeping grass fed sheep."},{"Title":"Living with Sheep: Everything You Need to Know to Raise Your Own Flock","review":"Geoff Hansen's guide to raising sheep is an honest and oftentimes humourous look at the joys and sometimes sorrows of raising and better yet \\"living\\" with our fleecey friends. I found the section dealing with lambing to be excellent, easy to follow and informative. I also like that Mr. Hansen takes the time and trouble to look at all aspects of living with sheep and not just his own preferences. I highly reccomend this book for anyone at any level of experience as it reads like you have a friend standing next to you offering sage advice and useful information in a language that all can relate to."},{"Title":"Living with Sheep: Everything You Need to Know to Raise Your Own Flock","review":"This is a very interesting and endearing book for the novice who wants to start their own sheep herd. I highly recommend that anyone who is considering a new venture with livestock become as knowledgeable as possible and this book with help you toward that goal."},{"Title":"Living with Sheep: Everything You Need to Know to Raise Your Own Flock","review":"This book was well written for folks like me - those having relatively little farm experience in the process building a flock. As I am still learning, only time will tell if all the counsel was well founded - however, the advice thus far has made good sense to me and focussed me on executing the fundamentals well. Most importantly, the boys and girls in my care seem to be doing fine."},{"Title":"Living with Sheep: Everything You Need to Know to Raise Your Own Flock","review":"This is a wonderful book for beginning shepherds (more experienced too). Very entertaining and informative."},{"Title":"What Buddha Never Taught","review":"Inscribed on the inside cover of this book is the saying: \\"do not speak unless you can improve on silence.\\" If the maxim was followed, this book would never have been written.The author travelled to the Thai Temple for International Monks, Wat Pah Nanachat, and spent a brief period there practicing the dharma. Most of what he found out there is essentially valid. Namely: 1.) you don't need to be a monk in order to meditate; 2.) many of the rules in the vinaya don't always make sense in modern life; 3.) Samsara is a mental state; and 4.) disciples can and do misinterpret their teachers.As someone with a philosophy background, he was also quick to pick up the fundamentals of the philosophy of buddhism and buddhist practice. By the end of the book, he was at least able to recognize and apologize for his passive-agressive attacks, tests, and harangues of the monks there, which he describes with admirable frankness. I was very impressed by the restraint exercised by the monks in the face of this. The monks were remarkably kind and tolerant; they must have regarded Tim Ward's personal attacks and outbursts with compassion.I read this book because I was interested in Wat Pah Nanachat, and this is a book about a brief stay at Wah Pah Nanachat. Tim Ward is a journalist, and was on a trip through asia in which he sampled various different religions and temples. It was interesting in its own right for being a beginner's tale, but would have been more illuminating had the author been more experienced by the time he arrived at Pah Nanachat, or spent much more time there sincerely practicing.It is also written from the standpoint of a journalist who appreciates scandal and drama more than peace and harmony. In the book, Mr. Ward has real difficulty following the part of the eightfold path dedicated to right speech, and also observing the fundamental rule of not looking to others to judge how they are practicing, but rather looking inwardly.The author remarks several time throughout the book about how he is an author, and how he made plans during meditation time for writing books, teaching at a university etc. It almost seems as if the dialogue in the book was engaged in for the purpose of putting it into this book.Still, there were some remarkable facts about life at Wat Pah Nanachat that stand out: giant cobras, killer centipedes, scorpions and spiders as big as a hand, huge flying insects, pervasive swarms of biting insects, olives pickled in cow urine to fight constant constipation caused by eating all food for the day in one meal, and descriptions of strange Thai fruits. The Jungle around the Wat was reminiscent of the description of the garden of eden in Paradise Lost, with more thorns and biting insects.On the whole though, this book is not recommended for those on the path."},{"Title":"What Buddha Never Taught","review":"More than ever, Buddhism requires a good old fashioned spring-cleaning. Every school of Buddhism has its own biases, problems, hypocrisies and sheer nonsense...all are now tending to stray further and further away from the original point. Theravadan Buddhism is no exception.Tim does a good beginner's job of highlighting some of the obvious question marks about Theravadan monastic life. Since Tim never professes to be an expert in Buddhism, one should read the book from this point of view. His views are not \\"expert\\" but neither should his views be dismissed out of hand.I was very fortunate to get my hands on a used copy prior to going to Wat Pah Nanachat myself last summer and thought it provided an interesting if dated observation (his stay was back in 1985). I stayed at WPN and another Theravadan monastery in Thailand for a few weeks and was able to compare notes, 20 years on.While I concur with many of Tim's observations and questions (such as the almost excessive degree of veneration that the Thai people tend to show these mostly Western monks, many of whom were dropouts or ne'er do wells in their society), I felt that he may have spent a bit too much time observing and writing notes and not as much time practicing the Dhamma in such a conducive environment. WPN is extremely spacious, both in the physical sense and spiritual sense. It really gives one the feeling of silence and emptiness, at least when I was there.I was expecting a very exciting and dangerous environment after reading his book. Instead, I found WPN to be extremely clean, empty and very still. There was little chance to speak with the monks or other lay attendees (except at the beginning with the Guest Monk); in fact, excessive speaking and interaction were discouraged and frowned upon. I felt the atmosphere was quite strict in terms of practice, not unfriendly, just a solemn serious tone. The days were pretty routine...there was some structure, but most of the time was for individual practice. Boredom, loneliness and sexual desire were the main manifestations or \\"defilements\\" that came up right away. The food quality at WPN was first rate (\\"temple food\\"), even for lay visitors at the end of the line at the morning meal.I walked the full length and breadth of WPN, both on and off the paths and in the jungle areas. I found no evidence of cobras, scorpions or other dangers as mentioned in Tim's book. There were a few mosquitos, but not many. The temperature was in the mid to high 20s and much less than the 38C I had just come from in Taiwan. I really didn't feel the environment at that time was harsh or austere. The facilities and kutis at WPN were first class...nothing compared to the grass shacks that I had imagined.This is not to say that in fact Tim was lying or exaggerating to make his account sound more interesting than it was; as mentioned, he stayed at WPN at the tail end of the Ajahn Chah era when things may have been quite different, more bustling, energetic, and still a bit Wild West. My experience and impressions of WPN were quite different, but then again, I am a practicing Buddhist, who had a lot of foreknowledge of the Thai Forest Tradition and was visting 20 years later.I think the real value of this book is that it offers a rare challenge to the often stagnant conservatism and at times outright elitism of Theravadan Buddhism. It also highlights the challenges that Theravadan Buddhism faces if is to make inroads into Western society and be taken seriously. A lot of the other forms of Buddhism nowadays in the West are either packaged as attractive relaxation meditation pablum or seductive worshipping of some charismatic guru or lama in technicolour robes...nonetheless, these forms of Buddhism seem to have much greater appeal than the relatively dour and backward-looking Theravadan approach.As Ajahn Chah has said, there are many roads to enlightenment; the Theravadan Thai Forest tradition at WPN is one of them and for my money one of the best and purest, despite it's limitations. Nevertheless, many now feel that Theravadan Buddhism desperately needs an overhaul; Tim's book is one of the first to dare to suggest this."},{"Title":"What Buddha Never Taught","review":"For me a newly practicing Buddhist, reading &quot;What the Buddha Never Taught&quot; was like being in a support group with a whole cast of characters failing where I fail and doubting where I doubt. Their novice exploration of practice serves as a great introduction to basic Buddhist thought and follows up with a lively discussion. Their questions helped me find my own answers. The book includes an excellent glossary of Pali and Thai terminology. An excellent journey into the Therevadan mindset. Be forewarned Tim feels no compulsion to keep within dogmatic lines. Fudamentalists might want to steer clear."},{"Title":"What Buddha Never Taught","review":"Much appreciation to the author for a wonderful journey. I felt as if I were there every step of the way. Clear, vivid, and honest. Giggles were as abundant for me as the transformations in to my own personal contemplations. As a lay-buddhist, questions were posed that I often ponder myself. So the identifications were of comfort and great value. I admire Mr.Ward for his courage and willingness to confront important issues. Anyone who wants to expand their spiritual horizons, heart space, and mind this one is a must read"},{"Title":"What Buddha Never Taught","review":"Because of the title, I expected a clever exposition on current Buddhist practices that lack the most important aspect of Buddha's teaching, namely sense introversion. The author's focus, however, is on the physical discomforts at Wat Pah Nanachat in Thailand and the all-too-human faults that commonly arise in groups of people gathered for whatever reason, even a 'higher purpose'. Kind of interesting for readers that may not expect such goings on in ashram life. For those interested in techniques of sense introversion, see God Without Religion."},{"Title":"What Buddha Never Taught","review":"Everyone can be a fundamentalist. This &quot;problem&quot; is not limited to Christians, however much we Buddhists would like to think so. Tim Ward shows how Theravada Buddhism, with its stress on the &quot;perfect Dhamma&quot; and hundreds of rules, can be corrupted in practice. Example: monks seem to take advantage of ignorant laypeople. Not surprising; monks are people, too. Example: cliques form in the monastery, and monks can be catty and nasty to each other. Not surprising, of course, but you never hear about it. Example: monks aren't allowed to kill anything. So, they take a layperson with them into the jungle, and say, &quot;Get rid of this&quot;, pointing at weeds or whatever needs to be cleared. This is not consistent with the spirit of the rules, but it follows the letter of the rules. Thus the problems of literalism raise their head. Tim Ward is a gentle, well meaning traveller who does all Buddhists a favor by showing that Buddhism can fall victim to the problems of all religions."},{"Title":"What Buddha Never Taught","review":"of the author's adventures in a Thai Monastery, fresh out of theological studies and after being a Jesus freak and deciding to explore other spiritual traditions.

An excellent, insightful, and entertaining read well worth the time spent with it. Perhaps problematic for folks actively struggling against dogmatic tendencies or elements of pride and/or identity. As with all teaching--take from it that which proves truthful and useful, and leave the rest."},{"Title":"What Buddha Never Taught","review":"This is a sweet book of self discovery on a path that many Westerners have taken over the past forty years using Asian ideas and practices to come to terms with an inner world they find uncomfortable. Tim Ward ended up in the Western monastery in Thailand of the Buddhist monk Ajaan Cha who was teacher to Jack Kornfield and Ajaan Sumedho. Ajaan Cha is the lineage head of the many monasteries Sumedho has help found in England, America, Australia, and elsewhere around the world. By the time Tim arrived in 1985 Ajaan Cha had been disabled by water on the brain for more than five years. Tim's tale of the monastery is revealing of the outer flaws of monastic life and his own struggle to come to terms with them. Monks influenced by Ajaan Cha and his students often promote monastic life as the answer to life's problems. The world Tim reveals is all too human. There are personalities, there is blind submission to Thai culture which treats monks almost as magical persons. Laypersons earn merit for themselves in this life and future lives by feeding and serving the monks, and the monks rationalize what they know to be a way too simple understanding of Buddhism because it maintains their lifestyle. Tim befriends another novice with whom he can talk about all these contradictions. The friend leaves and, although apparently not there much longer, Tim becomes really angry about what he feels are compromises. The anger is palpable and the reader senses how out of proportion it is to the inconsistencies in monastic life. The book is redeemed and Tim begins to understand what he has been missing when the very monks he dumps his anger on respond to him with authentic compassion. Their monastic life has imbued in them both a love and equanimity so they are not at all hooked by what they recognize as clearly Tim's discontents whatever the actual problems of Thai monasteries may be.This is an engaging book. There are wonderful descriptions of the discomforts engendered by mosquitoes, ants, scorpions, and snakes of a countryside which had once been wild and was giving way to civilization. The dialogue between Tim and his friend, his taunting of others in the monastery, his easy explanation of Buddhist ideas make for interesting reading. The book flows nicely and, as reader, I looked forward to what challenge would come next for Tim. These days Buddhism is presented as a cure all touted on the covers of popular magazines. The Dalai Lama has become a hero. While Buddhism can offer some people relief from their problems, it has a long diverse history as a religion with all kinds of awkwardnesses not revealed by its promoters. It is refreshing to get a look into one man's experience in a monastery. It has many familiar ordinary human failures along with redeeming qualities. And of course, other people in other monastic settings have had quite different experiences. I think this is an important book to read for both Buddhist practitioners and people for whom Buddhism has been placed on a pedestal.Charlie Fisher author of Dismantling Discontent: Buddha's Way Through Darwin's World"},{"Title":"What Buddha Never Taught","review":"I found this book to be exceptional. It alone provoked many thougths and many lessons of my own, and will continue to do so. I found Tim Ward to display his experience in a very precise,beautiful, and funny way. The point of everything...to be able to laugh."},{"Title":"What Buddha Never Taught","review":"&quot;What the Buddha Never Taught&quot; is not unbearable, especially if the reader has some interest in Thai monastic life, but the author's glibness suggests that perhaps he was more interested in contriving an interesting story than learning what the Buddha really taught."},{"Title":"What Buddha Never Taught","review":"Personally I really liked this book. I'm just now starting to learn about Buddhism and I feel that reading \\"What the Buddha Never Taught\\" has greatly helped in my understanding of some of the important concepts of Buddhism. The main concept of what the Buddha never taught was related to the teaching of \\"no self.\\" It took me a couple times to read it and understand that Tim and his buddy Jim figured out that everything is suffering. They concluded that the ego/self/monkey-mind causes the suffering, but the Buddha mentioned that ego was an illusion. However, they agreed that suffering was real. They then tried to figure out how to kill ego. They discovered that the ego lives by pointing into the future, and making points stick; so if you stop trying to make points, you will cut off the ego. They found though that if everything is pointless, there is no reward/no happiness because it's the ego that gets happiness. That's kind of a sad lesson to learn. The book also tells of some Buddha stories, one was the story of the mangy dog. \\"What the Buddha Never Taught\\" talks about the spiritual journey that the author, Tim Ward, took to Thailand to study Theravada Buddhism at a monastery by the name of Wat Pah Natachat. The book tells how Mr. Ward chose to become a pahkow; how he had to take vows, shave his head, wear robes, and what his daily duties consisted of as a pahkow. It showed what the monks daily lives were like, such as going out for bindabhat, how everyone in the monastery got their own little kuti to live in, the daily duties like sweeping, and the rules that monks have to follow. The book also gives insight into the loop-holes that monks have to break the rules; for instance they aren't allowed to cut plants, but if a pahkow says the word \\"koppy\\" then the monk is allowed to cut the plant. There were some issues I had with the book though. Tim Ward tended to get off topic a lot throughout the book. He mentioned numerous times throughout the book a red coffee cup. He was obsessed with the cup. I thought there would be a lesson at the end of the book; something like realizing that he was attached to the coffee cup and had to give it up, but there was no lesson. It was just senseless rambling. Furthermore, I didn't like the amount of characters he chose to include in the book. There are about twenty five characters in the back of the book, but he probably could have gotten by talking about only ten of them because a lot of them were relatively unimportant. To add more confusion, he gets the bright idea to call himself and Jim, the names Bob and Boomer. Lastly, I didn't like that Tim Ward complained about Theravada Buddhism a lot. He seemed to judge everything from complaining about the hierarchy, how the monks kept Ajahn Chah alive just to make more money, and that monks shouldn't be locked up in the monastery but to go out into the world and help people. I feel his book should have reflected what he learned by his stay, not his political views. I also, recommend this book to anyone interested in the culture of Thailand. The book discussed some interesting social norms that the people of Thailand have. For instance, the opinion they have on suicide and their fear of pee bahs. A pee bah is a forest ghost. In the book, Tim Ward tells about how a monk had to be transferred to a different monastery because the Thailand villagers around them feared that he was one of these ghosts, and the other monks didn't want the villagers to get scared and stop donating food to them. Even though Tim Ward included some stupid things in this book, I still recommend it to anyone new to Buddhism, feel they might like a little more insight into Buddhism, or if a person is interested in Thailand in general. He did bring up some really good principles about Buddhism, and give good insight into the daily lives of monks."},{"Title":"What Buddha Never Taught","review":"Ward's account of his stay in a famous Thai forest monastery provides a profound glimpse of the potential rewards and the many difficulties of Buddhist practice. His unvarnished, well-told story is a far more realistic view of what that path is all about than you are likely to find in most Buddhist how-to manuals."},{"Title":"What Buddha Never Taught","review":"It's striking to me how Buddhists are typically upset by this book. Most of them, I expect, have never been monks for even a short time, yet they seem sure that a monk's life is wonderful and richly rewarding...for someone else, not them! There's no need to argue about whether the author got it all wrong about Ajahn Chah and Wat Pah Nanachat, one need only look at the numbers: Very, very few people are able to live, prosper and be happy in the forest tradition of Ajahn Chah for even a short time. Of the hundreds who did take vows and become monks since 1970, almost all have disrobed.Why such attrition? Let's be frank. It's because for almost everyone, being a monk just plain sucks. Nirvana isn't achievable, and boredom reigns supreme. Therefore, long term monks are rarer than hen's teeth. The numbers don't lie and prove this is so. If it were true that a monk's life was that of being blissed out in jhana and the joy of the 3 gems, wouldn't being a monk be a tad more popular? But it's anything but popular, as only a very few even try this life, and those who succeed at staying in robes for years are generally, in my experience, extremely strong willed and idealistic individuals. Many of them seem to be just enduring monkdom, not thriving. After all these years, how many Western monks are there in the U.S.? Far fewer than a hundred, and most of them have been monks for less than 10 years. And yet, ask a Buddhist if a monks life is wonderful, and they're bound to say yes. It's just a romantic notion, nothing more.I read a recent interview by a Wat Pah Nanachat resident who disrobed after 9 and a half years. He said that he lasted 9 years longer than the average monk before disrobing. That is, most of those who come to that monastery, fully self assured this is the life for them, leave after only 6 months.I visited the Ajahn Chah monastery in California about a year ago, and met up with someone there who became a monk 13 years ago. I thought he'd be happy: I was shocked to hear him somewhat dolefully remark that he would leave the holy mountain, but he lacked a car with which to leave in. Not quite a ringing endorsement of the joys of the holy life. Few of the monks I met on my visit seemed to fit the description of happy; most of them seemed far more enthralled with monastery building projects than with meditating. And why not? To work, to build and create things, is necessary for human satisfaction. Work and human interaction are a human need. On the other hand, doing little all day, and keeping silent, is generally frustrating to the human psyche. We aren't built to be monks, we're built to be everything monks are not. This isn't because we're of \\"much dust,\\" full of karma, in illusion. It's simply because we're human beings.But being a monk is an exercise in frustrating oneself in just about every way possible, and not just for lack of creativity and human interaction, but in basic comfort, sex, even touching others. Also in very restricted hours of sleep, lack of comfort in sleep (no mattress or pillow), lack of mobility, lack of financial power, restricted diet, being forbidden to kill even insects and vermin, see a movie, or listen to music. No exercise unless done in secret in your kuti.Can't even wear underwear (somehow, this seems to me to be one of the most harrowing restrictions of the monk's life!)If all that's not enough, the monk must live with the knowledge that his livelihood is largely financed by poor Asians, who support him only because they've been told their \\"dana\\" will give them good karma.It's just a very tough life, and not because of the sin of attachment to material things. It's tough because it's based on superstition about karma and reincarnation and nirvana, \\"kilesas,\\" and too much else to list here.What's the upside? Oh right, nirvana. Enlightenment. Sure. Hey go for it, fly to Ubon tonight and take vows. Then you'll be able to criticize the author of this book, who has done a great service in trying to dispel the romantic notions of armchair Buddhists."},{"Title":"What Buddha Never Taught","review":"What The Buddah Never Taught is an exhilerating, real to life account of the daily life and ordeals of living in a Buddhist monastery.

It also provides a review of the political history of Northern Rhodesia in the lead up to independence in 1964 in which Charles and Monica Fisher were deeply involved - an unusual situation for whites to be involved in the politics of that turbulent time.The book is parochial in many ways, and the author's style is sometimes ambiguous.

Coincidentally, some of the character names/personalities find their way to S.M. Stirling's alternate worlds novels as well."},{"Title":"The White Company","review":"Everyone has heard of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes. What many readers aren't aware of is that in addition to detective fiction, Doyle also ventured into historical fiction. Doyle's 1891 historical novel The White Company is one of his early efforts in this genre, and I found the medieval adventure great fun.Beginning in England in 1366, during the Hundred Years War, the novel begins with our protagonist Alleyne Edricson venturing forth into the world for the first time. Raised until age 20 in a monastery per his deceased father's instructions, those instructions also require that he go forth into the world for a year before he can choose to return to the monastery. The sheltered young man ventures into the world with little idea of what to do but to visit his older brother and try not to fall prey to the dangers the monks have warned him of.Alleyne soon encounters two companions, however. Hordle John is a rough and wild giant of a man who has been tossed out of the monastery the same day Alleyne leaves. Samkin Aylward is an archer just returned from France and service in the White Company, loaded with plunder, who regales Alleyne, John, and anyone else who'll listen with tales of his exploits. Samkin convinces Alleyne and John to join him in visiting Sir Nigel Loring, a brave and well-respected knight of England who he hopes to recruit as the new leader of the White Company and to return France and beyond for great deeds. Sir Nigel quickly agrees, as he is full of chivalrous fervor to do great deeds of battle and gain honor. Sir Nigel takes Alleyne as a squire, while Alleyne takes an interest of his own in Sir Nigel's daughter, Lady Maude. After months of preparations and recruiting of additional archers and men-at-arms, Sir Nigel leads the company abroad. Great deeds of honor are performed in France in friendly tournament before the White Company goes to Spain to face real war, and a variety of exciting adventures are had along the way.While reading The White Company, I couldn't help but be reminded of The Black Arrow, Robert Louis Stevenson's 1888 historical novel set a hundred years later during the Wars of the Roses, and also featuring a young knightly protagonist and daring adventures. As big a fan as I am of Stevenson, I enjoyed The White Company much more. The characters are much more likable, there's much more humor, Doyle keeps the medieval language much more accessible for modern readers, and overall, it's just a lot more fun. Doyle's action scenes - Stevenson's definite strong suit in The Black Arrow - are as good as Stevenson's, and the White Company leads in every other aspect between the books.I believe my fellow fans of J.R.R Tolkien would enjoy The White Company. Though a historical novel and not a fantasy novel, it shares some of the high and noble adventure that sets Tolkien apart from the more grim interpretations of fantasy. At times some of the beliefs of the day reflected in The White Company, such as a woman who has prophetic visions, are closer to fantasy than today's reality anyway. Had Doyle just put in a dragon for Sir Nigel and Alleyne to fight (although Tolkien would probably have had Samkin the archer deal the deal blow to the beast), this would have make a perfect fantasy novel.I read a version of The White Company illustrated by N.C. Wyeth. I first encountered Wyeth through his illustrations of many of Stevenson's works, and he really brings some of the most exciting scenes of the book to life with his art. Wyeth illustrating an edition of an adventure story is becoming a signal to me that I'll probably enjoy it.I highly recommend Doyle's The White Company to anyone who enjoys tales of knights, archers, and chivalric adventures, as well as to anyone who enjoys fantasy novels like The Lord of the Rings. I had read and enjoyed some of Doyle's Holmes stories before, but I was pleasantly surprised by just how strong Doyle's historical fiction was. I definitely plan to read Sir Nigel, a follow-up book from Doyle chronicling the early adventures of that character."},{"Title":"The White Company","review":"Note: This review is of the 1922 hardcover edition published by the Cosmopolitan Book Corporation, New York, with illustrations by N.C. Wyeth. On the cover's inside is the inscription \\"Teresa Lee McNeel, December 1930, From Mother.\\" From that, I infer it was given to my own mother by my grandmother on the former's twelfth birthday. While the book has been in my possession for decades, only now have I taken the time to follow Mom's reading trail eighty years later.\\"Now order the ranks, and fling wide the banners, for our souls are God's and our bodies the king's, and our swords for Saint George and for England!\\" - Sir Nigel Loring, rallying the White CompanyTHE WHITE COMPANY, by Arthur Conan Doyle, was first published in serialized form in 1891. It has been asserted that Doyle regarded his historical novels, THE WHITE COMPANY being one of them, more highly than his (now) better-remembered Sherlock Holmes exploits.The place is England and the Continent, the year is 1366 during the reign of the King of the English, Edward III, and his realm is twenty-nine years into The Hundred Years' War with France.The male heroes of the story are three plus one: Samkin Aylward, a grizzled archer of the White Company, an English mercenary force, Alleyne Edricson, a twenty-year old clerk raised by Cistercian monks in Beaulieu Abbey since infancy who's now sent out into the larger world to learn something of it before choosing a permanent vocation, and the red-haired giant Hordle John, a disgraced Brother of the same abbey tossed out because of his self-indulgent ways. The trio then joins a fresh contingent of the White Company raised by the renowned and veteran knight, Sir Nigel Loring, at Castle Twynham in the Hampshire town of Christchurch. Alleyne himself is taken on as Loring's personal squire and, for the two months prior to the company's departure for the Continent, is the tutor of Sir Nigel's teenage daughter, Lady Maude. Edricson is, naturally, smitten, and he goes off to war carrying her green veil as a token of favor.Doyle's novel, written during the time when the Empire still spanned the globe, is, above all, a paean to England and its common men that transformed themselves into their country's stanch expeditionary warrior forces. As a song in the book has it:\\"What of the men?The men were bred in England:The bowman - the yeoman -The lads of dale and fell.Here's to you - and to you!To the hearts that are trueAnd the land where the true hearts dwell.\\"As might be surmised, THE WHITE COMPANY is also a coming-of-age story and a great road adventure. Emerging from the protective cocoon of Beaulieu Abbey, Alleyne is a completely blank slate, a slate upon which will be writ the learning experiences of a journey that will take him to Spain to fight in what will later become known in history as the Castillian Civil War, a peripheral conflict of The Hundred Years' War. Doyle ensures that the values learned mature Edricson into his ideal of a proper and true-hearted Englishman.A main thread that runs through the entire work is chivalry as practiced by an honorable knight, the poster boy being Sir Nigel. A 21st century reader of this 19th century book may find the romantic view of this warrior philosophy somewhat quaint if not downright ridiculous, as perhaps reflected in these words by Loring to an innkeeper when the former learns of the presence of an anonymous but otherwise bellicose knight within:\\"Go tell him that a humble knight of England would make his further honorable acquaintance, not from any presumption, pride, or ill-will, but for the advancement of chivalry and the glory of our ladies. Give him greeting from Sir Nigel Loring, and say that the glove which I bear in my cap belongs to the most peerless and lovely of her sex, whom I am now ready to uphold against any lady whose claim he might be desirous of advancing.\\"Loring is, of course, inviting the other knight to meet him in personal combat on the spot. The contemporary reader may be tempted to mutter, \\"Oh, puhleeeze!\\" However, in 1891, such a challenge, and the courtliness it stemmed from, was likely to be fondly remembered and admired.There was a flip side to chivalry, however. It was a code of conduct that governed relations between members of the nobility only, i.e. from knight on up to princes and kings; there was no obligation for the aristocracy to treat the lower classes similarly. Indeed, a noble landholder could treat his villeins abominably and still be considered chivalrous; only the Church might perhaps prevail upon such a lord to treat his serfs more justly and charitably. Doyle does not shirk from referencing this in the storyline.THE WHITE COMPANY contains thirteen color plates by the painter N.C. Wyeth in a magnificent illustrative style that hasn't been employed in decades.Not surprisingly, Doyle's adventure novel has an old-fashioned air to it. It's a solid tale with a fairly predictable story; there are no plot twists that cause a mental double-take or can claim a \\"gotcha.\\" It was undoubtedly recommended for the adolescent and young adult readers of the period much as I, in my youth, devoured the epic adventures by author Joseph Altsheler, particularly theClassic American Fiction: Altsheler's Young Trailers Series, all 8 novels in a single file, with active table of contents. That said, THE WHITE COMPANY grandly accomplishes what it was penned to do, both entertain and teach moral values."},{"Title":"The White Company","review":"With this book set after Sir Nigel yet written prior, Sir Aurthur Conan Doyle has set the framework of chivalry as it should have been.

I'd return it, but if they're all like that, there's no point."},{"Title":"The White Company","review":"Chivalry may be on life support, but it's still breathing in the words of Arthur Conan Doyle's The White Company. Although he is well known for his Sherlock Holmes stories, Doyle was most proud of creating the noble knight, Sir Nigel Loring of the White Company.This book is set in the tumultuous days of the 14th century, when the political struggles among England, France and Spain, and the Crusades in the Holy Land, created instablity for peasant and noble alike. There are many heroes in the tale of knights and battles, but young Alleyne Edricson is the main protagonist. Sheltered in an abbey, where the orphaned lad was educated per his noble father's wishes, Alleyne is unwillingly shoved into the world for a period of a year, where he must decide whether he wishes to make his way there or return to a monastic life.It doesn't take long for Alleyne to meet with adventure. He is shocked to find the world is a rough and tumble place. But his straightforward and naive approach to life helps him out of some scrapes and endears him to some colorful characters who become his bosom companions. Together, they join the service of Sir Nigel, who is an unlikely hero with his bald head, bad eyesight and scrawny stature. That is, until he is able to prove himself in \\"some small feat of arms,\\" which is his favorite pastime. He is always victorious in these exhibitions of his knightly prowess, and he always has a kind word for the vanquished, his noble opponent. His motivation is always to defend the honor of his \\"lovely\\" wife, for whom he cherishes the greatest tenderness, although others wonder if this is due to his poor vision rather than any attractiveness on his lady's part.There are many satisfying battles and cliffhangers in this book. Sir Nigel plunges headlong into any opportunity for a fight. Alleyne becomes his squire and follows him to France, to fight for their Prince, Edward III, who wants to restore the vanquished king of Spain. Alleyne becomes adept at sword fighting and exhibits as much bravery as his lord. He is also motivated by the love of a lady, Sir Nigel's lovely daughter, Maude.I read this book aloud to my children, and we shared many moments of laughter as we followed the warriors from England to France. I struggled a bit with the French pronunciation of names and places (how do you pronounce \\"Blois\\"?), but it was a very funny and exciting book, and I'm glad we were able to read it together. Doyle was an expert on this time period as his mother read him many chivalric tales as a boy, exciting his interest in medieval times, which continued into his adulthood. The descriptions of weaponry, customs, religious life, clothing, historical events and geography permeate the story without detracting from it. There are numerous stirring and gory events (including pirates, hangings, peasant uprisings and decapitations...yuck), which will have readers on the edge of their seats. Of course, the illustrations by N.C. Wyeth added to our enjoyment.There is another book about Sir Nigel, a prequel to The White Company, called Sir Nigel, which we will have to read soon. He has become one of our favorite literary characters."},{"Title":"The White Company","review":"I can't remember how I happened on this book- probably Amazon herded me to it- but I'm quite glad. I'm more of a fan of the Sherlock Holmes stories, but I found this as enjoyable as The Black Arrow or Robin Hood or any other medieval book that I've read, and I'd never even heard of it before. The protagonist is a young man raised at the monastery who joins a band of rough but good hearted archers and follows their exploits as they head to war in France and Spain. The old agnostic (Doyle) weaves in more respect for the Catholic church than one usually sees from so-called church leaders today, combined with some common sense insights of true morality. For Doyle chivalry not only is not dead, it'll cut off the head of anyone who says otherwise. In other words, a man's word was worth something, and a man's actions were worth even more. Lots of swordplay, a little (very little) romance, some interesting and well developed characters, and an undercurrent of humor. Not as clever as the Holmes books, but a lot more action, and one learns a little English history at the same time. I'd highly, highly recommend it for kids, or anyone really, and I am amazed that it's fallen through the cracks to this point- at least for me."},{"Title":"The White Company","review":"I cannot tell you how much fun this book is...you will have to read it yourself. This is the kind of book that you must immerse yourself in. Give yourself the time to just sink into Conan Doyle's world. It is easy to do, because Conan Doyle had a gift for imagery. The book is so complete. It shows both the beauty and the barbarity of the times with complete harmony. It is also downright funny at times. I have found myself laughing out loud while reading this book, largely because of the language used. Yes, the language is sometimes hard to follow, but who wouldn't laugh at \\"I have been cozened and bejaped!\\"? I think the author does this on purpose because it IS funny. It is interesting to compare The White Company with Crichton's recent novel \\"Timeline\\", set in the same era. Both authors worked to bring the flavor of that time to the reader, but with vastly different aims and results. Anyway, give yourself a break and escape into another world. Go to battle with Hordle John, Sam Aylward, and Alleyne! Then go sample another of Conan Doyle's little known gems and read of the outrageous exploits of Brigadier Gerard!"},{"Title":"The White Company","review":"I recently purchased this book for my husband and myself to enjoy together. Needless to say, he's been hogging it every night. Occasionally I hear him giggling (at a passage) like a ten-year-old boy. From what I recall when I read this as a kid, this book IS the perfect adventure story. Complete with knights and archers both dashing and dumpy (Sir Oliver), and even pirates, it almost reads like a serial novel in this respect. One cannot, however, overlook or underestimate Doyle's brilliant use of medieval language in his dialogue, nor the sheer color of his vivid descriptions. This is a timeless book; one to get yourself lost in."},{"Title":"The White Company","review":"This books is definitely the stuff of childhood dreams and imagination. Who among you can say they have never imagined themselves playing the part of the intrepid knight battling injustice or the damsel awaiting the return of his true love? The book follows the progress of an adventurous monk that has left the cloister and hitched his wagon to Sir Nigel's White Company, a group of English mercenaries seeking fight and fortune in France and Spain. Those young at heart will especially enjoy this tale. It is gripping without being brutal but with the endearing quality of a bed time or fireside tale."},{"Title":"The White Company","review":"I loved this book as a kid, and found new depths to it when I came back to it as an adult. A must-read! The breadth of imagination and the color and vividness of the descriptions are hard to match, and the characters are memorable -- Samkin Aylward the master-archer is my favorite."},{"Title":"The White Company","review":"The White Company is one of those books which lies completely below the radar. While we all know stories like The Count of Monte Cristo and Huckleberry Finn and Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Doyle's classic and simple-hearted story about English adventurers in the Hundred Years' War is a largely unknown work. I purchased it as a lark, and because it cost a single dollar, and its worth was proved to be many times repaid.In reading The White Company, it is best to set aside expectations of sophisticated or intricate character development--this is a story that does best with a sympathetic reader, already steeped in the daydreams of bygone days and lusty battle--and simply have fun. Also, this is the kind of book that a person with some grounding in history will get more out of than someone ignorant of the 14th century. Perhaps it's advisable to obtain a little background information before settling into the book; assumptions about educational background were--ahem--more stringent in 1900 than today.This is a man's story, to be sure, and it appeals to the insurgent lurking within all men. However, it isn't offensive to womankind, either, revealing the strength of the female characters as well. Enjoy with confidence.One last comment: If, at the end of the story, you don't a lump in your throat, or feel a stirring in your heart to don a steel cap, lace on a jerkin and take up a stout length of yew, you've missed the point."},{"Title":"The White Company","review":"Though popularly remembered for the Sherlock Holmes stories, the historical novels of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle are more illustrative of his literary flair and narrative skill.'The White Company' and 'Sir Nigel' are set during the Hundred Years War between England and France, focused around the figure of Sir Nigel Loring, a chivalrous knight whose thirst for honour and glory pull him and his companions into many strange and warlike adventures.Mixing real historical figures such as Edward III and the Black Prince with creations of his own, Doyle manages to weave a number of separate incidents into an interesting and highly enjoyable tale. At times very humourous, these stories nevertheless also describe the harsher realities of medieval war, presenting a colourful picture. Though characterisation is sometimes two-dimensional, Sir Nigel as the main protagonist is both funny and endearing.

I knew that Sir Arthur is an excellent writer but I didn't know that he is that good with medieval adventures.Everything he writes is very true historically and that makes the book even more enjoyable.

If you are a kid or if you are one of those grown up kids like me you will love this book."},{"Title":"The White Company","review":"Doyle is best known for his Holmes intrigue creations, but he considered these novels of chivalry and adventure as among his finest achievements, though they are not well known or attributed to his fame. White Company &amp; Sir Nigel provides the two publications under one cover for the first time, providing his historical fiction in their proper light and inviting Doyle fans to a taste of something different."},{"Title":"The White Company","review":"I listened to The White Company when I was 12 as an audio book.I instantly fell in love with Arthur Conan Doyle's prose and his cast of colourful characters: the naive Alleyne (said \\"Allen\\") Edricson, who over the course of the narrative becomes a man, chivalric Sir Nigel Loring, the tomboyish Maude Loring, the simple but immensely warrior John of Hordle, veteran archer Sam Aylward, and the grizzled Black Simon.The characters are strong, well written, and extremely entertaining....Conan Doyle, author of Sherlock Holmes, spent over two years of his life researching this book and his dedication shines through the pages. Containing detailed descriptions of heraldry, castles, weapons, and cities, The White Company takes you back in time to the romanticized world of knight errants, damsels in distress, gallant squires, but does not shy away from the more realistic facts of Medieval life - starving peasants, blood-and-piss battles, captives and ransoms, rape, pillage, and plunder. The White Company contains, among other things:a chase with archers and knights,an awesome sword fight,a giant who can fire an arrow 600 metres,a sea battle between pirates and a merchant boat,a rampaging bear,a gunpowder explosion,an archery competition where Longbowmen shoot birds out of the sky,a pseudo-monk,a wrestling match in a tavern,a last stand between five knights and thousands of starving, crazed peasants,a huge battle in the end,a princess who lives in a nunnery,a lord and a archer taken slave,and much, much more. But the best thing is that the book won't drown you if you tie it around your neck and go swimming and if you put it in your suitcase it won't be overweight: The White Company is just the right length.On a different note, it must be remembered that Conan Doyle was INTENSELY patriotic and much of this book had parallels with England's situation then. So if you don't like that sort of \\"England is supreme. French are dogs.\\" sort of stuff, avoid....The White Company contains one of my favorite poems, an old archer's song: The Song of the Bow. I will show some of it here:What of the Bow?The Bow was made in England:Of true wood, of yew wood;The Wood of English bows;So men who are freelove the old yew-treeAnd the land where the yew tree grows....What of the Shaft?The Shaft was cut in England:a long shaft, a strong shaft;Barbed and trim and true:So we'll drink all togetherto the grey goose featherAnd the land where the grey goose flew....The White Company is one of my favourite books, and I have read many. You must read it!Strongest Recommendation!"},{"Title":"The White Company","review":"The plot in this story seems to be quite simple, therefore the story becomes as simple as its plot is.

Robert Bringhurst recommends from 45 to 75 characters, ideally 66.Also, the margins are so narrow that you need to contort the book to be able to read the letters near the middle.Another sign of amateurish typesetting is that \\"symmetric\\" quotes are used.I guess this work is public domain. Next time, instead of buying the cheaper edition, I'll look for a more reputable publisher.This is a review of the paperback edition, and refers only to the typesetting, not the contents of the book itself.

A very historical book, containing much information about the War, which might be found in many history books. It may be slightly more of a history book rather than a truly fiction book, nonetheless, a book written exceptionally well, with action and suspense, in the style of Conan Doyle, a prolific author best known for his detective stories in Sherlock Holmes and also in the White Company's companian piece, Sir Nigel. This book is for anyone who would enjoy reading about medieval history and times."},{"Title":"The White Company","review":"The White Company was said to be one of Canon Doyle's favorite creations, and it does show the great pains he took in research, both in speech and the customs of the day. The plot ramps up slowly at the start but once it gets going, hang on for the adventure of your life- it is non-stop heart pounding action. And throw in a budding romance and you have one heck of a tale. I found the White Company a more tightly constructed book then Sir Nigel, which was subsequently written as the prequel to the White Company. I found the final ending of the story a tad Hollywoodish, but I suppose he wanted a happy one. All in all, one of the most memorable books I've read."},{"Title":"The White Company","review":"I first read this book over 50 years ago, and wondered how I would like it now. I found it to be an absorbing description of feudal times in England and what we now call France. I can readily see why the French dislike the English, although 700 years seems a long time to hold a grudge! The book is a fine adventure, with lots of detail about combat in the 13th century.

How could you go wrong. A must for lovers of chivalry and romance."},{"Title":"The White Company","review":"This book is a companion to Sir Nigel. The The White Company was written before Sir Nigel; however, Sir Nigel (Nigel Loring) is set earlier and should be read first. Although famous for Sherlock Homes, Doyle was knighted for his historical novels of which these are two. Both books are excellent for young people forming their characters."},{"Title":"The White Company","review":"The White Company, by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is an inspiring tale of knightly honor and chivalry. Though famous for his Sherlock Holmes stories, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, in writing The White Company, produced an extremely vivid account of the horrors of medieval warfare, while mixing in moments of humor to create an inspirational and highly enjoyable tale.The protagonist, Alleyne Edricson, is a young man come fresh from the monastery to explore the world and all it has to offer, as his father had wished. Soon after leaving the monastery, Alleyne meets a beautiful young lady and her father, Sir Nigel Loring. Alleyne then becomes squire to Sir Nigel, a humorous and highly respected knight, and the adventure begins. While fighting abroad, Alleyne proves himself to be a worthy suitor for the lovely Lady Maude, Sir Nigel's daughter, and returns from the war as a courageous and honored knight to marry her.Though the characters are at times two-dimensional, Doyle does a superb job of endearing them to the reader and enabling the reader to feel as if he or she really knows the characters. The White Company, an escape fiction novel, is an excellent example of formula fiction. The characters are mostly stock, and the ending is a happy one. The worthy hero rescues the damsel in distress, loses her for a while, but returns to win back her love. Even though the novel contains some flat characters and stereotypes, a dose of reality is present in the horror of war portrayed by Doyle.This account of knights, war, and fair ladies is permeated with the theme of honor. The code of chivalry for medieval knights is a well-developed theme presented by Doyle. This valuable theme mixed with an enjoyable and funny story makes this novel unique. The White Company is a well-written, interesting book and I recommend reading it."},{"Title":"The White Company","review":"If the Divine is in the details, than this novel is touched by It with easily readable and rich details alive with imagery.

There were some minor inconsistencies between the two books--which were probably occasioned by Sir A. C.

(I won't detail the discrepancies, so as not to diminish the reading enjoyment for those who missed them.) I was glad I purchased both books together, though, because they're both worth reading.

His goal is to change the ruthless ways of his brother, The Socman of Minstead. He firsts finds his brother harassing a beautiful lady. Alleyene intervenes, which causes his brother to set dogs upon him. Alleyene then decides to become a squire to a knight, the knight happens to be the beautiful young lady's father. Alleyene goes off to war and gets involved in battle. Some soldiers called Alleyene weak because he dwelled on the horrors of war, but Alleyenes friend explained his weakness. &quot; It is not weakness of heart, for I know the lad well. His heart is as good as thine or mine, but he hath more in his pate than ever you will carry under that tin pot of thine, as a consequence he can see further into things, so that they weigh upon him more.&quot; Sir Arthur Conan Doyle brings the story alive with vivid detail and characterization.

He's certainly knowledgeable, but a woman's perspective might seem more valuable. More importantly, though, the reason a woman's self-confidence is affected every time she looks in the mirror (as the book's description claims is the case) is becuase our society mandates a ridiculously strict and unrealistic standard of beauty. How about a fitness book that emphasizes the fact that people come in all shapes and sizes and that a woman doesn't have to resemble a model to be beautiful--clothed or naked.

I think it is fair to say that when one buys a book titled &quot;Look Great Naked,&quot; she is looking for something quick, easy to follow and effective. The book is just not set up in that way. Should you train 3 times per week or less? All muscle groups on the same day or spread them out? 15 reps or 10 reps? While the book provides some general principles (e.g. &quot;a minimum of 48 to 72 hours is necessary for adequate recovery&quot;), one has to look hard for them, and make a lot of choices. If you want everything laid out nice and neat for you, like in Joyce Vedral's books, you are out of luck.(2) the diet section was pretty basic - really broad principles, but as with the weight section, he does not put it together into a program. A much better book is &quot;Nancy Clark's Sports Nutrition.&quot;(3) one-third of the book is taken up with recipes. Now, some people enjoy this in a book, but I personally never follow such recipes, so it is a waste of space for me. If you like recipes for things like &quot;fat-free tuna melt&quot; or protein shake meals, you will like it.(4) there is a lot of information that Schoenfeld has on his website that is not in the book - e.g. sample menus, frequent questions. So the book provided nothing new.Overall, I expected the book to focus the information from &quot;Sculpting&quot; and the website to the lower body, provide workout and diet programs, and be written in a very user-friendly way. It did not accomplish it. On its own (without reading the website or &quot;Sculpting&quot;), I think it still would rate as a mediocre book. But knowing his other work, this book is a real disappointment. I suggest buying his other book instead."},{"Title":"Look Great Naked: Slim Down, Shape Up and Tone Your Trouble Zones in Just 15 Minutes a Day","review":"I'll admit, I bought the book because I was intrigued by the title. But boy was I glad I did! Make no mistake, this is a serious fitness book with a lot of substance. It's NOT for those who just want to take it easy in their workout.The first few chapters are very inspirational. It begins with some interesting info on why women store fat more easily than men, why quick fix programs don't work, and what it really takes to get your body into shape. The author doesn't pull any punches and says flat out that you have to put in the effort, but he does it in a way that really makes you want to start working out. It then describes in detail the specific exercise program for working each of the three women's trouble zones (abs, butt and thighs). The organization here is excellent. It's very thorough and covers everything from sets to reps and everything in between (and yes, the workout does only take about 15 minutes!). It even describes the exact equipment needed to do the workout at home (you can do the routine either in the gym or at home). But what's really cool is that the routine is designed in a way that makes it simple to create perfect workouts every time you train--even if you don't have any background in exercise. I've never seen anything like this before (and I've read a lot of fitness books) and it's a real help.The last part of the book deals with nutrition. I was extremely impressed with the straightforward approach taken. There is an indepth discussion of carbs, protein and fat, with specific recommendations for apportioning each in the right amount as well as a formula for figuring out how many calories to take in. But it doesn't get overly technical with diet and it's again laid out in a very easy to understand way. The section on tips for losing those last few pounds was especially helpful. The book ends with about fifty or so healthy recipes, many of them contributed by top fitness models.All in all, I'd say this is a must-read for any woman who is looking to get into shape. It's motivating, well written, easy to read and, best of all, has lots of great information that you can really apply to your workout. I would have given it six stars if I could have!"},{"Title":"Look Great Naked: Slim Down, Shape Up and Tone Your Trouble Zones in Just 15 Minutes a Day","review":"I would have enjoyed this book a lot more if it would have given equal time to the upper body. There was no mention of arms or back in this entire book. I borrowed his first book, and he did mention those body parts in it. I would have been more pleased with his first book -- which I plan to buy. By not mentioning arms and back in his second book &quot;Look Great Naked&quot;, the author contradicted himself by his comments in his first book of making sure all muscle groups are worked equally to prevent a misshaped and unballanced look. I'm looking forward to owning his first book so I can incorporate my upper body into my workouts. All in all, the content and information in &quot;Look Great Naked&quot; is very valuable. His books are definitaly geared for people who have access to a Gym -- so if you don't, skim the book first before buying to make sure you're happy with it. I learned some new exercises with some of the machines that can target my muscles in a different way. I'm looking forward to trying some of his suggested moves."},{"Title":"Look Great Naked: Slim Down, Shape Up and Tone Your Trouble Zones in Just 15 Minutes a Day","review":"Mr. Schoenfeld has written an excellent book that is totally results-oriented. My entire body has changed since starting this program several months ago. No matter what anyone else says, the way you look influences how you feel. My clothes now fit great and I feel much better about myself and my body.Also, some of the reviewers who say you need a gym are off base. Maybe they are commenting without reading the book. There are substitute home-based exercises for all the machine exercises that are fully demonstrated. I do this routine at home three days a week just using dumbbells and strength bands. It works fantastic."},{"Title":"Look Great Naked: Slim Down, Shape Up and Tone Your Trouble Zones in Just 15 Minutes a Day","review":"I am a pretty serious weight trainer but many women are intimidated by going into a weight room and using weights. There are two things I like about this book; one, the title is terrific if not realistic for most of us; and two, this book gives many alternative exercises for weight machines so you don't have to go into the weight room if you feel funny about it.You will not get big bulky muscles if you follow this workout because you do not use very heavy weights. Instead you will get leaned, toned muscles which is what most women want and it targets the trouble zones, the abs, butt, and thighs. He also talks about the importance of diet (not dieting) and consistancy (it doesn't happen overnight, you have to keep at it).My biggest criticism of this book is that he does not include exercises for the upper body, though he does mention that it is important to work the upper body as well as the lower body. Therefore, I find it to be incomplete for an overall training manual, but I do think it is a good place to start. Just don't forget to work your upper body every other day as well."},{"Title":"Look Great Naked: Slim Down, Shape Up and Tone Your Trouble Zones in Just 15 Minutes a Day","review":"Over the years I have tried virtually everything to shape up including books, tapes, supplements and thigh creams. But this book is the best for losing inches and toning up. For the first time, I can really feel my muscles working. It doesn't take long to do the exercises and the nutrition is easy to follow. The author is also very motivational. He shows how to set realistic goals no matter how out of shape or overweight you are. I felt that he was talking directly to me and was encouraged to keep going on when I really didn't feel like it. I've learned to put things in perspective and am very happy with the weight that I've lost and the shape my body is taking. Over all, an excellent book for any woman regardless of her present shape. I bought one for my mom and she has gotten very good results too."},{"Title":"Look Great Naked: Slim Down, Shape Up and Tone Your Trouble Zones in Just 15 Minutes a Day","review":"As a 30-something woman with two children, I am so pleased to have found this book. After my last child, I haven't been able to lose the weight I had gained amounting to about 20 pounds. My stomach was also stretched and all the ab exercises that I did never helped. I have been staying with Brad's program for a little over a month now and have already dropped a dress size and feel much more firm and toned. My stomach is finally tightening up and I don't have that terrible loose skin look. The program is very easy to follow and the explanations of the exercises are fantastic. I am looking forward to being in a bikini by the summer for the first time in years."},{"Title":"Look Great Naked: Slim Down, Shape Up and Tone Your Trouble Zones in Just 15 Minutes a Day","review":"I think it would better serve your customers to inform potential buyers that this book is for women who go to the gym on a regular basis, and not for those who were expecting to use this book to work out at home. I would not have wasted time and money had this IMPORTANT information been provided."},{"Title":"Look Great Naked: Slim Down, Shape Up and Tone Your Trouble Zones in Just 15 Minutes a Day","review":"I am extremely pleased with the results that I've achieved on this program. In two months I've lost 13 pounds and everyone is noticing my muscle tone. Unlike other programs, the diet is easy to follow. Be advised that each trouble zone takes fifteen minutes so the workout can actually take longer depending on how many areas you train each day. But this is only a small quibble. The results are well worth it!"},{"Title":"Look Great Naked: Slim Down, Shape Up and Tone Your Trouble Zones in Just 15 Minutes a Day","review":"I ordered this book based on reviews from health and fitness websites and the online reviews. The reviews indicated (or I assumed) I could do these exercises at home! I am very interested in weight Training exercises. Perhaps it was my wrong assumption, but I assumed the exercises used free weights and floor exercises. 90% of the exercises were based on going to a gym or having gym equipment (I do own an elliptical). I was disappointed and returned the book! So the motto is, if you don't have access to gym equipment don't waste your time!"},{"Title":"Look Great Naked: Slim Down, Shape Up and Tone Your Trouble Zones in Just 15 Minutes a Day","review":"This book provides some very general tips that are useful regarding reps, stretches, and exercises, but really fell short of what I was expecting. The author does have a very positive, energizing tone and is extremely encouraging, which is great. However, as other readers have noted, a huge portion of the book is recipes. Some of the recipes are very plain and uncreative (such as sprinkling fish with spices and broiling) and others are just unappetizing (like a salad comprised of beans, onions and chicken). Most are suggestions from bodybuilding professionals that have no body fat and big, bulky muscles. Personally, that wasn't the result I was looking for, so I found his suggestions too rigid to realistically implement in my everyday life. If you are looking to become a future Ms.Universe and want a strict plan that will help you lose all body fat, this is probably a great book for you. But if you're looking for some useful advice to tone up and a realistic plan that still allows you to eat like a normal human being, this may disappoint you. There are better books out there."},{"Title":"Look Great Naked: Slim Down, Shape Up and Tone Your Trouble Zones in Just 15 Minutes a Day","review":"Brad Schoenfeld has done a wonderful job of creating workouts designed especially for a woman's body. This book has helped me firm up and lose fat without getting big, bulky muscles. I used to spend an hour and a half a day working out. I'm now getting better results in a fraction of the time."},{"Title":"Look Great Naked: Slim Down, Shape Up and Tone Your Trouble Zones in Just 15 Minutes a Day","review":"If your not happy with the way you look don't worry. This wonderful book helps you little by little one day at a time. Everyday it seems when you have to face yourself in the mirror something bothers you or you are not happy with what you see. Well no more worries! This wonderful book helps you target body trouble spots and stay fit not for just a year or two but for your entire life. The author explains and illustrates how the High Energy Fitness system of training gives every woman the ability to improve her appearance-and overall fitness. The guide was both informational and inspirational, that includes the latest advice in helping a woman reach her physical potential. All you need is fifteen minutes of exercise a day. Is that too much too ask for a complete life change around. I did not think so. The 15-minute guide and its exercises are not only worth its weight in gold but propel us to a long, enjoyable and healthful life.FinancialNeeds.com"},{"Title":"Look Great Naked: Slim Down, Shape Up and Tone Your Trouble Zones in Just 15 Minutes a Day","review":"The book is just packed with great info. I learned more about training from this book than from all the trainers in my health club. Its a great workout that's easy to follow and really explains the reasons behind training.

Finally, I feel like I know what I'm doing!Denise"},{"Title":"Look Great Naked: Slim Down, Shape Up and Tone Your Trouble Zones in Just 15 Minutes a Day","review":"I can't say enough good things about this book.

The writing is clear and concise and the book is very inspirational. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Look Great Naked: Slim Down, Shape Up and Tone Your Trouble Zones in Just 15 Minutes a Day","review":"Yes I want to look great naked and this book has shown me how. I love the routine--it doesn't take long to do and is very effective. I've seen a big difference in my body over the past few months and attribute it all to using this program."},{"Title":"Look Great Naked: Slim Down, Shape Up and Tone Your Trouble Zones in Just 15 Minutes a Day","review":"I attended the authors Look Great Naked seminar and was delighted to see that he published this book. I've used the routine for a while with much success, but the book has been a good refresher for me. It is pretty much identical to the seminar but also contains recipes and some other information that wasn't included in the seminar. The exercise descriptions and photos have been very beneficial in helping me get the form for each exercise. The routine is demanding but it definitely gets you into shape. Brad really knows his stuff and communicates it well in this book. If you are committed to exercise, the Look Great Naked program will do wonders for your body."},{"Title":"Look Great Naked: Slim Down, Shape Up and Tone Your Trouble Zones in Just 15 Minutes a Day","review":"Look Great Naked is true to its title. By following the program, you will substantially change your bodys appearance. The training routine is progressive--it gets harder as you go on. This constantly keeps things challenging and effective. It's also great how the exercises in the routine are constantly switched around so you don't get bored. According to the author, this also keeps your muscles off guard so you keep making progress and avoid a plateau. If you're into fitness, you definitely should read this book."},{"Title":"Look Great Naked: Slim Down, Shape Up and Tone Your Trouble Zones in Just 15 Minutes a Day","review":"I am pretty new to fitness and this book really helped me to create a program that I can stick with. It is well written, well organized and easy to follow. Brad has done an excellent job of putting all aspects of exercise and nutrition together into a very readable package. The one thing I'd like to see is a video that goes along with the book. Otherwise, I'd definitely rate it a buy."},{"Title":"Look Great Naked: Slim Down, Shape Up and Tone Your Trouble Zones in Just 15 Minutes a Day","review":"This was not a full body workout. Lower body focus for the gym and not for home. This wasn't worth the dollar I spent."},{"Title":"Look Great Naked: Slim Down, Shape Up and Tone Your Trouble Zones in Just 15 Minutes a Day","review":"Having tried just about every method available to get my body into shape, I can't begin to say how happy I am with the results of this program. The results I've achieved with this workout are better than I ever imagined. The workout uses a technique called giant sets that makes the workout very intense but very quick. I also find that it is a great aerobic workout so I don't need to do my aerobics for as long as I used to. I do the workout one day at the gym and two days at home using strength bands and dumbbells. The exercise descriptions are very precise and helpful to show me the form for each exercise.What's really cool is that I had a few questions about the book and I emailed Brad. I was surprised and excited to get an immediate response. He was extremely helpful in explaining the answers to the questions that I had and served to really motivate me. I am now in my sixth week and see a big difference in my body, especially in my hips and thighs.Overall, this is an excellent workout for targeting those stubborn problem areas. I have seen better improvement in a few short weeks than I have in years of dieting and step aerobics."},{"Title":"Look Great Naked: Slim Down, Shape Up and Tone Your Trouble Zones in Just 15 Minutes a Day","review":"I have tried everything to trim and tone my body but nothing has given me results like this book has!!! I started noticing changes in my body in only two weeks. The exercises vary, so you don't get bored, and you only have to work out for 15-20 min. every other day. (they recommend 48 hrs rest between workouts in the book)!!! I LOVE IT!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO OTHERS!"},{"Title":"Look Great Naked: Slim Down, Shape Up and Tone Your Trouble Zones in Just 15 Minutes a Day","review":"I have been searching for a book to help me get into shape for some time and I finally found it. Look Great Naked has answered all my questions about toning up and losing fat. The approach is straightforward: you can't attain a great body without a proper diet and exercise. And it explains a specific exercise and diet regimen for achieving a great body. There are many unique exercises in the book--some that I've never seen before. Using them in the combinations described has helped me make better progress than with any other routine I've ever used before. I'm not as strict with the diet as I should be but I've incorporated several of the nutrition suggestions into my diet and have noticed a definite improvement in losing fat."},{"Title":"Look Great Naked: Slim Down, Shape Up and Tone Your Trouble Zones in Just 15 Minutes a Day","review":"I found this book to be very helpful in toning those trouble areas.

However, I found it extremely motivating and interesting."},{"Title":"Look Great Naked: Slim Down, Shape Up and Tone Your Trouble Zones in Just 15 Minutes a Day","review":"This book has been very helpful to me in creating an exercise program. I had reached a plateau in my workout and wasn't making progress. The book explains why certain combinations of exercises are better than others. How working muscles from different angles promotes better development. This has been a revelation to me. By using the exercises in the suggested combinations, I have seen almost instant improvement in my body. I am so happy with the progress that I've made on the program and would recommend the book to anyone who is serious about getting into shape."},{"Title":"Look Great Naked: Slim Down, Shape Up and Tone Your Trouble Zones in Just 15 Minutes a Day","review":"This book is a refreshing change from the standard exercise books. First, it's fun to read. I was able to finish the whole thing in a few hours without putting it down. Second, it has tons of different exercise plans rather than just one basic routine to follow. And third, it explains nutrition in a way that is very sensible. It's not just high carb or low carb, it is a way of eating.I'm just a beginner so I'm taking it a little slow as the book suggests, but I'm definitely seeing changes in my body already. With the help of this book, I am confident that I'll achieve my goal of being in better shape than I was 10 years ago."},{"Title":"Look Great Naked: Slim Down, Shape Up and Tone Your Trouble Zones in Just 15 Minutes a Day","review":"The introduction says that you can do the exercises at home with weights and a bench but when you actually look at the exercises, most of them are done on machines from a gym.

This is what really sold me on the book."},{"Title":"Look Great Naked: Slim Down, Shape Up and Tone Your Trouble Zones in Just 15 Minutes a Day","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. It is extremely elementary and I seriously doubt if the author even wrote it. It resembles a collection of fitness magazine articles thrown together in an attempt to publish something; it's basically a superficial work.It's true that there aren't many intelligent individuals in the fitness industry, and unfortunately, this writing reinforces that truism. I'm sorry I bought the book."},{"Title":"Look Great Naked: Slim Down, Shape Up and Tone Your Trouble Zones in Just 15 Minutes a Day","review":"When I ordered this book I assumed there would be many excercises which I could do at home in between doing the wash and changing diapers. The 15 minutes a day is what I found appealing. Instead I found the majority of excercises to be ones in which I would need to do at a gym with professional equipment which is not an option for me. Also, I don't want to look like a body builder. I want to look slim and feminine, not hard and tight like a &quot;six pack&quot;. The models in this book are all body builders and that seems to be the audience this book is written for."},{"Title":"The Globalization of World Politics: An Introduction to International Relations","review":"This book helped me understand my initial international relations module at college. It is concise, informative and provides detailed analysis of key issues, and sets out typologies on how best to understand international issues."},{"Title":"The Globalization of World Politics: An Introduction to International Relations","review":"The organization of the work is excellent and many of the chapters (including those written by John Baylis) were clear, concise, and easy for a graduate class to follow. Unfortunately, other selections in the work are diffuse, rambling, or awkwardly-written. Moreover, despite an attempt to provide a balanced perspective on whether globalization is actually occurring, the work tends to support the globalization argument without providing strong evidence. Baylis' brilliant initial chapter actually presents a plausible case against globalization. Finally, despite the importance of nationalist and religious-based ideologies in motivating transnational behavior, these concepts receive less coverage than, for example, feminist theories. I had to construct an entire unit on Christian and Islamic principles of transnational relations from supplementary materials. Although I might assign Baylis' first chapter as required reading, the quality of the writing in the remaining 400+ pages is too inconsistent to be a good text."},{"Title":"The Globalization of World Politics: An Introduction to International Relations","review":"Not to bad.

Found places I would not have had without the book."},{"Title":"Before endeavours fade: A guide to the battlefields of the First World War","review":"I have traveled Northern France extensively since I was first stationed in Germany in 1987. I was given a copy of Before Endeavours Fade as gift in 1990 and have used it ever since. This work is beyond a doubt the best guide book for WWI Battlefields. The book has a section on every major battlefield on the Western front and while the short histories of the battles are adequate, the pictures and descriptions of the battlefields are excellent. But the greatest thing about the work is the maps. Using this book I have never failed to find the piece of terrain or monument that I was looking for. I have used Rose Coombs' book when visiting Verdun, the Somme, Vimy Ridge, Passchendaele and almost every other major battlefield on the Western Front. If you are going to visit France and can only take one book, take this one, it will get you to where you want to go, and will explain is understandable terms what you are looking at.I would recommend that before you go make sure you do some reading on the battlefield you are going to visit. My recommendations are for Verdun - The Price of Glory, The Somme - The First Day of the Somme, for Passchendaele - They Called it Passchendaele. The list goes on and on. Buy Before Endeavours Fade at the first opportunity because it is frequently unavailable."},{"Title":"Before endeavours fade: A guide to the battlefields of the First World War","review":"Written before the recent renewed interest in the Great War, this guide is still the best there is. It covers pretty much the entire Western Front and has hundreds of photos of monuments, markers, important buildings and of course, cemetaries. Although it focuses on the British battlefields (particulary Ypres and the Somme) there is great info about the French battlefields and an excellent section on the Americans. I've used this book to find amazing places (like Apremont-la-foret and the Butte de Vaquois just to name two) and put a name to places I've visited but didn't, at the time, know what they were. If you're a Great War buff, or even just interested, this book is essential. You'll get more detail in the Holt's guides, Middlebrook's stunningly clear guide to the Somme, or the terrific Leo Cooper Battleground Europe series. But to get nearly every important site on the Western Front in one 150 page package, Mrs. Coombs' book is it. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Before endeavours fade: A guide to the battlefields of the First World War","review":"Despite its age this is still the best guidebook to the battlefields and memorials of WWI.

Included in the book is a lesser known poem by John McCrae which starts out: O Guns, fall silent till the dead men hear Above their heads the legions passing on! (Those fought their fight in time of bitter fear, And died not knowing how the day had gone.)O flashing muzzles, pause, and let them see The coming down that streaks the sky afar; Then let your might chorus witness be To them, and Ceasar, that we still make war.Tell them, O guns, that we have heard their call, That we have sworn, and will not turn aside, That we will onward til we win or fall, That we will keep the faith for which they died.Bid them be patient, and someday, anon, They shall feel earth enwrapt in silence deep, Shall greet, in wonderment, the quiet dawn, And in content may turn them to their sleep."},{"Title":"Before endeavours fade: A guide to the battlefields of the First World War","review":"I purchased my first copy of this book while touring WWI battlefields in North Eastern France in the mid to late 1980s.

Thubron examines day-to-day life in Western Russia, Estonia, Belarus (\\"White Russia\\"), Ukraine, and Georgia, near the end of Leonid Brezhnev's premiership. He finds despair and cynicism, as well as an unshakeable sense of humor about life under communist rule.Thubron's work is a travel narrative, an account of a car trip that he took alone in 1980 that was planned and approved by the Intotourist, the Soviet tourism board. Traveling as a \\"building company director,\\" Thubron meets many people along the way. He talks with Russian and eastern bloc tourists at the campsites where he spends the night, locals in cities and towns, and dissidents whose addresses he has received from associates in Great Britain. Thubron also describes run-ins with police officials who are shocked to see a foreigner traveling alone by car in a British car. The first question he is asked while registering for his first overnight campsite stay is \\"Are you a group?,\\" which Thubron describes as a \\"quintessential Russian question.\\"Intermingled with his descriptions of the landscape and important historical sites, Thubron recounts various escapades, stories of people offering to buy his clothes (especially his jeans), of the advances lonely women who see him as a way to escape to the West (or to have an escape for a day), of many vodka guzzling evenings, of officious Intourist tourist guides, and of the talk of dissidents who seem unconcerned that their homes are bugged. Thubron offers his own insights about lesser known sites, like the Josef Stalin museum in Gori, Georgia, Stalin's hometown. In an exciting passage near the end of the work, Thubron describes how security personel in two white Volgas tail him all the way to the Romanian border.Throughout, Thubron expresses a Western sensibility and skepticism about the Soviet Union. His narrative mixes a blend of awe for the accomplishments of the Russian people and horror for what the Russians have endured and suffered. In fact, the book begins with an admission of his long-held fears about Russia, dating back to grade school when he first viewed in awe maps of the Soviet Union stretching across the globe.Thubron's prose style is both poetic and urbane (with an impressive vocabulary); he recounts many unforgettable episodes. The book ends where it begins with Thubron marveling at the vastness of Russia, an impression that the reader will remember, too."},{"Title":"Among the Russians","review":"Ride around with Thubron in the last years of the crumbling Soviet Union. He takes you into the apartment buildings to find some of the most interesting -- and heartening -- testaments to human color ever encountered in travel writing.There are some truly jaw-dropping observations made by our driver as he stumbles upon people who are dealing with oppression in ways that &quot;westerners&quot; have never had to imagine.Through the vodka, through the endlessly repeating housing blocs, Thubron takes us to a deeper, more personal understanding of life under the Soviets. On the way, he introduces us to individuals (yes, strong individuals) that are not easy to forget."},{"Title":"Among the Russians","review":"As an interested reader of the Soviet Union and Russian culture, I picked this book up two years after I read In Siberia. I was amazed at the amount of detail the author poured into his journeys across the Soviet Union. He was able to visit the Russian citizens, homesteads of famous icons of years back (Tolstoy among them) and see cathedrals we can only see in pictures. His writing style and demeanor may strike readers as distant and unattached but he went over there to observe and he did not observe this place through rose-colored lenses-he showed us what Russia was really like in 1980. If you strictly want to read about Russia, you may be disappointed when you read the material towards the end which is about Georgia and Armenia, but my ignorance of those former republics were replaced with notions that they might be more beautiful and more interesting than all of Western Russia. The whole way through you will be captivated, appalled and intrigued with his journey. This is a must-read for anyone interested in Russian culture."},{"Title":"Among the Russians","review":"Written by someone who somehow managed to drive a clunker with UK plates through the Iron Curtain between West and East Germany and all the way to Moscow. Thubron then motors all the way to present day Azerbaijan and St.Petersburg. It is a snapshot not of present day Russia but of 1980 Soviet Union.The faint glimmers of hope that these people held on to and their continual amazement at the fact the author would explain the West was afraid of them are an excellent historical reference. Told that we are the threat to the Soviet Union a lot of the people were both in awe and afraid of the author.The amazing fact that he camped his way around a closed country is a great read of how they perceived us as much as a straight travelogue.Well recommended"},{"Title":"Among the Russians","review":"If this gives any indication of enjoying a book :I read it in two gulps / just could not put it down !This writer is just captivating .I ESPECIALLY was charmed by the poignant descriptions of peoples' faces ..A MUST READ especially , if you are curious to understand the puzzling dichotomy of repressionand, too authentic warmth and hunger for beauty that comprises this fascinating country, Russia..Spaceba!"},{"Title":"Among the Russians","review":"This is a good account of traveling through Russia in recent times.

Thubron is a vivid writer who paints memorable portrait of the people and places that he explores. The only knock on this book is that it is becoming dated. Originally published in 1983 it tells more about who the Russians used to be, rather than who they are. Still worth a read though."},{"Title":"Among the Russians","review":"I wondered, when ordering \\"Among the Russians\\", whether the fact that it had been written a quarter of a century ago, about a world that had apparently disappeared, would detract from the impact of the journey. I need not have worried as it has the immediacy of a trip completed yesterday.The book perhaps - and understandably so - does not quite have the fine polish of the recent \\"Shadow of the Silk Road\\", my first experience of Thubron, but is none the less beautifully written and absolutely fascinating. The combination of the unorthodox travel arrangements for the time (a car), the poetic and precise (I checked Google Images while reading \\"Shadow of the Silk Road\\"!) descriptions of places, the intimate and thoughtful portraits of people and, particularly impressive, the provision of a detailed historical context, make for a compelling read. Extra thrills, including a dramatic conclusion to the book, were thoughtfully provided by the KGB.With all this it might seem unnecessarily querulous to ask for more. But in both these books we are left with a feeling that the author has, perhaps unconsciously, fenced off a part of his personality and his activities. In this age of \\"letting it all hang out\\" we are sometimes left with unanswered questions, sometimes on simple practical matters.On the one hand, a voyage, especially a solitary one, involves constant and often stressful interaction between the traveler and his surroundings. We do see a lot of this but are often left trying to imagine details. On the other, it is often marked by long periods of silence when the traveler, a long way from home, will reflect on his life, loves, beliefs and hopes. Aside from a few memorable incidents, we do not see very much of this.A writer is fully entitled to reveal, or to hide, as much as himself as he chooses. But a bit more of Colin Thubron, the man, would give his travel books an additional vital dimension. Perhaps - after reading \\"In Siberia\\" - I should try his novels!"},{"Title":"Among the Russians","review":"As a cultural anthropologist who was been living and working in St. Petersburg, Russia for several years I can recommend this book for only what it is now. This is a travel narrative written over a period of weeks by one person, who did not speak Russian, in a tightly regulated tourist industry. Firstly, most people would agree that not speaking a language of a culture seriously inhibits your ability to assess what is actually happening and why. Secondly, at the time this was originally written, the Soviet Union, nor anyone else thought that it was in decline (1980 was also the year that the Olympics were held in Russia and an year after the invasion of Afghanistan)and seeing it as such is only because of hindsight.Thuborn's travel is from the in-tourist perspective, several other Western travelers who visited for conferences and business trips might explain something completely different. I know one such American photographer, Demarest Peterson, who traveled to Russia in the 1950's who was virtually uninhibited by the tourist guides from the in-tourist department, and was even able to take pictures of worshipers in a Russian Orthodox church during this time!Consider the alternative, imagine a Russian who was able to visit the US, under false pretenses, at about the same time, alone, poor in English and by car (if this would ever have been allowed). Would they be allowed to travel independently? Probably not. Would they be monitored by governmental officials? Probably yes. Would they be requested to join an official tour group to \\"give them a better traveling experience\\" (to keep an eye on them)? Yes, most certainly. Would their documents have been examined? Yes. Seeing it from the other side may help to explain the experiences that Thuborn had. Very few traveled to Russia from the West during this time which may help to explain the enigma of Russia more than one persons two week journal.I can recommend this book from only this perspective, as a historical narrative, and not as something to be considered for 2010. Russia has changed greatly in the last 10 years alone and it resembles nothing of the Soviet Union in 1980. If taken as a guide this book, now, will only heighten one's sense of cultural shock. And when you return, write of your own experiences, they are sorely needed."},{"Title":"Among the Russians","review":"I should preface my review by making it clear that I am not generally a fan of hyper-descriptive, verbose writers in the vein of Hemingway. That said/understood, I found Among the Russians to be so long-winded and detail oriented (in terms of describing places, buildings, forests, etc) that it was difficult to get a sense of the people. He interjects tales of his human interactions sparingly and a bit chaotically, so it isn't the type of book that I enjoy. A balance of description, history, and on-the-ground human interaction is key in making a book like this readable and entertaining. His style misses this by quite a bit. That said, it is an interesting account of 1980's Soviet Russia. It is what it is, but it's definitely not my favorite."},{"Title":"Story of Tracy Beaker","review":"The start of Tracy Beaker is a book which i recomend highly.

It didn't really have such a good ending. All the Jacqueline Wilson books I've read did the same thing. It just ended. Otherwise it was a really good book. The book makes you never want to stop reading. It is really exciting and fun to read. I really like The Story Of Tracy Beaker. My favorite (or FAVOURITE) character is Tracy. Tracy is my favorite character because she reminds me of my friend Louisa. She reminds me of my friend Louisa because they both can be really stubborn sometimes and they are both be really fun. I mean I don't know Tracy is fun because I haven't met her but she seems fun. I would recommend it to all the girls in our class. I don't think the boys would like it so much."},{"Title":"Story of Tracy Beaker","review":"While I was in the library, walking down the various aisles, I saw this book, and thought that it was a little strange for a children's book. Curious as to what the story was about, I decided to take it. Once I started reading it, I just couldn't put this book down. I finished reading it entirely in one sitting. It is one of the best books that I feel I have read recently.Tracy Beaker is a young girl who lives in a children's home. She tells us a little about her likes, dislikes, and other aspects of her personality before the story starts. She hopes that her mother (who Tracy says is famous actress) will come one day and pick her up, and will share her adventures with Tracy. Until then, she decides to spend her time by writing her autobiography (which is what this book is all about). She writes down her bad experiences in the foster homes that she lived in, her rivalry with Justine Littlewood, and her silly friendship with Peter Ingham, among other things.Jacqueline Wilson did a wonderful job in writing this book. Since this is the first book that I had read of hers, I feel tempted to read her other works. She portrays the life of Tracy in different angles, and tells the story in such a humorous way that it just draws the readers and makes them feel for the character. Nick Sharratt drew cute illustrations that went well with the story. What made me enjoy this book more was the fact that it was told in a realistic way. It doesn't have the typical happy ending, but you feel satisfied and happy for Tracy in the end anyway. The language is simple, but I wouldn't advice children below 8 to read this book, as it contains quite a bit of profanity.\\"The story of Tracy Beaker\\" is funny, emotional, and told in a unique way, and I would recommend anyone, adult or child, to pick up a copy and read it."},{"Title":"Story of Tracy Beaker","review":"tracy beaker is my fantasy book of my whole childhood starting from 5 years old,im 10 now and just cant stop reading it.Im going to give it five stars because it has loads of exiting words and the text is smashing.i cant seem too work out though why the author sometimes puts in words and they says the oppisitething for example she writes tracy beaker likes dogs and then she dont.I admire jaqueline willsons books especially tracy beaker.I bet im a number 1 fan and the reason why is all i ever do is either sit down and read tracy beaker or sit on my inflatable sofa and look on the internet and read other peoples reviews on tracy beaker.by courtneyphoenix classyr6"},{"Title":"Story of Tracy Beaker","review":"Review by YMP, age 11:This is another winner from Jacqueline Wilson. It is a wonderful story about a child named Tracy Beaker who has spent almost her whole life in Children's Care. Even if you haven't been in foster care before, you can relate to her experiences. She has troubles just like everybody(Read: Peter Ingham, a weedy little kid who thinks she is his friend just because they share a birthday, and Justine Littlewood, a nasty snitch who is mean to everybody except Tracy's ex-best friend) but not quite like everybody. The characters are well thought out and the ending, where you don't know if Cam will adopt her yet, leaves you asking for more. This book is good for adults who like a short, funny story or kids who like books about other kids (basically every kid). Myself, I didn't half like it.If you liked this book, try reading The Suitcase Kid, also by Jacqueline Wilson.I have only given it 4 stars, because Americans and Canadians might find it hard to get used to Tracy's British vocabulary.--YMP"},{"Title":"Story of Tracy Beaker","review":"This book is fun and very easy to read and a little bit sad at the same time. It's the story of a girl named Tracy who hates almost everybody around her, but she really loves her mom and wishes she would come pick her up from the children's home. She likes to think her mom is a Hollywood star. Tracy thinks she is the smartest girl and she's a little bit self-centered (I think you'll understand this from the book cover!). After she meets Cam, she starts to like other people.I recommend this book for ages...I think any age will enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Story of Tracy Beaker","review":"This book is about a girl whose mum does not want her.

Came in great shape, her granddaughter loves it."},{"Title":"Pookie and the Gypsies","review":"Pookie and the Travelling People's CircusThis is the second \\"Pookie\\" book by Ivy L. Wallace. The first book, simply titled \\"Pookie\\" (1946) described how in a seemingly ordinary rabbit family, a little white baby rabbit was born with a pair of tiny wispy wings on his back. Teased by his family and neighbours, and longing to fly with the moonlight fairies, Pookie decides to leave home to seek his fortune. After many adventures, as autumn comes to an end and bitter winter winds blow, Pookie, despairing, falls from a hillock -- but, happily, is found by Belinda, the kind daughter of a woodcutter. Nursed back to strength by Belinda, and loved by her, Pookie finds that his wings grow and strengthen, and this first story ends with Pookie now a happy flying rabbit!The second book \\"Pookie and the Gypsies\\" (1947) is an adventure, as the title and cover illustration -- Pookie is seen sitting on a high tree branch, looking down on the bright tents and caravans of a circus -- suggest.Perhaps surprisingly, even though, as a character, Pookie has barely been introduced, this story also introduces a separate sequence of characters and animals, the \\"Animal Shelf\\", which later became a successful TV cartoon series.The story is that Pookie sets out from Belinda's cottage very early one morning, to \\"fly to the end of the wood and back\\". Just when he feels it must be breakfast time, and flies down to land on a tree, he sees the circus -- not that Pookie understands what a circus is, at first. A gypsy walks out of one of the tents, and puts a small monkey on another branch of the same tree, chained to the branch.Naturally Pookie begins to talk with the monkey -- called Tunkey -- and he is shown some of the monkey's circus tricks. Alas, as Pookie is concentrating on watching Tunkey, the gypsy catches Pookie and puts him in a cage. But Pookie is not alone. Also in the cage is another captured animal, a stuffed-toy giraffe, who has lost some of his stuffing, so he continually falls over, and is told to \\"get up\\" -- naturally, and amusingly, the giraffe is called, or believes his name to be, Getup.Getup, and another stuffed-toy -- a zebra called Stripey -- belonged to a boy called Timothy. But Timothy's mother had sent the two toys to a jumble sale (perhaps a church bazaar, or a fete). Although the two toys had escaped on the journey, Getup was captured by the gypsy, and is now part of the circus act.Another creature also visits the caged animals: Kinker, the mouse, so-called because his tail was once caught in a mouse-trap and, although he managed to get out of the trap, his tail was permanently kinked. Perhaps because of the trauma of this injury, Kinker does not talk, but Getup is able to \\"read\\" what Kinker tries to communicate, by observing Kinker's face and eyes.The gypsy realises that a flying rabbit will be a great attraction at the circus. At first Pookie does amaze the crowd, and is thrilled to be the centre of attention. But when Pookie considers a thrilling life in the circus, he remembers Belinda, and feels so crippled with homesickness that his wings almost completely shrink and he is no longer able to fly.The gypsy is so annoyed that his star attraction has stopped being an attraction he decides he will put Pookie in a pie!Happily Stripey comes to the rescue, and all the animals escape. Pookie offers them a home with Belinda. But Getup and Stripey choose to return to their loving master, Timothy. (Later, and never again with any connection with Pookie, the two stuffed-toys Getup and Stripey, and a different monkey called Woeful, and two other toy animals, a bear called Gumpa and a tiny white kitten called Little Mut [one \\"t\\"], appear in a series of small-book format stories -- \\"The Animal Shelf\\".) Tunkey and Kinker both choose to return to the circus. As Tunkey explains, at the circus there are \\"special nuts and bananas which might not grow in the wood\\", and there is the happy circus life -- \\"I love being in the Circus\\" -- despite which Tunkey has his usual sad monkey face (hence, similarly, the name of the \\"Animal Shelf\\" toy monkey, Woeful -- it is how that sort of monkey naturally looks).Naturally Pookie is delighted to be reunited with Belinda, safe, and at home, loved, and a little wiser.This may not be a masterpiece of children's literature, such as \\"Pookie\\", or \\"Pookie Puts the World Right\\", but it is a thoroughly satisfying story.I am not sure \\"Pookie and the Gypsies\\" was reissued in the last years of Ivy L. Wallace's life. When she wrote to me about her struggle to recreate the artwork so that the \\"Pookie\\" series could be reprinted -- around 1994 -- she said (about the possible re-issuing) \\"Pookie and the Gypsies will take some thought & replanning if it is to come out again -- as Circuses are not \`in' things now here -- Gypsies are \`Travelling People' -- no caged animals, etc. (I'm a supporter of \`no cages' of course!) I'll be re-writing it & re-illustrating something to take its place as no. 10 in the series\\".Should we be concerned? In 1947 who (apart from Travelling People or Romany, or however they would refer to themselves) would be concerned at the word \\"gypsy\\"? (Political correctness, surely, only goes so far, and usually does not act retrospectively: we are unlikely to start referring to pieces of gypsy-inspiured music such as Sarasate's \\"Gypsy Airs\\" or \\"Zigeunerweisen\\" as \\"Travelling People's Piece\\" or \\"Roma Melodies\\".) Similarly, animals in cages, and animals as circus acts, and even animals in cages in zoos, were just the way of the world around 1947. A simple Note to the Modern Child could explain that things are, happily, different now, but \\"Pookie and the Gypsies\\", unrevised for would-be political correctness, in its 1947 telling, is a good story, plainly told in the language of the time.A more important question is whether there is any racial prejudice in the description of the actual gypsy who features in the book? He is described as \\"a tall dark man with gold rings in his ears\\" (first un-numbered page of the story). But surely this is merely descriptive, not prejudiced. His behaviour may seem cruel: keeping Tunkey chained up, and caging Getup, and then Pookie. Certainly he does not feed them well -- \\"a plate of brown mush that tasted of nothing, and a tin lid of water\\". Unquestionably he is brutal when he decides to turn Pookie into a rabbit pie. But, in his defence, he has no need to keep a rabbit that is not a performing circus attraction. (His disappointment is reminiscent of the dashed hopes at the end of the classic Warner Brothers cartoon \\"One Froggy Evening\\", directed by the great Chuck Jones: 1955 -- a frog that can SING AND DANCE on a sidewalk merely croaks when on stage!)Far more significantly, given a chance at freedom, Tunkey and Kinker both choose to return to the circus and the gypsy. He can't be that bad, surely. The man may be dark, and have ear-rings, and a bad-temper when disappointed, and lack sensitivity to animal nutrition, but he is not a bad man, and there is no compelling evidence of racial or ethnic prejudice in the story.As the key beginning of the \\"Animal Shelf\\" series, and as a fine addition to the tales of Pookie, with excellent illustrations, and a circus story almost as good as Walt Disney's \\"Dumbo\\" (!), this is highly recommended.John Gough -- Deakin University -- jagough49@gmail.com"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Very well written. If you've ever wondered how it feels to go from being normal to planning suicide, this book will lead you step my step into the darkness.

Since I've always been intrigued by the human condition & it's attendant psychology, although books such as The Bell Jar are not my usual fare, it kept me there with the main character in a personal way. Also, I've always appreciated writing talent. Ms. Plath IS TALENTED. I found her style unlike anything I've previously read and yet very efficient and effective.

For no explained reason, Esther begins to go crazy. Sylvia Plath takes you into Esther's mind, and you slowly fall into her insanity right along with her. You will experience a cynical yet reasonable outlook on life.Author Bio: Sylvia Plath was born in 1932. She was raised in a middle-class home, and attended Smith College. During her junior year in college, she suffered a mental breakdown. This is chronicled in The Bell Jar, which is largely autobiographical. She recovered well enough to finish her senior year, receiving various awards and graduating summa cum laude. She won a Fulbright scholarship and went to Cambridge University for two years. There, she met Ted Hughes, a British poet whom she married and moved to England with. With him, she had two children. She committed suicide at age 30, and her macabre poetry was collected afterwards in three books.Evaluation: The reason I bought this book was because the name sounded familiar, and the back told me that I would be following the crack-up of Esther Greenwood. It sounded interesting, but little did I know just how closely I would witness Esther's insanity! What really stands out in my mind about The Bell Jar is how immersed I was in Esther's world, thoughts, and feelings. I felt like I was right there with her, and I could almost feel her emotions. At many points, I had to stop reading because I was beginning to feel as depressed as she was! Sylvia Plath does an excellent job of bringing the reader into Esther's mind. Her cynical views seemed very normal and feasible. Ideas and phrases are well articulated, so you can understand exactly what Sylvia/Esther is talking about. Plath's thoughts are very well expressed. It's incredibly interesting to read about somebody who is going insane, especially since the story is largely autobiographical - so you know that Esther's outlook on life and her downward spiral were actually experienced by Sylvia Plath. I love how nothing in the book is sugarcoated. It's great to read something that has the ability to take you from your normal, healthy mind into the psychology of someone going crazy. Finally, I loved the metaphor about the bell jar, from which the book got its title. So while the story can be depressing and a bit much at times, it's very well worth it in the end. To sum it up, this book is extremely interesting, realistic, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good read that's a little bit out of the ordinary."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"&quot;There are no crazy people, merely crazy situations.&quot;Now, I don't necessarily agree with this quotation.

And I cannot see it as such. In the narrator's case, I think she clearly and unflinchingly reports the happenings of the world around her. And her inability to accept the people and standards that her society deems 'normal' as such makes her feel extremely disconnected.I had been warned when I was younger that I shouldn't read this book as it was depressing, sad, bleak, etc. I finally devoured it for the first time last month and loved it.

I was taken through each emotion, from happiness to sadness, during the process of Esther's mental breakdown. It was interesting to see through the eyes of the very disturbed girl. At times I found myself relating to Esther, but at other times I would think of how extremely nutty she was.The Bell Jar was so well written, with a certain flow, that I could not put it down.

Its narrative is vivid and outstanding and its intensity is extraordinary.Esther is perturbed, she is a loner in a world of multiple possibilities; she has so much to choose from that she begins her descent into a world of darkness known only to those who are really desperate, to those who have the tendency of breaking with reality to those who experience a deep breakdown.The power of this material is astounding and the attention to imagery and rhetoric is ruthless.I recommend it and give it 10 stars. Unforgettable."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"The Bell Jar is the best book I have ever read. The book shows a great sense of feminism and feelings against men. The book explains very clearly the feelings that Plath has gone through. The scenes of suicide are powerful, and makes one look at why someone would desire to take their life. The book takes a look at depression, on a slightly darker scale. Parts of the book are so deep, that it draws the reader's emotions into the life of Esther, the main character of the book.Esther suffers depression, even though in the beginning of the book, she has almost every girls dream, to be living in New York City, for one month free, after winning a contest. The book takes a look at the darker moments in Esther's life, revealing her innermost thoughts, fears, and emotions. Plath's writing is able to make the reader break down along with Esther, and her many faultering emotions. Most women will be able to relate with the ever changing emotions and easy annoyance that Esther goes through. Feeelings of lonlyness, rage, anger, jelousy, anxiety and distress have a great hold throughout the book."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Like other poets and writers, Sylvia Plath got her acclaim after her death, in her case, suicide. Suicide always helps to enhance a person's worth in the art and literary world. Does that sound harsh or cynical? I bet Ms. Plath would agree. Her suicide was a great career move.I just recently read this book and it is well written and interesting. I heard &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; was semi-autobiographical even though it is listed under fiction and called a novel. I mostly wanted to read it because I too have suffered from depression and wanted to see if I could identify with anything Sylvia Plath wrote. Yes I did, with many things. I especially identified with Esther not wanting to bathe and how it seemed a waste of time. I never went three weeks without bathing like she did, but I did get where I considered showering and washing my hair a waste of time, like she said, because we would just have to do it again. That's only one example from the book.I would like to read a good biography of Sylvia Plath now to see if I could get some insight into things that &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; left dangling for me, such as why she/Esther disliked her mother so much."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I have a bad habit of reading the reviews for books before I start reading and I often find myself wondering if I read the same book everyone else did. The Bell Jar was one of those books. I'd heard from several classmates that it was a wonderful book, and I read very positive reviews from this very website, but I found the book to be quite the opposite of what I had expected. Perhaps The Bell Jar is a work that is very limited in it's scope of readers, or perhaps I completely missed the point of this book being written, though I've always prided myself as being a very diligent reader. I read it in one sitting, though I was constantly begging myself to put it down, and I still could not find the connections between all the events in the book. This is a story about the (rather dull) everyday life of a depressed woman where most (if not all) of the notable events take place in the mind. And while stories like this must certainly inspire those in similar positions, I beleive that the events in books should fit together to be unified at the conclusion, and The Bell Jar did not do this for me. There were parts of it I enjoyed and parts that I may even remember, but, having heard the compliments of other reders, I'll humor myself in believing I've read the wrong book."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I cringed when reading the suicidal episodes that Esther Greenwood(Sylvia Plath's alterego) put herself through.

The book was a normal coming of age type book for the first 100 pages, and then all of a suddent Esthter talks of the 19 razors blades she keeps in her purse, and then the entire premise of the novel deepened tenfold and took an unforgettable 180 degree turn into the enigmatic bell jar. When she vividly imagines slitting her wrists I felt nauseous and about to puke wanting to throw the book down. Needless to say, I really got into the novel and the characters -undoubtedly because they're all real people in Plath's life... This classic is deeply disturbing, yet refreshingly redeeming & reinvigorating.FYI: A must read - not just for chics."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"The brilliance of The Bell Jar is the realistic way Plath tells Esther's story and the interconnectedness of the elements of her madness. The first statement Esther makes to her reader is how sick she gets at the thought of being electrocuted. Later, after she comes more undone mentally, she goes through electric shock therapy and, hearing a story about a man who was saved from a suicide attempt, she becomes obsessed with thoughts of suicide. She emerges from her madness and self-destructive thoughts after her friend hangs herself. Yet throughout her experience with madness the fear of going through shock therapy drives her to the brink of suicide.Plath describes madness to feel as if one is under a bell jar. Esther implies the suffocating sensation when she says that wherever she goes, whether to Europe or Asia or the moon, that she will always \\"be sitting under the same glass bell jar, stewing in [her] own sour air.\\" Esther knows that something is not right inside of her, and she knows that it is worse to be afflicted in the mind than in the body, but she is hindered in her ability to communicate or even catalogue her own issues.The most tragic element of The Bell Jar is how closely it parallels Plath's own experience. Plath went through a traumatic experience with electric shock therapy and did eventually end her own life at the age of thirty. The characters seem to closely relate to her family members, as Plath had an overbearing mother like Esther's and lost her father, a European insect expert, at a young age. Sadly, it seems that the realistic nature of Plath's first novel was wrought from her own plunge into madness, yet Plath did not meet the same end as her character."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"&quot;The Bell Jar,&quot; a classic novel by Sylvia Plath, describes the dark depressed world of Esther Greenwood through her battles with depression, which paralleled the author's in many cases. The novel is semi-autobiographical and includes Plath's harrowing experience with an attempt at suicide.The story begins with Esther and eleven other girls in a New York city hotel room, all winners of an internship from a fashion magazine contest. It follows her through a variety of adventures as she slowly sinks deeper and deeper into depression. The slow demise of Esther's mind is shown and explained in her attempt at suicide to her experiences in a rehabilitation center and is made to seem almost, but not completely rational and understandable to the reader.&quot;The Bell Jar&quot; is a compelling and engrossing book that will keep the readers eyes glued to the page until the abrupt ending."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I read this book for the first time when I was 15 years old. I thought it was mere happenstance that I encountered it, and every since that first introduction it has stayed on my mind every since.Sylvia Plath was one of the most interesting writers of our time. She wrote what she felt and rarely has there ever been another like her or will there ever be.I feel that the mere emphasis on depression in her book was indeed a wake up call for many during that time. During the 1950's people did not readily express their emotions, basically what wasn't socially acceptable was generally locked up inside. It was no accident that Plath chose to write about her own neurotic feelings from the perspective of someone on the outside looking in.I clearly believe that Plath was desperately relaying her feelings in terms of the constant hopelessness and utter betrayal that she possibly felt as a brilliant,young, white woman during the 1950's who was relatively endowed with all the possibilities that one could ever hope for but still utterly depressed, lonely, and confused.This book gives wonderful insight for those who are depressed,lonely, and confused. Plath actually comes to a sort of numbness when she realizes that the planning and hoping as it might be to be the best is not all that it is cracked up to be.This book is brilliant, and unfortunately Plath committed suicide during her short life and career. Sometimes, I ponder about what could have been if she had lived just a little bit longer. We all face times in which we are unsure but we must strive to continue on.&quot;The Bell Jar&quot; was and will always be one of the best books that I have ever read. Its not like &quot;Lisa Black and Dark&quot; or any other dark literature that I can recall at this time. It is because it is a real encounter of a real woman in search of love, comfort, and truth."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"The Bell Jar, by Sylvia Plath, tells the story of the pain and rebirth of a young girl.

It brings out the truthful dark side out of everyone."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Before reading &quot;The Bell Jar,&quot; I read &quot;Ariel,&quot; Plath's collection of poems that really address the climax of her depression with such great poems like &quot;Daddy&quot; and &quot;Lady Lazarus.&quot; But it was only after I read &quot;The Bell Jar,&quot; that I truly appreciated Plath's genius and sophistication as a writer. One of the reasons Plath was such a genius was her command of the English language. &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; does not read like a novel, but more like prose, which made the book a quick read.&quot;The Bell Jar&quot; tells the story of Ester Greenwood, a young woman interning at a woman's magazine in New York City. The reader fully witnesses Ester's decent into depression and her institutionalization in a mental hospital. Like her poetry, &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; is semi - autobiographical and very emotional. Plath also leaves the ending of the novel ambiguous, I do not want to give the ending away but I will say this, do not expect any sort of resolution.All in all, I would recommend this book to Plath fans and those who appreciate a clever, wonderfully written piece of literature."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"The Bell Jar has been on my &quot;to read&quot; list for years, now I finally know what all the fuss is about.

The answer I now know after reading this novel is that there is no answer, it just happens.

Such mentalillness strikes across all social, econmic, racial, andreligiouls boundaries, but rarely has any author beenso candid and courageous in chronicling his/her ownhumiliating and agonizing experiences. It's worth notingthat Ms. Plath died by suicide at the age of 31.I cannot give it five stars, which is reserved for thelikes of Edith Wharton's \\"Age of Innocence\\", but it'sa gripping and harrowing must-read for anyone who everwondered about the experience of mental illness."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"The Bell Jar is a terrifying account superbly crafted.

Sylvia Plath has a natural talent for poetry that is dark, lucid and sharp in its heartfelt emotion. Trust that when you read her poetry, it will absorb you and you will walk away drenched in it; it will hang on you in your daily life like a shadow. I strongly recommend reading Sylvia's poetry, specifically Arial and The Colossus. The Bell Jar does not tap into the writing skills that Sylvia is capable of. Perhaps it is because it is more of a recount, a truthful story than a visually painted portrait of the truth that she creates with surrealist imagery in her poems and even in her personal journals. This woman can write on a level of no other. In comparison to her other work this book seems almost written by someone else, or a child Sylvia. I did in fact read this book very quickly in anticipation of what depth Sylvia was to expose of herself. I believe she did just that in this book, in fact it was almost verbatim her life, with names and places slightly changed. Considering that Sylvia's life ended by her own hand, it's frightening to realize how honest this book was regarding her loss of hope. One can't help but wonder if in fact Sylvia planned this book (or it just simply is) her voice crying out from the grave, because it is in fact saying everything that this book is saying; I speak the truth, here is my pain."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"For the last three years I've had The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath on my TBR (to be read) list. Recently when I saw an audio version on CDs, unabridged, I couldn't resist. Wow, this was a wonderful experience, albeit a sad one as well. The reader, Maggie Gyllenhaal, was wonderful. She had just the right voice, the perfect attitude, and even looks a little like Sylvia Plath, so far as I can see from the small photos on the back of the CD case.I knew, going in, that this was to be a book about insanity, and semi-autobiographical. Typical for a first novel, to want to write about oneself. Of course after I listened to the book I had to do a lot more research because I was fascinated by Sylvia Plath and her brief but eventful life. She was primarily a poet and short story writer who received a guest editorship position at Mademoiselle magazine in New York City by winning a short story contest in 1953. This is where her novel, The Bell Jar, starts, though she renamed the magazine, the main character, and the hotel at which she stayed.In the book, the protagonist, Esther Greenwood, gradually falls apart mentally while interning at a magazine in New York City. She eventually has to leave to move back in with her mother, and from there things get worse. If you compare the novel with her actual life, there are many similarities.In real life, she recovered from her breakdown and married Ted Hughes, another poet. They had two children and lived in England and later, in Massachusetts. Her first and only novel, The Bell Jar, was published on January 14, 1963 in England under a pseudonym, Victoria Lucas. Less than a month later, on February 11, 1963, Sylvia Plath took her own life using gas fumes from her oven. She must have been depressed due to a separation from her husband due to his infidelity, and the pressures of being a single parent, isolated, and unable to afford adequate winter heating or even a telephone.I hope someday to read her unedited journals and some of her poetry, and perhaps some short stories. There also are several biographies about her available. She had an amazing talent for putting the reader in the midst of a situation, right into the thinking process of a deranged protagonist. I felt the narrative of her novel was phenomenally well done. She knew first hand about insanity, and let us in on the secret of how it could happen and what it is like to fall apart mentally, gradually, one step at a time. It is definitely a novel I'd put on my list of books every serious reader should experience at least once."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"The Bell Jar, written by Sylvia Plath, takes the reader on a very in depth and personal trip through depression. The book is written through the eyes of Esther Greenwood, the priveledged college student struggling to find reality and her true self throughout the book. While she should be having the time of her life, Esther sinks deeper into the depths of severe depression. She loses most of her sense of reality, which distorts her mind and eventually even her vision. What Plath leads the reader to believe is that Esther is brought to depression due to her lack of relationships with others. Esther seems to make minimal effort to form any kind of relationships, which leads her into isolation from the world and her life. Although she does form friendships with some characters throughout the book, in her mind she still cannot relate to them.This book was very appropriately named, because when Esther reaches her deepest points of depression, it is as if a bell jar has come down over her, which isolates her from the world. Her mind and vision become so distorted that it is like she is looking through its glass and living her life from underneath it. What is interesting and unique about this book is that it is written through the eyes of Esther. Sylvia Plath is able to take the reader through all stages of extreme depression in some intense and disturbing detail. She must have experienced some form of depression in her life to be able to describe depression so accurately from the viewpoint of Esther.The Bell Jar is an incredibly creative, yet disturbing book with an intirely new aspect for the reader."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Without a doubt, my favourite book.

It refrains from sugar-coating how that sort of experience actually is and how lonely a person must feel to be a victim of their own irrational mind. Esther Greenwood, a sort of representation in itself of Sylvia Plath, suffers from suicidal depression that leads her through the ever-hyped electro-convulsive shock therapy and eventually into an institution. This novel seems to never be ashamed of laying out the facts, as disturbing or irrational as they may seem, from the maddening, wrenching scenes of shock therapy to the self-deprecating feelings Plath experienced that constantly pushed her towards suicide. I think, however, that one has to reach a certain level of maturity or simply experience of age to really identify with this book.

I believe it has such an association with the issues that may forever face women. Not to be sexist but I don't believe a male would relate as much with the main character. Her femaninity is quite an important part to the understanding of her. She attempts to find her place in society while balancing the expectations around her. This conflict leaves a duel mentality, where one minute she feels inferior to all around her, but the next, she feels she can overcome any obstacle. An inability to cope with such emotions leave her frozen in fear. I believe it to be a tragedy but there is no moment to define it as such, therefor, I think one would really have to relate to the character to understand."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"prior to reading \\"the bell jar\\" i read some of sylvia's unabridged journals and there wasn't much of a departure from her real life and the book. now i understand that writers use their own lives to draw from, but this book wasn't much different from reading her own journal entries. it didn't strike me as this literary masterpiece. if i hadn't read the journal entries perhaps i would have felt differently about the book."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Although I don't relate to this book as much as I thought I would, I honestly thought it was mind blowing. Sylvia Plath's story gripped me so much that at points i cried whilst reading it. Normally when i finish reading a book I am very opinionated about it, but this one leaves me speechless, I just don't know what to think. I've never read anything quite like it. It wonderfully describes the slow yet sudden descent into depression"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I've read several books concerning young women who have fallen into mental depression or instability.

She hates men. Basically she follows the rules and gets hurt and decideds its mens fault or someone elses fault. Basically, she is a player hater. THis book should be called player hater. She needs to drink a 40 and try to cheer up and stop being dark and spooky. it was alright though. she writes really good and is honest."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Plath writes the way a surgeon would. Beautiful imagery as usual with Plath, a really good book. Yet, and that would be my reproach, it is so incredibly COLD, distant, unpassionate, almost inhuman. That probably fits with the mood but jeez, that book is depressing like hell, don't expect to \\"relate\\" or feel like you're less alone or something. It's perfect like diamond as a novel, but it's just as cold too. I might be a bit harsh here, for in fact there are passages that are not this cold, of course, but the overall mood is pretty scary. It chills you. But to be honest I think I should reread it because I read it like two years ago, so what I am talking about now is the impressions it left me with. And I remember it being cold as ice. It's as though the main character is some kind of desperate machine. Which probably is a good definition of depression (the mental disease, not your average being sad), so in that respect it's perfect.I think the book certainly deserves more than 3 stars, but it's so cold I can't get myself to give more."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I had high expectations of this book because Sylvia Plath came highly recommended by a reliable source, but I was counting the pages until I was done, painfully waiting for the book to get interesting and it never happened.

The only reason I did give it 3 stars instead of 1 was because the main character is easy to relate to for many people including myself.

Certainly a disturbing piece of work and written is such a way that it would be easy to confuse this as an autobiographical work. The description of the descent into mental illness is so vivid that the readers might question their own mental health. Powerfully written and moving.My only fault with the book was towards the end. While Ms. Plath goes into depth with the descent into mental illness, the reverse is not true. The protagonist's climb to mental health is not documented at all. I would go into detail for this review, but that would involve spoilers. But, it affected me enough that I cannot give the book the full number of stars I would have intended."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I thought this book was good but I felt that there was a heartlessness to it. When I read something I want to be really moved by it. This was a good book but for someone with that many feelings it seemed bland. I suggest reading it for the experience."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Are you the type of person that doesn't like to read that much? Do books bore you? Do you dread reading books assigned by your teachers at school? Is it hard for you to pick a book of your choice to read? If you answered yes to those questions, you might want to consider stopping by your local library or bookstore to purchase The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath. Though this book isn't a hot new release it's just as fresh as the books of today. It enters the mind of teenagers of today, which is good that teenagers are able to relate with the main character, Esther Greenwood. With all of the trials and tribulations that she goes through, it's almost a sure thing that readers could find at least one thing in common with her.The fact that the author continued page after page to throw all these problems at Esther could be considered an issue. Some reader's might think that maybe it was too much. Though if one were to see things in another light they could see it as the problems being stepping stones in life. Esther was climbing up but in reality she knew that sometimes you just have to start over for the best. Sylvia Plath proved in this book that you can fall rock bottom in your life and still be able to be on top once more."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"There are brief glimpses of brilliant writing in this book, but as a whole it is not consistently brilliant. What I am struck with the most is the utter selfishness of the author, the main character. For her to keep trying to kill herself simply because she is sated with life, out of sheer ennui from having been given too many opportunities in life, is galling. The author had some talent, but she had a lot more selfishness than talent. And she proved that when she later killed herself in real life. I'm sorry, but you DO NOT kill yourself after you've had children. Sorry, but once you have kids, the suicide option is out. Tell that to Kurt Cobain and Ian Curtis and any other self-centered artist: Try being a responsible human being for a change and quit thinking only about yourself so much."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I probably wouldn't recommend this book to lovers of fiction. There is no \\"plot\\" as such- the story unfolds in a fly-on-the-wall manner. You're simply observing a series of events (I use this word loosely) that may or may not have any significance. Was this done on purpose? I'm sure folks will say so. But as a result, for much of the book I felt bored, wondering when something would \\"happen\\". Apparently I missed the purpose of this book until I neared the end. The book doesn't serve any purpose other than to have you tag along on a journey.I fail to see how this book became such a classic. I imagine it's much the same as those posh people in the fine art world who crowd around a painting of nonsensical splatters and \\"Ooh & Ahh\\" over its hidden meanings. I'm sure that more literary types will point out how Esther was a model of the feminist movement, the issues of mental health care, and the conservative beliefs of the time. But all these points were breezed over in passing, and failed to tweak anything inside me. There was no impact, no revelation. It seemed like whenever Plath had the opportunity to create some great moment with the reader, she shrugged and turned her back.Is this a captivating tale of real depression? To anyone who hasn't suffered from mental illness, I'm sure this book would have left them as clueless as before. Certainly it's apparent to fellow sufferers that Plath (Esther) has a big problem with mental illness. Detachment from the world, lack of consequence, suicidal thoughts in a very passive manner... these are all things I'm intimately familiar with. But this was just another thing that rubbed me the wrong way. If not to open the eyes of \\"normal\\" folk, what was the point of this book?In that sense, this book felt very self-indulgent. Plath seemed to care very little about the reader's experience. Any opportunity to expand on a concept or leave an impression on the reader was ignored. It seems that Plath simply wrote this book as a journal of sorts, but without the usual deep and personal insights.For such a personal book, Plath was remarkably successful at distancing her readers. And for that reason, I just can't recommend this book. Will there be folks who think this is a masterpiece? No doubt. I'll let them \\"Ooh & Ahh\\" over the paint splatters while I go and admire the works of the Renaissance.Edit: I should clarify that I'm perfectly aware that this was a personal work (thus the \\"lack of care about the reader's experience\\") and that it was Plath's family who published this book after her death. But given the above points, I feel that this is one of those works that should have remained private. Was this just a money making venture?"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"This was a textbook requirement and though the hardcover was a plus (since I really prefer hardcovers) and the content suited the Women's Studies course I took, owning it now after the fact, gives me no resale value, as is always common as new editions emerge.

Can't remember her name, isn't that terrible? I think her character was undiagnosed bipolar. I've felt the same kind of pain in my life as hers, although I've never attempted to commit suicide. The most interesting parts of the story is when she's experimenting with different ways of killing herself. The style of writing for Sylvia Plath is very artful and descriptive.

It's definitely worth purchasing and adding to your collection."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Plath's pseudo-autobiographical account, THE BELL JAR, is a striking novel rich in symbolism and marked with thematic relevance. Plath's main character, Esther Greenwood, a talented writer living in NYC and working for a fashion magazine, finds life as a female to be a terrific struggle of choosing between and conforming to the cookie-cutter &quot;good girl&quot; or &quot;bad girl&quot; roles of society. Consequently, Esther continuously references her inability to pick from the world's &quot;fig tree&quot; of female roles; she does not want to conform to ONE single role because she is diverse in both her thoughts and abilities. Plagued by her &quot;abnormal&quot; (as seen by society) desires for female equality, Plath loses her sense of identity and ends up in a mental institute attempting to overcome oppression from the conformity that she cannot defeat.Will Esther conquer or succumb to the pressures of life's &quot;bell jar&quot;? Only by reading this symbolic novel of self-discovery can one uncover Esther's true fate. Down-to-earth with real-life characters who suffer real-life problems, this novel proves to be a great read for anyone who is looking for lessons on how to prevent and/or overcome personal trials in life. Learning from the examples/mistakes of Esther, the reader grasps insight into life lessons throughout the novel. Skillfully incorporating various symbols and themes into the text, Plath engenders a literary masterpiece as well as work of art.Indeed, I am convinced that if a reader is willing to open up both his heart and his mind to the sensitive issues of this novel, he will not be let down."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I find this book almost the biography of Sylvia Plath. The protagonist,Esther Greenwood have numerous similarities to Plath. Reading this heart-breaking novel was a totally unforgettable experience.The book began with narration of Esther,19 and trying to write something in the summer in New York,1950. Esther like Plath was going through a difficult phase with life. She expereinced failures and distress and with unstable mind plus a little this and that lead to mental illness which eventually lead to suicide. Plath depicted the whole situation and events so vividly. Only one been through those thoughts and suffering could relate.Plath wrote it with so much empathy and conscientious. She was crying out for help to her mental unstableness and woe she was going through.Since this novel was published a month before her death at 30.Wonder how come no one approach to help her.If at that time she had care and support plus better treatment,maybe there's hope, or maybe not...."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"It is a very good book. Like I said in the title -- it reminds me of Catcher in the rye but written by a female. I like how witty and introspective the writer is. The part about the mental hospital is more brutal and less entertaining than the part about New York etc. However, overall, the book gave me the experience I have been seeking -- namely to get a feel of what it's like to be a girl (I am a boy myself). Plath is very good at getting precisely at the femaleness of her character. Too bad she didn't get to write her second novel. I am sure it would be something amazing."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Plath has sharp insight into the catty &quot;why-bother&quot; view of the world as many suicides see it. In turns humorous, serious, and philisophical she savages the expectations of women in the 1950s the powerlessness of adolescents in that pre-scripted world.Gender roles are more flexible today in no small part thanks to the proliferation of this book on college campuses in the late 60s and early 70s. It is readable and challenging. Only decades after it's creation, many of it's phrases are among the most familiar in English literature."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"This book is beutiful and utterly facinating.

Plath does a good job of helping you to empathize with the main character so much that it makes you wonder if you could end up in the same state, which emphasizes the insidiousness of mental illness.

I would read it,it's g ood!"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"This novel of about 200 pages consists of two quite different halves. Esther Greenwood, a brilliant college girl in the early 5Os, spends a month in New York as guest editor with a women's magazine. The first half of the novel is about her adventures with the other college girl guest editors in New York. These are extremely funny. The mood, however, is darkening constantly, so that on should not be too surprised that Esther collapses completely after the expected admittance to a writing course does not come through. The second half of the novel is about depression, suicide and psychiatric wards.The book is fascinating (although I was a bit surprised to see some reviewers rate it among the greatest novels of the century), but the narrator is not always reliable - after all, she feels she experiences life through a bell jar, cut off from the rest of the world. The book does not really help the reader understand depression the way &quot;I never promised you a rose garden&quot; by Hannah Green did for schizophrenia. We only get a very hazy notion of the nature of the therapy, for example.Maybe it is because the novel is strongly autobiographical, but the narrator always keeps a certain distance to herself. There are lots of things she would never tell. There is hardly anything she would not joke about. After all, that is what many reviewers forget to mention: &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; is a very funny book with some billiant satire on 50s America - not just in the first half!"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"This book will suck you into the mind of Esther Greenwood right away.Sylvia Plath is an author with a confusing writting style yet interesting.

I couldn't help wondering what it would be like being burned alive all along your nerves.\\"And so begins this novel, documenting the life of one young Esther Greenwood as she starts off working as an intern at one of NYC's more prestigious magazine firms, and ends up in the nuthouse.The way Esther documents (she and a friend) getting picked up by some DJ on the street in NYC is hilarious, but this, unfortunately, is perhaps the last bright spot in the book and we have barely turned the cover. The book then takes us on a manic roller coaster journey in and out of mental institutions that would come to be synonymous with Plath's life, on which this novel is based. The rest, alas, is history.But Esther, or Sylvia Plath, was not simply crazy. She was highly rational, in my mind anyhow. Knowing how much to tip, however, was one thing that caused the young Esther much consternation. She documents getting stalked by a taxi driver after exiting the cab after not having left a substantial enough gratuity. And as for her reflections on room service, this is what she writes: \\"I could have called down and asked for breakfast in my room, I guess, but I would have to tip the person who brought it and I never know how much to tip. I'd had some very unsettling experiences trying to tip people in New York.\\"Critics call this book self-absorbed, but we are all self-absorbed in our own ways, are we not? I see Ms. Plath, or the young Esther Greenwood, as a sensitive woman who was simply overwhelmed by the contradictions, intricacies, cruelties and vagaries of life. And, of course, there may have been, and probably was, a chemical imbalance somewhere in that mind of hers. Those less sensitive of us would simply call her a \\"paranoid nutcase,\\" but as one person noted, \\"Sylvia Plath had a way with darkness..........\\" She sure did.Read this book at the risk of getting severely depressed but at the same time learning that you aren't crazy--you are simply a lone fish in a crazy world.Rick gives it four stars.

Although she is known primarily for her poetry, I've often thought that Bell Jar captured both her skill as a sharp poetess, but also her lesser-known sense of humor. The Bell Jar involves suicide attempts and mental institutions, but more importantly, it doesn't dwell on tragedy so much as cut through it. Plath's photographic depiction of what it is like to be thrust into adulthood and all the other things that aren't in childhood are equally important and remind the reader that the things that we experience are neither so beautiful nor ugly as they are absurd.Whether or not you've ever been depressed, the Bell Jar captures not only the fear of nothing ever changing, but also the greater fear of things being different, twin processes which are, to me, at the heart of depression."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"The Bell Jar, by Slvia Plath, is a somewhat autobiography of the author's life. To begin the book we meet Esther, an aspiring author who gets a chance to go to New York to work on a magazine. While in New York, Esther realizes the phoniness of the people around her and that she has serious problems dealing with society as a whole. Esther in a downward spiral of dispair and confusion, takes a whole bottle of sleeping pills. Having survived from her overdose Esther is admitted to a mental institution where she is forced to discover her true self, and remove the bell jar that is suffocating her. Sylvia, the author, does an amazing job portraying Esther's raw emotions and inner desires. This is a wonderful book for anyone who liked The Catcher in the Rye, and Girl Interuppted. The Bell Jar has the same pesimistic attitude toward society. Slylvia is a great author with many classics under her belt and this is yet another to add to the list."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Although this partially auto-biographical book written by Sylvia Plath is most commonly discussed in feminist groups and psychology classes, its a book for the likes of anyone who's ever felt a bit out of touch with reality. Plath was an excellent poet, and an extremely good author. The fact that this is her only novel is quite disappointing. This book is easier read than almost any other I've ever picked up. Its a better written Catcher In The Rye. One that doesn't so much focus on the whining and complaining about life, but more of the spiral of feeling insane and like an outsider. Don't get me wrong. In no way is this a take-off of Catcher In The Rye. It is as unique as any book that you could get your hands on. That's what makes it so brilliant. Also, I think anyone who reads this book should try their very hardest to read Plath's poetry along with it. It will make you understand her world on a bit more of an artistic level. Basically, I can't stress enough how important this novel is to American Literature. Someday, this book will be in as high of regard with the literary greats as Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre and Shakespeare's MacBeth."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"The Bell Jar is an interesting read that one could pick up and get through in a couple of sittings or less. The book follows a 1950's college aged woman who finds herself while simultaneously going \\"under\\". The book has an interesting autobiographical element to it and this version has a superb section about the life of Plath, which I found fascinating after reading the book.For me the most interesting aspect of the book is the way Plath delves into the psyche of this woman who is losing a grip on reality. It's surprisingly and disturbingly sad and funny at the same time. I could relate to some of her apparent disinterest but other than that I've never been exposed to someone who has been deemed by society to be \\"officially\\" crazy. At times I wondered if she really had a problem all along or if everyone around her were such \\"conformists\\" that she was just out of place. Also the portrayal of 1950's psychiatric treatment was well done in an entertaining manner but not convincingly accurate.The writing is a uniquely stylized 1st person perspective and I felt like Esther was telling me this story face to face. It's disappointing that Plath's life ended so early as her ability to write novels might of rivaled her poetry skills.I would recommend this book to casual readers as it moves quickly and is easy to follow. Appropriate for people over 18 although most high school students could probably handle it. Contains sexual situations and adult themes.Bottom Line: A well-written fascinating portrayal of how quickly someone who is \\"normal\\" can fall from grace. Great window into 50's society and expectations."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"An in-depth look at the struggles of a young woman. Reviewer: Linville LA Student from Linville, Louisiana I really enjoyed this book because it took you inside the mind and heart of Esther Greenwood. You always knew how she was feeling. The Bell Jar is a story about a successful woman who struggles with her inner self and some social issues. She gradually slips into a deep, dark depression and struggles to find the light of day again. She has problems with her mother. She can't seem to get a relationship worth keeping. She had problems finding someone she could trust; someone that could and would help her. She admits herself to an asylum, where she spends a lot of time. Shock therapy was proven ineffective and therefore pointless. She just drifts deeper and deeper into her state of depression until she does not even know who she is.

Her destiny is left up to the individual reader."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Living with bipolar disorder myself, she captures some of the nuances of depression and describes them very well.

Read and comprehend this book the way it was meant to be, you will find another world that does exist in some of us.I have found her writing so captivating, the descriptions, simple but effective. She saw a different world, as most of us do, but to write the way she does takes talent. This book led me to read her unabridged journals. An amazing, intelligent but damaged woman."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I think the reason why a lot of people haven't taken to her writing style is because you have to keep in mind that Sylvia Plath was, first and foremost, a poet - not a novelist. There is an honesty and poetic quality that embodies every single word of this book. This is not a book that was written to make people feel sorry for her and if you met Esther Greenwood in real life you may not even like her, but one thing you do come away with after reading this book is an understanding of how a person can go from functional to suicidal in a matter of days.It's hard to understand under what conditions a person could commit suicide if you have never attempted it yourself (I never have.) And if you can't understand, you can't appreciate how real a suicidal person's feelings are. In this book, Sylvia lays out her feelings and thoughts with such honesty and poignancy that it literally becomes painful to imagine her suffering.Besides suicide, the other major issue covered in this book is the feminist double-standard. Why is it that men who sleep with many women are congratulated and women who sleep with many men are socially chastised? She touches on this subject through her encounters with men. You can feel her frustration and anger with the double-standard and you know (knowing what is to come later on in the book) that this only exacerbates her feelings of hopelessness.It's sad that poets are so underappreciated in our society. Overall, this is one of the best books written... ever. Poets write great prose because they see beauty and sadness where others see ordinary. Then they translate this to the written word and it becomes a glorious celebration of language."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"'The Bell Jar' remains one of the best books ever written on depression, far better than say 'Prozac Nation' or 'She's Come Undone'. However, unless the reader has experienced depression firsthand, they may have difficulty relating to the protagonist. Those who criticize this book will always demand a rational reason for Ester's depression. This isn't very different from the way people act in real life. People who have never experienced depression firsthand fail to miss something: there isn't a rational reason for depression. In depression, the word 'rational' doesn't exist. It could be a cause of many things, often times being a chemical imbalance in the brain. Let's just say this: depression can happen to anyone. It doesn't matter if you're rich and privileged, successful, or loved. Depression is uncontrollable and it's not something a person can merely 'snap out of'.So what is it about 'The Bell Jar' that makes it superior to its imitators? Perhaps its the book's sense of humor. Whether talking about movies shot in Technicolor or 'scandal sheets' (aka: tabloids), society is viewed through a humorous yet almost sardonic-like telescope. The book is roughly edited, and the run-on sentences and random observations give it a more personal feel. To this day, 'The Bell Jar' remains a great testimonial on what depression feels like."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"It's an interesting look at how some one who originally wouldn't be considered crazy today was driven to semi insanity and a suicide attempt by an oppressive society. She didn't want to fit into the standard role expected of women at that time, for example, she tells a male character that she never wants to get married, to which he responds ,\\"You're crazy\\". She is later assualted and continually prohibited from doing what she wants because she is a woman, which is partially to blame for her break down."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"The death of her father when she was only eight years old had a profound and terrible effect on Sylvia Plath. It was the dark star that ruled her life and led her to a period of insanity in her early twenties and eventually to suicide when she was thirty. All of this can be seen in her poems and in this thinly fictionalized autobiographical account of her mental illness. She likens the experience to being sealed in a bell jar, isolated from the world, her view of which becomes heavily distorted by the glass walls of her mental prison. She herself seems never to have faced up to the etiology of her neurosis and she does not describe her doctors as having discussed the issue, even though, after electroconvulsive therapy and (expensive) nursing care within an asylum eventually effected a cure of sorts (in reality, a temporary patching up), she describes herself as having been 'analyzed'.The Bell Jar is a painfully honest confessional that captures the characteristic self-absorption and craftiness of the mentally ill. She had considerable difficulty finding the right voice for this, her only novel, but finally hit on a sparse, fragmentary narrative style, embodying surreal poetic imagery, that is reminiscent of Salinger or Nathanael West. It is usually the girlish voice of the novel's protagonist rather than the mature voice of the author herself, with constant reference to hairstyles and shoes and of the unsatisfactory nature of the men in her life. Their real failure, of course, was in not being her father, and the threat they posed was that they would, as he had in a sense done, finally abandon her.Plath herself said that The Bell Jar could never be published in America, and when, after the author's death, it was, her mother tried to stop its publication. The characters and events were too thinly disguised for comfort. It remains, like most of her poems, a raw and open wound, a beautifully written and compelling narrative that has deservedly become a modern classic."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"This book is a work of art. Plath's poetic skill comes shining through in this novel about a young woman suffering from severe depression and suicidal ideation. Plath's use of words to convey images, feelings, thoughts and personality is precise. The story flows beautifully, as she tells the story of Esther Greenwood.Esther's fall into depression reveals in depth insights into the malady that come from Plath's own experiences. This brings up an issue when reading this book. It is difficult to separate the character and the novel from the author and her own life and tragic ending. That consistently loomed in the back of my mind as I read about E. Greenwood.I enjoyed reading this, but also had to put it down at times because of the depressing nature of the story. Plath puts the reader into the thoughts and consciousness of a depressed young woman, and that is not an uplifting experience. I don't think this is the type of novel you just read for pleasure w/o becoming involved with the character. Plath wants to make sure you know what it is like to be a depressed person thinking about suicide.It has an optimistic ending that allows you to leave Esther Greenwood to take on the world again and to trust that she will do OK, even though the author fell victim to the depression that haunted her."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"While reading something, somewhere, I saw this book mentioned, and I ordered it from the library.

I first came upon this book when introduced to it by my English teacher quite a few years ago. It's a raw look at the mental stability of Plath before her marriage to Ted Hughes. It's full of wit, humor, and morbidity and focuses around an internship at a hip magazine office in NYC. Everyone can relate to something about the main character Esther; whether you are male or female."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"This book is a classic by any standard or categorization, and certainly stands out in the genre of mental illness narratives. It is probably one of the most vivid and articulate descriptions of mental illness ever written. Not surprisingly, I also found it disturbing and somewhat frightening.

It seems as if the charactor falls into a point in her life, and you don't even see it coming. The things that you read may seem disturbing, but you can't help but read more. I recomend this book strongly. Pay close attention-the story changes in a blink of the eye."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"A scared loss of understanding and reality are all that serve as the backbone to the what must be quasi-autobiographical tale of Plath. When reading, you can almost hear the whispers of depression and anguish in between the typing on the page. I found the book extremely interesting and yearning to wonder how someone so talented (see also E. Wurtzel) could feel so horribly bad just livign out life. The book is a pre-cursor to the many books on depression out today, but offers its knowledge through a story of fiction and undoubtedly, of the happenings of the well-known author."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"This book is amazing. Plath includes her personal feelings and emotions. She draws you into the mind and soul of Esther Greenwood. Although it is has a dark tone, the novel draws you in. This book is not for everyone though. If you like happy and light hearted novels, this is not for you. This is a great book if you are looking to read something \\"deep.\\" There are many psychological and social issues that are presented through out the text. The use of symbolism proves to be effective, as well. Overall, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is not afraid of the idea of death (heaven knows that there is much about that through out the book)."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"This is probably my favorite book ever. As a self-diagnosed bipolar, cynical, angry teenage girl I can say that Sylvia Plath puts what millions of us feel every day into exactly the right words. [...] But then I read it again. And again. Probably too many times. Plath knows exactly what she is talking about, this book is heartbreaking and personal. It's like Catcher in The Rye with a poetic Franny as the main character, only Ester's way more [messed] up than Franny."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"This is a brilliant first person account of the experience of having a mental disorder (including very exact descriptions of schizophrenia, back before it was widely known of in the 'sane' world, and before it was transformed into entertainment fare by the makers of the filmed 'A Beautiful Mind') and what contributed to its occurrence. Made all the more horrible and disturbing by the the fact that this is practically an autobiography (with fake names) and that Plath did not end up making it out of the illness alive. She killed herself not long after this novel was finally published."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Sylvia really writes from a \\"someone who gets it\\" perspective. I appreciate her raw demeanor and honesty. I found myself relating to her immediately as she drew my mind further and further onto the pages of this novel.***Caution: Unfortunately, I was already at a low point in my emotional cycles (BPD and BD), so when she was contemplating suicide, so was I. By continuing reading I pushed myself all the way over the edge and woke up alive the next day in the ICU at a hospital. So, DO NOT READ if you are at all at a low point!!!"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Sylvia Plath has in many circles been something of the poster child for modern nihilism, almost to the point of a cultural in-joke (see Fight Club), but the first thing I was struck with was how witty and humorous The Bell Jar starts. For example, this passage:\\"I'd discovered, after a lot of extreme apprehension about what spoons to use, that if you do something incorrect at table with a certain arrogance, as if you knew perfectly well you were doing it properly, you can get away with it and nobody will think you are bad mannered or poorly brought up. They will think you are original and very witty.\\"Second, it didn't take long to figure out how much modern \\"chick lit\\" owes to Plath. Before shopaholics and Prada-wearing Devils, Plath had already been there and done that, all the way down to the poor girl working in the NYC fashion magazine angle.Third, I was touched by the humanity that Plath brings to some tricky subjects: coming of age, sexuality, career-setting, societal pressure, care for the mentally ill, homosexuality, and social shallowness, just to name a few. Her descriptions of Esther Greenwood's trip into madness isn't like watching a specimen under her famous bell jar; you get the feeling that you're watching a living, breathing human being who is trying to find a way out of the mental and emotional box canyons in which she feels trapped.I felt myself connected to Esther in ways that I didn't feel in that other work of 60's young adult angst, The Catcher in the Rye. Where Esther Greenwood is smart, creative, troubled, and desperate, Holden Caulfield is merely smug, whiny, spoiled, and self-obsessed. It's not hard to see why Caulfield resonated with many 60's social elites, since they share some of the same characteristics. In my opinion, Sallinger and Plath shouldn't even share shelf space--The Bell Jar is a deeper, more emotionally involved, and ultimately better written work.Plath's first calling was as a poet; The Bell Jar was the only novel she ever published. Her poet's background served her well, as her prose flows along the pages. I think the book starts a bit better than it ends, but her writing style throughout is a wonder.As for The Bell Jar being a scathing commentary on her personal acquaintances, I didn't get that vibe. It's hard to know what those personal relationships were like, but I got these sense of a person writing about what she knew (Plath had her own mental breakdown in 1953). I can see where some of those people would have been offended, but The Bell Jar was supposed to be the first half of a two volume work, the other half of which was never produced due to Plath's untimely death.Lastly, it's good to remember that The Bell Jar was written in the early sixties and largely prefigures the feminist movement. It's often waved around as a feminist novel, and it certainly takes up some of those themes, but The Bell Jar predates political feminism, and in one of the more poignant passages, foresees the arguments of feminism and their ultimate rejection. Part of the passage is:\\"Of course, the famous woman poet at my college lived with another woman--a stumpy old Classical scholar with a cropped Dutch cut. And when I told the poet I might well get married and have a pack of children someday, she stared at me in horror. \`But what about your career?' she had cried.My head ached. Why did I attract these weird old women? There was the famous poet, and Philomena Guinea, and Jay Cee, and the Christian Scientist lady and lord knows who, and they all wanted to adopt me in some way, and, for the price of their care and influence, have me resemble them.\\"In the end, The Bell Jar is a remarkable work--not merely just important, but also a good read. If you haven't read it yet, you should. It's amazing to think what Plath might have written had she lived longer."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"One might think that a novel about a young college woman's experience with madness in the mid-20th century would come across as dated or even quaint. On the contrary, as I read I found myself nodding emphatically, and even calling up friends to tell them about passages I'd read that were particularly familiar. This reaction emphasizes The Bell Jar's staying power after half a century; any ambitious young woman who has struggled with anxiety about their future, or felt like a square peg in society's round hole, will find themselves identifying with this novel.The story is heavy with the weight of the author's suicide; in fact, the novel is so close to Plath's own experiences that it wasn't published in the United States until after her death, as she was afraid of hurting the real-life people who were thinly veiled as characters in the novel. While the Bell Jar is an important novel in its own right, it will also give readers a more nuanced perspective on Plath's poetry.The Bell Jar sheds light on psychiatric care in the 1950's, under the stifling expectations of a woman's role in post-war America. The novel explores themes of feminism and mental health without being didactic; Esther's insights feel relevant and real today, while revealing much about the society in which Plath herself came of age. Some find heroine Esther Greenwood's descent into mental illness to be depressing, but I found her story to be ultimately life-affirming; Plath avoids nihilism by not merely focusing on Esther's breakdown, but also her recovery.You needn't have spent time under \\"the bell jar\\" (Plath's metaphor for the extreme anxiety and depression felt by the young protagonist) to appreciate this novel; Plath makes the workings of Esther's mind accessible and real. Plath's matter-of-fact style makes neurotic thoughts and suicide fantasies feel almost ordinary; Esther's struggles seem like a perfectly natural response to a world full of date hypocrites and phonies. Some readers may empathize more than others (a friend told me \\"it's like we all become our own version of Esther Greenwood while we're reading the book\\"), but it's difficult to be unaffected by what has become one of the most iconic novels about mental illness, feminism, and the youth experience."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I have always loved this book. Plath's literature is exceptional, in my opinion. But the reason I bought this copy, even though I already own one, is because there are a few of Plath's sketches included in this edition.

I remember staying up late at night reading this book, as it captivated me from the first sentence. In class, we went over a brief background of Sylvia Plath's life and the personal, political, social, etc. environment in which the book was written. I remember looking at pictures of Sylvia Plath in class, with her All-American good looks and obvious intelligence, then going home to read the dark thoughts and insecurities that she described in The Bell Jar. I remember being perplexed by this book, as I could not understand why such a successful and beautiful, young lady would ever even think about comitting suicide. I also coudn't understand why she was so \\"turned-off\\" by the world and every important person in her life (i.e. her mother, her father, Buddy Willard, etc.). I mean, I loved this book from the beginning but I was left with many questions regarding Sylvia Plath, herself.Well, I am now two years removed from college and I have gone through some tragedy of my own. I was recently diagnosed with Generalized-Anxiety-Disorder (GAD) and had to get treatment for it. I have since been \\"cured,\\" but in re-reading The Bell Jar I couldn't help but admire how Plath makes the decent of Esther Greenwood into borderline insanity seem rational, if not altogether normal. I may also add that I had recently read The Catcher in the Rye and I got great joy out of paralleling Holden and Esther as I worked through the book. In addition, I researched Sylvia's life more in depth and watched the movie SYLVIA, with Gwyneth Paltrow portraying Sylvia Plath. This added background made all the difference in the world in regards to my experience with this book. As if I hadn't already enjoyed the book so much more my second time reading it, I found the answer to my questions in the \\"Biographical Note\\" section of the book. In it, Aurelia Plath, Sylvia's mom, describes Sylvia's intended message in the Bell Jar, as explained by Sylvia during a conversation with her mother shortly before her suicide:\\" 'What I've done...is to throw together events from my own life, fictionalizing to add color...I think it will show how isolated a person feels when he is suffering a breakdown...I've tried to picture my world and the people in it as seen through the distorting lens of a bell jar.'\\" \\"The very title The Bell Jar should imply what Sylvia told me and that is what the astute reader should infer...\\"Now, I know that Sylvia wasn't \\"turned-off\\" by the important people in her life so much as she was seeing them through the distorted lens of the bell jar. Thus, she wasn't herself and other people's behavior seemed superficial and irrational to her when in reality it was her behavior that was irrational and to a certain extent superficial.Despite the criticisms of this book, I would reccomend everyone to buy this book and read it with this last notion in mind."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"At first, the main character's psyhcosis seemed almost logical. Then, slowly Ester Greenwood lost touch. Plath did a great job of leading the reader along with Ester as she experienced it. I found myself really pulling for her and hoping that she would get better. It is a stomach turning coincidence that Ester feared the Bell Jar would return because it certainly did for the author. It was a very interesting read and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I opened the book and found it a quick read, but I noticed that something was missing. Then I figured it out. Sylvia Plath's brilliance is contained in her poetry. Her book does convey her message quite well (at least what most people consider the message to be) and it is fantastically well written and contains many of the contrasts and comparisons betweeen two seemingly very unrelated things, which distinguishes her work, but it lacks luster. It seems great upon first read, but when compared to her poetry, it is like a candle that is lit, but sputtering. I think her book is a more logical explanation of her madness, but it doesn't make her seem like she is mentally ill. She makes you feel like she is healthy and the rest of the world is sick. Kudos for putting us in her shoes. But aside from that, the rest of the story seems drab, despite the imagery. It didn't evoke many feelings in me. I think literature is meant to stir and inspire. But maybe she just wanted us to feel nothing at all, as if we were trapped under a bell jar and the only thing you can feel is the pain which is so persistant that eventually you become used to it and don't feel it anymore. I guess that's the reason I didn't like the book as well as I should have. She intended for us to feel nothing at all."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"This is a work of art.

Thus I feel it's appropriate to give the reason for my reading the book as a bit of a premise for my review. My favorite musician, Ryan Adams has a hauntingly beautiful song titled \\"Sylvia Plath.\\" The song itself tells of a fascinating woman, and clearly her writing and her life touched Adams in such a profound way that he wrote a tune for her. It was because of that, that I decided to see what the fuss was about, which brings us to my review.I did no research on \\"The Bell Jar\\" prior to buying the book, so I had zero idea what I was in store for. What I found over the past week of reading the book was a thoroughly readable and realistic, feasible story of a tortured, pain filled soul. The writing style of Plath is beautiful throughout, and what strikes me is how current Esther and her situations seem today. I felt at the end of the novel as if the book could have been released this past week, it's that true to life. Now, being a man roughly the same age as Esther it was interesting to read a story which seemed autobiographical throughout from the perspective of a woman. Esther is so much like many people I've met, and she faces the same turmoil that many young people today still face.While the content was indeed heavy and deep and often times a struggle to read as a result--suicide is never a fun topic, and I unfortunately witnessed a dear friend's suicide while living in Spain many years ago--it's a very real problem for young people who don't feel there are alternatives to the bad hands they were dealt.I could not sleep at night if I were to offer any fewer than 5 stars to this book. So easy to read from the perspective of style, and so hauntingly real, I understand fully well why now after having read the book myself I see so many others ranting and raving, singing its praises.\\"I wish I had a Sylvia PlathBusted tooth and a smileAnd cigarette ashes in her drinkThe kind that goes out and then sleeps for a weekThe kind that goes out on herTo give me a reason, for well, I dunno\\"~Ryan Adams"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"While \\"The Bell Jar\\" has appeared on high school reading lists for quite a long time, I don't know many teachers who have actually made it a part of their curriculum.

Taught together, they would illuminate for both genders the process that's usually referred to as \\"coming of age\\" but, as regards these two books, might better be described as the process of beginning to see the world as an inexperienced (and also fascinated) adult.

I love it. The words ebb and flow and just create.It is tough following a woman down into her depression. She has this great life working as an intern for a fashion magazine in the heart of New York City, and then, she just doesn't care anymore. Her life whirls around her and it's as if she just wants to get off the ride. And the voice is very conversational, very informal. I could relate to the character; even though I'm not depressed myself, I felt sympathy and friendship with Esther. If I had known her, I would have visited her in the asylum.Anyway, it's a good book, thought-provoking, creative, a bit morbid, but well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"\\"The silence depressed me. It wasn't the silence of silence. It was my own silence.\\"So, I missed the boat on this one, back in high school when every literate fifteen year old girl was reading it. I'm glad I waited out. I think I would have liked it, but perhaps for the wrong reasons.Ok. The book morbidly fascinates me--a thinly veiled autobiograhical novel of a poet's descent into madness written by a woman who later stuck her head in an oven and committed suicide. Just from this knowledge, the book becomes immediately haunting. But it's not just this black curiosity that made this an engaging read. I love how absolutely honest it is. Unlike other books I have read in which the protagonist goes \\"crazy,\\" Esther Greenwood's insanity is subtle and far more realistic. At the beginning of the book, Esther seems relatively put together, but she slowly unravels so fluidly that I surprised myself when I realized, \\"Wow. This girl is really crazy.\\" Perhaps because it is based on personal experience, I think that Plath's depiction of depression is so well-done. She shows that it is not a raging force, but rather a paralysis, a lack of emotion--and all through beautiful and intense language.This book is a good read, but it will depress you. That being said, I would recommend it, especially to girls in college who feel like they can relate to Plath's story."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"In one of its first reviews, in 1963, this book was called \\"the first feminine novel in a Salinger mood.\\" The narrator certainly has that unique outsider's perspective on a world of which she appears to be part--so typical of Salinger's work. While Esther Greenwood has the outward trappings of a successful college student, she is in reality merely acting the role expected of her by society, increasingly unable to see the point.The powerful thing about this novel is that, despite her impending breakdown, it is easy to understand and identify with so much of Esther's thinking. Her despair is initially rooted in a concern quite common to young adults--but brilliantly expressed--that the myriad *felt* possibilities of life can never be realized in a structured (and stifling) world:\\"I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked.... I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.\\"Unfortunately, Esther's despair continues to deepen, as even the most successful futures begin to seem empty, all effort towards them pointless. In the end, even daily life becomes devoid of meaning:\\"I saw the days of the year stretching ahead like a series of bright, white boxes, and separating one box from another was sleep, like a black shade. Only for me, the long perspective of shades that set off one box from the next day had suddenly snapped up, and I could see day after day after day glaring ahead of me like a white, broad, infinitely desolate avenue.\\"While this transition accompanies a real psychological illness, we experience it through Esther's own thoughts. As a result, the progression of anguish seems natural, consistent, and even sensible. For this, the book has been justly praised for its insight into the inner workings of a troubled mind.In summary, I enjoyed both the beauty of the prose as well as the unique narrative perspective, which offers a troubling but fascinating glimpse of mental disorder. Throughout, sprinklings of humor, intelligent feminist thought, and echoes of Sylvia Plath's own life keep the novel engaging as well as entertaining. (I recommend this edition, which contained just enough background material on Plath and the book's publication to put the work in proper context)."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Esther Greenwood, a college student from Massachusetts wins a dream assignment, with eleven other students, on a big New York fashion magazine. Esther is vulnerable and impressionable and is unable to enjoy her assignment; some of her experiences frighten and disorient her. Esther does not fit in with either of her friends: the rebellious Doreen or the conformist Betsy.Returning home, Esther finds that she has not been accepted into a writing course she applied for, and this leads her to consider what choices she has in life. Thus begins a descent into depression, and a very personal form of madness.It is easy to see autobiographical parallels with Sylvia Plath's own life. Perhaps too easy, and this can detract from a broader message of identity and belonging, which so many of us experience and can relate to. I first read part of this novel as a teenager, almost 40 years ago. I read it then as an autobiographical novel which, while it raised many of the questions I was considering myself, had no comfortable answers. Coming back to the novel now, I see that I wasn't looking past the tragedy of Sylvia Plath's own death to appreciate the writing for its own sake. While Ms Plath took her own life at age 30, that this was a (tragic) choice, not an inevitable outcome.So, why read this novel now? It was published almost 50 years ago and while aspects of the setting reflect that, the underlying search for identity and purpose are timeless. For me, this is a novel worth reading twice.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"For those of us who think we've left the past behind and are terribly sophisticated...Pick this book up. Sylvia Plath is clearly more famous for poetry than prose, but this novel, written first person, is able to subtly place the reader squarely in the protagonist's shoes. The passage \\"the air of the bell jar wadded around me and I couldn't stir\\" illustrates the tactile feeling Plath's writing convey's and the sympathy it engenders in the reader. This novel also reminds us that 'the more things change the more they stay the same' in terms of social and mental health issues."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"This is one of my favorite books for a reason--it manages to capture what some may call insanity in such a raw, tangible, relatable way.

For a brief moment she stood at the mountain peak--the toast of the town. Very sad."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"When I first read The Bell Jar, I think I was in 8th grade. I got very into Plath and her poetry shortly thereafter. The love and respect that I have for Plath is not easy to put into words. I ended up studying her extensively in Grad School and writing my thesis on The Bell Jar. After reading feminist criticism by Julia Kristevia who studied Jacques Lacan, I knew I had to base my thesis on this. My argument was that Plath used feminine language in her novel that was in direct opposition with the 50s stereotypes that she was being forced into. The only way for Ester Greenwood to back to what she felt was true was to descend into \\"madness\\" which was not madness at all but a way to cope with the life she was being FORCED to lead by those around her. Ester was able to overcome her demons by basically rejecting the \\"masculine or symbolic\\" language and embracing the semiotic or feminine language that Kristevia described. Plath rocks!"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I read this book a few months back and really enjoyed it.

A must read for sure!"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I first read this book way back when, when I was a teenager. I absolutely loved it then, and it really holds up as a classic. Yes, it's a feminist novel, and yes, it's angsty, but it's also well-written, moving, and realistic. Plath was one of a kind, and the world is just a little colder without her in it."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"It is good to read about people who are talented, intelligent, perfectionists who suffer from a mental disorder- why - because I think it takes the discrimination out of mental illness that we all have. We are all mentally ill to some degree so I don't know why we abhor it. Maybe with people like Sylvia Plath, we can learn to be more compassionate to one another or ourselves, realizing how easily one can fall into depression or any other type of ailment that attacks our mind."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Insanity is a weird thing - most people are \`insane' to some degree or the other - while a minority succumb to the polarities of the disease and swing back and forth much like a pendulum.Sylvia Plath fell into the latter category, and while the positive end of her spectrum meant that she created some shockingly good work, the negative end ensured that she would meet a tragic and self-inflicted end. Her suicide I think, remains the most mechanical, yet most poetic death of all the great writers, and it's a pity that shes often remembered as \`that woman poet who stuck her head in an oven' when in fact she was well spoken, eloquent woman whose command over the English language was much vaster and encompassing than yours or mine.\\"The Bell Jar\\", her only full length fictional prose work, is almost autobiographical in patches. The publishers make it clear that this is not Plaths' own story, but you cannot help but identify the lead character as Plath herself. The way I see it is this - Sylvia created a fictional character, but gave it her mind and thoughts, leading to one of the most fascinating fictional characters in modern prose. To me, this was the literary equivalent of a convergence of both David Lynch's masterpieces \\"Inland Empire\\" and \\"Mulholland Drive\\". The same \\"a woman in trouble, yet she doesn't know it yet\\" theme permeates the entire novel, and by the time it reaches its (somewhat obvious) conclusion, you're left wondering how Plath didn't invest more of her time in churning out full fledged prose novels.Simply put, this novel chronicles the descent of a womans' mind, but its so much more than that. It speaks of mental disease with a frankness that the author probably didn't quite comprehend at the time. Maybe she did, but either way, I think what she was doing her was to capture the state of her own mind frame by frame until that fateful day in real life when she so notoriously took her own life. \\"The Bell Jar\\" has its moment of adolescent wandering and naivete, which I found quite endearing considering the age of the author when she wrote this. Perhaps she wasn't mature enough to deal with life as she grew older, or maybe she was too caught up in her own web of literary wonder to crawl out of it. I think all the great poets were afflicted to some degree with this disease, and Plath is no exception.If you're interested in a semi-autobiographical (though the blurb won't admit it!) book by a great poet, this is the book for you. Its never boring, and is quite an easy read as Sylvia trades in her famous double entendre poetic metaphors for more easily accessible and simply written language. Short crisp sentences. Clear dialogue. And yet, the sentences get shorter, and thoughts get more fragmented as we plummet with the author into the very depths of insanity. An unforgettable, and somewhat scary experience - but as a book lover, one you should definitely experience.Five Stars."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I wouldn't consider myself an expert in literature, although I am a bit of a writer myself, I find the bell jar to be an excellent and honest modern novel. An autobiography of sorts, the Bell Jar reports a particularly bad time of transition in Plath's life. For anyone else, being an honor student on scholarship and given the chance to be an intern at a fashion magazine in New York would be an amazing experience. But she is unimpressed and seems disenchanted by the whole thing. She has no idea what she should do with her life. She hates the thought of being tied down to one profession when there are so many to choose from. Things get worse when the internship is over and she moves back in with her mother. She cannot sleep and no longer desires food. Taken to a doctor for her insomnia, she is referred to a shady psychiatrist who subject her to crude shock treatments. Things only get worse and she becomes suicidal, always seeking out a new method of knocking herself off. She almost succeeds at one point and is taken to an asylum where she begins the process of rebuilding herself. This book remains a very honest look into the mind of troubled young girl. Interestingly, Plath never really gives a reason why she feels the way she does in the book, she just seems to be spiraling into madness with no more knowledge of the reason than the reader possesses."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar is a window into the psyche of a mentally unstable woman in the 1950s; it shows an interesting point of view of being in a mental institution. There are not many books that are about or have this perspective of a mentally unstable person losing their mind for the first time and going to a mental institution. There aren't many good books about that, at least. I found that this book was incredibly hard to put down, it keeps you on the edge of your seat a lot, I found myself reading for hours without even realizing it. It is written so well and seems like something a lot of people, myself included, can relate to on several different levels. The way she describes what is going on and what is happening to her it almost seems logical. We can see it from her point of view, the way she thinks and goes about doing everything. It is like a window into her brain, the reader can see what is going on inside her head and the logic behind things she does.One thing that really interested me was the constant referral to a bell jar, like the title, which symbolizes her madness. It is so intriguing the way she describes it as her being inside a bell jar that drops on her, distorting her perception on the world. And then towards the end when it is lifted off of her but still hovers, she knows she is not well but is getting better. It left me wondering what would happen to her next, when the bell jar will fall on her again and what will happen next time it does."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Identifiable darkness is what best describes the tone of The Bell Jar, by Sylvia Plath. Opening this book there is an expectation of simplicity but knowing Sylvia Plath's history one knows it can't only be that. The book follows a seemingly average girl through the twists and turns of her life through good and luck filled times and on to scary and dark times.As one delves into the story line expectations are quickly contradicted as the main character, Esther, begins to wallow in deep depression and her life begins to change dramatically once she visits a psychiatrist. Plath hooks the reader by making Esther so easy to identify with, almost making the reader feel as if there is something wrong with them like there is with Esther. Her thoughts are not abnormal, they are thoughts that everyone thinks about but the extent to which Esther dramatizes these thoughts sends her deeper and deeper into her own world of confusion and the unknown.Different characters enter and leave Esther's life throughout the novel and they each affect her in different ways but they all are instigators in her loss of touch with reality. Buddy Willard, a boy who Esther has dated and who likes her very much, seems to be a key player in her initial downfall. She had always looked up to him but her sudden thoughts of no longer being attracted to him confuse her and anger her and he eventually fades out of her life, as all the others have before him and will after him. There is not one character who stays constant in Esther's life, not even her mother and Plath uses this situational device to further exemplify Esther's aloneness in the world and her ongoing journey down the road of depression.Plath uses symbolism, and the power of narration by the main character to bring out the complexities going on in Esther's life and mind. An example of the symbolism is the fig tree that Esther talks about as representing her unknown future. \\"One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor,...and beyond these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out\\"(Plath 77). The symbolism amplifies Esther's fear of the unknown and her confusion in what path to take out of the endless possibilities that lay ahead of her. \\"I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose\\" (Plath 77). This shows Esther's fear of her future leading to her dark depression. The reader feels like they know Esther better than anyone else in the world because they are living through her, through her dark, cynical, tone and uneasy state. This quality makes the book more intriguing and much harder to put down. Though its not a suspense novel, one still wants to keep going from chapter to chapter to better understand what Esther is going through and in hopes of seeing her lifted up from the hole she has dug herself."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"It's a great book for sure, one of the best books I've read from this century. However, I've noticed that many say this book goes into a \\"dark scary place\\" or something similar. I did not see it that way at all. You follow the course of Esther Greenwood's thoughts, and though she does get depressed, I never found the book to be dark or in a morbid mood. It always seemed somehow cynical and lighthearted to me.maybe spoilers following..it even has a happy ending. Plath's life did not, though."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I expected this novel to be incredibly depressing and so had put off reading it, but I was pleasantly surprised to find how much humor it actually has. Futhermore, the writing style is crisp and concise, making it a very easy read. An interesting thing about this novel is it's incredible subtlety.While often being quite descriptive regarding events and people, the protagonist actually shares very little information about her personal thoughts and her rationalizations for her actions. Normally I would see that as a flaw but the events she narrates seem to actually speak for themselves so that we can almost guess how she must have been feeling or why she was so upset as a woman in a restrictive society who encountered several difficult relationships with men. We can see that these relationships upset her and that the social norms she imbibed growing up kept her from feeling free to express herself, leading to mental instability. This allows the reader to become more involved than is generally possible by encouraging them to fill in the blanks and analyze what is happening in order to draw conclusions about her feelings for themselves.While often interpreted as being feminist, anyone can read into the novel their own interpretations of her psychological demise based on their own experiences. For example, her type A personality and the pressure she puts on herself as an over achiever is another probable trigger for mental breakdown. Though slightly ambiguous as to the source of her depression, the symptoms of alienation and withdrawal are clearly mapped out. Even if you are unable to relate to what appears to be a self-centered, passive, depressive the symptoms are accurate and the the detached tone is an appropriate reflection of someone who is depressed since it makes sharing your feelings with the people around you so difficult. Even the choppy narration can be seen to reflect the mental instability.The lack of a fast paced plot or some kind of racy trigger for her depression highlights the fact thay anyone can become depressed seemingly without warning, and that the ordinary day to day trials of life can be just as wearing on the soul as an dramatic encounter. The overall feeling of the book is one of alienation and withdrawal from the world, yet with delightful touches of humor, written in a simple and straighforward, yet poetic manner."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"The Bell Jar is a mysterious yet a lumionous novel.

The creative writing syle that Plath uses is magnificent and unique. We have never come upon a novel so intriguing and extravegant.

She has a severe mental breakdown and, eventually, she takes sleeping pills to attempt suicide. The major cause for Esther's breakdown is the lack of a clear individualized femal role.

Granted, but the only reason we were given horizons in this life, was to push those babies out...that's right expand 'em every chance you get. The Bell Jar did expand mine to some degree.The writing would probably reach out to a young adult more so than someone in mid-life, but it is solid throughout and tells the story of Plath's largely autobiographical descent into mental illness. Plath comes up with an apt metaphor for her condition, calling upon the strength of language she was bestowed with as a talented poet. The Ball Jar descends around her cutting her off from the &quot;normal&quot; world...it sets her apart, cuts off the air. I think Plath must not have been able to escape the Bell Jar in the end as a tragic suicide ended her gifted art early in 1963.It gives us hope today, that we have found better ways to deal with mental illness since those times and individual's stricken with a condition are allowed options and get the chance to chose life. I guess reading &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; at this stage of life did expand some horizons, but would probably reach out to those coming of age and let them know problems are out there, and they can be dealt with. I wouldn't call it an essential read for me, but it might be to others.

Her slow descent into terrible crippling depression is boring but I think the point is, depression is painful but not exciting. Her mother wanted very much to help her troubled daughter but it was impossible to reach her. Esther/Sylvia was a brilliant girl with great intellect. That is also a point. Mental illness can affect the brightest people. Her reason for her crippling depression is unclear because no one knows that much about why some people fall into such hell with no reason to. Esther/Sylvia had great opportunities ahead of her. She had win literary prizes & also had VERY NICE BEAU WHO SINCERELY LOVED HER NONE OF THIS MATTERED.KNOWING WHAT EVENTUALLY BEFELL SYLVIA PLATH MAKES IT DOUBLY PAINFUL. I AM GLAD SHE DIDN'T DECIDE TO gas HER 2 sleeping CHILDREN with HER WHEN SHE STUCK HER HEAD IN the OVEN.A TRAGIC AFTERMATH IS THAT HER HUSBAND, TED HUGHES' SECOND WIFE, ALSO KILLED HERself plus their child! His third wife was a nurse (does that say something?). Hughes was the poet who was sort of the Queen Mother's poet laureate or I guess that means he wrote verse praising her.Because you know what eventually happens to Sylvia/Esther it makes the whole long tale more tragic. The story does become boring but the pain this poor girls suffered shouldn't be diminished because depression is boring.

The language is exquisite and the journey through the mind of Esther is completely engulfing. Sylvia Plath, in both her prose and poetry shows great insight into the human mind and demonstrates her true knowledge of the unstable person's mentality and recovery. The Bell Jar, like any great novel, questions and challenges the fabric of society and life itself.However, The Bell Jar can make even the most mentally stable person feel depressed and slightly suicidal. The entire novel deals with suicide: the road to Esther's breakdown, her week of attempting suicide and her years of recovery. When reading any work by Sylvia Plath, such as The Bell Jar or the poem Lady Lazarus, one must remember that Plath herself did end her life in suicide. For those with unstable tendencies or pessimistic views on life, The Bell Jar will only hinder growth and happiness.I will not be one to discourage people from reading the beautifully crafted novel that The Bell Jar is. My only recommendation is to choose a bright, happy day to undertake this novel as it will completely change your mentality, at least for the time in which you read it. Watch a happy movie, spend time with loved ones or read your favorite children's book (The Frog Princess) to restore your will to live after reading this novel.

But that's what I liked about it.It was kind of frustrating because you just wanted the main character to snap out of it. I know mental illness is serious and these people cannot help themselves from feeling the way they do, but it was really frustrating because I do not share her same opinions about life and I try really hard not to be so helpless and reliant on other people to fix problems in my life. Also she talks a lot about the burden of being a woman. I think just because women have the challenge of giving birth, it is really a gift of closeness to our mothers and ancestors that nobody can take away.Just like some people never find real love, I think Sylvia takes her emotions for granted. Like she's supposed to feel great all the time. Being a genius sometimes means being more sensitive and vulnerable to feelings of depression, but that doesn't mean she should give up. Because in the end everyone dies. We're supposed to share our sympathy for humanity, but Sylvia doesn't really care about anybody but herself because she's so alone and afraid to reach out.All in all, I don't think this book has a positive message.

However, it wasn't much of a descent. It was more like, she wasn't insane at the end of one chapter, and at the beginning of another chapter she was suddenly insane.Regardless, it was a pretty good book. Not spectacular, but interesting enough to hold my attention."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Too bad, I was excited to read this book after reading a biography of her by Alexander_______. However, the book left me dissappointed. I could not understand anything; while reading, my mind kept wandering. That is a clear sign to me that the book could not grab my attention and it would be a waste of time to try to read the whole book. I just could not follow the writing at all. There was no plot, no flow that lead me from one event to the other.I read some of the other reviews from readers who also did not like the book. Some people felt that the book was too depressing and too self indulgent. That is the whole point of depression. Depression leads the mind inside oneself and finds fault with the world around it or finds fault about him or herself. It makes sense that her book shows the main character as someone who was self-absorbed. That's part of what depression is."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Although this book had some clever imagery and imaginative descriptions, the plot was almost non-existent. There is not one actual event throughout the novel. I could not empathise with the main character, but it did give me some insight into the minds of depressed people, because her life seemed to be one long, torturous toil, even though she really seemed to have no obvious reason for complaint. Even though the focus of the novel never strays from the main character, by the end of the novel, I barely felt I knew her at all; her depression seemed to consume any other personal qualities she may originally have had. As a fanatical reader, I felt I had to read it because it is a classic, but after doing so, I think it would have been best avoided."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Not sure if I like it or not.

Now I see why it wasn't going to be published when she was alive. Because it is BORING!(The book was published 6 weeks after Sylvia Plath committed suicide. Things always sell better after they are dead.) The entire first half of the book is so monotoned I found myself putting the book down quite often. I kept thinking \\"when will she go insane and be interesting?\\" I have to say that her description of things was intelligently written it was just so BORING!Let me sum the book up for you and save you the money....girl gets job in NY, girl meets boy, girl dumps boy, girl goes slightly insane, girl goes into a rehab/asylum, girl is up for getting out of the asylum, book ends......just like that! The worst ending ever!I really am torn by giving authors a poor rating because I know how hard they work on their writing but this book was just arrrgghhh boring."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I read this book because I wanted to see what the big deal was. Apparently the author took her own life a month after the book first appeared in 1963 under her pseudonym \\"Victoria Lucas.\\" Critics say the character Esther Greenwood is an extension of the author. Perhaps it also refers to the book of Esther. I don't know. Nevetheless, it is a typical 1960's book. The protagonist is well compared with Holden Caulfield of \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" (another overrated book). Holden and Esther both are in New York City, the former in the 40's, the latter in the 50's. Like Holden, Esther gradually loses her marbles. In fact, the first part of the book differs radically from the second half of the book. The first part is the narrator during sanity, the latter part is the narrator during insanity, so to speak. Although Esther loses it more than Holden, Holden narrates his story from the nut house. She is the classic mixed up person of Hedda Gabler of Ibsen lore. Esther too, like Hedda Gabler, attempts suicide. What is tragic is not the descent into mental anarchy of Esther, but the fact her problems in the novel were essentially problems because she was too immature to deal with them. This is evident by Esther's inability to make choices. All choices have unforeseen consequences. No one is omnniscient. The solution to her problems was she needed to simply \\"grow up.\\" It's like falling into suicidal despair because your favorite soap opera was canceled. Some critics have suggested that Esther's problems have to do with repression. In part, I agree. But the definition of that repression has been skewed. The objectification of women is not liberation unless you bought into the twisted logic of the political left. Unless women are liberated to clean house, cook meals, send the kids off to school, clean laundry and go to the grocery store, this repression will only continue. Similarly, white men need to be liberated from the defamation perpetrated against them by the so-called House of David laying at the white man's feet the alleged repression of women and minorities. It is noteworthy that the number of suicides amongst women increased dramatically when women were shamed away from their natural vocation as wife and mother. Unless women are allowed to be women and not pinups for greedy men like Hugh Hefner, Al Goldstein and other members of the synagogue, to be objectified and marketed like slabs of meat, they will remain in bondage to unnatural repression."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I am almost sorry to say that my reading of Sylvia Plath's novel \\"The Bell Jar\\" was not nearly as moving or thought-provoking as it seems to be for so many. In my opinion, \\"The Bell Jar\\"'s Esther Greenwood is entirely unsympathetic, to the detriment of the novel. While I recognize the necessity of emphasizing her deterioration, I found her to be overly melodramatic and weak (while still recognizing her \\"condition\\"), and I loathed her from the start. While I will allow that Plath's prose is more eloquent than her poetry I failed to find evidence of the brilliance so often extolled."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"This poignant novel by Sylvia Plath about a young woman's nervous breakdown holds many life lessons.

However, that label is a huge insult to the Bell Jar and Sylvia Plath who has ten times the skill of salinger and her book is ten times more real and more intresting. Despite the differences, this book shares one fault with salingers in that both rely heavily on a main character, Holden and in Plath, Esther. So if you find your self hating Esther, than you probably won't like any of the book. That said, Plath makes Esther much more appealing and likeable than holden, most likely because the character is more genuine than Holden Caufield. The story itself gave me the chills at the end, which is ironic, though it was not intended to be so and that is what gets you while you read the book: The fact that she worked so hard battling depression only to fall back under the bell jar shortly after the book was published. However, as one reviewer earlier suggested, this book is more than a descent into madness, it also makes social commentary on the role of woman and the suburban life, i can't find that review now but it was really excellent you should look through and find it."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I read The Bell Jar for a research paper on Sylvia Plath. As I researched info on her life, I was amazed at the events that happened to her that ended up in the novel. The first part of the novel is very funny. The humor slows down at the climax, and stays there for a bit during the conclusion. However, by the end of the book, I felt that I had read everything that was happening before. It was a lot like Girl, Interrupted's hospital, and I realize that this book was the forerunner for these psychological memoirs."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"This is a very pointed look at a young woman's descent into psychosis. Plath is a blunt author and there are many questions as to if this book is an autobiography. The main character, Esther, uses many aliases (aliai?) and tells a story that lines up quite well with that of Mrs.Plath. This was a required reading book this year at school for me, but I will tell you this. I read it over the summer and liked it-but I enjoyed it more this time around. This is a powerful book and is written with a lot of well thought out imagery and symbolism. If you have seen the movie Girl, Interupted or read One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest you will find this book of interest. But if you have a light stomach beware in the last three or so chapters.

I find myself feeling the same way &quot;esther&quot; did in the book seeing that I am also a 19 year old college student who writes poetry and stories trying to find ways to show the world my work. It shows the darkness behind the sugar coating that society has painted for youth today. We are told that we have it easy and that we should be more thankful and in The Bell Jar it shows that life isn't as easy for youth as we are told it is. It shows that success is not always a great thing to have. It can bring you down faster than it brought you up. This is a great book and I recommend it to anyone. It's partially autobiographical and I recommend also reading &quot;Letters Home&quot; by Plath's mother. It has letters that Sylvia wrote to her mother throughout her life and it gives much more depth to The Bell Jar."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I picked up this book on a lark and could not put it down.

Ester forced her readers to look inside themselves and made it clear that you are not to be afriad or look down on the characters in this book. Everyone of them had a reason and a purpose to complete and I would defnitly recoment that if you are looking for a good pice to read that Slyvia Platt is the way to go."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"This is a novel that chronicles a young woman's downward spiral into depression and an eventual suicide attempt. It is a thin veiling of Sylvia Plath's own history. Sadly later on she succeeded.With this in mind from the first chapter it is easy to see that the author felt separate from her \\"healthy\\" counterparts. I think most of us feel that at some time, however her disassociation became more complete. I was wishing, I had had a sense of what she was like before this began. Was this an extreme change or did she often feel set apart, when she was technically healthy.What is frightening about this book is that while you are in her head with the writing, none of her thoughts or feelings seem so outrageous. In the afterward it indicated she pondered rewriting the whole story from the outside perspective, from her mother and associate's point of view. There were some references that were startling, as the not changing clothes and bathing that were not apparent to the reader that she adds in occasionally. This gives you a sense of a disconnect between the inside and the outside that she was feeling. This outside perspective would have added much to understanding the why for her mother's first suggestion to seeing a doctor, as from \\"Esther's\\" view this seemed unnecessary. Ironically, the character never really questioned the need for either the doctor's visit or the electroshock therapy. This shows the character's ability to comply, regardless of how she felt. Authority and other's measurements of her, as most good student's played a very strong part in her personality.Later on, when she is recovering in the asylum, her relations with other people improve, however, she does not appear to the reader to be so different in thought. It appears that the measurement of success is entirely based on the patient's relation to the outside world. As there were no more references to poor hygiene or suicidal thought, this apparently was the mark of wellness. From the reader's perspective this does not necessarily make the transition from a lack of mental health to one that is acceptable, so obvious. It also apparently does not give the patient a framework to work with. This is evident by the fact that she did go on to successfully commit suicide years later.This is a coming of age story that many people have faced in one sense, though not to that extreme, when they get to an age of moving from the teenage world to that of an adult. Often this is triggered by moving from the academic setting to that of the working world. There a disconnect that happens there. The high achieving student that Sylvia Plath was, was apparently unprepared for the shift in priorities that happens during this shift. She lost her footing and until her behavior became extreme, no one noticed..As this is the second time I read this book, it is evident, I hold it in high regard. It is easy to empathize with the character of Esther and her dilemma's. In some ways too easy. I think most of us when we are troubled disassociate ourselves with the world around us and become very egocentric. This book may serve as blue print for testing yourself to see how well you are doing. I also think this is a good book for young people at this stage to read. It will give them some sense that someone has been there and done that and maybe it can get them to ask for help before they get to the point she did."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"this is a wonderful novel. the language is beautiful and poetic which is one of the ways that it is a different story than catcher in the rye. esther greenwood typifies a lot of 19-20 year olds in the fact that at times we all feel alone and trapped in a world that we look at through a &quot;bell jar&quot;. even if this wasn't based on plath's life, it is not a far fetched story and the descriptive and poetic elements really bring this novel to life."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"In the novel \\"The bell Jar,\\" by Sylvia Plath, we have the wonderful lifestyle of the character Esther Greenwood, torn apart. This compelling novel by Sylvia Plath does not only express early sparks of feminist vibes, but also leads the reader to a thorough understanding of depression and suicide.Throughout the book there are constant references to men and their importance in society. The setting is in the 1950's, but the female reader most likely knows enough about life in the 50's to relate to the setting. Many things in this book are based on gender. At about the middle of the novel, we have a prime example of this. Esther is at a maternity ward, with a \\"boyfriend\\" no less, and is told that she should not watch a birth that is going on in the room. As a female, I must say that this scene did indeed make me cringe; but why should it be made a general assumption that all women would? Also during this scene, Esther is shown the dead fetuses that have been kept for observation. This is yet again- not something that she is asked to see, yet also not something that bothers her. As said throughout the novel- Esther herself would not be happy as a wife, let alone a mother. I was given the impression that she looked at being a mother and a wife as being a slave. \\"This seemed dreary and wasted life for a girl for a girl with fifteen years of straight A's, but I knew that's what marriage was like, because cook and clean and wash was just what Buddy Willard's mother did from morning till night, and she was the wife of a university professor and had been a private school teacher herself.\\" Esther was trapped under the bell jar- locked away from all else in the world...why would she want to increase this distant feeling?There is a portion of this book that I felt to be very symbolic that no other reviews have seemed to touch upon- that being the metaphor about the fig tree. Sylvia stated that \\"From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and wrinkled.\\" All of these figs were different routes in her life that she could take- a plethora of opportunities before her that began to tear her apart. Yet again- there is references to the trapping of her soul inside of her own brain and thoughts. Inside the bell jar. As the denouement approaches, Sylvia's character of Esther is sent to an asylum for a depressive mental breakdown that has been foreshadowed to the reader through out the book. Here she remains in a world that is new to her- a world of electroshock therapy, various asylums, and an increased state of self-dissatisfaction. This book took the reader on a real life journey through the life of novelist/poet Sylvia Plath- from her odd obsession with the Rosenbergs, to the last lines of her 'note on the book' \\"to the person in the Bell Jar, blank and stopped as a dead baby, the world it self is a bad dream.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Wheh..this was very good. It was so interesting watching Esther slowly spiral into a place she couldn't escape. I can see why this novel caused such a stir, back in the day. I can imagine that there are still some pretty oppressive schools that would FREAK if a teacher were to assign this novel...although I think it would make great high school reading. Some of Esther's stifling obstacles are not quite as true in today's world, but most are and/or have been replaced by others."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Finishing this book was the worst thing that's ever happened to me. The writing style was so clear and, for me, easy to relate to. When the story ended I grieved simply because I could not even imagine moving on to another author; but the sad truth remains, Sylvia Plath left us no other novels to cherish.To put it simply: THE BOOK IS AMAZING in that the theme is clear and sucks you into Esther's (the main character) skin. While she goes insane it almost seems as if you are going insane with her. You never hear a diagnosis or the symptoms, and her sickness is real and natural and it becomes a part of you. The things she does are never explained but all fit together into a beautiful story that could never be mimicked.Please, read this book."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"This is a great book written by a powerful talented young woman that tragically committed suicide at the prime of her life. Perhaps because she was born in the wrong century, or she could not deal with society's pressures during the 1950's, and that drove her mad. Esther is concerned about being accepted in social circles, what types of behavior are proper and preoccupied with being a virgin. We can only speculate.No one torments himself or herself purposely for any apparent reason, nor do they choose to feel suicidal at times. No one really knows why, not even modern day psychiatrists. It is disturbing to call this book a \\"classic\\" (although it is) or compare it to Salinger's Holden Caufield (Catcher In The Rye is a great book too), when the Bell Jar is about a person's real pain and troubles. As a matter of fact, the not so great reviews The Bell Jar received after being published made her uneasier and more depressed, since it was compared to Salinger's work.Esther feels asphyxiated in her own world, (The Bell Jar is a metaphor for feeling emotionally stifled and trapped) and her anxiety and depression too much to handle so she attempts suicide and ends up in a mental asylum. There she receives ECT therapy (there wasn't Prozac then not that it would have been any better), which probably did not help much (just like Hemingway).The Bell Jar is of a haunting theme, and not for everyone, it is about the dark and desperate nature of a descending spiral of perplexity, ambivalence, melancholy, and ultimately death. I disagree that this piece of work is about selfishness, I love this book, and its one of my favorites."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"This is an incredible book which I read during the summer, the book is about Esther, although much of it was based on the author's life. The book is set in the 1950's, when Esther was nineteen. During that time she had a metal breakdown and ended up in a mental institution. Don't let that scare you, the book is very deep and will make you feel like you're actually living everything that is going on. Sylvia Plath was a very good author, she had the gift of only writing a few words that could tell an entire story, I was able to finish it in two nights. The only ironic thing about the book was that six months after it was published, Sylvia was \\"sucked back into the Bell Jar\\" and commited suicide. This is a book like no other that will leave you thinking for a very long time."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"The Bell Jar is definitely a book that I could read more than once. It's an intriguing tale of a young college-aged woman dealing with suicidal insanity and attempting to cope with society. The way Sylvia Plath tells the forlorn story of Esther Greenwood in the first person makes you enter the psychotic world of the book and makes you feel as if its your story that you're reading. She places you inside Esther's mind and you feel like you are actually there experiencing all of her incidents with Buddy Willard (her should-be lover), all of her blind dates, and all of her unbelievable loneliness that leads her to be suicidal. This book is said to be based on Sylvia Plath's own life just before she committed suicide, so that could explain the incredible vividness of depression and desolation throughout the book.The story begins with Esther in New York City working for a magazine as a summer job. She gets to know a few of her female co-workers but never truly fits in with them. She attends many banquets and parties for the magazine and has a few adventures of her own, but all this time, she refuses to let herself give in to the artificial feminine stereotype that all of the women around her fulfill. Esther begins to take notice of all of her faults and the faults of the people surrounding her. As the novel progresses, Esther's mind seems to grow more and more incoherent and she seems to be disconnected from the world.Once her summer job is over, she moves in with her mother in a suburban Boston town. For the first few days, she relaxes and observes the neighborhood from a house window while pondering about what she will do with the rest of her summer. She quickly gets bored with that and attempts to write a book but her mind just keeps getting more and more fragmented to the point where she cant sleep, read, write, or eat. This goes on for a whole week before her mother realizes what is happening to her daughter and forces her to see a psychologist. This leads Esther into intensive shock therapy and more thoughts of suicide. It is then that she realizes that she's been viewing life from a different perspective, as if surrounded by an opaque encasement... like a bell jar surrounding her.I could without a doubt relate to this book in so many ways. I shared an abundant amount of the same opinions about society as Esther did and could relate to some of the incidents. I'm pretty sure that everyone could relate to what Esther is feeling at some point in their lives.From her excursions in New York City to her terrifying shock therapy, Sylvia Plath will most definitely keep you interested in Esther's life until the very end and will leave you craving more. I recommend this book for everyone who enjoys reading about the twists and turns of the human mind."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"\\"The Bell Jar\\" introduces us to a college-aged woman who spends a month of her summer vacation in New York City, all the while working at a magazine and attending events with a group of other girls from this summer program. She is somewhat of an outsider, perpetually waiting for something more. In the novel she describes waiting for the mystery of New York City to rub off on her, but she can never seem to find it. We learn of her continual disenchantment with relationships and the potential for relationships. There is a continual feeling that she's slightly off-axis from everyone and everything else -- not in terms of any mental instability, but more that she cannot resign herself to be like the average girl her age or find herself fulfilled by anything superficial. As the novel progresses she becomes even more disconnected, as an effect of her mental degradation.It's a wonderfully well-written book, and it definitely held my interest. One of the difficult things about this novel is that it tends to over-saturate in certain age groups. And this caused me to have a somewhat distorted presumption about it prior to reading it. I enjoyed it, but it wasn't quite the \\"descent into madness\\" I was expecting. Though I've found this the case with other novels I have read as well, such as \\"Girl, Interrupted\\". The insanity doesn't quite seem so abnormal. Though that is definitely subjective. I did, however, appreciate how honest and realistic the novel is. (Granted, the protagonist obviously isn't far from the author's reach.) So while it may not have been as intense as I had hoped, it was certainly satisfying. In fact, the more I think about it after having finished it, the more satified I become with it; the way Plath crafted this book really leaves a lasting impression on you.Overall, I would certainly recommend this book. Plath has an excellent style of writing that can be very sutble, yet quickly draws you in. While I haven't read many novels dealing with this subject, I would recommend \\"The Bell Jar\\" over \\"Girl, Interrupted\\" in terms of the former's ability to really bring the reader into the mind of the \\"insane\\"."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar is one of the most moving and enlightening novels I have ever had the pleasure to read.

Few authors have been successful at capturing this horrifying illness so poignantly, yet realistically. The reader is invited to experience the throngs of depression as it takes hold and tortures the individual so intensely, that for many the only way to end the emotional pain is self-destruction. Although suicide is not the answer, it exists as the one sure way to end the misery of everday existence.'How tragic that Esther is freed from her demons and Sylvia, herself, was not. This work is a masterful at exposing depression as an ugly and debilitating illness."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Lorna Lindquistbamalorna@hotmail.comLooking at what's under the glassA review of Sylvia Plath's The Bell JarWhile reading Plath can be muddied by all the \\"Plath baggage\\" that history has shown us, I think that coming to and away from this book with an open mind will help the reader enjoy it as much as I did. Plath's untimely end is not a mystery to the current reader, but to expect this book to be depressing insults the message that Plath tries to convey.The main character, Esther Greenwood, obviously suffers from a chronic depressive disorder. She constantly thinks to herself that she should be happy. She looks objectively at her sadness and explores it as though it is simply a bad habit. Greenwood comments again and again that she knows she should be excited about her fortunes in life.These fortunes mimic the fortunes that Plath herself enjoyed as a young writer. She was published early and had early success, but still her life felt blank enough for her to stick her head in the oven before she turned 30. I think that in this way, The Bell Jar is a thinly veiled autobiography. I also think that she wrote this in third person not so that her personal life could be kept hidden, but so that the examinations of depression could gain a sort of validity by being removed from the author and her stigma.One farce of depression that Plath destroys in Greenwood is the clich&eacute; that all depressed people simply lay around feeling sorry for themselves all day. In fact, Plath suggests that people who are depressed know that there is a problem with themselves, but lack the ambition to root it and solve it because even life as a whole has lost its luster.As a work, message removed, Plath's talent as a poet comes shining through. She uses phrases that so accurately describe Greenwood's situation that you feel like you can see her thoughts. She uses childish language that indicates the childish tone Plath thinks that life has to offer. She constantly says that things are \\"stupid\\" she is \\"stupid\\" others are \\"stupid.\\"Overall I think that The Bell Jar offers more to the reader than a simple story to read about what appears to be a \\"crazy girl,\\" it offers instead excellent insight made by a talented writer."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I am a 10th and 11th grade English Language Arts teacher in an urban high school setting. I purchased a class set of this book for my 11th grade classes and I was surprised by their response to it.I initially read the book in college and I was saddened by the fact that Sylvia Plath did, in fact, commit suicide. I was informed that the book, although published as fiction, is basicly a transparent account of her own breakdown during her college years. Having been made aware that Esther, the main character, is actually a flimsy representation of the author, I found the book to be captivating. I found myself examining the text closely to learn why she never \\"made it\\" after all.My students were similarly motivated. Sylvia spent some time in Winthrop, a small town neighboring East Boston, so many of the landmarks were familiar to our class. This added to the sense of \\"memoir\\" that we felt from the text.Student responses were divided. Some students related to some of Esther's problems or to Esther herself. Others found her to be a relentless whiner and high practitioner of melodrama. Everyone was shocked by the differences found in the pressures of a coming of age story set during the 50's vs the values and pressures placed on students today.At the conclusion of the book I had a guest speaker discuss suicide and depression with my students. For some of my class the book brought up issues and questions. I wanted to be sure that my kids saw a more optimistic solution to Esther's problems than Sylvia in fact did.Overall, I was given a thumbs up by my 11th grade... Although many students started to wonder \\"if she is ever going to kill herself... or what?\\" others felt decidedly anxious as the plot progressed. Many of my students liked Esther a lot and felt saddened by the obstacles that she faced during the course of The Bell Jar. Student opinion was not necessarily divided by gender.Many students confessed to me that they read ahead and enjoyed it more than \\"regular school books.\\" I intend to teach it again next year."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I personally find Sylvia Plath's journals her most interesting work, but this comes in at a close second. This book will challenge just about anyone who reads it, whether you're depressed or not. If you've never been depressed in the way Esther is, you're going to ask yourself why she torments herself for no reason and perhaps feel that the storyline is implausible. the deeper you go into the book, the less sympathy you'll feel for her. If you HAVE been as depressed as Esther gets, you'll feel challenged for another reason: the book will reach TOO far into your mind and make TOO deep a connection with you because, well, Sylvia Plath describes depression very well. Her writing tends to make you feel like you and no one else are experiencing what she's going through with her, and it's pretty disturbing. However, it's also a quite rewarding experience. A &quot;bell jar&quot; is just a very apt term for a distorted view of the world that presents everything as seemingly inherently bad. Esther lives under one all the time, and she's not truly aware of it. Eventually her life is turned into a constant waking nightmare because she can't even say what's wrong with her. It's painful to read but it makes for some damn good reading. Reading this book will give you a very graphic idea of what it's like to live under a bell jar and what happens to people who live in permanent ones. You probably won't be the same after you read it."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I read this book immediately following &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot; by Susanna Kaysen. This was an interesting coincidence because both these novels are (nearly) autobiolgraphical accounts of mental traumas these women suffered in their early 20's. In fact, both women had resided in the same mental hospital during their recuperation. I finished &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot; a bit confused on how I had ever rationalized spending my time reading such a book in the first place. The author's over-personification of the trite theme of &quot;crazy may be sane&quot; wasn't even accompanied by a plot. Sadly enough, the most interesting part of the novel was the excerpt taken from a psychology textbook describing Kaysen's diagnosis. Then, I picked up &quot;The Bell Jar,&quot; not knowing what it was about, and read it. It was everything &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot; had tried to be and wasn't. The main character's experiences were real and meaningful, and the book itself tried less to shock its readers by trying to include monumental meaning, but instead, simply told its tale in a beautiful and harrowing way that perfectly reverberated the all-too-familiar struggles of a young woman emerging into an unfamiliar world that in its simpleness, conveyed more than even Kaysen could ever fathom being bestowed upon a reader."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I've been trying to broaden my reading range by throwing in a few classics here and there. One I had been interested in for quite some time is The Bell Jar. And with the Sylvia Plath movie coming out soon, I thought reading this book might be a nice complement to that. And what a real pleasure it turned out to be!The Bell Jar does not read like a classic - \\"classic\\" being the term of very old books with very old language - the description I've always had for the classic genre. This book has a very contemporary writing style, and despite it being written in the 1960s, The Bell Jar's topic of mental illness certainly transcends the generations and can be related by many people no matter when they read the book. I absolutely loved it!The Bell Jar tells the story of a young Esther Greenwood at the beginning of her mental decline. She first recognizes its oncoming during a summer of interning at a magazine company in New York City. Trying to fit in with the other interns, as well as dealing with boys and co-workers prove to be a struggle at times for Esther. And later, when the real depression and suicidal thoughts set in, readers are invited into a dark and scary world, one created realistically and with honesty by Ms. Plath.This book ranks high on my list of all-time favorites. I'm so glad I read it. From now on, if people want to read a classic (or a darn good book for that matter), I won't hesitate to suggest The Bell Jar. It's fantastic!"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Many readers seem to reject this novel because it offers no clear explanation for the psychololgical collapse it narrates. But nor, from the perspective of the afflicted, is there often any such explanation in real life. I find the way Plath unexpectedly cuts from the hilarious antics of Esther's month in New York City - told in a voice as endearing as Holden Caulfield's - into her sudden depression to be a very effective literary device. Plath doesn't explain what happens so much as she shows us what it feels like. Compare the tone of the first fifty pages to the last and you'll see this is a narrative which gradually unhinges, disintegrates, becomes less and less reliable. This is precisely what you'd expect in a first-person account of a depressive episode. Yes, it can get \\"boring and repetitive\\" as many reviewers have noted - and that's an apt representation of the lugubriousness of depression and the traditional treatments for it. There is no simple answer, no easy happy ending for Esther. She is a young person confronting the meaninglessness of life, too intelligent to fall into the easy distractions of marriage and work, but not sufficiently self-knowing to forge her own path without them. That such a path is unclear is part of the point. Hatred for this book seems to come out of a view of life (and literature) as something certain, meaningful, entertaining and closed - precisely the view which Esther, and most depressed people, cannot take. That Plath can put us in her position for a few hundred pages, and show us how puzzling and frightening it can be, is a testament to the strength of her talent."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Frequently, when I read about The Bell Jar, reviewers caomment on the parallels between Esther, and the author. Then they proceed to describe the book's harrowing descent into madness.I almost hate to burst the bubble, but after reading the book, I find it to be widely misinterpreted. The book is not about Esther's problems, but the problems of the world about her.When Plath wrote the book, she did so under a pseudonym. Not only, (as many suggest,) to avoid the ire of her friends, whose loosely drawn chariactures pepper this book, but also because of it's biting censure of her male oriented society. I have NO DOUBT in my mind that when Plath wrote the Bell Jar, she had no intentions of killing herself. I think the work should be viewed in that light, and when one does, it takes on a different, and far more profound meaning. Plath still needed to work in her time, so (In my opinion,) she wrote the Bell Jar to attack the restricted role of a woman in society, and she conveniently provided an out for any harsh critic, namely, that the main character is insane. To read it now, and interpret the main character as an insane, or unreliable narrator does a great disservice to what Plath intended for this work.Plath, like Esther, was perhaps the smartest woman in America during her time. She won countless scholarships, and like Esther, a guest editing slot at Mademoiselle. Now a woman of her talents would be at Harvard on a full ride, but during her day, Esther, and Plath could only hope to someday become the editor of a glamor mag, forever telling women how to tell if their lover is cheating. Not much of an existance for a bright young woman.Plath vents this frustration in the Bell Jar. Esther sees men all about her that will always be accepted, that will not be held back if they desire to become something irrational, or take on large career goals.I'm thinking specifically of the birth sequence in the middle, when Buddy and Esther watch Mrs Tomolino give birth to her child. A fat intern says that women shouldn't be allowed to watch a birth, otherwise there'd never be any children. (I am paraphrasing.) Implying their unfitness to be a doctor, (while his own obvious physical limitations are of course, ignored.) What a ridiculous notion. The men assume that Esther will not be able to stand watching the birth but she does well, noting the use of the drug. When she is told that it doesn't kill the pain, but only makes the woman forget it, Esther thinks that this is a perfect example of a man's drug. One that allows the pain to exist, but shuts it away in a dark tunnel, where someday it will rise to swallow the woman. (Again with the paraphrasing.)Other signs of this exist throughout the work. In fact, one can go as far as to say that every time her life is on track, or Esther is suceeding, the event is derailed in actuality, or symbolically, by man. (I've checked, and it is so.) The image of a bottled baby arises again and again, and Esther later states that she hates the role of mother, because of the restrictions it implies. To give in to the maternal impulse is to chain yourself to a child, to trap yourself, to become the bottled baby. Esther remarks that it is almost as if nature knew about the restrictive world of men, and it agreed, conspiring against her biologically as well.I think that perhaps the single most telling line in the book is delivered by Buddy, whom I saw as a representative of men in Esther's life. When Esther, and Buddy's earlier girlfriend both end up committed, Buddy asks if there is something about him that \\"drives women crazy. \\"If you read carefully, you'll note that Esther's doctor refutes the question, and dismisses it as a sort of casual \\"Of course not.\\" Esther simply pushes some foam from the edge of her cup back into the coffee, and says nothing. Not because she agrees with the doctor... Else she would add her comments, but because he speaks the truth, and she knows affirming this will keep her in the asylum.There is much much more that the enlightened reader may discover on his or her own, and I recommend that everyone who has read this book in their adolescent fits of suicidal fantasy, should return to the work with an eye towards its social commentary. I think you'll find the work to be stimulating, and still (sadly) relevant today. I only wish that Plath had found the strength to live though her troubles. We would still be reading her book, and revering it as a classic, but uncolored by her own experiences, the book could be freed of our society's focus on Esther's suicide attempt, and more on the conditions that created it, which definitely were NOT in her head."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Like millions of other young women, I'm sure, I came across \\"The Bell Jar\\" in college, and I felt an immediate attachment to the book: it uplifted me, angered me, scared me, and made me feel deeply protective, all at the same time.\\"The Bell Jar\\" tells the story of Esther Greenwood, an intelligent college student, as she slowly feels the \\"bell jar\\" of detachment and madness overtake her. As Esther goes from a prestigious internship in New York City to a summer at home with her mother in the Boston suburbs, her attachment to reality becomes more and more tenuous, until thoughts of suicide overtake her.It is no secret that the story has at least a partial basis in reality, and that Sylvia Plath is writing from her own experience is perhaps what makes Esther so deeply real. I recently wrote a review of \\"Bridget Jones' Diary,\\" and although \\"The Bell Jar\\" is undoubtedly a better book, there is a certain similarity between the protagonists: like Bridget, Esther is a character who is almost universally relatable. It does not matter if the reader is psychologically healthy or not: Esther awakens what she is feeling in all of us. My emotional response to \\"The Bell Jar\\" was on par with my emotional response to certain real-life events. I was uplifted to find a shared experience; angered at Esther's responses--and at the fact that they seemed reasonable to me; scared at the uncertainty I felt about myself and my own psychological state by the end of the book; and deeply protective--of Esther, of Sylvia Plath, and of every other reader who shared my experience.I recognize that specifically speaking of the female experience when reading \\"The Bell Jar\\" could be considered rather narrow-minded of me. I certainly believe that this book can resonate with men as well, just as \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" can resonate with women. There is something deeply female in Esther's experience, however, and I cannot put into words the extent of my appreciation that Plath was able to give a true voice to this femaleness, without getting defensive and without getting melodramatic."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Removed, unemotional, disturbing. That's Sylvia Plath's excellent book. Starting with her successes as a young adult, The Bell Jar is a fictionalized autobiography, in which she gives herself a different name. It chronicles her life through her mental breakdown, including electroshock therapy, and her fellow patients. Accuratly discribing the stresses of a girl in the 1950's, including whether to be a good little housewife or to follow her dreams. What should she choose?The book is easy to read and quick.This book, written a few years before Plath's suicide, makes subsequent accounts of insane asylums seem inconsequential, dull, and whiney.You'll never look at mental institution fiction the same again."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"The fact that I have read this book at least 50 times probably makes me the most unobjective reviewer possible. Still, having read many other reviews of The Bell Jar, I am struck by the fact that most readers respond mainly to the harrowing portrayal of Esther's descent into madness rather than the wry, biting humor with which Plath describes it. Certainly, as a 19 year old college student myself, reading the novel as an easy way out of an assignment to get to know a modern American poet, I was most taken in by Plath's cynicism. Still, although cynical and satirical, this book approaches greatness because it hacks through the false outer shell of the world and divulges the ugly truth that everything means nothing...or nothing means anything, which is a great tragedy for a young, brilliant woman like Esther who has so much to look forward to. Unfortunately, she discovers that all of her hard work and success aren't going to pay off in any meaningful way. She may walk out of her psychiatrist's office in full control (at the end of the book) but one senses that the lesson she's learned, that something's wrong with everyone, will die hard. The ability to do all this with a sense of humor is amazing, not to mention that her use of simile is, perhaps, the best ever."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"As a psychologist, I believe that Sylvia Plath's novel accurately portrays the confusion and disorientation that accompany mental illness. Unfortunately, while the main character, a young college student named Ester Greenwood, rings true, the book itself is as confusing and disorienting as Ester's life. Plath's literary style seems to be to wander from scene-to-scene and present-to-past with little or no transition. The book was so disjointed that at times I looked to see if there were pages missing; how Ester goes from point A to point B is often unclear. Despite this, Ester is a real person undergoing a real struggle with a real disorder. Her thoughts of suicide are described in a simple, matter of fact manner that is extremely honest, and both the positive and negative aspects of her treatment are exposed. The book's ending, while optimistic, is overshadowed by Plath's own eventual suicide; it is the author's own experience and tragedy which makes this largely autobiographical novel a classic."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I heard about The Bell Jar from amazon.com and all the reviews seemed to be fairly well so I went out and bought it. From the very beginning I loved Esther. If you're openminded, you can connect with her on this strange level. Sometimes you want to reach out to her and tell her it will be alright. A woman with everything she has has no reason to be depressed. But that's one of my favorite things about the book. Unlike others she doesn't become depressed over a man or a lost loved one, it's just something that happens to her, and even she can't figure it out.At the beginning Esther is a brilliant young college student with great determination. However something, and there seems to be no explination for it, causes her to become depressed. Over and over she talks about &quot;being her old self again.&quot; She goes through many institutions and a few shock treatments after attempted suicide before the &quot;bell jar&quot; is lifted from her head.I love the way she describes her thoughts. I love the way she reacts to Buddy Willard and the way she stands up for herself to men unlike alot of women. I love everything about Esther, and I think you will too.Words cannot describe this book as mine seem far from it.

Plath as the proto-feminist... Plath as the tortured artist... Plath as the avatar of mental illness... Mostly, though, Plath as the emotive symbol for the unbearable pressure of potential.I can't believe I went so long avoiding this book. Maybe so many of us get turned off to her work by all the Sylvias we go to school with and come across at poetry readings through the years. I was wrong to ignore the work this long or judge it by her fans.I haven't been as excited about words in a very long time. I don't think she is much of a storyteller or novelist, in the sense that I use those words usually, but I think her language might rival Marquez or Fitzgerald at their best.I do not often read such clear and perfect descriptive passages and she seems an inexhaustible well of them and avoids falling into the faults of Faulkner in the rush to be \\"literary\\".While the theme of this book and its obvious and melancholy parallel to her own demise is hard to bear at times, she is such a masterful writer, it is, in the end, impossible to put down."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Read a library copy of Bell Jar and had to have it.

In the end, as she recovers, the things she thinks about, they become real as she's reconnected with her old self, her healthy self.

Plath, writing form her own experiences with breakdowns and hospitalization, creates a fully developed and complex, even at times humorous character to whom I could relate. The story moves along well, doesn't sag, and the ending, though ambiguous, makes the story all the more realistic--there is no definitive end to depression, and the story mirrors that well.As always, I appreciated the fact that it was not a feel-good book; Plath is not one given to sappy interludes and touchy-feely sessions between the characters.

That's my humble opinion.Plath's character Esther is the focal point of the story. It is told by her point of view. The book details her descent from a editorial prize from a famous magazine to her fall to a mental institution.The book works on many level. Any girl, in fact, anyone can relate to Esther's fall to depression because everyone has, once in their life, had a moment of depression or loneliness or isolation, etc.In fact, I'm sure, many of you know that this book semi-autobiographical of Plath's own life.And I'm sure many of you know the comparison to Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye to this book. But it is different, though I give both of them 4 stars. It's different while Holden deals with his contempt for human behavior, this is more of a detail description of a person's fall to depression.The fact is Esther could be anyone. This book is a quick read and worth the effort. If you have time, it won't take you more than two days.The reason I gave this book four stars is because I, myself, could not relate to the main character. Throughout the novel, I felt myself pitting her. It's not the book, it really is me. That's the main weakness of the story. While most people are use to the main character triumphing at the end, there is none of this. Depression isn't an easy battle to win and the book leaves us kind of empty.

If anything, Ms. Plath takes pains to ensure that readers understand the depth of her psychological pain in a prose that can be vivid, even stunning. My one problem is that her own self-loathing overwhelms all else; by the novel's end, her biting sarcasm and stubborn bitterness had begun to grate. Still, there is no doubt that she demonstrates in this book the mastery of her craft, a mastery even more apparent in her poetry.

Esther goes through mental breakdowns and Sylvia Plath makes sure you know every detail. She bases this book on her rel life experiences and everything she goes through. This is an emotional story that will pull you in and make you not want to put your book down.Author Bio: Sylvia Plath was born in Boston on October 27th, 1932. She attended Smith College on a scholarship, and in 1952 won a Mademoiselle short story contest, which allowed her to work as a guest editor in New York. When she came back she tried committing suicide and ending up in an institution for a while. After she got out of the institution, she went to finish college at Smith and then went to Cambridge after that. She ended up meeting a poet named Ted Hughes. They ended up moving to the United States. She wrote her first book of poetry called The Colossus and Other Poems in 1960. Shortly after in 1963 she published The Bell Jar and a month later committed suicide.Evaluation: This book is a very good book and I would recommend it to any young teen and older. Sylvia Plath had made this story relating to real life experiences and to be able to read about it is very interesting.

Esther's struggle with issues and people around her gave me an inkling into what was I facing with people around me. It's not more of madness than being sane that made me love this book and what it stands for - probably suffocation, probably the need to get away so many times when we are unable to do so. The probability of meeting someone nice and sensitive which never really works that way.Grappling with oneself and situations can be quite a thing to undertake. Most of the times, many of us choose to push things under the rug without paying attention to our thoughts and problems.

It is a known fact that the best 'stories' come from personal experience, and the 'Bell Jar' is a top-notch example of that!"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"This book was really astounding. It had sort of a simple story going to it, but there were so many deeper meanings thrown into the novel. This book was so amazingly deep, but so easy to read. I finished reading it in two days. I would definately recommend this book to everyone. I personally didn't care for Plath's poetry when we studied it in class, but I really enjoyed her book. So, whether you like Plath's poetry or not if you like a book that is deep, yet a fast read, I would definately read this book."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"&quot;The Bell Jar&quot; is a dramatic and touching book following the life of the young woman named Esther Greenwood. I personally enjoyed this book to a high degree. Sylvia Plath takes the reader on a trek, where we view the downfall and destruction of the book's heroin, Esther. Esther starts her post college year as an aspiring writer doing what people that age do. She attends parties and bars, leading the life of a normal 23 old woman. However, Esther enters a downward spiral into a world of entrapping depression. I like this book for the complicated and well structured plot system which Plath provides for the reader. I especially enjoyed how the book so well introduces us and acquaints us with Esther. Around the first few pages, Esther speaks of her constant desire to eat. This kind of common thought dialogue so easily acquaints us with Esther, therefore understanding and liking her. Thus by witnessing her thoughts, we feel overbearing sympathy for Esther as she slowly but surely enters a dark and gray realm of anger and depression. Plath does well at structuring Esther's downfall. Not just one event makes her break down to her knees, but the sum of small futile events. All of Esther's colleagues around her prosper with significant others and job lives, as she is blatantly turned down by an eccentric man and as she loses a chance to write a powerful article which she very much wanted. There Esther sits, in a bell jar as an observer. She observes everyone around move forward on the road of life, as she sits back watching everyone disappear in the far distance. Certain points of the book seem to drag on, losing some feel to Plath's writing. For a clump of pages, Esther continuously speaks of her ex-boyfriend, Buddy Willard, which gets old really quickly. Truthfully, I do not have much negative to say about Sylvia Plath's only novel. It is a very moving book with dazzling imagery as well as many poetic gestures. I wouldrecommend this book to anyone with an open mind. If you read this book and say &quot;What a crazy lady,&quot; then this book was NOT for you. If you have an open mind to these types of situations, then this is the book for you. Girls might enjoy it more than men because since Esther is a female, girls can obviously relate much easier than guys can."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Sylvia Plath entered this world in 1932 and decided for herself it was time to leave, amidst a turmoil of tragedies, on February 11, 1963.The Bell Jar is basically a semi-autobiographically novel of her madness, self-destruction, and struggle with her oppressor. The bell jar is symbolic for the pressures society has placed on her. This novel shows her inability to free herself from the constrictions placed on her life and thus, this begins her slow breakdown of her mental entity. Her road to recovery begins with shock therapy, which only results in resentment. The novel is mixed with despair, almost a confessional call for help and her insecurity.Her words are so brilliantly eloquent, yet Plath writes in such a succinct and simple way, that any reader will be able to absorb her works and interpret them in his or her own way.I definitely recommend this book, whether or not you've ever read any of the other Plath's works."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I reread the Bell Jar every couple of years and have done so since I was 18. It's so much more than a morbid ride or a thinly-veiled autobiography. It's one of few great coming-of-age stories that we have as women. I've long since stopped reading this book as a glimpse into Sylvia's soul or coming suicide. I've also stopped reading it as a precursor to the coming feminist movement of the 1960s. I'm drawn back to it again and again because it's simply a well-told story. It's subtle, complex and occasionally very very funny."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"A largely autobiographic novel, The Bell Jar is a story of depression and mental illness. Esther is a poor student from a small town, on a scholarship to do guest editing for a New York magazine. Her time in New York, obsession with the power than men have over her, and own apathy gradually lead to a mental breakdown. Institutionalization, shock therapy, and suicide attempts follow, all closely mirroring Plath's own history. Written honestly, with great skill and talent, The Bell Jar gives insight into depression and mental illness and tells a very personal, depressing, unique story. It's a hard book to sum up and even to talk about, but I recommend it very, very highly to all readers.As fascinating as this book was, as clear as the writing is, I find it difficult to talk about. The Bell Jar is perhaps the best memoir/book on depression and mental illness, providing a very human, realistic, and identifiable view of depression from the inside out. Plath writes so clearly that it is impossible not to understand her protagonist and the events in her life. As such, it's an informative, invaluable novel which allows the reader to understand, even experience, a point of view that would otherwise be unknown to them--and so it can be a very emotional book to read.Besides this measure of intrinsic value, the novel simply reads and moves well. It is a memoir, not an detective story or a romantic novel, and as such the plot isn't the focus: rather, it is characters and experiences that matter. The honest, gritty memoir is reminiscent of The Catcher in the Rye (although, I would say, much better). But the story is still compelling: not matter how gritty, even through the mental breakdowns, Esther is so well-written that the reader ca identify and sympathize with her throughout. Furthermore, the text reads smoothly and quickly while still chronicling some truly harrowing and depressing events. The book is compelling, well-written, and worthwhile not only as a memoir of depression but also as a skillful novel.The rest of my thoughts about the text are lengthy rambles on women, madness/mental illness, and writing, but they are out of place here. The only thing to leave you with is a strong recommendation of The Bell Jar. Read it--there's nothing more complex than that. It is an accessible novel, both in length and writing style; it is skillful, a masterly work; the description of depression, of treatment, of interaction with the rest of the world is worthwhile for anyone to read. I highly recommend this book and am very grateful that I finally got around to reading it myself."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"This is a masterpiece, well written, extremely well organized contemporary style book. It is often compared to The Catcher in the Rye, while I think that the angst in this book isn't so apparent.For anyone who has suffered through a mental disorder or knows someone else who has, this is a must read as it is very articulate in how it describes the process of slipping into depression."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I think more than anything else, The Bell Jar is a book about uncertainty and failure. Like the main character, when I first entered college, I thought that anyone who encounters these two horrific obstacles is stuck forever in a trap, and nothing short of a flawless record is ever worthy of existence. I didn't realize that if you live long enough, you're certain to encounter such setbacks, and if you live even longer, you're certain to get through them as well.The actual book title is a bit puzzling initially, but it ties in really well with the story and this theme about life being full of times when you're imprisoned in an incredible streak of depressing, non-successful ventures. Even something as simple as sleep becomes a struggle to accomplish. It's like the hand of God has abandoned you, and you just have to wait for it to come back.The modernized world has great expectations of us all, and we have great expectations of the modernized world. But sooner or later, both parties will fall short of these expectations. We expect to have no problems getting through school, succeeding in a career, finding love, and starting a family. We don't expect setbacks and failures such as divorce, suicide, inadequate talent, infidelity, car accidents, miscarriages, and bad economic times to play enough of a factor to damage our plans. And the world doesn't expect us to fall into these things. But in truth, none of us is above a single one of these failures falling upon us.ABC's \\"How To Be A Millionaire\\" sums up a good portion of The Bell Jar for me in the statement, \\"I've seen the future. I can't afford it.\\" It's a statement I agree with. Despite our expectations, we can't afford the future. But somehow, miraculously, with a lot of hope and a lot of help, there just may be a way to get through it. So believe it or not, The Bell Jar leaves me with a strong feeling of optimism, at this, the closing of the year."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"The Bell Jar is the loosely autobiographical novel by Sylvia Plath. It's one of my favorite books. I could read it repeatedly, and that's not something I normally do with most novels. Unquestionably, Sylvia Plath was one of the greatest literary talents of the 20th century. Just from reading this novel, you can tell she is a poet at heart. The book is simpler and more straightforward than her poetry (which is to be expected), but she draws you in as the reader with her various uses of simile and her striking imagery. The prose has an intensity, as well has a conversational tone, that makes it feels as if Esther Greenwood is speaking directly to you, making it hard to put down.Despite its reputation in some circles as a \\"feminist\\" novel, young men and women should be able to read this book and find something to relate to. Not only does Esther struggle with society's sexist double standards, she is also striving to find her place in the world, establish a career, carve out an identity for herself. This is a must read for anyone in their young adulthood because who doesn't deal with those existential dilemmas during that time? This book is also well known for focusing on depression. Plath makes you understand the illness completely through Esther's eyes, to the point that that it's difficult to determine what is actually wrong with her. The subject matter may keep some people away but Plath's hilariously sardonic sense of humor provides great comic relief throughout the entire novel (even throughout the heavier second half). Plath's reputation often precedes her work so I would recommend not going into the novel with any preconceived notions and simply treasuring its brilliance."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Probably the thing that scares me the most about this book is how much I relate to Esther, the brilliantly mad heroine. Of course, it's not her brilliance to which I relate, but her madness. Sylvia Plath indeed makes Esther's breakdown seem like the most reasonable thing in the world. Esther is battered left and right by people's expectations of her, as a woman and as a writer. All of these expectations are burdens, weighing her down until she finally falls into a dark hole. It's 1953, and for a woman who wants to define her life by her work and her mind, the pressures of marriage and womanhood are immense. Esther is surrounded by talented girls who want nothing more than a rich husband and children. Esther doesn't fit into that mold, and she is unable to create her own.Sylvia Plath uses the story of a fig tree to illustrate how Esther sees the many different possible paths in her life. One fig is the talented poet, another is the doting wife and mother, and another is the powerful editor....it goes on and on. Many people have struggled with the same thing. Esther feels pulled in many different directions (as do I). Her descent into madness throws a wrench into her plans, forcing her to deal with the imperfect person she really is. Plath uses an almost causal tone when describing Esther's breakdown. Everything is stated matter-of-factly, demonstrating how even the mentally ill can think rationally.The book deserves its place among the best of the American classics. Plath was a literary genius whose own struggles with mental illness gave her poetry and prose a tragic and haunting voice."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Flat out one of the best novels I've ever read. I've read her poems before and never really cared for them. I'm going to go back and read a few now that I have a perspective on who she was.I saw one reviewer say he/she didn't understand how people found this novel thought provoking or moving. Well, I wouldn't consider it either one for me. What I did find was a candid story about a deeply troubled teenage girl in the first half of the twentieth century.This should be on high school reading lists long before Tolstoy's eloquent yet stale Anna Karenina.. just to name one off the top of my head."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Sylvia Plath's semi-autobiographical novel begins the first half with an uncannily similar introspective caustic awareness of Holden Caulfield -The Catcher in the Rye- and ends with a tranquil and disturbingly pathetic prisoner of mental illness who resembles Susanna Kaysen -Girl, Interrupted.The beginning accounts for a young talented writer who wins an award in college to work for a fortnight in New York and hob nob with literary greats while witnessing the operations of a media magazine mogul. Life was free and very good to the protagonist - Esther Greenwood.Then Esther shrinks and defies comradery and eerily succumbs to a mental illness that most cannot relate to - as most are lucky enough to be immune to such disease. And, to Plath's credit, Esther does not deliver an account pleading for your sympathy. Instead, Plath describes in the first person what she perceives - awkward to the sane reader, but amazingly enlightening.Malcolm Lowery won great praise for his dipsomaniac's perspective inUnder the Volcano- where words plastered on the beginning pages read as though the typist either could not formulate a sentence, or was as impaired as the protagonist. By reading pages of the blundering but decipherable prose, Lowery made the reader feel the torment of the drunkard's demise. In this book, where the prose is not nearly as difficult as that by Lowery (in fact the writing is exceptionally good), the reader is taken to experience what Plath calls the Bell Jar. This book teaches without being didactic.Before reading this novel, I fondly looked upon bell jars - the glass covers used to protect flowers. They tickled pleasant and fond memories of nature and its beauty. But, to Plath, a bell jar is something much more than a cover to adorn. Even if she received the greatest gift from anyone, she writes that she could not appreciate it as \\". . . I would be sitting under the same glass bell jar, stewing in my own sour air.\\" And this haunting life discouraged her and made her want to avoid becoming a fusty old mare. She continually would worry because \\". . . I wasn't sure . . . [that] somewhere, anywhere - the bell jar , with its stifling distortions. . . wouldn't descend again. . .\\" And, in real life they did.Not hidden amid this novel are feminist tones - not undertones. Great details about not marrying, not having children, and fighting men who almost rape good girls like Esther to do the \\"act\\" exist in this book. And, in the end after having virgin-ending sex, she experiences what the doctor says \\"only one in a million\\" experience - severe unending hemorrhaging. Men are not good for much - even in that respect.Having lived in the novel's backdrop, and being an avid lover of J.D. Salinger's deprecating words in young man's jargon about the privileged of New York, I felt shrouded in nostalgia when reading this novel. This book brought me to places and literature I admire. This book took me back in time in a comfortable way - irrespective of the topic which I rarely include in conversation or thought. Plath is, in my biased opinion, as important a voice of the early sixties as those who preceded her by only a matter of few years - theBeat Generation.This novel deserves its praise, and it is certainly our misfortune that the author died at a young age with only one published novel."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"In The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath,Esther Greenwood shares her most significant years of adulthood with thereader and gives an insightful perspective on life as she descends into madnessand finds her life put on hold for a mental illness that won't let her returnto her old life of academic excellence and writing. She didn't find herselfstimulated by the high-end parties of New York City's glamorous culture andthe idolized lifestyle that other girls her age strove to achieve, but herexperiences frightened and disoriented her. Esther becomes increasinglydepressed, and finds herself unable to sleep, write, eat or behave normally. Shechecks into different institutions to help herovercome her illness and sheprogressively (with highs and lows) tries to return to sanity.Plath's distinctive writing is a verbal feast with vivid imagery, accuratediction, and original comparisons. Overall an enjoyable read, regardless of someof the grim circumstances that Esther finds herself in (The Bell Jar is reallya thinly veiled autobiography of Sylvia Plath). It's unforgettable darkand cynical humor as well as the thought provoking themes makes it well worththe read.(Anna Kogan)"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"As many other reviewers have stated, this book is filled with poetry.

In High School I was required to Read \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" several times. Never once was this book even suggested. I have always enjoyed CITR, and have read it many times both for pleasure and requirement. I had heard of Plath, but had no idea that she wrote such a book.

Early on, she declares, (p 2) \\"I was supposed to be having the time of my life.\\" Esther Greenwood and eleven other young ladies (p 3) \\"had all won a fashion magazine contest, by writing essays and stories and poems and fashion blurbs, and as prizes they gave us jobs in New York for a month, expenses paid, and piles and piles of free bonuses, like ballet tickets and passes to fashion shows...\\" Unfortunately, instead of elation and excitement at such an opportunity, of it, she writes (p 3) \\"I felt very still and very empty, the way the eye of a tornado must feel, moving dully along in the middle of the surrounding hullabaloo.\\"The Bell Jar follows her experiences as an intern in NYC during the early 1950s, college life (dating, avoiding her TB afflicted boyfriend, trying to lose her virginity), and mental decline, including time spent in a psych ward for electroshock therapy.

Also good: Girl Interrupted by Susanna Kaysen, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kesey, and A Beautiful Mind by Sylvia Nasar."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"The Bell Jar tells the captivating story of Esther Greenwood, a gifted young woman who has just completed her arduous internship as a junior editor at a magazine in New York City in the early 1950s. The novel, written entirely in first person, chronicles her mental breakdown and subsequent emotional deterioration.This work is a roman &agrave; clef, in which some or all of the characters in the book are based on actual people, and the happenings in the novel are rooted in real occurrences. Typically this style is used on sensitive subjects, or subjects with which the author is not entirely comfortable revealing all the information. This novel was obviously quite emotionally close to Plath, who could be described as the real-life Esther Greenwood. Originally released under the pen name Victoria Lucas, the book was modified to be in Sylvia Plath's name only after her suicide in 1971.Though often associated with severe sadness or depression, The Bell Jar can be very humorous, but not always in an obvious way. Plath writes using dry humor, being, at times, extremely cynical. She expresses a strong disdain for those who choose to follow convention, such as marrying and having children, believing those to be unexceptional and simple paths of life.Plath's skill is unmistakable and her experience as a poet is quite evident. Alliteration and assonance are scattered in the pages of The Bell Jar, and Plath employs various other literary devices throughout the novel to enrich the reading experience. Symbolism is another tool commonly used by the author. Esther glimpses into several mirrors during her stay at the psychiatric ward, often mistaking her reflection for that of another. This lack of self-recognition reveals Esther's struggle to fully comprehend herself and this symbolism demonstrates Plath's insight into the human condition.To be direct, I adore this book. I find the character Esther to be the perfect combination of skepticism and wit, refusing to conform to meet the standards of her time. Her resilience and individuality ripple forth from the pages of this book like the interruption of still water by a stone.Having said all of this, I probably would not recommend The Bell Jar. I say this not because of any fault of the book, but for my own selfish reasons. As it is, I feel not everyone has the capacity to genuinely appreciate this bok. Reading this novel without that capacity runs the risk of depreciating it based on misunderstanding. In a way, those who choose to pursue this piece of literature deserve the knowledge it holds, and this prevents the book from becoming commonplace. It should be kept-- like a secret among friends."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Reading The Bell Jar, I have uncomfortable moments where I see whispers of Esther's insanity in myself. Plath has created a character (or maybe recorded herself in a way) that is eminently believable, and begins the book with a personality that doesn't hint at what is to come later. Her apathy and distraction grow so gradually, normality and madness blend into each other so finely, that it is disconcertingly jarring to realize how hazy and meaningless the word \\"normal\\" really is. For some reason we seem to expect that we would know insanity instantly were we to see it, or experience it, ourselves. But of course the difference between a \\"normal\\" person and a person suffering from a mental disorder is a construct of our society, not an immutable distinction. This book is beautifully written, with many scenes that linger in my memory. It ends ambiguously, but the sad story of its author gives the entire work a somber feel."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Plath's story may leave you with the sense that a sane and healthy mind is much more of a fragile thing than you expected. By turns entertaining, funny, dark, and poetic; Plath's writing infuses her character with genuine humanity. She allows us a unique insight into an unwell mind. Strangely enough, I often found myself cracking a slow smile as I read the thoughts of a completely rational character whose descent into insanity seemed so natural and reasonable."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Despite my penchant for both women's literature and modern American literature, and despite the fact that I even majored in American Literature in college, I never got around to reading this book. I so loved Plath's poetry, particularly in college, that I think I was secretly frightened to read her autobiography because it would force me to think carefully about her tragic end. Now that I've finally finished it, I can count it among my favorite novels. Its colloquial and simple language makes it an easy read. Esther's deep struggles with the opportunities both open and closed to women are as accurate and pertinent today as they were 30 or 40 years ago, and Plath's riveting and terrifying description of a young girl's plunge into mental illness is crafted with such ease that the reader begins to question her own sanity. The real tragedy of the novel is knowing the true end of Plath, and thinking how much more wonderful prose and poetry she could have contributed."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"\\"The Bell Jar\\" by Silvia Plath, is a book about a girl named Esther Greenwood.

She makes several suicide attempts and is taken to a mental hospital to be treated.I would highly reccommend \\"The Bell Jar\\". The author writes in an excellent style that makes Esther Greenwood's insanity seem so real. This is a tragic but wonderful and interesting book of how Esther lives her life with her insanity. She undergoes shock treatments at a mental hospital, but along the way, she meets new people and recalls back on some past experiences. I can guarantee that anyone who reads this book will love it just as I did, and will not be dissappointed."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"This is my favorite book of all time, and contrary to popular belief, Sylvia Plath is not crazy; she is simply honest. Any teen, adolscent or post-adolscent girl can identity with Esther's plight because it is their own, and anyone who says otherwise is a liar. Plath's novel takes you places where you may not want to go; but, they are places where every woman has been before at some point in her life. Even if you've never been haunted by the prospect of suicide, you know how it feels to have life close in, leading you to toy with the idea of crawling under a rock and quickly disappearing from the rest of the world. You know what it's like to be afraid of living because one more day in the world is one more day you have to deal with an overbearing mother, a snoopy peer or a demanding boyfriend. Every girl gets trapped in her own private bell jar. Esther goes through all these things and any woman can easily relate, whether she wants to admit it or not. I must say that this is far and away the most bare and honest novel I have ever read. I could almost hear the wheels of psychosis churning around and around in Esther's head. Plath is a genius and expresses her brilliance ever so beautifully in this masterpiece of hers. FIVE BRIGHT GLEAMING STARS! A MUST READ FOR WOMEN EVERYWHERE!"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"The Bell Jar is a stark narrative about depression, and the power it has to completely immobilize protagonist Esther Greenwood and throw her into insanity. The Bell Jar's prose is easy to read, and yet Sylvia Plath's writing style is highly sophisticated and exact, which is startling considering the nearness of her own suicide. Esther Greenwood begins an ambitious and talented young writer, working for a beauty magazine in New York, and attending college on a full scholarship. Her sorrow and madness begin to surface, and she soon finds herself trapped in a revolving door of mental asylums. The interesting thing here is way the story is told; unflinchingly and without remorse. I could hear Plath's cold, spare, incisive voice behind that of Miss Greenwood - hurting and ready to die. The Bell Jar can be read as a fierce indictment on depression. It is a brilliant, haunting, frightening work, and it held my interest intensely the whole way through."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"No matter your age or background, if you have ever felt alone, you can relate to this book. The Bell Jar is the story of a girl fresh out of college trying to find peace of mind and happiness. The beginning of the book tells of her slow discovery that everything she has ever wanted-and is now on the verge of getting-do not mean as much as she thought. As her dreams seem to crash down around her, she feels her bell jar descend, sending her into a state of loneliness and madness. The beauty of The Bell Jar is that the author's feelings come through so honestly that the reader feels like he or she is sitting across from a friend, listening to their story. The story not only draws sympathy from the reader, but causes an assessment of one's own dreams and fears. The Bell Jar is not a story to read and forget. It mirrors real life inner-quarrels and leaves the reader with a sense of hope. No matter what the bell jar is, it can be overcome."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"This novel is fascinating because it is not driven by the usual plot devices writers use to move a story along. The reader is sucked into this book by Sylvia Plath's exquisite narrative voice: her similies are still startling even after so many years, her word choices are flawless, and she is a master at choosing just the right details-- and nothing more to bog down the narrative flow-- that illuminate a scene.The plot has a true ring to me. I suspect that most people who have made it through most of a college program, and must confront the courses and people which they have managed to avoid for many semesters; that, or not finish their program, would feel the same way. I don't think a person must be depressive in order to relate to the malaise of the beginning of the book. By the time things become, well...strange, the reader has already been pulled into Esther's head, and sees events from her perspective. Her depression seems almost inevitable.Beautiful and perfect."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"The story can be compared to Catcher In The Rye in that the main characters of both stories are similarly out of place in society. They feel as though there is something in life that is missing, but continue living not knowing what it is until they eventually have a mental breakdown.

Her words could be violently beautiful, or peacefully bloody, but what can one expect from a novel by a poet."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Rarely, if ever do I give a book 5 stars, but this definitely deserved it.

I especially liked the first person narration of the story; it provided a more personal view on Esther's fall into insanity. When I was reading it, I could feel and understand Esther's concerns with herself and the people/world around her.I've noticed that most of the time when people talk about this book, they speak of only Esther's insanity and how it relates to Plath's own diminishing state of mind, but in my opnion, there's so much more to it than that. I actually think that in a small sense the story was also about the problems of the world through Esther's eyes. Take for instance Buddy's betrayal. This makes Esther question all those theories about men and women being pure for their husbands and wives. Yes, a large part of this story is about Esther's mental state, but at the same time, you're faced with a young woman who is aptly aware of her surroundings. She questions the standard? What's right?

She shares her innermost thoughts of those around her:&quot;The figures around me weren't people, but shop dummies, painted to resemble people and propped up in attitudes counterfeiting life.&quot; She also reflects with her own difficulties with the prospects of love.&quot;And I knew that in spite of all the roses and kisses and restrauraunt dinners a man showered on a woman before he married her, what she secretly wanted when the wedding service ended was for her to flatten out underneath his feet like Mrs. Willard's kitchen mat.

They will always come alive...remain fresh."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"This book has reached many audiences--feminists, mental health experts, depressed people, young people, and the literary community, to name a few. Rather than take any of these viewpoints, I rated the book based on what kind of reading experience it provided to me. I was expecting something really emotionally intense. The story is interesting but not compelling. It was frequently disjointed and did not seem polished, and I can understand why the original editors rejected it. Many comparisons have been made to the works of J.D. Salinger, but in my opinion this book falls far short of Salinger's works on all counts. The setting is very dated because of references to the prices of things (dresses costing a few dollars, expensive restaurant dishes and taxicab fares under a dollar), and the details of how women dressed (high heels, stockings with lines on the back that had to be kept straight, etc.) I actually found this aspect of the book to be interesting. Many reviewers have noted humor in the book. I found very little humor. I think the fame of this book rests on the fact that it was in the right place in the right time. The same book written these days would never have seen print. It is worth reading for its place in literary and social history, but it just isn't the reading experience you might be anticipating. It did leave me feeling great sadness for the author and the suffering she experienced."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I had to read the Bell Jar for my English class and write a research paper on it. To be honest, reading it was not one of the most joyous times of my life. The book maily focuses on the depressing parts of Esther and her monotonous life. All throughout the book she is falling down on her knees and has not stregnth not get back up and face the world. She continually hides from people and does not show the true person she is. Esther has no self confidence and wishes to seduce the first man who comes across her path. She is a desperate person with little self moral. But, on a good note, Plath writes about her depression so descriptively, you actually feel like you are going down with Esther. I would not recommend this book to the person wishing to read something for fun, but for the more serious and mature reader. Reading a book for fun is what Harry Potter is for. Hope this helps alot!"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"There have been plenty of novels that since The Bell Jar have described in painstaking detail the morbid coldness of a psych ward experience, and people who've been through it may more closely relate with these recentworks, as certainly the psychiatric field has changed since 1953. However, Plath's experience is both personal yet easily relatable. We feel in her body when she's receiving the electric shock treatments; we feel in her head as she tries to make sense of why death is so appealing; we feel in her heart as she tries to understand what love is, and why she hasn't even come close to it. Plath clouds Esther's thoughts with plenty of vivid imagery and similes, and by the book's completion, we wish it wasn't over.FULL REVIEW:[...]"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"The Bell Jar is an accurate and soulful story of a brilliant woman who fights constant psycholoical battles. The writing is spectacular and the story itself is thoroughly captivating. Worth a couple of re-reads!"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"The Bell Jar was one of the most substantial things written by Sylvia Plath, who was world-renowned for being one of America's best poets. In college I took an array of poetry classes, I enjoyed them to an extent, and I always did well in them. But poetry has never really affected me like it has other people. A lot of it is pretentious, and a lot of it is hard to understand. But Plath eased in well to prose; it was excellent.Initially this wasn't a big seller (partly due to her using the pseudonym \\"Victoria Lucas\\"), but after her very tragic suicide in 1963, the novel took on a new fame.It's about a smart college girl in the 1950s; starts just after the Rosenbergs are electrocuted (as it states on page one). This young woman is spending a semester in New York City working for a reputable fashion magazine, as an intern, winning her spot with twelve others for academic excellence: for her it was writing a particular poem. The book follows her life for approximately a year; from New York to Massachusetts (Plath's originally from Boston). It's a \\"confessional-prose\\" masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Sylvia Plath's story--both in real life, and in this work of \\"fiction\\"--is undeniably sad. I purchased this book after, by chance, catching the last 15 minutes of the movieSylviaon tele (which piqued my interest in her story). I instantly fell in love with the mood of this book. Sylvia's style as an author is undeniable.I am tempted to compare the main character of this story (which is, in fact, a not-so-\\"fictionalized\\" autobiographical account of Sylvia's entry into young adulthood)to J.D. Salinger's Holden Caulfield (ofThe Catcher in the Rye, for those not familiar). However, that might be a bit oversimplistic. When you consider the social climate and its implications for women in the era of this book, you may find it all the more compelling that the main character behaves as she does. I won't give too much away, but I will say that Plath does a remarkable job of creating a character for whom her readers will likely experience many conflicting impressions and feelings.You will likely walk away from this book feeling frustrated and curious. Go with it! I highly recommendSylvia Plath: Method and Madness: A Biographyas subsequent reading. Why? Because only after reading Sylvia's biography can you realize how very much of 'The Bell Jar' was based in reality--and that, in turn, will solidify whatever feelings it evoked in you. I found myself turning back to 'The Bell Jar' constantly just to note the similarities as I read that biography. At the end of both, I cannot deny that although Sylvia's life and story was very different than my own (and that, as a person, she was someone I probably would not have felt *warm and fuzzy* toward in 'real life'), I walked away from both books feeling somehow sorrowfully connected to her and her tragic life--which undoubtedly ended much too soon."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"This is one of my all time fave books. It's in my collection, along with GO ASK ALICE, CUT, CONFESSIONS OF A CATHOLIC SCHOOLGIRL. Books about troubled girls are just so fascinating. Make me feel less screwed up, I guess."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I've been an avid reader of Sylvia Plath's writing for quite some time. It was her works that lead me into the realm of poetry. When I discovered that she had written a book, I was beyond thrilled. It always humbles me to take an adventure through her life guided by her vivid imagery, and this book was certainly nothing short of that.The Bell Jar starts at a point in her life where she is in New York apprenticing as a journalist for a magazine. It is here that her mental stability begins to decay. From that time on, the main character, Esther Greenwood, reflects on the events in her life that lead up to her condition.As someone with a generally differing take on life, I appreciate this book for it's representation of the alternative mind set. This book does not come out and say that the main character is ill, they set up her depression as a chronic piece of Esther's life. The presentation of a serious mental state being shown to the world as something relatable and relatively normal is, I think, a commendable ability. With that in mind, I would recommend it to anyone who is opened to an opposing thought process, it may just change your view on life."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. I enjoyed every moment of this book. I read it within 2 days! This should be a top priority on your to read list!"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I read The Bell Jar several times during my emotionally troubled high school &amp; early college years, which led me to want to (and, in fact, read all of Plath's poetry and become a Sylvia Plath fan. Twenty-plus years after my first reading, I found myself wallowing in depression, trying to make sense of it all, with a hankering to revisit The Bell Jar. It was even better the second (well, actually fourth or fifth) time around -- not only could I relate to Esther Greenwood's horrid isolation, I could also see the humor and wit this time, and relate not only to Esther's personal desperation, but also her mother's desperation to ensure that she was okay and her inability to do so. Esther stews over / tinkers with / attempts suicide in a variety of ways, underscoring the chronic nature of depression. Oddly, reading The Bell Jar didn't bring me down at all -- rather, it made me think about how gripping depression can be if one never confronts it head-on and conquers it (assuming such is possible)."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"it's a shame that Sylvia Plath did not have the opportunity to write more fiction. This novel is funny, insightful and haunting. Her sense of humor is fantastic, I've read this book over again and I'm amazed at how right on she can be. Free from the &quot;find your inner child, what mommy and daddy did to me&quot; psychobabble so overabundant in the &quot;when I went a little cuckoo&quot; books of our era, Plath's telling is fresh, honest and different. (I'm not poo-pooing societies ability to get in touch with themselves, perhaps if Sylvia Plath had lived today she might have been able to cope better, I am just remarking that it makes for a different kind of read)."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"The Bell Jar was a very good book. As I began reading it I was very interested, and as I proceeded into the book it became even more interesting. From the way that the book started out, I never thought that it would turn out as it did. When the main character, Esther, was introduced she seemed like a nice, very smart young lady that did no wrong. As I kept reading, until I finally came to the end, I realized that I was mislead and she had a lot of problems that you would not think someone like her would have. I really liked the way the author set up the story and the ending that she wrote for this particular story. The different kinds of people that you met throughout the story lead you to the understanding that Esther was different than most and did have some problems. While she was in New York everytime that one of her fellow contest winners would invite her to do something she would deny the invitation and either stay in her room and do nothing, or she would go out into the city and view the downside of it. I thought it was good for her to explore all aspects of the city, but she never wanted to do things with her fellow winners. It made the story really interesting and made me to not want to put the book down. I would refer this book to anyone whom likes stories that leave you confused when you find out that someone or something is totally different than what you had thought or was presented to be."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"This is a great book. It neatly shows how those with psychiatric problems may look normal on the outside but inside they are rotting (and I think I am entitled to use the word rotting). Plath's work clearly demonstrates how even the most promising are in reality just a few steps away from personal hells. The descriptions of electro-convulsive therapy are terrifying (although the process has suppousedly been made less barbaric today). It would be interesting to read this book if it had been written today when psychotropic drugs are somewhat more effective."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath is the most intriguing book that I have ever read. Her approach to a young woman's insanity is absolutely stunning and should be read by everyone. She has a poetic flow to her writing and describes everything so well that it is easy to create images in your mind while you read it. At one point in the book, I actually had to put it down because the character, Esther, was so convincing that I felt as if she were right in front of me, living the life that Plath created for her. The Bell Jar is extremely unique, strong and poetic, and it is a shame that Sylvia Plath descended into her own depression and killed herself not long after completing the book."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I first read this work when I was in about 9th grade. However, because I had been so young and it had been so long ago when I read it I couldn't really remember anything but key elements and such. So, I decided to pick it up and read it again. This amazing work really gives you some insight of how sometimes privileged people fall to pieces. She paints a vivid picture of how painful life was like for her, and how she felt completely alienated by everyone except her therapist. The ending could be seen as a bit rushed, but the general feeling remains in tact. Definitely a great book to learn more about severe depression, and about her life."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Plath was an incredible and intense mind. Through her writing, she sent emotions and feeling to an incredible amount of people. The story of The Bell Jar is really Plath letting her being seep out onto paper. The writing is classic and leads me to believe that the whole idea of &quot;sanity&quot; has become almost non existent, as well as overrated."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"The book tells the story of a young English major who finds herself breaking down mentally and being treated by electric shock in a special institute. This novel is said to be based on the life of the author, Sylvia Plath.Is Esther a younger version of Sylvia, or just a wannabe girl with ambitions to become a poet / author / journalist? Or maybe this is just the way Sylvia sees herself, denying all her literary accomplishments? I find that to be one of the most interesting questions raised in the book.I sensed that Esther's main problem was not knowing how to handle the world around her once she got out of the &quot;perfect&quot; environment of being a star pupil in school and college, and living in a world where she might not be the &quot;star&quot; but the average person or even fail evry once in a while... She starts to feel confused while staying in NYC. Even though she got that stay as a prize in a competition, and the prize could be seen as a high point for her, once she gets there she finds herself in social and personal situations she just can't handle properly. Some are minor, such as drinking the water meant for cleaning her fingers in dinner - and some more serious, like getting involved with Doreen's newfound friends, and finding out too late that she'd rather spend time with the &quot;nicer&quot; girls, boring as they might be compared to the former.When she finally gets back home, she experiences the first &quot;academic&quot; failure she has in a while - not being accepted to a writing course she was absolutely sure she'd get into. She hadn't made other plans, and is so shocked by the failure she just spends her time doing nothing in her mom's house, and that eventually drives her to think the thoughts and ask the questions that eventually break her down.Her treatment at the institute sounds like a &quot;standard&quot; and obvious, but I found the descriptions of the other patients rather amusing in a cynical and black humor sort of way...Esther has a very distorted view of men. The sofisticated men of New York all turn out to be creeps and empty headed people, the guy wshe chooses to lose her virginity with is a calculated women chaser, and even Buddy, who seems to be the perfect guy at first - handsome and smart medical student - turns out to be the sort of person who looks down on Esther, her ambitions and thoughts, and her mental situation."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I read this book under the impression that it would be a stereotypical mental illness book. Once i read the first chapter i knew that it was different from any other book that i've read. The emotions that she goes through. The way she describes her feelings. I was enraptured throughout the entire story. I couldn't believe that someone could go through something like she did. It was unbelievable. And the ways she pondered her suicide, i never knew that was possible. For some reason or another, it appealed to me when she explained the she wanted to draw a warm bath and slit her wrists, watching her red blood flow out of them. Likes red clouds. I don't understand why that was so appealing to me. It was a incredible book and it opens your eyes to the possibilities that a human can go through."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"This book is really incredible. It is a really short read and it has this great way of sucking you in. The whole time I was reading it I felt as if I was going crazy right along with the main character!

She is not beautiful, not necessarily brilliant. She is plain with brown hair and brown eyes. As far as her brilliance, she was a big fish in a small pond at her college and when she reaches the big city she begins to see how insignificant she really is. I love this novel, it is by far one of my favorites. Part of the beauty of the novel is that Esther is not this gorgeous, perfect person. She is a normal person who catches a lucky break and spends the remainder of the novel trying to figure out how to repeat her luck; then dealing with it when that does not happen. She is a real character. She is all of us. There is no prince charming. She has to save herself."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I was required to read this book for a college class I am taking but still would have enjoyed the book regardless of whether or not I was taking the class."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"A strong narrative that delivers a look into the steadily imploding life of a young woman.

It's a bit disturbing at some parts, but being a teenage girl, I can relate to some of her thoughts. This is a book that makes you think. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"The Bell Jar is a hard book to read. In reading it, I felt like I was trapped in Esther's bell jar myself. Her words, so achingly real--almost certainly related to the book's semi-autobiographical nature--evoke the struggles of not only women but also any overachiever and any loner. Throughout the novel, we see how the bell jar encaged Esther and we see how slowly, very slowly, she lifts it off of herself.I think the reason I appreciated this book so much is that the problems Esther faced are problems I've faced, and although I'm better than Esther, I've felt so low sometimes I felt like breaking. She showed me that she wasn't crazy; there was nothing wrong with her besides these social circumstances that she just couldn't cope with, try as she might. I love reading books where I feel like the narrator expresses my thoughts in a more tangible and eloquent way (and Plath can write!) The only reason it wasn't perfect for me--although this rating may change upon more reflection--was that mental illness is, well, pretty boring. The repeated suicide attempts and the monotony of life in the asylums are not particularly gripping, but I understand their necessity to the story.I just wish I could read this story with Esther walking into her final interview with the psychiatrists and walking out of the bell jar, however, it is impossible to read that last page and then not remember Plath's suicide shortly after this book's publication. Because of this knowledge, instead of ending with a sense of hope, the book ends with the feeling that bell jar is forever, it always exists, floating right above our heads, ready to collapse upon us again."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I bought this for some summer reading and was done within about a week cause it was so hard to put down. The book is really good at giving an inside look on how people dealing with depression or a mental health illness see the world. Would not recommend this to anyone who is depressed though."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"The Bell Jar is a poignant autobiographical novel about a young woman's road to irreversible insanity. The novel takes place in the sixties -- a time in which depression hadn't been delved into as much as it is now. While her mental condition worsened, Plath escaped her bizarre life by writing poetry. She'd also written this book. Even though she'd lost her battle with depression, Plath left this wonderful book as her legacy. The Bell Jar is poignant, twisted, surreal and, more importantly, insightful. By far, one of the best books I've read all year. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"&quot;The Bell Jar&quot; is an excellent piece of literature with a feminest feeling.

It was an outstanding book and I absolutely adored reading it."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I read this book after I finished Ronald Hayman &quot;Death and Life of Sylvia Plath&quot;. Considering just how dramatic her life was (that ended in suicide), and how much she was such a melodramatic person (a scene between her husband and his mistress), I was a bit disappointed to find that this semi-autobiographical book isn't dramatic enough. She told the story in almost monotone, teenage, and detach way, even though at rare points she does become &quot;involved&quot;.

Unlike the people who pretend to read on a Kindle or Ipad, I prefer a hard copy. And it sure beats the hell out of paying $30 for a new copy.

I enjoyed it so much that I ended up buying it myself a year or two later to read it again. One complaint that I've heard about the book is that it is depressing. Yes- it is depressing, however the story is also very real. Sylvia Plath does a fantastic job of using rich descriptions without it being too wordy. Plath has made the book very down to earth and honest. I bet this book was very controversial in the time it was written. Overall, it is a great read and for it's price it is totally worth it. Esther Greenwood is no doubt a complicated girl, and Plath weaves her story beautifully. Although fairly dark in nature, the story wraps up with the theme of rebirth and renewal. The book is truly inspiring and is a recommended read for anyone going through a difficult time. Suicide is mentioned many times throughout the novel, so be aware of that before purchasing."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I thought twice about reviewing this book even though I rate it highly. What more could I possibly say that hasn't already been said? (Yes, I know, it's hard to believe that a bookworm like me has only just discovered this gem.) But then I started making comparisons with another classic I have read and felt compelled to say something if only to set the record straight.Having noted the blatantly obvious in my usual way, with a Homeresque dimwittedness that I ascribe to age, I dug out Salinger's classic and read it through again, partly to make sure that the five-stars I had given it on Goodreads was justified, also to see if my memory was playing tricks on me or if these classics really are comparable.My conclusion is that \`Catcher in the Rye' is only a four-star read. Comparable, indeed, but lacking in many ways. That said it's important to remember that Holden Caulfield's female counterpart, Esther Greenwood, is also Plath's alter-ego and as such is empowered with the voice of experience.And what an experience. Five-stars all the way."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Thinking this would be a novel solely concerned with little more than the shock treatments of a young woman, I put off reading this for years. Big mistake. This is vibrant writing by a sensitive woman going through her tender years.

The mindset of The Bell Jar is so different from what that which we feel on a regular daily basis, but while reading the book you almost begin to think like Esther.

The main character, Esther Greenwood (a hero fashioned after Sylvia) barely survives the trials and tribulations of a life which includes electroshock and temporary &quot;insanity.&quot; Her life is sheltered under a suffocating bell jar which distorts reality into a pessimitically biased version of the truth. To escape this life-style, Esther attempts suicide on several occasions (many of which paralleling the attempts of Sylvia). The bell jar is a depressing, but accurate, account of a less-than-ideal life. Esther will have you weeping and laughing as she attempts to lead a normal life-style. If Sylvia hadn't committed suicide in 1963, she would have been very proud of its success."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I first read this book when I was a teenager and was totally enthralled by it. It has stayed with me through the years and now a 30 something wife and mother I understand it even more. Now as then when I read this book I &quot;feel&quot; the bell jar surround me.

Plath took apart the details of the life that hides behind a depressed soul, not giving definition to, but relating to those who suffer the same. One knows a truly well written book by how involved one gets into the lives of its characters. The time that I spent reading this book brought me to look at my own life. As a result, I lapsed into one of my depressive spells, but this was no ordinary &quot;hate life&quot; spell. I recognized so much that I shared with Esther. I asked my psychology teacher, who recommended the book to me, if most of his students come back to him and tell him that the book affected them in the same way it affected me. When a book forces you to look at your life and you find yourself completely absorbed into every fiber of its content, it truly is a treasure."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"The Bell Jar is even more powerful because it is an autobiographical piece.

I read it upon recommendation by a friend. And while I did enjoy the style in which it was written, overall this book left me feeling empty. I felt I had wasted my time. Mostly because I could not at all sympathize with the main character except in the most extreme of cicumstances, such as the shock therapy. Other than those few moments, I did not feel like she was subject to any unusually cruel acts or treatment. The majority of my disappointment came in the end. I felt there wasn't any kind of payoff, no real conclusion.Maybe I was distracted by all the little notes my friend had written in the book. Maybe it's simply because I'm a guy (which I sincerely doubt.) Personally, I would much rather read Ms. Plath's poetry than trudge this this little volume again.I give it two stars, for while I didn't necessarily enjoy the plot, the prose were downright hilarious at times!..."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Reading Sylvia Plath's novel, The Bell Jar, is like entering the life of a young woman that is trying to grow up in a male-dominated society. The main chareacter, Esther Greenwood, is approached by many mental and physacle obsticles. Her mind is overcomed by many emotions and menatlly challenged problems. She struggles with many issues from suicide to relationships. The Bell Jar is a great book for woman and especially teens. It deals with some issues that young ladies deal with everyday. Esther Greenwood portrayed a self-reliant woman, but was in need of help from the world that she avoided. Sylvia's style of writing is very simplistic and easy to understand, but is also full of radiant detail. It's not a story that causes bordem, but instead curiosity and interest. This book is said to be a reflection of the Plath's life,but is also a reflecton to lives of many young woman all over the world. This novel is some what disturbing but is a true American classic."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"At first one is struck by the surprising, fresh, and often delightful descriptive metaphors that light up the pages of this book (3 or 4 of these are so strikingly apt that they may stick with the reader; e.g., the \\"eye of a tornado\\" already on p.3), but beyond mid-book even these have become tiresome through overuse. \\"Much metaphor and a dash of feminism, both gratuitous\\" pretty much sums up this work. The purported insights (deep or otherwise) into mental illness and a plunge into it, are simply not there, except perhaps for those so young or naive as to have never thought or experienced much. There is that sort of caste to it which is familiar in that which seems often to appeal to histrionic and/or etiolated young females. Beyond that, and its feministic arrogation, one can perhaps see one other reason for its apparent popularity among a certain readership: its lack of any real nexus (other than serving as a cathartic for SP, herself) invites emotive readers to read into it what they will, including their own themes and prejudices."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I chose to read The Belle Jar because I had the book and always wanted to read it but didn't have the time. It happened to be an autobiographical novel too. I have heard a lot of people talk about the book and how good written it was. Also, my mom recommended it; it was her favorite book in collage. I've heard that you had to read it in high school, so now I have a head start. Sylvia Plath, the author, committed suicide in her early thirties. I thought it would be interesting to read a memoir of a suicidal feminist.The book is about a girl, Esther Greenwood, in the 1950's. She won a contest to go to New York for the summer and be a guest fashion editor for Ladies' Day magazine. While she is in New York she befriends some of the other guest fashion editors, Doreen and Betsy. Esther believes she is more like Betsy than Doreen. One night on the way to a party two men, Lenny and Frankie, stop her and Doreen in their cab. They go out to dinner with them. Frankie leaves early and Doreen spends the night at Lenny's apartment while Esther walks home. The pounding of the door of her hotel room wakes Esther up. Doreen comes in wasted and passes out. In the morning, everyone got food poisoning from the breakfast. Buddy, Esther's old boyfriend wants to marry her, but she doesn't want to because she thinks she can't maintain her duties as a wife and write poetry at the same time. Also, she thinks it's unfair that women are expected to stay \\"pure\\" until they're married, while men are not held to such strict standards. She wants to lose her virginity because she's frustrated with her naivety. Esther believes it will transform her. She realizes that a man would never sleep with the women he loved because he thinks it seems animal-like.She goes on a blind date, with Doreen and Lenny, with a one of Lenny's friends, Marco. Marco is a \\"woman-hater\\". He makes Esther dance with him even though she doesn't want to. He tries to rape her in a puddle of mud. She thinks if she just lies there \\"it\\" will happen. Then he calls her a slut and she begins to fight back, she punched him in the nose and he smears his blood on Esther's cheeks. She took the train back to her hotel in Manhattan. She changes and takes the train to Massachusetts, where she lives.The family doctor refers her to a psychiatrist, Dr. Gordon. He does nothing but make matters worse. Dr. Gordon doesn't listen, is conceited, and sends her to shock treatment. Esther attempts suicide four times. She tried slitting her wrists but couldn't bring her self to it, hanging her self but couldn't find a high enough place to do it, drowning herself but keeps floating to the surface, and taking fifty sleeping pills. After trying to overdose, she passes out and wakes up in a hospital bed. In the hospital, Esther meets her new psychiatrist, Dr. Nolan. She likes Dr. Nolan a lot, she thinks of her as a mother figure.Esther sees Joan, buddy's old girlfriend and collage acquaintance. Joan says that after reading about Esther's suicide attempts in the newspaper, it inspired her to try also. They become good friends, but later on Joan tells Esther that she likes her. Esther gets mad and Joan walks away. She tells Dr. Nolan that she wants to lose her virginity but is worried about pregnancy, Dr. Nolan sends her to another doctor to get a diaphragm. Esther now needs to pick whom to give it up to.She loses it to a math professor named Irwin whom she met in the Harvard library. After, she starts bleeding and it will not stop. She goes to the emergency room and the doctor stops it. When she gets back to the mental institute she is staying at, she gets out before school starts again. She discovers that Joan is missing. Later, they found her; she hung herself in the woods.Esther calls Irwin and demands that he pay for the medical bill of that night. He asked if he was ever going to see her again, she replies \\"Never,\\" then hangs up. Now she feels free. Buddy came to visit and asks if she thought that buddy had anything to do with Joan's suicide. After the funeral she waits for her final interview with her doctors, she walks into the room.This book was very poetically written. It also refers to a fig tree to represent the options she wants, but she is paralyzed with indecision and the figs fall of and die. A belle jar is a clear, glass jar that people use to display things, or acts like a vacuum when closed. It's called The Belle Jar because she feels as if there were a belle jar hovering above her about to drop and suffocate her. At the end of the book, she feels that it has been lifted but may come down again at any time.This book reminded me of a movie I saw called Girl, Interrupted. It's similar because both are about a girl in an institute who deals with suicide and sex. How a girl went from living normally to having sex with a stranger, committing suicide, and living in a mental institute, when in fact they are not that psychotic. Sylvia Plath did a beautiful way of explaining in this book, I understood everything rather than sitting confused. I would recommend this book to anyone in eighth grade or higher, or they might not understand it. Probably someone who likes poetry would like this book."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"The Bell Jar, written by Sylvia Plath, is an extremely insightful autobiography that reveals Plath's inner turmoil through her thoughts and actions. The plot of Plath's story begins with her winning an assignment on a New York fashion magazine, which was a dream come true for her. This dream soon became raveled up in Plath's distress and became one of the many pieces of the puzzle of Plath's life, which soon transformed into a living nightmare. Due to her illness and her mental breakdown, Plath, or Esther, as she is known in the book, had to go to a psychiatrist and even had to be treated with electric shock therapy. Plath took a very immature approach toward dealing with her turmoil and mental breakdowns by attempting to kill herself several times. Although she felt this was the way out of her despair, she never had the will or strength to go through such a drastic measure of coping with her problems. Plath eventually found inner peace and satisfication in her life. I believe the theme of The Bell Jar is that depression, frustration, and hardship come in everybody's life at one point or another and we all must know how to handle it properly and not to turn to a rash solution such as suicide. Several small elements such as tone and symbolism actually play a big role in the depth of this novel's true meaning. This novel has a factual tome in the very beginning, but as the story progresses, it becomes one of despair and suspense. Also, the title has very powerful symbolism in it. The title of The Bell Jar refers to a cylindrical glass vessel with a rounded top and an open base used to protect and display fragile objects or to establish a controlled atmosphere or environment in scientific experiments. Most likely, the meaning behind this symbolism is that throughout her stay at the mental hospital, Plath felt as if she was in a bell jar because she was fragile and liable to break at any time. This feeling developed through her stay at the hospital because she knew she was quite ill and in a way felt trapped in the hospital due to her illness. Plath probably also felt as if she had no way out and she may not be able to live a normal life again. The Bell Jar has a very influential and positive social significance. This book probably can relate to how many people might have felt at least at one point of their life. People who have felt that way and have read the book before most likely can share their depression and despair more easily with others and learn to cope with their problems seeing how Plath managed to get through her despair. Therefore, this novel has great meaning and purpose on society because the fact is that more people you may think consider suicide. I can honestly say this novel, The Bell Jar, written by Sylvia Plath, is very enjoyable, and depressing at the same time, to read. It offers a chance to see how life can be so depressing sometimes, yet there's always a reasonable solution; you just have to be very determined to find that solution."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Esther, the main character, is a racist, homophobic narcissist, as superficial as she is sensitive, as innocently waifish as she is ruthlessly passive-aggressive, always needing more than the world has to offer. She's an interesting mass of contradictions, but for me ultimately unlikeable, making the first-person narration sometimes hard to take.The first half of the book, set in New York where Esther is interning or something at a women's magazine, is the most engaging. It's like a cross between Sex And The City and My So-Called Life. She indulges fully in the glamorous lifestyle she is afforded on the company dime, but laments being numb to the experience.In the second half the narration continues taking a more lamenting than expository tone, ranging in effect from tragically romantic, when she actively commits to her decision to give up on life, to just whiney, when she seems to be demanding sympathy for insensitive or cruel treatment she suffers but does little to combat or avoid. The book seems more like a plea for pity than understanding a lot of the time.There are a few uniquely effective instances of metaphor and descriptive writing, but many more that are banal enough to encourage skimming, so whatever points Plath earns for vision are lost for filler.All in all I can't say the book's not interesting, but I can't say I'd recommend it."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I have mixed feelings about this book. I liked the precision of Plath's writing, and parts of the book were excellent. But it is so detatched, and there is so little character development or background story, so I found myself just not caring much for Esther Greenwood (the protagonist), nor really understanding the reasons for her inner torment.There are a few scenes where we get a glimpse of her childhood and some of the issues she had to deal with. But these glimpses are brief and fleeting, and left me wanting much more. For the most part, I found Esther to be remote, self-obsessed, and not very likeable, which left me indifferent to her plight.Mostly, I was frustrated at Esther's unwillingness to cooperate with those who are trying to help or, or her unwillingless to help herself. She wants to wallow in her misery. So wallow she does. And because she feels that everyone else is the cause of her problems, she makes no effort to look inward.If Esther is a thinly disguised Plath, it is no surprise Plath's life ended with suicide. It seems inevitable. Esther is hell-bent on failure, in spite of the best efforts of those around her.I'm glad I read The Bell Jar for the simple reason that it feels like an authentic and honest depiction of a young person's descent into mental illness. Depression affects millions of people. It's an important issue that needs to be explored and understood. And Plath does a fair (but incomplete) job of it. I only wish I liked the Esther more. I found myself not caring very much about her fate. Neither, apparently, did she."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Well first, lets cut to the chase, the book is not as bad as a three star, but not worthy of a four star either. I'd give it a passing grade of 72%. I don't regret reading it and actually found it more and more intriguing as days passed since I finished reading it.The writing style is rough. I don't want to be to critical here as it was Plath's first novel, and when I finish my first, the same may be said of mine. Sometimes the writing is brilliant, sometimes it is cumbersome, but all in all it should not affect the reader too much.Overall, not a great read, but not regrettable. A female version of Catcher In the Rye it is not, but I can see that the 20-something female reader may enjoy it more than any other demograph, identifying with Esther better. After all, we all have been there to some degree and some point in our lives. It is valuable to see how far the mental health care field has progressed since the middle of the 20th century and today. We should all be grateful.For more details, go to aj.huff.org.

The protagonist,Esther Greenwood have numerous similarities to Plath. Reading this heart-breaking novel was a totally unforgettable experience. The book began with narration of Esther,19 and trying to write something in the summer in New York,1950. Esther like Plath was going through a difficult phase with life. She expereinced failures and distress and with unstable mind plus a little this and that lead to mental illness which eventually lead to suicide. Plath depicted the whole situation and events so vividly. Only one been through those thoughts and suffering could relate.Plath wrote it with so much empathy and conscientious. She was crying out for help to her mental unstableness and woe she was going through. Through Esther, she voiced out her feeling, sorrow,emotions and those things going through her mind at that time. Only Plath will know the truth...Since this novel was published a month before her death at 30.Wonder how come no one approach to help her.If at that time she had more love,care and support,maybe there's hope, or maybe not...."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Before Bridget Jones, before Girls Guide, there was The Bell Jar.

Taking it upon myself to see if the book did indeed reveal the mystery of Sylvia Plath's disease (for that is truly what it is), I found it to pleasantly display her feelings during the book's time frame. Between Esther's high's and low's and her continual obsession with the thought of suicide until she finally tries it for herself, and then the eventual downfall of her friend, to the release of her from the confining spaces of the institution and the horror of shock therapy. I have heard many people voice a disatified emotion toward the somewhat abrupt ending of the book. I myself, while looking at the end of Plath's life, could easily see the path that Esther would soon follow. It shows a fantastic look into the unpredictableness of mental illness and describes, in detail the uncomfortableness of being trapped inside the distorting effects that the bell jar can produce upon us.

Therefore, giving it a higher rating would be unappropriate.As a young inspiring author, I enjoyed reading the segment with Sylvia attempting to write a book.I also appreciated her gift of expressing depression. Rather than writing something like, &quot;I felt as if the terrible burden of depression was laid upon me, crushing me whole,&quot; as many authors would do, her experiences through mental angst made the writing genuine. Most writers, do not portray a skewed perception of the victim as Plath did.The Bell Jar is genuine, and that's what makes it impact its readers.All in all, some great writing by Plath, but the novel itself does not compete with the classics. And why should it? She was not a novelist but a poet. I would recommend it, however, as I would any of Plath's poetry."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath begins with Esther's, the main character, internship with a fashion magazine in New York, and then goes back a few years into her college days. It goes on to tell about Esther becoming crazy. It seems that she has an almost perfect life; she had received numerous awards for her writing. However she struggles within herself.

The way Esther is presented is &quot;oh, I'm so sad, but God I get a lot of awards and people really really like me, but oh no! and I'm the smartest person in this entire story and blah blah.&quot; Trust me, I realize that this is extremely realistic and everyone gets sad, but I just wanted a little more from the writer-something jarring.

Dang i still have 5 words left. Benedict Cumberbatch."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"When I began this book I really didn't know what it was about, even though I knew a bit about Sylvia Plath's life. I was very shocked as I read on and found myself completely emotionally involved in Esther's life. It's a very gripping read, and one that I (a 19 year old college student studying english!) identified with muchly.At first it was hard for me to understand Esther's shift from being somewhat &quot;normal&quot; if not a bit apathetic, and suicidal depression. But if you read closely, the answers are there. I think Plath writes in a way that is very straight forward and without excessive emotion. She lets you react to her work without trying to force your ideas in one direction or another. Esther feels she has to kill herself: she gives a few reasons but doesn't try to persuade us that what she's doing is right or noble.She chronicles not only her own descent into depression and madness (which is written wonderfully -- we're as caught up in her own shattered perception as she is) but also the terrible psychological views of the time as well as treatments (lobotomies, electro-shock therapy), the stigma surrounding depression/madness, expectations for women, and the burdening pressure society has on young hopefuls. It's a wonderful story that is what it is and leaves you to make up your own mind. Even if you don't enjoy it or understand it, The Bell Jar is an important step in feminist novels, understanding psychological disorders, and literature itself."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Personally, I could relate to this book in so many ways. I could understand the frustration that Esther felt as she struggled to deal with the pressures of society despite her own feelings of inadequancy. After an attempt of suicide, she is placed in a hospital where she is isolated from the norms of society. While there, she learns that she does indeed have inner strengths and the ability to cope. She emerges from the hospital ready to face the world head on.This book brings even more meaning with the knowledge that the author, Sylvia Plath, dealt with many of the same issues in her own life. It has been speculated that she wrote this book more as an autobiography rather than a work of fiction because of the many similarities. But tragically, rather than gaining courage and strength, Sylvia Plath committed suicide not long after this book was published. It's almost as if this book was her cry for help, a plea that went unanswered."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"This book ranks as one of my top ten favorites.

After I read this book, it took me a while to figure out how much this book affected me. The book may seem strange in the way it is written. The plot seems flat at certain parts or unbelievable, but the reader should keep in mind that this book is based strongly on Sylvia Plath's life. Although not everybody will be affected by the book or will relate, it is definitely an important book to read. If a person really wants to get into the book (look past what's on the pages), I strongly suggest you read more about Sylvia Plath's life and read her poetry.

The way the author takes you into Esthers depression and brings you through each step of the way is just brilliant. Even as a reader, you realized she was in deep and every justified thought was turned around to show just how deep in she was. Its amazing and perfect. If you have ever gone through depression, then this book will amaze you in ways you could never imagine, because things you once couldn't understand or comprehend... you see in the book and suddenly it begins to make a bit more sense. You relate to it - pointing out certain parts saying 'I've been there...' or 'Thats how I feel...' and through to progession of the book, realize just how bad 'there' really is.I love this book to death and I highly recommend it to anyone who is ever remotely interested in it.I won't lie... the beginning was a bit confusing and made you wonder about certain things but by the middle you are caught up inside the book and you will never regret reading it."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"We thought the book was an interesting perspective into the mind of the depressed. It allowed us to see the despair and struggles facing those with mental illness. It followed Esther though the beginnings of her disease though recovery, allowing us to better understand this process. We liked Esther's use of analogies (such as the fig tree) to explain her feelings toward her life and her world. Esther also seemed more than just a character in a book - she felt like a real person to which one could relate. One flaw in this book is how it sometimes jumps from scene to scene, past to present, with little warning, leading to confusion. Some things were also vague and unexplained, such as Esther's insulin shots and other incidents and characters. Overall, this book was an enlightening and educating experience."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Anyone who can fault this work based on entertainment valueAnyone who can fault this work based on entertainment value is a fool.If you are talking to me about pages and events then I can clearly see how you missed the point.

If you are in search of a good read only, then just move on, because, while yes, you will most certainly find it here, but if that is all you are in search of or find, then you already truly missed the boat.This piece of work is the true definition of sharing. This is a person who passed 5 years prior to my birth and I feel as if I know her. Not only is this book well written, but also it is written with her heart and soul.I know that this was a book written to make money, to allow a writer to keep writing. But true to Sylvia's style, it is a deeply personal book that sheds a lot of light on her actual life for the person reading between the lines, or for the person who actually cares.If you are looking to have a better understanding of depression, and how it works, then sign up for a class. If you have to ask if there is a point, then you clearly wouldn't know the difference either way. If you think that reading a lot of books makes you an expert then you are a sad case.This book is about making connection with the person who wrote it. True, you shouldn't feel obligated to like everything that some one writes just because they are a literary genius, but to dismiss it as if it were a Dean Koontz book with a bad plot only shows the lack of depth within your own cranium."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"What else can possibly be said about this book that hasn't already been said since it was published in '63? It's fiercely personal, it's scary as hell, it's laugh-out-loud hilarious. Plath has the ironic first person voice of Esther Greenwood down cold, and her dark sense of humor is what makes this book so much more harrowing. What amazes me most about reading the Bell Jar now in 2002 is how modern it seems. Plath was way, way ahead of her time."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Most exciting book I've read in ages. I have been looking into all the literature of Sylvia Plath, and by reading this auto-biography type story, the veil of all her poetic work lifts up. Also recommended for teenage readers."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Slyvia Plath did something in literature many other lesser writers would kill to do. She used strokes of light and shadow to capture a living archetype in all of its dreadful beauty and fragility - something almost unnameable but close to us in the world within which we live. But she went furthur than that. She saw herself through a glass darkly and within the archetypal she discovered a person. Archetypes are archetypes but persons are an entirely different order and magnitude of being.I have a hard time describing to myself what the actual nature and greatness of \\"The Bell Jar\\" is. It exists in a place where mere mood becomes something objective and transcendent; a place where our words fumble about on the fringes of counciousness to describe a face that is so achingly familiar, lovely, terrifying in the richness of its capacity for self-destruction. Not a whisper is soft enough to capture the delicacy of the portrait of Esther Greenwood. Her cynicism is sad and accurate. When I think of Plath herself peering out through Greenwood's too wise and too hopeless eyes I am reminded that there is a state of being that is neither sane nor insane - it is hyper-sane marked by a terrifying lucidity possessed by only a few people in human history: Jesus Christ, Simone Weil, William Shakespeare, Sylvia Plath herself, of course, in her poems also, such as in the last flower she offered up for our inspection \\"Ariel\\".Plath's lucidity is knowing. She knows herself and she sees something in the world, something that can hardly be spoken but also cannot be refuted.The great American writers of the Twentieth Century are Flannery O'Connor, R. A. Lafferty, William Faulkner, Ralph Ellison, and Sylvia Plath who gave herself to us completely but only for an hour. Only her ghost remains and it will haunt us until the end of time."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Many don't undersatnd why the character of Esther goes crazy but I kind of do. I have been and am still partially in the same place as Esther. I'm not exactly depressed, or crazy, but I do have my moments when I feel useless and better off dead. That is why I loved this book so much. I've always felt very alone in my feelings, and this book proved to me that I am not the only one. That I am not alone. At the same time this book also angered me in the fact that Mrs. Plath leaves us the readers completely hanging at the end. Does she get out? Does she go back to college? Does she ever get married? And what exactly did the doctor fix after her encounter with Irvine (I'm trying not to reveal too much)? Overall, I think everyone should read this book. Whether you feel like the character in the book, or you may know somebody like them, I think this book can inspire more understanding with people. I really don't like using the terms crazy, insanity, or even depression when describing what it is Esther suffers from in the book, because none of the above really describe it. I know, because I feel it too, and none of those terms describe me. At least I don't think so. And now I know there are others out there who feel the same as I do thanks to this book."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Before I began reading &quot;The Bell Jar,&quot; my father warned me: &quot;That's one depressing book.&quot; I pressed on anyway, and in a matter of two days, finished one of the most honest and touching books that I have ever read. I saw myself in Esther Greenwood, a young woman of my age who finds herself nauseated at the increasingly narrowing path down which young women in the 1950's are being led. Her candid observations about sex, her peers, the city, her school, and her family, echoed thoughts that I have often entertained in my own mind. Esther has little interest in being a mother and living in the suburbs--she is not even certain that she wants to be married. It is for her refusal to accept the role that society prescribes to women that she is rendered crazy by her mother, her peers, and her doctors. If Esther Greenwood is indeed crazy, then I wonder about the mental health of myself and many of my friends. I propose that it was not Esther's mind that drove her to attempt suicide--it was a confining society that kept her from feeling free enough to explore her own interests and goals; and being understood by her mother and the other people who loved her. &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; spoke to a generation of women who would come of age in the 1960's, and would help to give them the confidence and the courage to change the world."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Before reading &quot;The Bell Jar,&quot; I read &quot;Ariel,&quot; Plath's collection of poems that really address the climax of her depression with such great poems like &quot;Daddy&quot; and &quot;Lady Lazarus.&quot; But it was only after I read &quot;The Bell Jar,&quot; that I truly appreciated Plath's genius and sophistication as a writer. One of the reasons Plath was such a genius was her command of the English language. &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; does not read like a novel, but more like prose, which made the book a quick read.&quot;The Bell Jar&quot; tells the story of Ester Greenwood, a young woman interning at a woman's magazine in New York City. The reader fully witnesses Ester's decent into depression and her institutionalization in a mental hospital. Like her poetry, &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; is semi - autobiographical and very emotional. Plath also leaves the ending of the novel ambiguous, I do not want to give the ending away but I will say this, do not expect any sort of resolution.All in all, I would recommend this book to Plath fans and those who appreciate a clever, wonderfully written piece of literature."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"The bell jar by the highly acclaimed writer, Sylvia Plath -who is famous for her number of poems- is one of my favourite books. It is a dark and rather disturbing novel; autobiographical to some extent and provides an insight to her and her feelings in a metaphor.You will be empathetic towards the narrator and main character, Esther Greenwood, a young adult who succeeds her way into university in New York. At the beginning, she was ambitious and witty, and like Plath, Esther is an excellent writer. In the summer of her 19 years, she works as a junior magazine editor at her internship and she introduces her friends and many situations that contribute to her final breakdown, as she gradually declines to insanity as she feels being trapped in the bell jar. She is later admitted to a mental institution, where she'll shares her experiences with you. The rest you'll have to find out.The book jumps from time to time where she'll recall past events abruptly, this was quite confusing, but after the first couple times, I got the hang of it. There are some humour in this book that breaks the ice, mainly a bit of dark humour once a while. I thought the ending was rather ironic, as after a month of the book being published, Plath had committed suicide...Plath's poetic language and technique is what makes this novel unique, her ability to describe the details of a situation with similes and put every word together that made it so honest and real. She was able to convey the images and feelings of Esther and lets you in her world to portray mental instability. I also found it hard to separate Esther from the author of the book. This book evoked strong feelings from me when I read it. It is an emotional story and can somewhat be life-altering."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"The BELL JAR is a remarkable autobiographical piece: like the fictional heroine Esther Greenwood, Plath went to New York to work on an internship, and discovered the seamy reality lurking beneath the cocktail parties and the piles of eligible men. She finds herself retreating into despair, frustrated with her own inadequacies, as well as the constricting world around her that forces her to play certain roles - for example, as an eligible partner suitable for a procession of insincere men, or the perpetual virgin keeping herself \\"pure\\" for an ideal marriage partner.THE BELL JAR also struck me as a remarkable comment on contemporary cultures - specifically the recreation of New York mediatic culture so beloved of successful television series like MAD MEN. When we look at the characters in that show, with their slicked-back hair, immaculately pressed suits and frilly dresses, we're transported back into a world which - for the program-makers at least - seems so much more attractive than the grimy reality of contemporary America. Viewers are invited to experience pleasurable nostalgia for a vanished world. Plath reveals the grimy reality lurking beneath that world."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Thought I wouldn't like it but couldn't put it down.

Though, after reading some of the negative reviews here, which admittedly, are few and far between, I almost feel obliged to share my two cents.Okay, so to those of you who've complained about the book not having a plot, let me put a question forward: Does your own life have a plot?Although - as far as I understand it at least - this book is not totally autobiographical, it is closely twined with Sylvia Plath's actual life. This being so, the story isn't going to run along a straight line so that the reader can peripatetically meander down humdrum lane; it's not going to pave a path while mapping every corner or hold your hand while you turn each page. It runs true to how life is, and it does so beautifully. Beyond beautifully. It does so with sincerity, complete candour and devastating insight. This, for me, trumps any book bearing a contrived plotline, regardless even of how magnificent that plot may be.Second, Syliva Plath was severely depressed. If you felt that Esther's character lacked depth because her actions / thought processes made no sense; then frankly, you're a poop head. The whole issue with depression is that it makes no sense. Its effects are not grounded in logic and thus make it impossible to provide \`reasons' or justifications for why Esther felt and lived and acted in the way she did. I can't help but feel that your issue is not with the book itself, but rather, with depression. Maybe, if you did some research into the bleak facts that bed the ground depression flowers from, you'd have enjoyed reading this masterpiece much more. It will indeed allow you to appreciate the complexity of layers that Esther's character possesses. And if it doesn't, well, that's your problem.Finally, aside from The Bell Jar providing for a small slice of English genius; aside from The Bell Jar totally absorbing its reader into the malevolent, chimerical void that it conjures; aside from the fact that it doesn't necessarily have a strictly defined plotline, the Bell Jar posits as a beguiling venture into the spirit of a severely depressed human being. And further to this, it allows its reader to swim in pools filled with the proverbial tears that are shed from all people who experience this crippling, juggernaut of a psychosis. I mean, isn't this what classics are made of? Raw engagement?This really is one of the best books I've ever read; right up there with 1984 (my ultimate favourite). I can't recommend it highly enough. Just read the damned thing."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"What can I say that other reviewers have not?

Her disciplined, careful, quiet and emotional language makes The Bell Jar a masterpiece. It is both disturbing and understated; remarkably so when one considers the subject matter and the fact the this story is autobiographical in nature. Esther is a young woman blessed with talent and intelligence, and the means to exercize them. We gather that her life has been basically happy and satisfing. But privilged young women, perhaps especially privilged young women, are not immune to mental illness. We follow Esther through her increasingly distorted perceptions, which are vivid and accurate descriptions of a depressive's world. The treatments are almost as bad as her illness. But by the end of the novel, Esther is on the mend. Things are looking up; the dark journey Plath takes us on ends with a vision of light. This is made especially tragic as Plath herself committed suicide. Esther got through it, but Sylvia didn't. Anyone who has been lucky enough to never experience a major depressive episode will find a new perspective about mental illness in this book."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"**This contains spoilers**I read this book, finally, after it being recommended as a must-read from several people. We're pretty good about not spoiling books for one another, so I really had no clue what the book was going to be about when I began reading it. I did have a vague feeling it was a feminist book for some reason, but no solid backing on that information. I knew it was considered a classic to some, and those were the general reasons I began reading this book.The book starts off with a somewhat distant teenager / young 20-something living in NYC with various other girls her age who have won a writing contest for a summer internship. While Esther seems like any other distant and socially awkward person, this fact seems to drive her farther and farther away from reality. The book describes her going through some rough happenings in NYC, but nothing that makes the sudden turn she takes from function human being to needing to be committed to an asylum in just a few pages.The insulin therapy and electric shock therapy she receives reminds me of Exley'sA Fan's Notes. I feel that he describes these horrid experiences more realistically, where as Esther seems to be dreaming the whole time. I'm sure the personal demons she was facing were driving her out of touch with reality, as were the treatments, but Plath seems to be keeping something from the reader.I couldn't help shaking the feeling that she was not revealing the whole truth about the situation, which is fine - it's her novel, not mine. But even the way the book ends, with Esther going in to face the asylum's exit committee for her interview and just stops, leaves me feeling unsatisfied as if more could have been said to help the reader understand the issues at hand. The length of the book even seems to be tied in with this as well, being fairly short it seems more could have been discussed with the reader about her life after the interview.I enjoyed this novel more than I did not, but I would not recommend keeping it on that must read list. I just really don't understand what the big deal about this book is."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"A classic isn't a classic because it has reached some measure of perfection on the page, but because it has resonated with more people on a deeper level than most other books. And that is precisely what makes this book burn. It's not that everyone loves it, or that it has a happy ending (it doesn't), but instead, it has a transcendent tangibility about it - it can be universally felt and related to by those who slip between its pages and stay awhile. And feel it, they will.The writing is seamless and smooth; Plath knew how to write. She knew how to get her troubled spirit to materialize long enough to photograph it for the page. The combination is dynamite, a subtle, understated, gut-wrenching explosiveness which leaves a trail of smoke in the reader's psyche far too long; you won't quickly clear your soul of this book."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"The Bell Jar is nicely written, and why it didn't receive unanimous acclaim when first published ia curious, but might be due to the high standards of literature in that era. Interesting as a description of mental decline, the book also incorporates ideas that became familiar only decade or so later: themes such as antipsychiatry, alienation, feminism, existentialism, and psychological self-description. In contrast, the writing style is very classic. Also interesting is that Plath does not, as is often the case, romanticize her adolescent depression--she is not a pining Young Werther with a truer insight or a more engaging personality because of her disorder. It is painful, not an increased source of insight. The plot is well known-a thinly veiled story of then collegiate Sylvia Plath interning at Mademoiselle in New York one summer, and thereafter, her decline. Even at the books' beginning, it is apparent that Esther Greenwood, the Plath character, is injured--we learn more later about reasons. The detached, delicate, actually at times rather funny prose conveys her detachment--a dissociated woman aware, always ironically, of a talent that she now can't exercise, of her declining appearance, of her estrangement from any real relationships. She has an increasingly derealized perception of her world. Parties, meetings, and boyfriends come and go, and she registers all with a documentary self detachment. Assaulted sexually, she does not record the emotional pain, only a growing nehilistic emptiness. She goes through the motions, with boredom or disdain and as the internship progresses, so does her dissociated disdain. She tolerates then rejects her once worshipped boyfriend at Yale, now seen as dull and insufferable--as are many of the men (excpet her dead father), and, indeed, most of the women. After her internship, she is rejected for a writing workshop and this hastens her decline. Her mistrust and perplexity broaden--the patriarachal medical establishment, the world of wealth and privelege, the peculiartieis of other patients, her erstwhile friends. Her present self regardsg her former self as another person. Yet even while in an asylum and confused, the implacable narrative style continues. Plath, to her credit, was, in this book, extending the language of self-described deterioration. Her state is enhanced by the writing style-in the conventional or classic literary style of a more talented or sensitive soul observing a debased, insensitive world in which she only a marginal participant, and superior to--the world of wealth and entitlement, of elite schools, of libidinous peers, of fatuous authority figures, and smallminded neighbors. That this is a coming of age book for females has often been cited, and this style of perception is seen in many of those types of books--the young sensitive antihero who doesn't quite fit in, is romantically depressed, and has a finer vision. I thought the best part of the book is its literary qualities: its description, exactitude, and even wit--and the sense that Esther really is a pleasant and humble person underneath. Her devotion to writerly values is evident in the plot-the hastening of her decline after rejection from a writing workship, and the presence of the one true, uncriticized heroine, and older wealthy woman writer. Damon LaBarbera, Ph.D"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"[3.6/5.0]Esther is an extraordinarily gifted girl. Pretty, intelligent, and talented, she has qualities and accomplishments anyone would be proud of, anyone, that is, except her. This novel is about Esther's (and Plath's) descent into a deep, dark depression that is likened to being trapped in a bell jar that separates her from the rest of humanity and from living a normal, happy life.Esther is a bright overachiever who made straight A's her whole life and received a full academic scholarship to college. Because of her intelligence and writing ability she is invited, with 11 other girls, to be a guest editor for a popular fashion magazine for a month. The girls are treated lavishly and get to live an opulent lifestyle only a privileged few get to enjoy. Having lived in poverty her whole life, she should be delighted at being elevated to such elegant and lavish living, in the heart of New York City no less, but she is unable to enjoy her new position. In the book Esther says \\"I felt very still and very empty, the way the eye of a tornado must feel, moving dully along in the middle of the surrounding hullabaloo.\\" The hullabaloo being New York City, boisterous and lively, the eye of the tornado is her, empty and lonely.During her paid internship Esther becomes very critical of herself, which is typical of depressed people. With all of her accomplishments, she acutely notices only her and other people's faults.This novel is also a commentary on conventional society. Esther wants to be a poet, writer and a professor and feels stifled by the domestic role women are supposed to play during the 1950s. She finds it hypocritical how women are supposed to be pure while men sleep with as many women as they desire.The first half of the book is sort of fun, but there are signs of her deteriorating mental state. The second half of the book deals almost exclusively with her mental illness and her descent into a dark, frightening world. When she returns to her mundane home after her internship the bell jar quickly descends over her, suffocating and trapping her. Cutting all social ties and future plans, Esther gives in to her overwhelming despair. Experiencing insomnia, an inability to read or write, and extreme depression, she decides suicide is her only option. After numerous suicide attempts Esther ends up in an asylum, which ultimately saves her life and returns her to a state of normalcy.After a while I started to dislike Esther because she is selfish, cruel, and extraordinarily judgmental; but I guess she perceives the world around her \\"through the distorting lens of a bell jar,\\" and it's very difficult to have a positive view of humanity when you are completely miserable. Only towards the end of the book does she begin to view the world positively and the bell jar is lifted, however temporarily that may be, since in reality Sylvia Plath tragically killed herself at the young age of 30.The reason I gave this book 3.6 stars is because, although it is well written and poetic, I feel like Plath was holding back her talent. Later, when Plath was talking about her mental illness, shock treatments, and her experience at the asylum, she said they were \\"A time of darkness, despair, disillusion--so black only as the inferno of the human mind can be--symbolic death, and numb shock--then the painful agony of slow rebirth and psychic regeneration.\\" Only very rarely, if at all, do you find any writing as beautiful and complex as that in the book. I read the above line 4 times to let its beauty and meaning sink in and only a few times in the book did I reread anything because the sentence was deep, aesthetic and complex. Another thing that bothered me was that Plath rarely described her own subjective suffering. The book was mainly just her opinions of other people, descriptions of the environment around her and her superficial reactions to events that occur. I didn't feel like Plath dove deep enough into her agonizing internal suffering. One thing one must keep in mind is, when writing an autobiography the author is constrained by the events that occur in one's life, where as in a completely fictitious story, like the last book I reviewed, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, the author can create all sorts of interesting and fantastic scenarios, which really bring a story to life. I think that is one of the reasons why I grew bored and impatient with the book at times."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"This book is great. It is so nice to see a book written in this time period, about the time period. The sad story in this book gave great insight into the treatment of women, both in normal society and in mental institutions. It painted a clear picture of what was typical of women at this time, such as typical schooling, dating and sexuality in relationships, and \\"normal\\" behavior.As someone interested in entering the mental health field, it really shows the changes that have been made to the health care system and how some people were stuck in the system based on their lack of funds and availability of skilled and caring doctors."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"After hearing so much about how good this book is I decided to buy it and read it for myself. The story follows a young college aged female who was very successful (the character had won writing awards and one big one that allowed for her to go to New York) into the confusion of a nervous breakdown. The breakdown documented what happens in the 50's so there is also alot of contrast with how women were supposed to be with how she wanted to be. Sylvia Plaths character Esther Greenwood often is flummoxed about how to go about living her own life within this stiffling atmosphere. She is close to finishing college and is wondering her lifes path. Some of the stiffling issues that aggravated her nervous breakdown had to do with 'not being pinned under the thumb of a man,' ie, having kids was often a way to kill ones career, public life and academically pursuits. Eventually she goes through treatment and sorts through it. There is also a weird 'having sex for the first time' incident that goes on and describes how closeted homosexual and homosexual tendencies were then. The work is semi-autobiographical and follows the authors life very closely. I also didn't expect it to be funny, especially in the beginning and towards the middle and end it tapared into a wry humor that I liked! Very good and interesting book."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I am not a mental health professional, and I claim no expertise in that field. I know this book speaks to many people about gender issues, and I'm sorry to give that short shrift, but I read this book from the standpoint of somebody who's had a person close to me commit suicide. It has been a while since I thought about this book, but I saw a friend's Goodreads review recently, and just coincidentally the Human Resources dept where I work has lately been active addressing suicide prevention. I can't help wondering what this book says about the experience of depression. That statement may be simplistic; depression may not be a single entity, but a constellation of different conditions with similar symptoms. I've read some distinctions between \\"psychological\\" and \\"biochemical\\" depression. The biochemical category makes sense, but the more I read about \\"psychological\\" depression, the harder it is to believe anybody really knows what is meant by that term. Maybe it just represents forms of biochemical depression that haven't been elucidated yet. Maybe what seems like a \\"psychological\\" component is just incidental. Legitimate grieving or life stressors may lower the threshold for biological depressions to declare themselves, but may not actually cause depression. From my lay perspective, this seems to make intuitive sense, because we read about people like Anne Frank or Loung Ung, who faced horrible and prolonged psychological assaults, but did not seem to be clinically depressed. I presume it's because they had no biochemical disposition towards depression. If Anne Frank isn't a case against the existance of psychological depression, I don't know who is.One form of biologic depression involves insufficient Serotonin. That's a neurotransmitter, a chemical responsible for signal transmission in the brain. Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors like Prozac or Zoloft treat depression by increasing the concentration of Serotonin at brain nerve endings. Plath's metaphor for her depression as a bell jar makes perfect sense in this context. She compares her life experience to the rarified atmosphere under the sealed glass dome of a vacuum pump. It seems like she was trying to tell us that her depression wasn't situational at all, it was a perception of some kind of insufficiency. I have to believe this distinction was important to her. After all, the title of the book is \\"The Bell Jar\\", not some reference to any of the situational stressors in her life. As I look at the suicide prevention materials from work, it bothers me that there is no mention of this anywhere. I'm sure what is listed here has some merit: risk factors, warning signs, recommendations, etc. But there's nothing here about comparisons to suffocation, or a vague sense of smothering or insufficiency. I wonder whether anybody has ever investigated that as a warning sign or risk factor for suicide."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I love books about psychiatric hospitals or mental illness. Sadly, this book was very dry and just a very slow read. I found myself having to force myself through the book."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"It is an odd adverb to choose when talking about mental illness: beautifully. But one of the things that makes a fiction piece beautiful is its showing ugliness while still touching the heart. It makes you say yes, this is true. It brings both ache and a sigh. That is beauty.This is an excellent book that captures the downward spiral of mental illness at a genius level. It is so odd that Plath initially published this book under another name because she was not proud of it. But I guess that is understandable since she suffered from mental illness herself."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I put off reading The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath first because everyone in college had read it and it just seemed cliche. Then I put it off because I was worried it would scare me with all the craziness inside. It's not scary, but perhaps in the mundane and normal way she is insane it is more scary than if she was a true nut. Because that means I could be just like her.The writing is beautiful, simply beautiful. Such normality made into such vivid imagery. The change in Esther is so gradual and yet so prominent. It begins with moments of silence and then strange sounds. It becomes utter calm almost to the point of lethargy. Then she just gives in to the fact that the world is monotonous and she doesn't want to deal with that.Some of my favorite lines from the book:\\"Every so often a beam of light appeared out of thin air, traversed the wall like a ghostly, exploratory finger, and slid off into nothing again.\\"\\"It dazzled and danced with light like a heavenly ice cube.\\"\\"Wrapping my black coat round me like my own sweet shadow, I unscrewed the bottle of pills and started taking them swiftly, between gulps of water, one by one by one.\\""},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"The Bell Jar, written by the late Sylvia Plath, is like an unstoppable ride on the tracks of depression; the momentum is building up so quickly, so even if one wanted to jump off the tracks, it is too late. The only way out was suicide.Sylvia Plath wanted to become a writer. Her first job was for a magazine in New York; she chronicles her experiences in her novel. Although she wrote in a pen name, everyone in the literary community knew The Bell Jar was her novel. She had literary success for her poetry. And her husband was another writer; but he was an errant husband and jealous of his wife's success.She wanted desperately to have The Bell Jar published. Publishers were critical of her manuscript, saying it was infantile and not literary. They felt it was more of a memoir than of a piece of literature. She had been in and out of psychiatric hospitals, and had electric shock therapy.She and her mother had a strained relationship. Her father died when she was young, and she missed him and mourned her loss. Her mother did not want the manuscript to be published, as she thought Sylvia had made hurtful statements about people who tried to help her; but Sylvia was too far gone into her deep depression.So basically it is a chronical of her fictional character's feelings and experiences masking her own life. Although I normally do not like a stream of consciousness style of writing, her lapses of memory, problems with transitional elements or inability to continue with a thought provides the reader with the insight into the mind of a tortured soul.In the book she attempts, but does not commit suicide. But the audience is told that she becomes a professor of literature in England. She was already divorced and taking care of two children. I forget the name of a famous writer's home in which she resided in England, but she had chronic sinusitus living in a dank house.The day of her death she made toast with butter and tea and placed it in the children's room. She opened their windows, then taped the bedroom door shut. She went to the kitchen and turned on the gas. The children were saved, although I heard recently that one of her sons committed suicide.Her husband had the rights to her manuscript. He was trying to honor the wishes of his mother-in-law. However, boot-leg copies were already being passed along, some reaching the States. A savy publishing company was able to gain rights and start publishing immediately.The movie made with Gwyneth Paltrow and Daniel Craig was pretty close to the book. Obviously this is not a fun book. But if one is in the field of psychology or interested in stepping into the mind of someone else, then this novel is worth reading. Some people compared the works of J.D. Salinger to those of Sylvia Plath. I would recommend reading the novel due to it's controversial content and make your own opinion about the novel."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I simply wanted to add to all these great book reviews, that the voice of Maggie Gylenhall is absolutely perfect for this audiobook, and that it makes it all the more enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Although I can't remember how long ago, I have read The Bell Jar before. Upon re-reading, I was surprised that I remembered absolutely nothing about it -- literally, not even the first thing. Anyway, it's good, although it's hard to separate the book on its own merits from the knowledge that it ultimately functions as a prologue to the tragedy of Plath's real life. Plath was, at heart, more of a poet than a novelist, which is evident often enough in her prose. Her descriptions are lovely - and yes, at times, even poetic - and always minutely observed. She is also a sharp observer of human nature, the essence of which she can portray with a minimum of words. Buddy Willard only requires a page or two before you understand just what he is, and the same can be said for many of the characters in the book. Buddy, with his conventional outlook, is part of the cause for the narrator's malaise, as she tries to figure out what she wants to be in the world, and opposes that to what the world wants her to be. Plath's book ends by offering us the chance to imagine a hopeful reconciliation for those possibilities. We take it, of course, and for a while in her life it appears that she did too, accomplishing what she wanted to be in the world, as well as a part of what the world wanted her to be. It didn't \\"stick\\" though, and if you don't know what happened next, you might want to pick up a biography when you put down The Bell Jar."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I've never been good with my words, so I will try my best to review it. The Bell Jar gave me a familar feeling when reading it. We follow Esther's slow decent into insanity, and we feel for her as we helplessly tell her that everything is going to be okay. I love that the book ends bitter sweet, that it's not a feel-good ending but it does wring out whatever hope the book may have possessed (which isn't much). Whether it was Plath's memoir or not, the fact remains that we see a tortured artists' view point onto what the world really looked like to her, through Esther. I will never get rid of this book."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"A poetically written account of a young women's decent into depression and psychosis and her journey through rehabilitation and self actualization. Not nearly as dark as it sounds..."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I expected The Bell Jar to be much more depressing than it turned out to be. Esther has won a short story contest the prize for which is a month in New York as a guest editor on a popular ladies' magazine. While in New York, Esther begins to feel the lethargy of depression creep in and feels that she is squandering her wonderful opportunity by just wanting to escape. When Esther returns home, she falls deeper into depression until a suicide attempt lands her in a hospital.Ester is also quite a burgeoning feminist. She bemoans the possibility of ending up tethered to a man and having her personality subsumed by him. Page 69: \\"And I knew that in spite of all the roses and kisses and restaurant dinners a man showered on a woman before he married her, what he secretly wanted when the wedding service ended was for her to flatten out underneath his feet like Mrs. Willard's kitchen mat.\\"I would have appreciated a deeper understanding of the root causes of Esther's depression. It seems she skims over the surface of her experiences, telling about events and feelings, without ever illuminating us as to the underlying issues. According to the end notes, Plath's mother wanted to prevent the book's publication in the states. Apparently some of the characterizations were quite thinly veiled, and Mrs. Plath was concerned that people would take offense. This might explain why Sylvia chose not to go deeper.Also according to the end notes, at the time of her suicide, Plath was working on a second novel based on her experiences since being discharged from the hospital. I would very much like to have been able to read this book. According to Wikipedia, though Plath's husband, Ted Hughes has some manuscripts and journals that were not to be published until 2013. Hopefully, these works will then be published."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Very enjoyable read. I could picture one of my aunts being in college with the main character in the book. Very accurate description of the way I remember things from the time."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"My family read this book together so we could discuss it, and after having read it, our feelings were mixed.Mom found this book utterly boring. She said she could not empathize with the main character, and didn't care what happened to her.Dad enjoyed the imagery, and said he would like to read some of her poetry. He also enjoyed her observations, which were at times witty and clever. But he felt the book was lacking.Then there's me. I really enjoyed The Bell Jar, finding it to be a real page-turner, even if not the greatest book I have ever read. After reading the biography in the back of the book, I have to think that Esther Greenwood and Sylvia Plath are one and the same.One interesting point of The Bell Jar is that it can be interpreted in many ways, but one doesn't have to TRY to interpret it in order to understand and enjoy the story. That is, it can be read on many levels.The content of this book is at times shocking, so I would steer the very faint of heart and children away. It's a good, easy read, and it paints a picture similar to Girl, Interrupted or One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. If you like a good, psychological study, you might want to read The Bell Jar. I also suggest The Bell Jar to a book discussion group, as there is plenty to talk about as the story moves along."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Sylvia Plath was one of the most gifted young poets of her generation. ARIEL, by far her finest work, was completed just days before she committed suicide in 1963 at the age of thirty.More widely read is her novel THE BELL JAR, written between 1958 and 1962, and published only six weeks before her death. Less a novel than a thinly fictionalized memoir of her first suicide attempt at age twenty, THE BELL JAR has become a feminist manifesto supposedly chronicling the frustrated hopes of a young woman held a virtual prisoner by an uncaring society.Plath's posthumous adoption by the feminist movement largely obscured the fineness of her writing and the truth about her life. As her daughter, Frieda Rebecca Hughes has acidly observed, Plath became a \\"suicide doll\\" for an intellectual movement seeking real-life martyrs. This turn of circumstance has long frustrated readers and critics who wish to assess Plath on her own terms.It is clear from a close reading of THE BELL JAR that Sylvia Plath was a complex, brilliant, unbalanced, creative and ultimately self-destructive person. On the one hand it is tragic that Plath ended her life before antidepressant drug therapies came into use, possibly regulating her lifelong history of extreme mood swings; on the other, medications may have subdued the brilliance and passion that underlie this book and the ARIEL poems.As THE BELL JAR begins we find young \\"Esther Greenwood\\" spending a summer in New York City as a student \\"guest editor\\" at a major women's magazine.Plath spares no effort in underlining the fact that this experience, with its exposure to the broad but not always genteel cultural and social mileu that is New York City horrifies Esther, an overprotected suburban girl to the tips of her well-shined saddle shoes. What another girl might find exotic or exciting about New York, Esther finds utterly repugnant.Her innocence leads her into several unpleasant encounters with men, and several scathing confrontations with the other girls in her group as well as the editor of the magazine, Jay Cee, whose pointed comments are almost uniformly unkind.Plath admittedly caricatured and lampooned real people throughout THE BELL JAR, cruelly and so much so that she published it under a pseudonym, \\"Victoria Lucas\\" in Britain, and felt that it should never be published in the United States. Her mother, with whom she had a symbiotic and mutually supportive relationship, appears in THE BELL JAR as a thick-headed ogre, largely blind to Esther's travails.Esther herself is a supremely gifted but supremely self-involved person whose constant internal dialogue effectively blots out much of the world around her. She is far less sensitive to the wants and needs of others than to her own feelings, of which even the most transitory or irrational are paramount. If Plath's Esther is a caricature, then she was the most cruel of all to herself. If Esther is an honest portrait, then Plath presents herself as a temperamental overachiever and a person who neither liked others nor was particularly likeable, at least at age twenty.Esther is like many depressed young people. She is unable to see any way out of her immediate unhappiness other than killing herself. Her contemplation of self-destruction, the actual attempt, and her long, slow painful recovery are recounted in searingly sad detail. The writing is simple but poignant.Throughout the book Sylvia Plath/Esther Greenwood laments that she is heremetically sealed within a bell jar, unable to have meaningful contact with life. Esther freely admits her terror of choices. To choose one path is to allow all the roads not taken to darken forever.These are thoughts that pass through every young mind, but they have rarely been committed to paper so well. GIRL, INTERRUPTED by Susanna Kaysen (which very coincidentally takes place in roughly the same era and in the same private psychiatric hospital) is but a pale shadow of THE BELL JAR.Dredging all this pain and reexamining this time in her life may not have been the best personal choice for Sylvia Plath, whose bell jar did descend again, and with finality. Plath fell into a deep depression during the writing of THE BELL JAR. Her personal life collapsed. She became increasingly isolated from those around her, even while she wrote the poems of ARIEL in a white heat, sometimes at the rate of two a day. She finally succeeded in taking her own life on February 11, 1963."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Walking In Her Shoes - A Review of \\"The Bell Jar\\" by Sylvia PlathThe fact that I read and review so many books is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, people often assume I am more knowledgeable about literature of all kinds than I really am. So, I am often greeted with, \\"You surely must have read \`Bel Ami' by Guy De Mauppasant!\\" Then, I have to mumble words of apology for my Neanderthal lack of sophistication and admit to not even having heard of the book! On the other hand, I get to add \\"Bel Ami\\" to my list of books to read!It was just such an interchange about books-worth-reading that led to my decision to pick up a copy of Sylvia Plath's, \\"The Bell Jar,\\" from a used book table in Greenwich Village. I was vaguely aware of Plath and her tragic life, but did not know many details of her story and her one novel. She lived part of her life just around the corner from the location of my office in the town of Wellesley, so I felt a geographic connection to the author and to her overtly autobiographical novel about a young woman's descent into madness and despair.I felt another connection, as well. She recounts in vivid detail her experience, as a young woman, of undergoing electroshock and insulin shock treatments - the treatments of choice in the 50's for those experiencing a \\"nervous breakdown.\\" As a child, one of my favorite people in the world was a great aunt who had endured the same kind of mental roller coaster ride that Plath narrates so hauntingly. \\"Dedda,\\" as she was know within the extended family, lived a life in many ways in parallel with that of Plath and her fictional alter ego, Esther Greenwood. As a young woman, she suffered a nervous breakdown, attempted suicide, was hospitalized, and underwent a series of debilitating shock treatments.Reading Plath's plangent account of Esther's journey through hell allowed me to feel that I was in some manner walking in Dedda's shoes. She has been gone for almost twenty years, but I think of her fondly every day. And I think of her fondly because of a significant difference between the path that she walked and the one that Plath ultimately chose to follow. Rather than succumbing to a despair that would lead to a successful suicide attempt, Dedda turned her experience with brokenness into a driving passion to reach out with compassionn and love to other broken souls. The second half of her life was a frenetic sprint to touch as many lives as possible - often sacrificing sleep and a normal schedule in order to find enough time to visit the sick, bereaved, distraught, unhinged and institutionalized. She became my role model for networking. But, I digress. More about Dedda and her remarkable life another time. . .One of the themes that jumped out at me from the pages of Plath's novel was the all-encompassing sense of strangulation that Plath felt as a young women growing up in an era and a culture that delimited the roles that a woman was expected and allowed to assume. She despaired of becoming someone's wife and mother - only to place within the suffocating isolation of a bell jar her brain and her career aspirations.\\"I tried to imagine what it would be like if Constantin were my husband. It would mean getting up at seven and cooking him eggs and bacon and toast and coffee and dawdling about in my nightgown and curlers after he'd left for work to wash up the dirty plates and make the bed, and then when he came home after a lively, fascinating day he'd expect a big dinner, and I'd spend the evening washing up even more dirty plates till I fell into bed, utterly exhausted.This seemed a dreary and wasted life for a girl with fifteen years of straight A's, but I knew that's what marriage was like, because cook and clean and wash was just what Buddy Willard's mother did from morning till night, and she was the wife of a university professor and had been a private school teacher herself.\\" (Pages 68-69)Stylistically, Plath chose to write the first paragraph above as a single, run-on sentence - emblematic of her feeling that she envisioned that such an existence would be nothing less than a life sentence of cruel and unusual punishment.I am not sure, as a white male, I will ever be able fully to appreciate the frustration of what it must be like to have one's choices in life narrowly delimited by one's gender or skin color, but Plath's claustrophobic \\"Bell Jar\\" takes me a few more steps down that path towards understanding. For that reason alone, this is a book worth reading, reflecting upon and sharing with others.Al"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"The TunnelThe phrase, \\"there is always a light at the end of the tunnel\\" is not always true. For some, the tunnel only continually grows darker. This reflects in Sylvia Plaths work. Her novel, The Bell Jar, brings readers through the mental breakdown of protagonist, Esther Greenwood. Unlike other classics such as One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest and The Catcher in the Rye, Plath establishes a much more in depth look at the psyche and what happens when it collapses.Esther Greenwood, a writer temporarily living in New York, moves back home where she gradually starts to lose mental stability. Finally, she sees a psychiatrist. He recommends Esther \\"should have some shock treatments at his private hospital\\" (135). After several attempted suicides, one almost fatal, Esther goes to a different hospital where she slowly recovers with insulin and more shock treatments. After the suicide of her friend, Esther slowly begins the return to her previous life.The story is given more substance and reality once one takes a look at the author. Sylvia Plath admittedly based most of the book on her own experience with mental disorder. To conceal this, the book was originally published under the pen name of Victoria Lucas. However, one can perceive the obvious reflections to her life present within the novel. While she spent six months hospitalized, so did Esther. Sylvia also went through several shock treatments like Esther. However, while Esther's attempts to kill herself failed, Sylvia took her life in 1963.Overall, the novel is extremely effective in its purpose. Plath skillfully employs point of view to portray Esther as a relatable character, includes potent sentences to contribute to different themes, and uses her writing style to illustrate mental instability. The story, from a first person perspective, lends a more personal feeling to the work and helps the reader identify with the protagonist. Plath also has a knack for including powerful ideas within short lines, \\"I would rather have anything wrong with my body than something wrong with my head\\" (182) and \\"To the person in the bell jar...the world itself is the bad dream\\" (237). She also uses several situations to reveal other important topics, such as religion when Esther explains how \\"what each person believed, happened to him when he died\\" (202). Relationship issues also arise, \\"I didn't know who would marry me now that I'd been where I had been\\" (241). Plath also breaks up her chapters. She often jumps from one topic to the next without any major transition. At times, days, and sometimes months will have gone by in the span of two lines. This ambiguity to Plath's writing provides the book with purposeful inconsistency which aids in the understanding of Esther's disorder.Perhaps it is because of this writing style that the book is considered a classic. It also shares many of the same qualities with other classics such as One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and The Catcher in the Rye. However, The Bell Jar encapsulates the idea behind both books, and holds everything they lack. The dissatisfied, young Caulfield holds many of the same qualities that the confused, depressed Esther does. Holden's desire for purity in the world echoes in lines like \\"The longer I lay there in the clear hot water the purer I felt\\" (20). Although, what Salinger leaves to the assumption of the reader about depression, Plath states directly, \\"That morning I had tried to hang myself\\" (158). This straight forwardness conveys her message in a much stronger way. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest's inclusion of insanity becoming reality also mirrors Plath's work. However, Esther as a slightly more sane character than Chief Bromden-the narrator of Cuckoo's Nest- shows readers that anyone can succumb to the hardships of mental sickness.Sylvia Plath is an excellent author who utilizes her style to its fullest potential to produce an amazing novel about the struggle with depression and \\"the bell jar\\" (186). Similar to other literary classics, Plath uses her protagonist to evoke emotion and portray humanity, showing that good literature sometimes lies in the darkened end of a tunnel."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I actually listened to this book as an unabridged book on tape. I had severe reservations about listening to/reading it--I had a manic episode several years ago that rates high among my most painful and embarrassing moments. I thought this book would be too close for comfort and that I would relive some of the most miserable experiences of my life by learning about Syliva Plath's nervous breakdown. The exact opposite happened: I felt self-compassion instead of self-censure. Sylvia describes so accurately what it's like to have a break from reality, to lose self-control, and to descend into madness--while not even knowing what's going on. Esther (Sylvia Plath's autobiographical narrator) also becomes increasingly self-absorbed, one of the hallmarks of a manic episode.One of the worst things about manic-depressive disorder/temporary insanity is that people who don't know much about the disease might assume that an afflicted person is always like what s/he is like when ill and take things at face value--fortunately, this couldn't be further from the truth, and most of us who are susceptible to the disease are very different types of people when we are healthy.I can relate to Sylvia's feeling of being dogged by her breakdown and her need to put it in perspective. It's said that Sylvia wrote \\"The Bell Jar\\" in order to get beyond her breakdown so she could concentrate on her poetry.The Bell Jar distorts perceptions, impairs judgment, disrupts relationships, and looms threateningly over the heads of those in remission--\\"will the bell jar come down upon my head again?\\" Unfortunately for Sylvia, it did. However, her book can inspire compassion for the mentally ill and show how even a gifted young student (who seemed to have the world by the tail) can be vulnerable to this illness--no one can assume s/he is immune to mental illness and/or temporary insanity.NAMI (The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill) reminds us to love the person, hate the disease."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I recently asked my wife to create a list of the ten most important novels she has ever read; \\"The Bell Jar\\" was on her list. I have spent the past two days reading Plath's novel and I come away from the book feeling vulnerable. Plath has created a work that immerses the reader in a dark world in which mental stability is not a given. I feel a new closeness to Plath for the struggle that was her life and for the power and urge that let her transform that into art. She has ceased to be a \\"suicide victim\\" in my mind and has, instead, become a human being.I was initially surprised by the voice of the narrator. It reminded me of Holden Caulfield -- honest, down-to-earth, knowledgeable, caustic. I found Esther immediately likeable and a sympathetic character. Reading like a diary at times, the story tells about simple events (a cab ride, a party, a visit from a boyfriend) told in simple language that frequently shines with such exquisite phrasing that I was forced to step back and laugh or smile or just appreciate Plath's ability to use language in such powerful and meaningful ways. Two examples of this:1. Referring to a picture of Dwight Eisenhower in \\"Time\\" magazine, Plath writes: \\"The face of Eisenhower beamed up at me, bold and blank as the face of a fetus in a bottle.\\" (72)2. \\"I felt limp and betrayed, like the skin shed by a terrible animal. It was a relief to be free of the animal, but it seemed to have taken my spirit with it, and everything else it could lay its paws on.\\" (83)Language and technique made the sad events of the novel seem real and immediate. Plath selects events in a masterful way, telling stories of simple conversations, giving brief insights into the narrator's mind, exposing fears, illustrating pathologies, foreshadowing events.The horror of the initial suicide attempt stayed with me throughout the rest of the novel. The second half that outlines her relationships with doctors and her stays in psychiatric institutions is dreamlike. We abruptly find ourselves in new surroundings, in the middle of conversations. This discontinuity creates a world that mimics Esther's increasingly nightmarish life. As readers we do not calmly watch from a distance; we are thrown into the consciousness of the patient.\\"The Bell Jar\\" was a disturbing book, but one that expanded my understanding of Plath and her work and gave me a perspective on mental illness that I had previously lacked."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"(I'm writing this review years after first reading TBJ, and am not quite as worked up as I was years ago.)Unlike many other readers of Sylvia Plath, I read The Bell Jar as part of a class assignment in grade 12, discovering her prose before her poetry. My first impression of Plath's only novel was one of awe. It's simple style and detached narration make it memorable in that it doesn't muddle the subject matter with melodramatic statements or situations.Sylvia Plath writes of her descent into insanity with such coolness and ease, that it is utterly difficult to see where she actually feels the Bell Jar starting to close in on her. Herein, Plath deftly blurs the line between reality and madness.Anyone who is interested in a classic story, one that is touching and poignant, read The Bell Jar. No other novel I have read so well explicates the human condition as this one does. Wow."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Sylvia Plath's timeless novel The Bell Jar has without a doubt exceeded my high expectations. Her writing is nothing short of beautifully detailed, incredibly creative and downright genius. She, unlike other authors has the ability to keep her readers in such a way that to abandon the book is virtually impossible. Her novel is as smooth and effortless as her poetry. The heartbreaking story tells about the year she tried to kill herself and the inescapable feelings that haunted her, feelings of being trapped and alone - as if in a bell jar. My criticisms for Plath are little to none. The book is at times excruciatingly painful to read, the ideas that went on in Esther Greenwood's head are explained beautifully but are also about death and feeling suffocated, trapped and isolated - they are about sheer depression and the end of her innocence. It is hard to read the chunks in the book when the people that love her make desperately vain efforts to save Esther. And although the book's plot can at times be hard to digest, the writing is so fantastic that it is well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"If you like great writing, you'll like this book.

Maybe it's more of a girl thing or maybe you have to have experienced a little bit of depression on your life. This is one of my favorite books and I think that the imagery is beautiful and fully worthy of a poet. Considering this book is written in the first person it would be unrealistic for Esther to comment on herself. Readers are supposed to understand her character based on the way she sees the world. This is a certain style of writing that not everyone will enjoy, but it was very much in fashion in this time period. Showing, not telling, as many english teachers put it.As far as Esther not accepting help, well what help was offered? Her mother's urging to become a secretary? It doesn't seem unrealistic that an educated young woman would want something more and yet not know to get it, particuarly in this time period. For example my own mother grew up in the same era and has told me that the only obvious career paths for an educated woman were a teacher or a nurse. My mother obtained a masters degree in english, but was not encouraged to pursue a PHd or any career other than a teacher. This book is about a woman who wants something more, but isn't sure what that is, in a society that does not offer many options. That is the key to understanding this book and the reason that it might be difficult to understand through the lens of modern times.The thing that I find the most saddening about this book is that after Ms. Plath made a recovery from an earlier episode of depression, presumably like the one in this book, she went on to experience another episode that resulted in her suicide. Esther makes such an inspiring recovery that it is very sad to realize what happens to Ms. Plath."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I am 42 years old and have just read The Bell Jar for the first time. This is the story of a young woman in the 50's who did not fit the mold of what society at that time dictated that a woman should be. She could not accept this, and in the beginning, it was hard to feel sorry for her because it seemed she gave up too easily. She wanted to be a writer, she didn't get into the writing class, and instead of taking some other course and trying the writing course again later, she gave up and slipped into depression. Esther's character was starkly contrasted by the other successful women characters. There were women doctors, women psychiatrists, women editors. Surely these characters also had gone up against the same pressures and societal dictate that Esther experienced. Yet they overcame their obstacles whereas Esther succumbed to defeat. The book was fascinating and every well written. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"&quot;The Bell Jar&quot; is definatly one of the most impressive books I have ever read. Sylvia Plath talks about how she gets depressed and eventually tries to kill herself. This book is bound to leave it's mark on you, and it is definatly recommended for anybody who liked &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot; by Susan Kaufman; &quot;I Never Promised you a Rose Garden&quot; by Joanna Martin(?), &quot;Lisa, Bright and Dark&quot;, and Sylvia Plath fans. The story starts in New York City, where we meet Esther (Sylvia Plath). Esther has been chosen by a magazine to work for a month at the magazine to learn about writing. Esther has &quot;adventures&quot; in New York, and after her month with the magazine is up, she returns home. There she learns that she has been rejected by a university for a writing course that she wanted to take, and she doesn't know what to do with herself. It is here that she realizes that there is something wrong with her, and many other events unfurl, such as her visits to a psychiatrist that performs shock-treatment on her incorrectly, until finally she overdoses on sleeping pills. After this she ends up in a mental institution, and she finally &quot;gets better&quot;. Towards the end of the book, she says that she hopes that the bell-jar of despair does not fall over her again. The sad thing is, that it did fall over her and that is how she died. This book is incredible, and there is nothing bad to say about it. Sylvia Plath is a great writer, especially because she speaks from experience. I highly recommend this book to anybody who is considering buying it."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I picked up this book purely out of curiosity. I wanted to see how someone with mental illness was able to construct such a well-known novel and in the end found that I was deeply impressed with the skill of Plath's writing. She is very talented in her use of words and I found the book engaging to read.I assume (because I have never ready any other book like this) that it's a rare thing for a book to capture a glimpse into the thoughts of someone that is mentally ill. I was expecting a fragmented and disjointed writing and was surprised that many of her experiences and thoughts were reminiscent of other women at a post-college age--perhaps, to an extent, even my own. Thoughts of inadequacy, self-doubt, and direction-less-ness often plague young adults and Ester showed all of the symptoms that coincide with \\"growing up.\\" Of course her problems run much deeper. Caused by something that I cannot figure out and that society is still looking for answers on. Plath's real life story is a tragic one and you can only hope that books like this can help society find the answer to lifting the bell jar.All in all I liked this book. I found there is a theme to the books that I enjoy most--female heroine and time period setting. Like Francie Nolan growing up during the depression (A Tree Grows in Brooklyn), Cal Stephhanides with the riots of Detroit (Middlesex), I very much enjoyed reading about the experiences and thoughts of Ester Greenwood in mid-1950s New England.The forward of this book mentioned that 80% of female poets suffer from mental illness. I was astounded by this number. In today's society you don't really hear about sanatoriums, asylums and the shock therapy that was depicted in the book set in the 1950s--today you hear about anti-depressant medications and sessions with psychiatrists.

I could not find words to give to the doctors to describe all of the feelings that go along with the illness. So one day I brought in my copy of the Bell Jar, and I pointed out specific parts that echoed the madness in my head. I am not making this up as a sappy story. Sylvia Plath's writing is so real to me, that it has always held a special place in my heart.So, lets say you are not crazy, and can not have such a visceral experience as I had. Read The Bell Jar. Plath's words are so powerful, the poetry that fills each page is so strong. I will admit that I got mildly disinterested near the beginning, but (dont want to give to much away) all of the events that lead to the pivotal point in the book, and all the of events that follow, are charged with electricity and passion. This is a woman's fight for life, and everyone should pick up a copy to enhance their own."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"This special novel passively sat on the bookshelf in my study for sometime. Over the months, occasionally, it would wink at me... I would pick it up, thumb through its pages, read the odd line or two, and place it back on the shelf. On a Sunday morning last week, I read the beginning line for the first time:\\"It was a queer, sultry summer, the summer they electrocuted the Rosenbergs, and I didn't know what I was doing in New York. I'm stupid about executions.\\"Needless to say, I read ~The Bell Jar~ from start to finish, and have had a suspicious and disturbing dark cloud hanging around me ever since. This dark cloud mingles with intermittent light, but the shadow of the novel's themes moves into my vicinity like a suspected stalker, waiting in the corner, seemingly ready to pounce without warning. This may well sound a tad too dramatic, but their are novels out there that have the power to influence your state of mind in profound ways. This novel, for me at any rate, turned out to be one such book.The story is a realistic account of a young American girl's descent into madness.Similar to many great American writers, her prose style is deceptively simple. Plath's writing is extraordinarily translucent, enabling the reader to vicerally connect with her inner most thoughts and feelings. This aspect of the novel was highly enjoyable rather than the actual story itself. Sometimes reality is difficult to look at...As a poet, Plath is acutely sensitive to the world, and as sensitive people are forced to do, they create social masks as a defence mechanism against the vulgarities of existence. This reminded me of the Aestheticism of the Irish writer and poet, Oscar Wilde: the poet's task in life is to be a seeker of beauty - the art of life, or the life of art, the aesthete or poet equates with a form of purified ecstasy that can flourish only when removed from the vulgarities and sterotyped world of actuality. In the case of the novel's protagonist, Esther Greenwood, it was a confrontation and eventual withdrawl from the vulgarities of 'male culture'. The mask she created revealed itself as an unkind, almost flippant attitude to the people around her. Because she must be true to herself, (as poets must be) her actions or inactions with the people around her caused tremendous guilt, thus the vicious circle begins: an acute sensitivity to the world and self; the creation of a false mask as defence; the inevitable guilt for not being true to oneself, leading to eventual self destruction.There are no knights in shining armour in this tale. Sir Galahad riding over the hill on his trusty stead to save poor Esther Greenwood from herself and others. On the contrary, most of the major male characters in ~The Bell Jar~ (apart from her father who is dead) are pathetic losers: coarse, insensitive and self absorbed.~The Bell Jar~ Plath's only novel before her tragic suicide, thrust her directly into the feminist arena, making her a feminist 'icon' in American culture. This accolade is well deserved as this book is a major contribution to the cause, exposing male dominance and oppression, (more so then, fortunately, than now) and illustrating that women are not simply baby machines, cooks, house cleaners, and mere objects for male sexual gratification.After finishing this book, I couldn't help making a comparison to Viginia Woolf's modernist masterpiece, ~Mrs Dalloway~. In this novel, similar themes are explored: male vulgarity, the arrogance of the medical profession, and madness.This is an important book for many reasons, least of which is its literary contribution to American letters.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"The overall theme of this book was human suffering. The author explored themes related to this, such as the human mind, struggle, suicide, and young women's positions in society during the 1940s and 50s: more specifically, how this society refuses to take women's aspirations seriously. However, the general theme and certainly the best explored idea of this book would be human suffering and madness. The author explores this well, probably because this was an autobiography. Sylvia Plath obviously understands at the deepest level the theme of this novel; it being a theme in her own life. First Plath explores how suffering begins and develops in a person. In this book, it is not actually clear what brought on the main character's terrifying internal battles and descent into madness. But the development is portrayed clearly; the stages of self doubt turning constant feelings of having no worth whatsoever. The character (as Plath calls herself, Esther) accuses herself of being useless in a society that has no place for her. And so begins a spiraling, quick decline in this young woman as she descends into a life of self mutilation. Throughout this novel, Esther contemplates suicide frequently: \\"But when it came right down to it, the skin of my wrists looked so white and defenseless against the blade of my Gillete that I just couldn't do it.\\" However, after following multiple attempts at suicide, Esther finally manages to overdose on enough sleeping pills as to land herself in the hospital. Shortly after she is sent to a Psychiatric Ward, where it is expected Electroshock Treatments will cure her depression. After endless, blurry days full of pain and misery, her condition improves. Esther is released from the Ward and is almost herself again. Around this time in her life, Plath completed the book The Bell Jar and produced a plethora of poetry, all astounding pieces of work. By this time she was married to a poet, Ted Hughes, and had two children. Although she was said to be hopeful and optimistic during these days of her life, on the morning of February 11, 1963, Plath ended her life without explanation. This book conveys a journey of an individual's personal experience with human suffering. The theme is well explored by the author, to the extent where the novel was criticized for being hitting the reader with such disturbing impact. I, as well, found this novel to be disturbing. Sylvia Plath dug deep into the landscape of the human mind and eloquently portrayed darkness, disillusion, and despair."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"i remember reading plath's poems in highschool...never quite understanding them. feeling bored by them. but this book...if you've ever felt yourself clawing at the edges of your sanity, this book will hit you in the gut."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"In an English class taught by an instructor I can now with impunity call a pompous fathead, I was assigned this book and had to write six pages about what I found to be its meanings. After taking some deep, slow breaths to control my rising nausea at the memory of all the affected, egotistical people who went on and on about the message of this book, I went home and delved into Ms. Plath's (always a Ms. when you're dealing with this woman, she's NEVER Mrs. Hughes, no, no, no) take on her own mental collapse during her years as a college student. I looked forward to this like a trip to the dentist, but within 20 pages I was into this story of a brilliantly intelligent, multi-gifted, crazier-than-the-average-loon young woman from the 1950's, who struggled to live up to the high expectations others set for her, imploded into mental illness, and rose again after a course of therapy that included electroshock treatments.I read through the early pages of Plath's humorous and falsely sedate story of her trip to New York after writing a winning essay in a magazine contest, her life and times as a university honors student, and her concealed revulsion at the man she was supposed to marry. Then the imagined \\"bell jar\\" of the book's title \\"descends\\" to imprison the young Plath, and she spills into madness. Plath ceases to sleep, eat, bathe, or communicate with anyone outside her own bedroom. Her well-meaning but bumblesome mommy tries to chide her seriously deranged daughter back into good behavior but succeeds only in driving Plath into assuming a fetal position in the earth-smelling space under the house. The seriousness of her daughter's state finally sinking into her head, the elder Plath summons help and Sylvia is sent to a progressive mental facility for a harsh but ultimately successful course of treatment.The book takes us through some of the horrors Plath endured in the hospital, and there are numerous cringe-worthy descriptions of exactly what it is like to experience shock treatment. (Ce n'est pas agr&eacute;able!) After Plath emerges from the center in a state of relative sanity and functionality, she returns to her studies and courageously frees herself from her unwanted engagement. Later, with a MOST unfortunate side effect, she loses her virginity to a professor, and thereafter till the book concludes, broods on the deepest fear of her young life, that the \\"bell jar\\" will descend once again. (Which it eventually does, of course, in the next decade, culminating in Plath's suicide.)Incidentally, in my paper, I took the position of her creativity (as it later emerged) partially arising from her suffering, and that Plath the poet of eventual cult status would never have existed had Plath the college student not endured the pains she did. Oops, seems that was not what Dr. Fathead was looking for, so I got a B. Nope, the correct and only answer for an interpretation of this work is that all intelligent women are automatically societal victims and Sylvia was saying that and only that in The Bell Jar. Unfortunately we can't ask Plath what she meant or indeed if there was ANY theme, cause she stuck her head in a gas oven and forfeited the right to speak for herself. So why so many agree with the victim/poor us message Fathead advocated as the ONLY correct impression to take away from this pre-modern classic defies my understanding, but I still liked The Bell Jar a lot more than I was expecting to and hope anyone who reads it gets to do so with the luxury of finding his or her own take on this unsteady tale of mental illness and survival."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"The Bell Jar is not for everyone. It's one of the most incisive, beautiful, horrifying journeys through mental illness ever printed. Anyone who has never suffered from depression or any great life-changing event may not get the point. They cannot fathom the meaning because they have no frame of reference. This is not a criticism of those who have dismissed the book, but simply my point of reference after bouts of crippling depression and being on the receiving end of well-meaning but ineffectual comments like \\"Distract yourself with some useful task,\\" or \\"Look on the bright side.\\"The point is that when you're in the throes of depression, no fortune, trip around the world, award, love, gorgeous weather, or satisfying work looks remotely bright. Some days it's all you can do to take a shower. Life looks black, hopeless, and utterly without meaning. A person who has never stayed in bed all day and read on a beautiful day because the world outside looked too terrifying may also mistakenly believe that depression is a trendy euphemism for laziness, self-pity, willfulness, and self-obsession. I assure you, it is not.To dismiss Sylvia Plath's book as worthless because it doesn't have a plot is really an unfair criticism. Not everyone wants to look at the darker side of existence, but for those of us who seek meaning from it, this is the perfect book with which to begin."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Sylvia Plath is an amazing author.

In the Sexton biography - written by Diane Wood Middlebrook - there is a biographical passage on page 107 where, at the Ritz Hotel, Sylvia Plath and Anne Sexton are having martinis and discussing suicide: &quot;Often, very often, Sylvia and I would talk at length about our first suicides; at length, in detail, and in depth between the free potato chips. Suicide is, after all, the opposite of the poem. Sylvia and I often talked opposites. We talked death with burned-up intensity, both of us drawn to it like moths to an electric light bulb. Sucking on it!&quot; One can only imagine the two grand dames of poetry confessing and professing to one another how they attempted it and would vow to do it successfully the next time around. I gather in the interim of their morbid discourse, Plath's haunting (if that is an approropriate word) statements as well as Anne's invoked within one another feelings of invidious, pressing desire for their own quiet world, a world not burdened by day-to-day realities. The Bell Jar, however, is not a literary biography in the true defination. Rather, it is a fictional memoir in the same element to that of Fredrick Exley's A Fan's Notes, but it is written in the similar stlye to that of her literary compatriot J.D. Salinger and his semi-acidulous novels. In it, we have Esther (Plath), a very endowed, intelligent young woman who wins a summer position as an editor/writer for a New York magazine; after that job, things begin to slide, mentally, for Esther. She is more than bright (Plath herself received a Fulbright Scholarship to Cambridge University), but there is a strong percolating aura that everything around Esther is too run-of-the-mill for her unique and unquiet mind. And when the mind is unique, restless and sickly, those become the proper ingredients for what Esther suffers and endures - a depression that goes beyond fatalism. With a rejection to a writing course and a lack of sincere understanding, she spirals downward to her mental breakdown, her bell jar firmly encapsulating her in the realm of madness. Her options for a cure are worse then the disease itself: electrical shock therapy, incarceration to a mental hospital, psychiatrists, attempted suffocation, warm water and a Gillette blade, and lastly and perhaps more potently, a lack of understaing of what she was going through. This isn't a novel that says, Pity me! It says, Undersatnd me! This is who I am! This is what I am going through! This is what I am seeing! This is how I am feeling! When the mind is inundated with the horrors of truths and medical misunderstandings, the chosen path can lead a person to a place he/she can never return from. Perhaps, in some ways, a lot more smaller to Sylvia's and Anne's, all of humanity lives in a bell jar."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Sylvia Plath made a significant contribution to the understanding of mental health with the publication of this book in 1971. She describes the mental health care that was offered in the 50&quot;s through her novel, The Bell Jar. It is widely acknowledged that this was more than a peak into her personal struggle, but a real reflection of how mental illness comes down on you, like a bell jar, where everything looks the same outside but there is pure confusion inside. This novel of such personal intensity explores the stages of the disease and the treatments that were available to her. It is far more in depth than Girl Interrupted.

I don't remember the context, nor the message, nor even the general idea of what was said. All I remember was the name of the author, and the name of the book. It stuck with me for a long time, and finally it bubbled up and found its way to my book pile. Eventually, it got read.Now that you know the story of my coming upon The Bell Jar, I suppose it would be appropriate to give a reasonable explanation of what I thought of it. Having bridged the subject, I find it difficult to do. The book is easy to read, probably taking me 4 days of sporadic reading to finish it. Be warned though, the book is certainly not light reading material.The subject matter is dark, in the realm of a more mature I Am The Cheese or The Chocolate War. I felt a lot of resonance between those Robert Cormier books and this by Sylvia Plath. I hated Cormier's books - the same cannot be said of this. While I did find it difficult material, it was not inherently cruel. It was troubling, yet truthful throughout. The struggle that Platt endures is tough reading, especially when you know this is a real story. Granted it was told through her looking glass, so you have to take that into consideration. Still, it's pretty dramatic no matter what your perspective.The chapter at the end of the book I read was an additional biographical note by Lois Ames, and in it we find a little of what happened to Plath after the book ends. It brings things together, in a sense. In a very real way it comes as no surprise to read those pages. I'll leave it at that, since there is already too much between the lines for the unknowing reader to glean from.In a strange way this book is a modern classic. It will likely not sit on the pedestal that The Good Earth will occupy (another recent read, thus the reference). Written in the 1950s, it relates well to a lot of what is happening today, in 2006. You could take out various items that date the book, release it now, and today's reader would be none the wiser. While the inherent subject matter is not confidence building or heart-warming, it does show people what they feel is not a solitary emotion.This book is not for everyone. It's not a happy book, written in a happy place. It is not a corollary to Harry Potter, it is not a sequel to Charlotte's Web. The book is loaded with dark text, showing the dark inner thoughts of a young woman in the dark world that we live in. Entertaining, even funny at times, the subject material is surely serious and the potential reader should be ready for the like.Some call this a young woman's Catcher in the Rye.

You also have to take into consideration the time when it was written- mental health was something that no one wanted to talk about or deal with. It must have taken a lot for Plath to come forth with this &quot;memoir.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"this book was one the greatest books i've ever read. sylvia was a strong, creative woman, trying to survive in a cruel world that just does not understand people. her sorrows and pain are all touched in this book. truly, a depressing story but so well written, that it touches you forever."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"There is no melodrama, or pretentious rambling here.

The brutally honest story of a young, dynamic woman\`s downfall into insanity is one that would define great literature. The protagonist, Esther Greenwood, captivates the reader as the book journeys through six months of her life, starting in a glitzy New York City trip, and ending in a mental institution in Conneticut. &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; examines the slow and painful breakdown of people, and how sometimes, hope doesn\`t seem to mean anything anymore."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I thought this book was a great way to find out what really goes on inside your head when your thinking of suicide.

The main character, Ester Greenwood, was such a good protagonist because her pain, suffering and sadness completely blanketed the book with such truthfully heavy and sombre aura. Ester\`s agonizing fall into depression and madness was so afflicting, it was almost disturbing that someone\`s sanity could crumble so easily and so brutally. Sylvia Plath is a literary genius because &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; is a semi-autobiographical story, and the way she veiled her true life story with such magnificent writing is unforgettable."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I found Sylvia Plath\`s autobiographical novel, &quot;The Bell Jar&quot;, a brilliant book, one that would define classic literature. It was honest, absorbing, poignant, intense and haunting all at the same time. Syliva Plath\`s ability of making a story into such an afflicting, bitter and tragic experience is striking. What amazed me the most was how the novel followed a woman\`s life through sanity into madness so delicately and naturally, you could barely tell when andwhere the &quot;bell jar&quot; started to close in on the main character. &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; is signifigant book because it\`s richly described story and dialogue will forever remain untouchable."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I first encountered Sylvia Plath fresh out of my tumultuous high school years, during which I dropped out and went back. I've suffered from bouts of depression since the beginning of adolescence. Throughout adolescence, these manifested themselves in myriad ways, from the typical rebelliousness to a two-month period around the age of seventeen wherein I couldn't even manage a smile and cried seemingly for hours nearly every day.At around age twenty I began to take my writing seriously (so dangerous and giddy a moment for any writer!). I discovered her poetry, and this wrenching and bitter and beautiful novel, at a point in which I began to have more frequent episodes, as well as a time in which I fell in love, did my Kerouac thing, started college. Here was a writer who not only went ahead into these horrors herself, but had the unwavering courage to document them and share them with others.As a literary work, the novel seethes with immortality, making a perpetual watermark in fire on the mind with its images: Esther trailing her finger along the wall of the building to help her keep her balance and bearing, the ends of the hair in the vomit like tree roots in a bog, Esther peering at Buddy from behind her hair (a mask utilized to illustrate the double standard and hypocrisies of both sets of behavior), Constantin's apartment, the lunch on the cold day when Esther and Mr. Willard drive up to the Adirondacks to see Buddy.As a work of psychological prowess and permanence, I don't know that I've ever read anything that more skillfully paints a portrait of such a descent. As a work of catharsis, I think, it is without parallel in this century. Sylvia Plath has become a kindred spirit to many writers out there, and many, as well, who suffer similar perils. This novel has marked the beginning, the first terrifying steps into the emotional devastation possible in the hands of contemporary culture. There is no other work yet like it, and there may never be."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Don't be fooled; this is not a classic book, just as Plath was not a novelist. She was a poet, and an amazing one. But a storyteller? A dramatist? Not really. So this book is of interest only biographically, as it applies to her life (because it was based in part on her experiences).Substandard, and don't be afraid to admit it after finishing it, despite her reputation. She wanted to be a novelist as well as a poet, yes; and she tried -- this being her best effort. But she wasn't a novelist. This is pulp work, frequently derivative, usually trite, even banal ... A lot like her short stories.The artist in development, but not the artist developed.That is has become a \\"classic\\" is due less to the work itself than to the death of the author, which is sad. The book is about a suicider, and the author committed suicide after writing a landmark book of poetry, and so many in consequence label this effort a classic. But it isn't. One does not have a lot to do with the other, really. If she hadn't died as she did, would \\"The Bell Jar\\" ever have been considered required reading? No, of course not. Nothing in it that indicates it should -- except again, as I said, the biographical import.I'm a huge fan of Plath, a real fan, and so I would urge readers away from this attempt and towards her real masterwork: Ariel."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I first read The Bell Jar as a teenager and I think I missed the point a bit. Like many of the reviewers who have given it a low rating, I found Esther's character difficult to relate to and I found the plot slow and slightly tedious. However, I re-read it recently and I was blown away. Perhaps because some of my close family members have recently been through very bad bouts of depression, I found that this novel resonated on a very personal level. Plath captures the awful claustrophobia of depression perfectly, and it is made all the more sadder with the realisation that she committed suicide soon after completing the novel. Maybe a lot of people will only find the true beauty in this book when they, or someone close to them, have experienced the all-consuming despair and lethargy of going through a similarly dark period. This book has definitely been promoted to one of my favourites and I am so glad I gave it another try."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I read this novel for a psychology class. On the whole, I can't say that I liked the novel very much. The beginning was interesting, and I did enjoy Plath's method of story-telling. But, it got very difficult to read once the novel progressed into the part where she starts to feel depressed. It was slightly disturbing to be in someone's mind who is descending into insanity. I would not recommend this book for the faint of heart."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"This was beautifully written. The way Plath flexes the words to describe the smallest emotional experience is so right on the money, it felt like Ester's experiences were mine own. I just finished The Graduate, and found the depression and weakness of the main character disgusting and pathetic. After reading/listening to Maggie Gyllenhaal bring this book to life, the disgusting depression that The Graduate presented was clearly a failed attempt to make the transition from college to real life and the depression that can come with it tangible for the reader. I wish Sylvia Plath had written more. I love her style, the elegant transitions, and the honey she offers to pull you in. OH and Gyllenhaal's performance is A+ work. Her voice was very easy to follow, her cadence was perfect and the way she took on the character made me feel like I was living the whole thing. LOVED IT it is like a great movie...only longer! Maybe I'll listen again!"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"With the seas of collective enigma and awe that surrounds Sylvia Plath, this first and last novel of hers flows like that sea itself. 'The Bell Jar' starts off with a taste you can almost feel tingling on the tip of your tongue. That taste is hollowness.As Esther Greenwood tries to have that time of her life she thought she would getting this chance of a lifetime, she begins to experience an emptiness of sorts which, clearly, lies beyond words.Even as one reads the sentence after sentence, one is pulled in between those blank spaces to a world so completely black. As Esther describes the beginning of her breakdown, you begin to almost hear Sylvia Plath whispering the written words so ominously in your ears - whether you know how she sounds or not.For years Plath enchanted people with her poetry, but she knew she could manage more than that. With 'The Bell Jar' Miss Sylvia certainly manages MUCH more. Beautiful descriptions, believable, enriching dialogue, and a story that will resonate in the core of your heart forever.Some part of this book are so eerily haunting that you feel the pain Esther, and likely Miss Sylvia, must have felt. The hurting sometimes is so deep that you begin to wonder what it really would be like to be trapped in such a prison. Of course, those who already feel this melancholy - like myself - will be more than attracted to this book as it can become like a shared secret between the reader and the character.What also pleases me is this is a first-person narrative. The book is supposed to describe a 'crack-up' of sorts but the way Esther talks of what is slowly creeping into her, you can see that she is not 'crazy' at all but a human being at the end of the day.That personal, private touch to 'The Bell Jar' is a definite part in the success of this book. One is left to wonder what Sylvia Plath, a woman with such great words sprouting from the depths of her mind, could have written in the lost years of a life she chose to end."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I thought the beginning was excellent; I really liked the first paragraph. Very tight writing, but then it started to falter. I know it's due to the emotional unraveling of Esther, but it just fell apart for me. Still worth reading."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"This book is beautifully written and poignant in style. It really gives an insider's view of what clinical depression is like. The story is mostly bleak, but honest, with drops of hope given at the end."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"The Bell Jar is a powerful coming of age story about the fictitious Esther Greenwood, whom author Sylvia Plath vicariously wrote as; and her struggle with societal expectations. As an outcast, Esther moves to New York City in the 1950's to work for a magazine. She deals with many life struggles causing her depression to worsen. Her depressive characteristics; obsession with fetuses and the Rosenburgs, sexual experimentation, attempted suicide, and disregard for society's norms, land her in an institution.Depression is a main theme of the novel along with personal growth (coming of age), society's restrictions on women, ethics of psychiatry, and cultural expectations. Esther is an anachronism, tied down by the prudish view on how women should be. She is a modern thinker, and sadly, not accepted for that.Sylvia Plath's cries from hell were evident in this eerily realistic novel. She wrote to the depressives and to those who can understand what she was dealing with. Presenting the never-ending conflict of Esther vs. society and convention, Plath made it very easy to fall into character and feel trapped under the very same \\"bell jar\\" of madness.I enjoyed reading The Bell Jar because it was so real and easy to relate to. Although it was a bit depressing at times, it wasn't whiny or pretentious. I highly recommend The Bell Jar for those who enjoy sociology, psychology, or just a good read. This compelling novel shouldn't be missed."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"This is an amazing book.

That having been said, I felt absolutely no connection with any of the characters in this novel. Esther just seems unsatisfied 24/7 and never wants to connect with anyone. The whole premise of the book is just dark, depressing, and disturbing. It sounds like Sylvia Plath wrote this like a personal diary and replaced her name with Esther Greenwood. While reading this, I was asking myself, \\"What goes on in this woman's mind and what makes her think this is alright to show to the general public?\\" Nobody wants to relax by reading a book about suicide, cutting yourself, depression, etc. This book is out-dated because the teenage suicide rates in the 1950s weren't as high as the ones today which should give teachers a reason not to have students read this for an assignment. Plath tries to present suicide as a rational solution to any problem in \\"The Bell Jar.\\" What if a person who has considered suicide read this book? This is NOT a classic at all. Classics have memorable stories and characters that we as the readers can connect to. \\"The Bell Jar\\" makes no connection at all to the reader. Sometimes authors have to know what their limits in writing are when it comes to what the general public wants to read. I don't recommend this book to anyone, especially those dealing with depression or any other similar problem."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I read this book in highschool and it nearly ruined modern fiction for me. I'm older now, have a masters degree in English, and I still find this book a boring, uninteresting, waste of time. To me Plath tries too hard to come across broken and tragic in her writing. Why do so many people think that a character's descent into madness makes for good reading? Wally Lamb's She's Come Undone is equally a waste of time in this regard."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"It was so hard for me to read this book!

English teachers/professors should not require students to read this; it goes against every basic human tendency to be happy and not to be anti-life.

I'll purchase somewhere close to home without a month wait."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"The Bell Jar tells the story of Esther Greenwood's slow descent into madness. Really a thinly veiled recounting of Plath's own mental troubles and her first suicide attempt, it provides a disturbingly realistic account of how a smart, talented and promising young woman can fall so far.Esther Greenwood is a scholarship student at a prestigious Eastern women's college and a talented writer. However, when she fails to gain admission to a summer writing course, her first inklings of psychological trouble multiply and she falls quickly into despair.The book takes the readers into Greenwood's mind. The slight changes in perceptions, the means of reacting to life's events, the thought processes, change gradually for the reader, as they did for Esther herself. Only the reader is better equipped to track the changes and to predict the result.The book describes Greenwood's suicide attempt and eventual recovery. It likens depression to being inside of a bell jar, which distorts the senses for the person trapped inside of it. At the same time, it recounts her journey into adulthood, her exploration of her body and sexuality, which remains active even at her lowest points, and definition of herself as a woman.At the height of Greenwood's mania, the repeated thoughts of suicide become tiresome. However, Plath presents both the lead-up to her psychosis and her recovery in a realistic and moving manner. The biographical note at the end of the book presents a helpful summary of Plath's life.Plath's eventual death by suicide at the age of 30 make this work all the more moving. Despite her struggle to get out from under the bell jar, she couldn't prevent its final descent. Readers can only sympathize by viewing, through this book, what it was like for her inside the jar."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I've recently decided to write a review for every book I ever loved. So, yes this is written in retrospect. And perhaps I don't have all the detail written down perfectly. But if you want to read a summary, I'm afraid to inform you that I cannot give you one. I can only give you my opinion.I was quite young when I first read this; maybe 14 or 15. Perhaps I was too young to fully understand it. I was, for one, a neurotic over achiever and couldn't quite grasp that someone could have an inability not to work. But looking back, I now find myself in the same situation or rather coming out of the same situation.I recommend this book to everyone, but only after you break into a few of life's tragedies and turmoil. Otherwise, there will be a void in reading this that can't be comprehended or severely hinders the reading.This was certainly written by a poet. It flows smoothly and nothing too contrive or sentences that were complicatedly constructed for the sake of being complicated. I remember fully enjoying this book.This book is as relevant today as it is was in the 60s when it was written. Things have changed, yes. But things have also remained the same. The same stresses, worries and concerns still plague many up and coming adolescents. (It's funny for me to write that sentence as one.)What I love most about this book is that it is not a moral tale warning about the rights and wrongs of life. Neither is an apologetic story. She doesn't make excuses. She tells it like it was for her. Being lost, being annoyed at being asked \\"what are you going to do with the rest of your life\\", being the odd one out, being gawky. All of this is still relevant today as it is for me.Where it loses people is when she starts to spiral down. It's a natural progression that flows smoothly downward---there was never one big incident or anything that explain any such thing. It doesn't try to prod in the physiological of the matter. It's like a first hand account of an accident about to occur where the person can't explain what is about to happen. She just knows she is going to crash.I'm not saying you have to be depressed or a wounded human being to read this. No. No one is perfect; everyone has problems. If you're young, maybe give this books a few years. But if you've lived some, then read this. This is not a story to be missed. Easy. Deep. Mesmerizing."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Victoria Lucas wrote this fictional novel, but it is based on Sylvia Plath's real life. Which makes sense, considering Victoria Lucas is only a pseudonym for Plath. This is the closest anyone will ever get of an actual Plath autobiography, which is sad, because The Bell Jar ends leaving many questions unanswered.Plath's own scholarship was at Mademoiselle Magazine, where she was a guest editor for a month. Esther's patron, Philomena Guinea, is based on Plath's own patron, Olive Higgins Prouty, best known for writing Stella Dallas and Now, Voyager. The individual who was the character base for Joan later sued after the book was published under Plath's real name following her suicide. The court ruled in her favor that she was unfairly branded as gay in the novel. Esther's suicide attempt is a mirror image of one of Plath's own. Both the main character and the author under went electroshock therapy, which also links the protagonist with the Rosenbergs, who Ester refers to in the opening, reflecting on their execution in the electric chair. Coincidently, Plath left two children behind after her suicide, as did the Rosenbergs.Its disturbing to read the Bell Jar, knowing how true to life it is and what happens to Esther in real life. Plath continues to be an enigma and the Bell Jar does not offer any insight into who she really was. It is difficult to connect to Esther Greenwood. She follows through life, disconnected, winning awards for her writing and flying through college on scholarship. Eventually, she wins a chance to spend a summer working at a New York magazine. Her first friend is Doreen, a \\"dirty common slag\\" that Esther would rather not associate with but wants to emulate. Losing her virginity to punish her boyfriend Buddy Willard for losing his becomes an obsession for her. Not that she really loves or even wants Buddy to be her boyfriend. Unfortunately, she feels that she is unable to leave him once he is diagnosed with tuberculosis and sent to a sanatorium.The novel is going along well until Esther is sent home. Up until this point, the character is realistic and sympatic. However, once she moves back home, her motives become unclear. Mental illness, depression included, is always unclear, but it is difficult to understand Esther. Before, the reader felt as if they were experiencing all this with her, as if they were there. Afterwards, we are just watching her go through things, not really getting a chance to feel what she feels. Esther, upon returning home, suffers insomnia and sees a psychiatrist who gives her electroshock therapy. Esther makes several suicide attempts, the final being when she crawls into a cellar and swallows 50 sleeping pills. She is sent to a mental hospital, where is meets and makes new friends, including Joan.The Bell Jar reads as two books. The first book is a character study of a young girl in New York. I enjoyed this half. The second half is a confusing mess. However, it is not bad. As two separate books, both would stand on their own and would be very good. However, the tie between is leak and together, two excellent books become a merely good one. Three stars for the book itself, the extra star for the impact it had on society."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"The Bell Jar is, what is consider, one of Sylvia Plath's greatest works. Plath wrote this novel as a biographical fiction. Sylvia Plath took the main events during a certain part of her life and changed the names and characters. This novel eloquently describes Plath's downward spiral to depression in, what some criticas call, a Salinger mood. The themes in this novel vary from Esther Greenwood, the main character, dealing with the loss of her virginity to her hatred of the domestic role that women of her time were forced to play. I really enjoyed this book because it was real. It is interesting to know that the insane events that occur in the novel actually happened to the author. I would recommend this book to anyone that has an open mind to read about suicide, sex, and electroshock therepy.

(Interestingly, it was Smith that Plath attended a couple of years previous.) Specifically, Sylvia's alter ego, Esther Greenwood, is one of twelve college girls who've won a fashion magazine contest, the prize being a month-long, expense-paid, freebie-filled, glamorous job in New York City as the guest editor of a national magazine. When the month is up, Esther returns home where, under pressure to make something of her life during her senior year of college, she cracks. From that point on, the storyline progresses from half-hearted attempts at suicide to one that almost succeeds, then subsequent admission into a country-club asylum for psychotherapy and electroshock treatment. (Though THE BELL JAR never states, even in the chapter &quot;Sylvia Plath: A Biographical Note&quot;, the author's real life experience was at McLean Hospital.) It's while on her way to the private mental institution that Esther defines &quot;bell jar&quot;:&quot;I would be sitting under the ... glass bell jar, stewing in my own sour air.&quot;THE BELL JAR is a hypnotic look at the mental deterioration of a talented and intelligent young woman. It's like watching the slow-mo replay of a person's self-destructive plunge off a building's ledge. There's perhaps an argument here for the book being required reading by the parents of any teenage girl.The literary world benefited when Sylvia Plath regained relative mental equilibrium long enough to write THE BELL JAR before succumbing to inner demons and committing suicide in 1963. Her ultimate fate renders even more poignant and prophetic her words:&quot;How did I know that someday - at college, in Europe, somewhere, anywhere - the bell jar, with its stifling distortions, wouldn't descend again?&quot;"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"One of the reviewers here stated &quot;Plath should have spent a little more time working out the ending.&quot; The ending of the book was, of course, dictated by her own circumstances.

Esther is a brilliant, prideful woman in a world where women aren't supposed to be either and are instead supposed to be like a minor character in the book whom Esther despises--a typical suburban cow, whining kids in tow. At the end of The Bell Jar, I believe we are supposed to ask the question, is Esther crazy or is her madness an appropriate reaction to the world in which she lives? The answer I believe is the latter.

It was easy reading, but at times I did grow bored, particularly the pages that are dedicated to how Esther tries to commit suicide. And yet it would have been too important to leave out.Overall, the story of Esther saddened me, knowing that Ms. Plath was basically writing about her own life. I wonder if she had been born much later (when depression wasn't considered taboo), and she would have gotten the proper treatment for her depression, what could have been. Sadly, we'll never know. I didn't realize how much of a stigma was attached to depression or &quot;crazy people&quot; back then.

It is about an fallible human and her raw inner thoughts about happenings around her. The genius is in Sylvia's objectiveness and her sharp unwitting intelligent remarks!"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"\\"The Bell Jar.\\" What is a bell jar anyway? This is what I asked myself when I picked the book off the shelf. The dictionary's definition of a bell jar is a bell shaped container or cover made of glass used to keep gases, air, or moisture out. This relates to the book because Esther feels as though her insanity or mental instability is causing her to be shut out from the rest of the world much like the bell jar shuts out the air. Esther feels almost suffocated by her own insecurities and on her road to psychological recovery she says that the closer she becomes to being cured, the more the bell jar is lifted and she can finally breathe.The book is an autobiography on the troubled author Sylvia Plath. In the book you can definitely see the parallels between Sylvia and the main character, Esther.The book opens with Esther sympathizing with the Rosenbergs who had just been executed for espionage. Esther says she wonders how it would feel to have her nerves fried like the Rosenbergs had. This offers the reader an example of foreshadowing. Although Esther has not said anything about suicide yet, this does show that there is some what of an interest on this topic that has not yet surfaced.Esther is very bright and is in New York working at a New York magazine. She is there on a scholarship she had won. She temporarily lives in a an all girls hotel. She has two close friends in New York, the first being a southern belle named Doreen. Doreen was very audacious and a definite rule breaker. Esther felt as though she shouldn't be hanging out with Doreen because of her bad habits but being with Doreen always provides a fun and adventurous time. The other of Esther' s friends is a slender blonde named Betsy. Betsy was very proper and sophisticated. She was the opposite of what Doreen was.Another person in this novel which really plays a large role in Esther' s life is her \\"acquaintance\\" Buddy Willard. Buddy has Tuberculosis and lives in a TB sanitarium, Although we are introduced to Buddy as just an acquaintance we later find out Buddy actually had a relationship with Esther. Esther then learns of an affair Buddy had over the summer. In an attempt to even the score with Buddy she tries to sleep with a man, (Constantin) she had met. This plan falls through and they just fall asleep. Buddy then invites Esther to the Yale Junior Prom. Buddy also \\"reveals\\" himself to Esther and she asks him if he really did have an affair and it proves to be true. This shatters Esther's dream of the two being together. Although he later asks her to marry him Esther declines.Esther then starts to feel a little depressed and this is when Doreen sets Esther up with a Peruvian woman-hater named Marco. This is the man that in my opinion will change Esther' s life forever. At first he dazzles her with a diamond but he later expects something in return and he tries to rape her. Esther then goes back to the hotel and in a rage throws all her clothes off the roof. I took this incident as a metaphor for her throwing her life in New York away and sadly returning to her grief stricken life at home in Wellesly. She leaves New York that night to head home. Upon her return home she learns that the summer course she had hoped to take at Harvard did not accept her. This will start her first and worst summer at home. The tuning point in the story is when on top of her failure to be accepted to the Harvard course, she learns that Buddy is falling in love with a nurse at the TB clinic. This presses the bell jar's edges tightly against the ground. Knowing this crushing news she goes to the pharmacist and has her sleeping pill prescription increased.Esther is sent to Doctor Gordon a psychiatrist who suggests electro shock therapy. After experiencing the treatment she wanted to commit suicide. She wasn't able to slit her wrists so she takes a multitude of sleeping pills and locked herself in the basement.Her attempts didn't work and she awoke in darkness. She couldn't see and was told she would eventually meet a nice blind man. Esther breaks a thermometer and a ball of mercury lays on the floor in a few smaller balls and she pushes them together, and they fuse back into one. I think this represents her breakdown, only I don't think her emotions can be put together as easily as the mercury was.She is then moved to a private hospital where she gets a female doctor. Esther gets injections three times a day to begin her treatment. From Caplan she is moved to Belsize which is a step closer to recovery. Dr. Nolan, (her new psychiatrist) resumes the shock therapy and Esther recovers more rapidly. Esther begins to gain more privileges and her recovery was almost complete. Esther then loses her virginity to a man whom she had met on the steps of a Harvard library named Irwin. She was dropped off at her friend Joan's house after hemorrhaging from intercourse. Joan re-enrolled in Belize, (being a former patient.) One day Joan wasn't home by curfew and Esther was asked if she knew of her where abouts. Esther didn't know and later Joan was found in the woods.....dead. After being convinced Joan's suicide was not Esther' s fault, she is interviewed to be released back to school. Thus showing that Esther was finally cured.The feeling that I got from this book is overall depression. The book is sad because Esther's life is full of many hardships and many things to over come."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I found Sylvia Plath\`s novel, &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; to be a genuinely moving and brutally honest read. Plath\`s untouchable use of words are so keen and vivid, reading her book is almost like watching a film. &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; is about a young and talented woman named Esther Greenwood. After a won trip to New York City, Esther slowly recognizes her new found feelings of despair, and starts to feel herself and her life sinking deeper and deeper into a profound depression. The book\`s journey from sanity to madness is captivating and almost harrowing, as we witness the hell the protagonist must endure. The most incredible thing about &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; is how is remains so subtle and natural, but still manifests terror to it\`s highest degree. Sylvia Plath\`s heart is written on every page, and reading &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; will give you a good relfection of her bitter but realistic view on herself, humanity, America and life. A definite must-read."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Forgive me, but I just can't understand the popularity of this book. It's supposed to get us inside the mind of a mentally ill young woman, but to me it's merely a two-dimensional relating of events without any true depictions of the raging emotions that must have been going on inside the heroine's mind during them.I came across Plath's \\"The Bell Jar\\" in a roundabout way. After seeing the rental video version of Elizabeth Wurtzel's \\"Prozac Nation\\", I read the book. Being prone to depression myself, I felt quite a bit of empathy for Wurtzel's stream-of-consciousness relating of her experiences when she was suffering from acute depression and the way her mind was racing at the time. Yet, when I read other readers' reviews of Wurtzel's book, I was shocked at how many readers felt it was unconvincing and recommended Plath's \\"The Bell Jar\\" or Susanna Kaysen's \\"Girl, Interrupted\\" instead. So, I read those books, too.Plath's \\"novel\\" is actually a novella-length, autobiographical sketch of Plath's own experiences with depression/schizophrenia as is made clear by both the Introduction and the Biographical Note included. The plot itself is interesting enough (hence, two stars), but that's ALL Plath gives us. A book like this needs to make us FEEL what Plath is feeling. And this Plath doesn't do at allExample: Plath blandly states that she hasn't been able to sleep at all for three weeks. And just leaves it at that. Maybe she assumes everyone's had the same experience. But I've BEEN there. Chronic insomnia cripples and isolates you. If she hadn't slept in three weeks, she would hardly be able to communicate with anyone around her. And believe me, most \\"normal\\" people do NOT know what that is like at all.Another example: Plath suffers from schizophrenia. Fortunately, I don't; but many years ago I read Joanne Greenberg's \\"I Never Promised You a Rose Garden\\" -- another autobiographical novel by a schizophrenic and, interestingly, written at about the same time Plath was writing this book (the 1960s). Greenberg's depictions of her \\"voices\\" holding counsel inside her mind haunt me to this day. At one point Plath mentions that her own \\"voices\\" were screaming at her, too. And again just leaves it at that. What did her voices say to her? How did they say it? How did they affect her? You won't find out by reading this book.At any rate, for those who are trying to experience what it's really like to look out at the world from a mind suffering from some sort of chronic depression, I still highly recommend Wurtzel's \\"Prozac Nation\\". For those interested in what it's like to be institutionalized, I recommend Kaysen's \\"Girl Interrupted\\", but not as highly. For those wanting to experience the world of schizophrenia, I strongly recommend Greenberg's \\"I Never Promised You a Rose Garden\\", even though this book is hardly mentioned in other readers' reviews.As for Plath's \\"The Bell Jar\\" . . . alas, I can't recommend it for anyone."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"This book really takes you along with this tortured soul's journey into madness.

When did she undergo the electroshock therapy--on page 1 or page 101? We can't tell because Esther's a bore right from the start and there's no difference in her character between &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after.&quot; Plath does an unenviable job of turning her tumultuous life into a tedious collection of journal entries of a lifeless, forgettable character.

I looked for clues in how she talked and what she talked about, but could only assume various items. In a work of literature, I don't care who you are, it is important to answer all the readers' questions. Why did she have the breakdown? What was the underlying motive for attempting suicide? How did it affect the rest of her life after all was said and done? I did not get the answers to these questions after finishing the book. This made it hard for me to care for Esther as much as Plath probably wanted each reader to. I just didn't understand where Esther was coming from when she ranted on and on about how fabulous it would be to die. I couldn't feel her pain because I didn't know where it came from. Same goes for Joan. There wasn't enough of her character to really get into to feel shocked and upset at the announcement of her death. Secondly, there were quiet a bit of failed metaphors in the story. Plath used the death metaphor too much and in the wrong places at times. Finally, I didn't get a final resolution out of this story. Esther mentioned near the end &quot;How do I know the bell jar won't descend again?&quot; That deprives the story of any climatic ending right there. I mean, so what if she's let out of Belsize, if the bell jar descends again, then why does this entire ordeal that Plath told matter?"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"For most of my adult life (I am 49) people who get to know me tell me that I would absolutely love this book.

Her word use, while precise, is TOO precise, in the sense that I get the distinct feeling she agonized over each one to make the character sound as depressed as possible. What's odd about it is that there doesn't seem to be any real reason for any of it, nor is any particular behavior described that might give me a hint at what goes on in anyone else's mind while interacting with her [Esther Greenwood]. All sincerity seems to have been leeched out of the book which is then peppered with ridiculous assertions that make self-proclaimed feminists sigh with pleasure. Since this is evidently semi-autobiographical I can't imagine what to make of that.Nearly every transition is abrupt and awkward and most of the characters have been flattened out and made into caricatures of feminist archetypes in the most tortured, juvenile manner imaginable. Needless to say that the plot, such as it is, is not helped in the least by any of the \\"people\\" that inhabit it. I could say so much more, but rest assured that it is all scathing.Luckily, it's the only novel she ever wrote, thus sparing me from the agony of someone convincing me to give her another chance. I spent $17 on this book. I consider this another stroke of luck as it is the only feminist work I imagine I'll ever buy, and consider my education complete and cheap at the price!"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"\\"The Bell Jar\\" is one of the most pathetic, self-absorbent pieces of writing ever published. Esther tried to literally and figuratively dig her own grave and is to be pitied. If the writer dared to look beyond Esther, reading it might have been pleasurable and insightful. As it stands, Esther's character was written as to be so self-absorbed that she is barely aware of the world around her, and even when she dares to open her eyes, she sees nothing but the world against her.Undoubtedly, at the time the novel was written, the world was very different then for women. But what I fail to see is any strength in Esther. Other than cower in a corner and cry, she appeared to want the world to cater to her. I'm sure this had a lot to do with her mental illness, but the book boils down to a pitiful tail of a girl who stood by and let the world swallow her up. I think this might make good reading for psychiatrists to peer into the world of insanity, but for the rest of us, it seems little more than a whiny tale of self-indulgence. The writing style of the book was quite good. The content was quite poor."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"While &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; is well-written its portrayal of psychiatric care is rather out-dated.

However, the insinuations contained in it are disturbing. The Bell Jar seems to villify men in general for their lack of understanding. Rather than acknowledge that some people in general are distant, Plath turns men into whipping posts. It should be obvious to the unbiased reader, however, that Plath was just plain old insane. This reviewer feels bad for Ted Hughes, Plath's husband who has been blamed by two generations of literary feminists for Plath's suicide. Reading The Bell Jar should exonerate Hughes-- his wife was, unfortunately, mentally ill independent of his actions. Sylvia Plath should have taken responsibility for her own actions and her own condition."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"This book was very unique.

The reader is taken on a journey of drastic emotions. This book is mainly targeted for high school students."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"The Bell Jar, by Sylvia Plath is the story of a young woman who progresses into a condition of serious mental illness. The book begins with Esther, the main character and narrator, having some very troubling thoughts. She is obsessed with the mental image of the execution of a couple convicted of treason. Esther recalls this part of her life as the beginning of her illness and a time of losing control. During a month-long stay at an expensive hotel in New York, we discover that Esther does not identify with any of the other young women who are staying there. She feels alienated from and inferior to them. When Esther becomes sick with food poisoning, she stays in bed and does nothing. She seems to be comfortable with being physically ill because it seems logical with her mental state. It gives her an excuse to lay around and do nothing, which is what she really wants to do. She is also able to avoid being around the people she doesn't fit in with, the wealthy young women. She is more comfortable being alone in bed than she would be dealing with others. When Esther is invited to go on a date with Constantin, she starts remembering a relationship she had in the past with Buddy Willard. She was more interested in what impression she made on the other girls in college than she was in a real relationship with Buddy. By going out with Buddy, she thought she would fit in better with the other girls. When Esther decides to go out with Constantin, she plans to lose her virginity believing this would make her more independent. When things don't work out with Constantin, she decides that she never wants to get married because that would stifle her ability to write poetry. She imagines that marriage would restrict her. After a very frightening encounter with another man, Esther goes back home to Massachusetts where her illness begins to get much worse. She hears her own voice as a zombie voice and is losing touch with reality. She goes to see her doctor who sends her to a psychiatrist. When Esther goes to see Dr. Gordon and shows him a paper that she had written in childish handwriting, he prepares her for electric shock therapy. The treatments are painful and Esther no longer trusts Dr. Gordon. After this, Esther begins to plan her suicide. Her death is the only thing she thinks about. When Esther takes an overdose of sleeping pills, she is sent to another hospital in the country. At this hospital, she meets Joan, an old friend from college. Joan is suffering from mental illness as well, but doesn't appear to be as sick as Esther. When Esther does finally succeed in losing her virginity, she ends up with serious bleeding and must be treated in a hospital. Esther has a hard time understanding why her body is injured. She thought this would make her independent, but instead, she is more convinced of her problems. While she is recovering, she learns that Joan has committed suicide. Esther is very disturbed by this because she thought Joan was in better shape than she was. After this, Esther realizes that a relationship with a man is not important to her. She feels she doesn't need this kind of relationship to be well. But when she leaves the hospital, she is concerned about how long she will be well before her symptoms begin again. This is what she calls the Bell Jar.

There were many other women there too, and she made a few friends. From the time she arrived, she was slowly getting worse mentally, but no one realized it...not even her. She had many trials in her lifetime that led up to her breakdown. First, her father died when she was nine, leaving her with a mother and a brother, both of which she hated. She lost some friends. To make it worse, her first &quot;love interest&quot; betrayed her. All of these things made up her life that she hated to live. She ended up in many institutions, and she ended up hating all of her counselors. One put her into shock treatments, and the treatments scared her so much that she hid everytime she heard those words, fearing that it would be her that had to go through them. The other tried to help her by making he talk to her mother, whom she could not stand. She finally ended up confessing that she hates her mother and she always has. From that point on, she felt free from everything. Her first &quot;love interest&quot; ended up getting TB and got very sick. His girlfriend, Joan, ended up in the same institution that Esther was in. This upset her very mich. She was never close to Joan, but when Joan was found drowned, her patents called Esther and told her that she was one of Joan's best friends, and they asked her to come to the funeral. Esther went, and it was a whole new beginning for her. From that day on, she progressed a lot. She finally ended up getting to go home and she tried to lead a normal life.This book by Sylvia Plath was actually written about her own experiences as a nineteen-year-old girl in New York City. The book was written just as she remembered, but every name was changed. She committed suicide when she was in her early thirty's because of her life and the way it had turned out."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I could not relate to this book at all, and it was recommended by a good, albeit much younger, friend. So I wanted to enjoy it. Luckily I &#34;left&#34; it to read &#34;Wading Home.&#34; See my review.

It was interesting story about Esther trying to be healthy(in mental means) again after attempts to suiside. This gives readers, especially people who have depression, hope to readers that \`This is not the end, so don't give away your life so easily.'Also the title of \\"Bell Jar\\" which is compared to Esthers mind that was closed and not letting the hope to come in and keeping the despair among herself.Eventhought you think that you will not have any mental diseases like depression, after you read the book, you wouldn't feel safe that a person like Esther was also having depression that she tries to end her life. This is a story of a person's life over one's life. I would recommend others to read it since there was no book like this in the world."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"One of the best reads of my life. Dark, brooding, and insightful. This is a chronicle of an ambitious woman who happens to have problems. A brilliant woman poet on the verges of successful publication, depressive descents, mood swings, and family life. Sylvia Plath's autobiography of a time in her life under the Bell Jar."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Well i must admit i am not quite done the book...I am more then halfway though. It was good when i started it and has only gotten better. I am suprised at how much i like this classic novel. I was afraid at first thinking i would not be able to undertand her ideas, but inturn i found i liked the way she looked at life. I liked the comparisons she made and how she described things. Partially through you would think she had a split personallity. I am reading this book for a class but i did it very early because the plot seemed interesting. I had no idea i would like the book this much..i can hardly put it down."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"In reading this book I became very depressed. Esther didn't have any thing good to say about anyone. Everyone was ugly in some way. There was always something wrong. Of course, the shock treatments she had to endure would make anyone negative. What were those people thinking? The Bell Jar echoes madness from start to finish. The entire book was difficult to take. I didn't want to read time after time of Esther trying to end her life. In fact her life was really just beginning.The author Sylvia Plath puts her descriptive writing to great use. She chronicles Esther's life with great style. Esther just didn't have such a great life. Her boy friend, Buddy, was nothing but a thorn in her side. I think Esther felt she was above Buddy and rightly so. It's too bad Esther had to go mad during the time that she did. If this were to happen now there would be a lot better cures for her to turn to.I think it's difficult to read a book about going insane. I guess because it make you question your own sanity. The pressure that was on Esther was mainly the fact that she was an over achiever. The author wrote that she studied too much; she didn't really know when to quit. I think it was a very sad book. Too read about someone with such an enormous cloud over their head. Really more like a bell jar over their head."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"After finish reading &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; by Sylvia Plath, I wasn't left with those weird when emotions whne a really good book affects you. As a matter of fact, I wasn't surprise that the author committed suicide. In life, when people feel enclosed and that no one cares, people are driven to desperate measures. Especially during the time Esther/Sylvia were living in. Us women have to deal with many issues. Always have and always will. The novel just makes me think that does reality really exist or do we just live in a fantasy world and not care with goes on around us? Reality is much scarier than fiction."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"A review???

I read this book last fall and I could not wait to read a chapter every night before I went to sleep. Plath was a genius, first I read all her poems and then immediatley purchased The Bell Jar and I was fascinated with the story of Esther. This book is semi-autobiographical. Esther's world is turned upside down when her depression sinks deeper into thoughts of suicide. She resents her mother, wishes her father was still alive, and is rejected for her writings. The passage that frightened me the most is when Esther loses her virginity to a much older man, the way Plath describes this scene gave me chills and even the chapter where she tries to kill herself by slicing open her wrists made me a bit nauseous. But The Bell Jar is a quick, eloquent read, a must have for Plath fans everywhere!"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I love this book it is one of my favorites. I relate to the college experience and being unable to focus on physics :-) The setting is intriguing in New York and the time period is as well, classic.

I found Sylvia Plath to be very intriging. While I may not be considered a mature individual I feel I can easily connect with Plath's central character, Ester.

I only wish there was a sequel to this fantastic novel."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"For a school project I read Sylvia Plath's &quot;The Bell Jar&quot;. I thought this novel was very good. Sylvia Plath is a very talented writer and displays this in &quot;The Bell Jar&quot;. It is almost based off of Sylvia's life. Sylvia Plath writes in a way that it can make the most vivid pictures in your mind seem so real. And it is also written in an almost poetic way. You can almost feel Esther cutting her calves. This book especially caught me because Sylvia writes from her own life, from when she slowly fell into a deep depression, became metally ill, and eventually comitted suicide herself. Sylvia Plath is a phenomenal author and definently shows this with this novel.

On reading the books first third you'll find yourself agreeing. Plath takes us down a path, seeming to say, &quot;Look ahead. This will lead us to the end.&quot; Then we're repeatedly taken off of that path, down apparent detours without meaning or relevance. This is a deception.By the time you reach the halfway point you'll see that what seems to be important is only a grounding place for what surrounds it. What seems to be rambling is actually what is important. Eventually we abandon the original path completely, and find that all of those supposed meaningless detours were the true path all along, that the story's real importance lies within them."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"The Bell Jar is a truely captivating story. My english teacher was telling my class about the book and how her college roomate's grandmother was mentioned in the book(her character was Philomenia Guinea) so I decided to read it. I read the book in two sittings. You would think that it is depressing and morbid, but I really had a great appriciation of how Sylvia Plath described the character and the situation. Esther Greenwood is witty and independent as well as different and smarter than everyone else in the story. I recommend this book to anybody(especially women), the Bell Jar is a true classic."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Let me first say that in rating this novel, I waffled back and forth between 4 and 5 stars. I finally decidedo n 4 stars, but it could just as easily have been 5.Sylvia Plath made a name for herself with her poetry and this, her only novel. She was one of the confessionalist poets, along with Anne Sexton, she studied with Robert Lowell. The Bell Jar carries her confessionalistic work into fiction. This is based pretty heavily on her life. The Bell Jar is like a Catcher in the Rye for girls. It's pretty well written, though you can tell it is an inexperienced novelist. It is a shame she killed herself so young, because not only was she a great poet, but she had such potential to become a great fiction writer. Plath successfully carries us down into insanity with her protagonist. The narration works very well in keeping the reader as disjointed as our heroin (It's similiar to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in that matter, only not to the extreme--and it paints a prettier and more approving picture of the mental health system of the time). We never get a good idea as to why the breakdown occurs, but as in real life, these matters are often confusing. My biggest problem with the book isn't the somewhat juvenile style of writing, but it is the ending of the novel. It seems a little to pat. We don't feel that the narrator has worked through her problems, or that her mental health should be better, it just sort of becomes better. Plath should have spent a little more time working out the ending. But it is a fine novel, one that I enjoyed."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"After discovering that my English teacher shared some of my tastes in literature, I asked her to recommend me another book to read and &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; came up. This is one of the best novels I have read in a long time. Plath's writing is almost poetic, and the overall novel is such a beautiful reflection of her life. Although depressing (the novel almost brought me to tears twice), after reading it I felt a great sense of satisfaction. Although this is a biography of the authors life, this novel mirrors many issues that every young woman will go through, and for this reason, amongst many, I strongly recommend that every girl, teen and woman reads this novel (I'm not sure if the average male would enjoy reading it). Plath obviously puts her heart and soul into her writing, and it shows, so I, as a reader, was able to empathise with the author on so many levels that this novel has left a mark on my mind that will probably stay there forever. *sigh* I'm addicted to good reading..."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I hate reading, and usually have to be forced to read for school, but when I sat down with the Bell Jar, I read the first 150 pages in three days! The way that the author presents her stories and situations, not only do you get a detailed understanding of what she is going through, but you start to wonder what is ACTUALLY wrong with her. You come to a point when you don't consider her crazy, but you look at her as misunderstood! I love this book, and I wish that it had never ended! I know that everyone will love it, boys, girls, young, and old! This book should be read by all, although not through school, at some time or another! WOW!!"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I was scared to pick up this book a couple of years ago because a friend had told me that it was dark and depressing, and I somehow formed an unfairly morbid picture of the book - for it is NOT dark and depressing. It is dark in some ways, but I would not say that it is depressing. It would be more accurate to say that it is disturbing at times, but this facet should in no way discourage a potential reader.The main reason you should read this book is because a powerful and touching story is told. This is, however, only one reason.It's worth reading because Sylvia Plath has a pure voice that rings. She is witty. Her words have punch. She paces words well and she uses words well, precisely. One thing I love best about her writing is its immediacy - she reminds me of how I want to write. She brings the reader right in, with not a lot of prelude setup. And once you scramble a bit to know exactly what's going on and who everyone is, you soon enough you do. It's a small wonder - it's a great way to write.If you enjoyed Catcher in the Rye, I'm almost completely certain that you would enjoy this book - because her tone is the most similar to Salinger's that I have ever encountered. It's a different voice, of course, it's her own, but she shares a certain intangible with him that is captivating.In summary, it's not exactly an easy read because she gives us a lot to digest, but it's a book that's definitely worth the journey."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Though what ultimately happens in this book is something that shouldn't be taken lightly, Plath was able sprinkle amusing incidents throughout the plot that make this book deserving of its &quot;classic&quot; classification.

Because I knew from other reviews that this was a book based on the author's own depression, I anticipated it to be mostly serious, however I was surprised that I ended up giggling through most of the book. I strongly recommend this book for any young woman or aspiring poet."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"This is the only novel written by the famous poet Sylvia Plath. It is autobiographical in many aspects and covers her attempted suicide. The critics thought this book wasn't as literary as they had expected and I agree that it was more fun than seriously literary. They predicted the next novel that she was in the process of writing would be better in a literary sense but she never finished it before her suicide. I agree that the book is not of the same literary quality as her poems and that this is worth mentioning in a book review, but it was still great and it is a must read for any Plath fan.This novel starts with the heroine's coveted internship with a posh fashion magazine in New York City, and then retracts to cover past aspects of her life, such as college and dating. The story then continues to the heroine's descent into madness, including her experiences with phsycologists and asylums and electric shock therapy.This is one of the best books I have read recently. Parts of it made me laugh out load and other parts made me incredibly sad. The heroine experienced and felt things so deeply, and Plath had a way of making me feel them and experience them along with her. This is a fast-paced and still thought-provoking book that I finished very quickly, and then went back to read some parts again and savor the sweet little details. The Bell Jar deserves to be on everyone's bookshelf, or better yet, bedside table, being read and reread again for the delicious little emotional masterpiece that it is."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"The Bell Jar was a novel of which was unusual than anything that I have ever read.

I just thought this novel was well-written, very emotional, and it's an interesting topic to write about. Not many people are comfortable with discussing mental illness.

The main character, Esther, was relatable. Of course one must overlook the setting and date. I was blown away by Sylvia Plath's ability to describe the intense emotions that she'd gone through. For one such as myself, who had never come in contact with a person with these issues, I was stunned to, on a certain level, feel I could relate to them. The further you got into the book, the more legitimate you found her ideas. By the time I'd finished, I found myself questioning why she was institutionalized.

Esther Greenwood opens the book as a normal girl trying to write in New York City. She then spirals downward into her eventual breakdown. Sylvia Plath vividly describes Esther's disease and her road to recovery. I know this is a short description but the book is SO good that I didn't want to say more to ruin it.

Knowing that Sylvia Plath actually went through most of the book's events herself makes the story all the more moving. If only everyone could be as truthful as Esther Greenwood! This book is quite indescribable, so you must read it for yourself. However, if I had to compare it to another book, I would say Sanlinger's &quot;The Catcher in the Rye.&quot; Esther Greenwood is like Holden Caulfield's female counterpart. If you couldn't stand Holden Caulfield though, don't let this stop you from reading &quot;The Bell Jar.&quot; The raw emotions this book deals with are so real, it is almost scary to think what society can do to an individual.

A book specific to the time period of the \`50s, it's easy to see why &lt;u>The Bell Jar&lt;/u> is considered a classic American novel, showing promise to modern literature. Not knowing that Sylvia Plath wrote this book in the late \`50s and early \`60s, one could guess that the novel was composed in the year 2004. The vernacular is plain and doesn't over-achieve the standards of comprehension, the way older books sometimes seem to do. With themes of suicide and mental instability, Plath does a terrific job of staying realistic instead of writing in an overemotional, \\"teenaged\\" way- which is what I liked most, being 16 and not proud of the irrational way teens think. Esther, the protagonist, is mature and logical in her struggles.As to not summarize the book, in short, &lt;u>The Bell Jar&lt;/u> is a perfect example of an understandable, personal American classic. Acting as one of the stepping stones to modern literature, Plath's autobiographical fiction is a work of art you wont forget."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I read this book at the recommendation of friends and a book. I was guaranteed a modern masterpiece and a feminist one to boot. I got all of that. Every woman has a bit of Esther in themselves. We must follow a straight and narrow path in our lives and if we don't we face being branded much as Esther was. We question marriage and we're crazy because marriage has existed for so long. Sylvia Plath has even captured the feelings that many women feel about losing their virignity, the pressure and the fear. The ending is one of hope. She steps into the light, but we all know that there was no happy ending for Sylvia Plath. She died because she never escaped her bell jar and left behind a profound work on the experience of that bell jar. Is Esther really crazy? I can't answer that, but I can say that Esther(and Plath) were feminists and they questioned our society's customs. Despite the tragedy, we're fortunate to have this work. Read it when you're questioning yourself or authority."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"THE BELL JAR is often compaired to Salinger's CATCHER IN THE RYE. There is actually a certain basis for this: both novels deal with youthful characters who are completely disenchanted by the world. But beyond this the comparison breaks down, for where CATCHER is essentially a character study, Plath's BELL JAR presents us with a tightly plotted story concerning a young woman's descent into insanity, and is in my opinion considerably more successful in an overall sense than virtually anything Salinger ever wrote.The novel is largely autobiographical, recounting one of Plath's most notorious mental collapses that led to a very famous sucide attempt. In dealing with this personally volatile material, Plath shows remarkable control, and gracefully walks the fine line between carefully crafted fiction and self-indulgence, creating in the process a modern classic indicative of America at mid-century.Plath herself considered the book simply a commercial &quot;pot boiler,&quot; a project undertaken in the hope of generating some cash. It is quite true that book is clearly written as a popular novel rather than serious fiction; it is also quite true that the book generates enough heat to boil water. But Plath was a uniquely gifted artist, and her talent simply bursts the seams of the genre: the book is possessed of a stunning passion and numerous powerful images delivered in a singularly uncompromising tone. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"In my neurotic workings to make myself a more literate & urbane creature, i've undertaken a number of the recommended \\"reading lists\\" that have come to plague my life, psyche and bank account. To many of you who have probably already read this novel and are just glazing your brain away at amazon reviews, you will not be suprised the Mrs. Plath's novella graced a spot on many of the said lists. Also, over the years i've always come to notice the books reputation, often for darkness. Naturally being a guy, i've also not failed to notice that the Bell Jar is often a well placed accessory of many if the stylish thinking-girl types.(I swear i've not met a man who has read it, or admits to having read it)So I plunged into it, expecting a maddening, dark tale that would explain the trend of certain girls who like to cut themselves. Instead I was just impressed that i could see the very honest report of feelings of depression and anxiety. It wasn't really dark at all I felt, it just showed well what it is like to be in that realm of detachment and uncertainity that a great deal of youths have found themselves in. I almost hate to say it because i know that it is trite, but the novel makes a good companion piece with Salinger's Catcher in the Rye. The book was enough to make me interested in Plaths poetry as well,(i'm very interested in reading Ariel), and now I feel I can property join the thousands of others who are sad that such a talent was been snuffed out so early and unable to have a full life of work within the realm of American letters."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I am a 35 year old male. This shouldn't matter, but as \\"The Bell Jar\\" over the years has become more a punchline than literature, the fact that I was not a young woman between the ages of 16 and 23 kept me from tackling it. I was pretty sure I couldn't relate. This is a fallacy of my own making. This book IS about being a woman to an extent, but it is also a profound look into the nature of humanity and the often inane way that we just begin to slip and then fall. There are always deeper reasons for slipping into darkness, but the reality is that they are not necessarily clear when we are fighting off the demons. This is where therapists often fail. They need to NAME the cause of the malady, like dianosing you with cancer. Where Plath succeeds most in her book is her treatment of the unknown quality of the downward spiral. Sure, peppered throughout the book there and hints and allegations of potential trauma, but, thankfully, they are not dwelt upon. It does get a bit obtuse in the middle, but it quickly snaps itself back into shape for a very profound final scene. I highly recommend it FOR ANY READER.

Esther Greenwood fascinated me with the way her thinking and actions gradually became more and more bizarre.

Looking for a good read--this is a good bet."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Sylvia Plath's, The Bell Jar, is a novel that will take you into the world of Esther Greenwood. A young girl clinging to straws trying to find her place in the world. The language that Plath uses is simple yet vivid, taking you into the mind of a depressed girl. From beginning to end you follow the journey from the unknown purpose in life into something much deeper and much more dark.The sentences start as if in the mind of a sane person and begin to subtly change into the mind of someone with a darkness setting in and leaving you with the eerie feeling that something is happening...but you aren't quite sure what.The vivid language stays with you and the characters that move in and out of Esther's life have a lasting effect on the reader, just as they have had on her.The beginning of the novel starts \\"It was a queer and sultry summer, the summer they electrocuted the Rosenbergs, and I didn't know what I was doing in New York.\\" This simple sentence thrusts you into Esther's life and you will not forget the journey of a young girl sitting in the bell jar trying to escape."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Sylvia Plath was an incredibly bright, feeling person who was terribly disturbed by the ideas lurking in the dark corners of her mind. I think that depression is something that befalls an extraordinary amount of brilliant artists. (Some psychologists say depressed people have it right...which is...comforting when you are depressed but scary all the same.) Through reading these words that Sylvia pressed to paper, you really get an idea of the sadness that plagued her and eventually led to her suicide. She is a wonderful writer and you will feel inspired by her accomplishments as well as quite sorrowful for the life that was taken by a sickness that clearly wasn't treated. Some people seem too intelligent for their own good and she is definitely one of them.Oh, and this book is labeled as fiction but it seems more like an autobiography that perhaps isn't totally accurate."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"This book is pretty great. When I first started it, it felt sort of like a female Catcher in the Rye. Esther is a likeable character and a relatable teen in the beginning. Then her journey into a nervous breakdown begins. It is an interesting look into what was most likely Plath's battle with mental illness. I recommend the book. It is a quick, easy read and not nearly as dark as some others seem to describe it as being."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"A portrait of madness written with a light touch. Breathtaking, sad and timeless. A must read for lovers of personal literature of the 20th century."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Reading the Bell Jar I got pulled into Esters world. Sylvia Plath pulls you into the world of a young woman and her slip into depression. In the first couple pages she speaks about seeing a cadaver for the first time, and that is just enough to tweek your intrest. The way she speaks about some things can make you either bond with her or think she is compleatly insane.When I read this book i couldnt put it down and once i finished it stayed in my brain for days. This is possibly one of my favorite books that I've read in a long time and would highly recommend reading it."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"The Bell Jar is an insight into a young girl's mind and how life influenced the way she thought and how she acted. It's a very good read because everyone has been upset or depressed sometime in their life and this lets you know that there is someone else out there who is going through the same thing.The prospect of chemistry also plays a major role in the book. Esther, the main character was affected by medicines and the behaviors of others which all played into why she was so lonely and suicidal. The novel goes into amazing detail of the current situation that Esther was in and how she reacted to them, it showed how she developed and grew with her experiences and how she finally overcame her illness. This novel is not only well written but it opens up a fictional character's heart and lets people examine it and therefore fully comprehend what is going on and why it's occurring. It informs people about depression and sparks their interest about it while using immense literary tactics to allow readers to truly enjoy the entire story."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Sylvia Plath was one of the greatest writers to live, in my opinon. And The Bell Jar captures her disturbing brilliance perfectly. I found myself having several things in common with Esther, leading me to question my own sanity. But nonetheless, this book is amazing. Read it and you will not be sorry."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Sylvia Plath paints a vivid portrait of a privileged life gone terribly wrong. The Bell Jar is a (somewhat) autobiographical account of Plath's breakdown and depression. This novel gives you an intimate look at the story behind the poetry. Somewhere along the way, this amazing author/poet suffered a breakdown which sent her spiraling into a deep and rather dark depression. The Bell Jar explains to readers, in almost desturbing detail, Plath's story from her time at Smith College to the various asylums in which she was treated by such meathods as electroshock therapy. A definate must-read for all Plath fans as well as anyone looking for someone to relate to during difficult times. In relation to the controversy over the novel and Plath's suicide, I must say that it only intregues the reader more and inspires them to learn more about this inspirational author/poet."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"This is the only novel written by the famous poet Sylvia Plath. It is autobiographical in many aspects and covers her attempted suicide. The critics thought this book wasn't as literary as they had expected and I agree that it was more fun than seriously literary. They predicted the next novel that she was in the process of writing would be better in a literary sense but she never finished it before her suicide. I agree that the book is not of the same literary quality as her poems and that this is worth mentioning in a book review, but it was still great and it is a must read for any Plath fan.This novel starts with the heroine's coveted internship with a posh fashion magazine in New York City, and then retracts to cover past aspects of her life, such as college and dating. The story then continues to the heroine's descent into madness, including her experiences with phsycologists and asylums and electric shock therapy.This is one of the best books I have read recently. Parts of it made me laugh out load and other parts made me incredibly sad. The heroine experienced and felt things so deeply, and Plath had a way of making me feel them and experience them along with her. This is a fast-paced and still thought-provoking book that I finished very quickly, and then went back to read some parts again and savor the sweet little details. The Bell Jar deserves to be on everyone's bookshelf, or better yet, bedside table, being read and reread again for the delicious little emotional masterpiece that it is."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"To be honest, if there's one thing that I didn't understand in this book, it's the title.The rest just made perfect sense.Plath is clearly a poet of some kind. Her writing flows beautifully and lyrically. It has the smooth edge only a poet can achieve in fiction. This is both a positive thing and a negative one. While it makes aspects incredibly well written, it also makes the book a tad bit over-indulgent.Or, it would, if there wasn't the whole story around it. Without having known Plath's background story when I picked this up, I knew instantly that this was real. Perhaps the name was changed and some things tweaked, but this just breathed so perfectly. I knew that this was honest, open, and true, and the whole world of Sylvia Plath/Esther Greenwood sucked me in.It went beyond the nice writing. It went into the emotions. I couldn't tear myself away from the book. It made me think, it made me wonder, and it (most of all) made me feel. At times I was disgusted, at times I was amazed, at times I was crying - but I was there all along. It's a vivid, clear account of depression, and a world that is practically unknown.What's for sure is that this will stay with me for years to come, both in my mind and in my heart. It makes one appreciate life without depression, teaches a lot, and is an overall incredible, breath-taking ride.A necessity."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Sylvia Plath has always managed to chill me and amaze me with her awesome talent with words, but until you have read The Bell Jar, you haven't experienced the full mastery of Sylvia Plath. I received The Bell Jar last year on my 14th birthday and when I first read it, it was like yet another slap in the face delivered by Sylvia. This book is a huge reality check and yes, like Sylvia's other works, it can be quite disturbing at times. The Bell Jar doesn't try to amuse you by saying that the world is a big happy place like many other novels do. It deals with reality - real issues and real fears surrounding a young woman searching for an identity in a harsh, unrelenting world. Sylvia Plath isn't afraid to tell you what the world is really like and how it can break a woman who's future seems a bright one. But the character's (Esther Greenwood) transitions from sanity to insanity are so subtle that it is difficult to distinguish the two at times. The Bell Jar is a look into the human mind that is dark and sadly cynical at times, but it is a novel that anyone can relate to. Everyone is searching for an identity just as Sylvia's Esther Greenwood was. And anyone can cross the thin line that separates sanity from insanity, just as Sylvia Plath did."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"In a world of over-medicated persons, \\"The Bell Jar\\" delivers what modern medicine cannot... a look into the life of a person without the use of modern medication or therapies. \\"The Bell Jar\\" delivers an insight into the world of the depressed woman, then and now. For a person in some sort of depressed state, Sylvia Plath gives us a world in which someone \\"understands\\".While she did not end her life on a good note, for those in need of understanding and not just \\"a good read\\", \\"The Bell Jar\\" offers a shoulder to lean on... a possible much needed cry.If you are reading this just as a classic novel, her metaphor and use of grammar to convey her life and loss is at it's peak. She give us a story thick with imagery, location, and tangible emotion. Her vivid scope of mental illness and the lengths one will go to in a chance to feel something other than a sense of loss or anguish, is all at once painful and beautiful. You know exactly where she is coming from, even if you have never experienced it for yourself. She transports us to a place and state of mind that is malicious and elegant... troubled and decadent.Sylvia's poetry is wonderful, if that is what you are looking for. But it is her novels, short stories, letters, and prose that can send you to a place where even the average person feels a kinship with this tortured soul. And tortured is exactly what she conveys.... those demons that in the end, caught up with her all too soon."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I first read this book when I was 12, and to my English teacher's horror: I received the question \\"Does your mother know you're reading that!?\\" to which I had the all-too-smug pleasure of being able to honestly reply that \\"Yes, she does, as she is the one who suggested it.\\"The Bell Jar is just incredible, hands down. I am not the kind of reader who regards it as a sort of proto-feminist canon, instead, I try to limit myself to taking it in through its most legitimate, face-value feeling. There is a \\"realness\\" to it that is just too good.As poor a context for crediting it with anything positive as it is, it was my first literary introduction to New York City. There are scenes in it that, even now- years later, stand out so clearly in my mind: when she's walking down the street in the midle of the night, drunk out of her mind, and yet somehow lucid enough to find her way home- tracing her hand along the sides of buildings all the way; or the time she stands outside, stories and stories up in the building she's staying in, and proceeds to throw all her clothes out the window, one by one, floating away in the New York midnight breeze.There is a numbness to the story that trudges along like a silent locomotive: you know the tracks are out ahead and the crash is imminent, you just don't know how, or when, or where, or just how bad it will be. And it is bad, it is really bad, but that's also why it's so good. Not to say that tragedy is a hallmark of literary worth, but the tragedy \\"works\\" here because it is just simply too real.As other reviewers have noted, it is a little disturbing that it ends well, when Plath, herself did not. Yet, in the end, maybe that is the best irony of it? Regardless, it's one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Many times I have noticed Sylvia Plath's intimate autobiographical novel labeled as a \\"feminist novel\\" or placed in Listmania lists of feminist books. Although, \\"feminism\\" is a term that has been loosely defined, I want to say, \\"Uh-uh.\\" Do a few encounters with jerky men constitute a feminist label? I doubt it. Does its portrayal of a woman being labeled mentally ill and sent to an asylum make it a feminist book? Not if she is. Does a gifted woman writing a harrowing, interesting, well-written novel some kind of achievement for all women? No, although it many be a big step for how literary society views female writers. But that's beside the point, which is the central themes of the book.To me, a feminist book or a feminist anything is something with an agenda, a central theme, calling people to stand up or portraying something preeminent as just or unjust. None of that appears in the Bell Jar's central themes: desperation, depression, pressure. You could overanalyze the book and say the themes stemmed from a male dominated society, but I truly doubt that society or the women it suppresses were a big enough part of the book to say so. The Bell Jar is, if anything, about an inward struggle to come to grips with depression and regaining an interest in life. I think feminists see the beauty of this book and want to assimilate into their agenda. Sorry, no strings attached here. Just a good, thought-provoking and, most of all, moving book."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"&quot;The Bell Jar&quot; is many things. When you read it in your teens, like I did many years ago, it's a survival manual on how to get through the idiocy and incomprehension of other people. When you're a bit older, it's a harrowing and scoriating tale of mental breakdown, given extra edge by the public history of its author. When you're a bit older still (I am now about the age that Plath was when she wrote it), it suddenly reveals itself as not just an artful novel but a frighteningly funny one as well.Even Plath's best poetry has been criticised for occasional glibness, and I have to agree. The sardonic drawl of parts of &quot;Lady Lazarus&quot;, for example, doesn't move me like I think it's supposed to - Plath not quite on form can sound like a more extreme, free-verse Dorothy Parker - and the jackboot rhythm of &quot;Daddy&quot; goes on a few stanzas too long, like one of John Lennon's more doggedly sincere creations. Plath's most brilliant poetry has a pure surrealism, a mythological quality, light years from this obviousness.However, in &quot;The Bell Jar&quot;, her liking (and talent) for cracking black jokes is in perfect sync with her panic and her fear of emptiness. This novel takes bitchiness to epic extremes - it's hyper-bitchy, it's suicidally bitchy. The flat, pale tone is always rendering things with the painful vividness you get from the early stages of a migraine. I laugh out loud at Buddy Willard's pathetic attempts at seduction (&quot;Esther, have you ever seen a man?&quot;), and I also hate him for not being more stylish, for being such a smug, humourless prig. The fat medical student who smirks &quot;At least your mother loves you&quot; is a tiny, unforgettable, unforgivable cameo.Esther on boys is whipcrack lethal, and this is both funny and part of her tragedy. I'll never forget the &quot;bitter, hawk-nosed Southerner from Yale&quot; who comes on all weatherbeaten and streetwise and then writes her a letter saying &quot;he thought he might be really able to love me, I was so intelligent and cynical and yet had such a kind face, surprisingly like his older sister's&quot; - Esther's reaction is &quot;so I knew it was no use&quot; and she breaks off relations with him.The reason this book isn't your average memoir of a depressed girlhood is that Plath wasn't just the wannabe journalist that Esther (and dozens of imitators) have been, she was an exceptional poet. The underlying sensibility is obsessive, mythological, not novelistic. Plath/Esther has an incredible sensitivity to brute Things, but she doesn't relish them or get curious about them the way a Nabokov would - she experiences them as weapons directed against her. New York at night is not a fun place full of happy people, but a lonely hell of &quot;tropical, stale heat&quot;. The UN Secretariat building is not a place where people work but a &quot;weird, green, Martian honeycomb&quot;. The feverish style of the first half of the book is stunned into calmness in the second half, when Esther is institutionalised and has had ECT; but it does its work in putting us right inside the spiked, angry cell of Esther's mind.&quot;The Bell Jar&quot; is a one-off. Plath's other fiction is trivial next to it. It gets better on rereading. I'll probably always turn to it sooner than the poems; for all her demons, Esther is good company, and her story is told with great truth and great artfulness."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"As one who suffers, somewhat, from ADHD, reading books have become a chore for me. Sylvia Plath's THE BELL JAR has always held a fascination for me, given my existential love of Dostoyevsky and others, but it is one I have only read bits and pieces of, from time-to-time.This audio book, read by Maggie Gyllenhall, literally \\"blew me away\\" with its over developed sentences woven by Ms. Plath, woven in such a manner as sugar crystals cross and re-cross each other as they form cotton candy at the county fair each fall in the small Southern neck of the woods where I was raised. I had heard of Ms. Gyllenhall, and knew of her movies, but I was not prepared to listen to such an exceptional audio interpretation, read in a manner that captured the essence of Ms. Plath's downward spiral into insanity.The words are sheer poetry, with metaphors written upon metaphors, in such a manner that enhances, rather than confuse, the spirit of the book and, and an almost innate understanding of what she is going through. While one wishes, hopes, prays, that she'll get better, the reader remembers, with sadness, how this allegorical account of Ms. Plath has no happy ending....If you haven't read THE BELL JAR, or even if you have, and you have seven plus hours to immerse yourself in a great undertaking, do buy this audio book and reflect upon a pleasure one gets from hearing a true wordsmith write of the confusion she along must deal with called \\"life.\\""},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"The hot steam rising off the streets of New York City and the buzz of the Rosenberg case emitting from the radios and televisions laid the foundations for the fragile construct of what became known as Ester Greenwood's Bell Jar. It serves as a euphemism for the period in Ester's life that captures within its confines her gradual breakdown. Ester Greenwood was an aspiring, appraised writer who was sent to New York for a month long internship at an esteemed women's magazine, an opportunity which ensured her job security in the future, fine clothing, food, and accommodations, and the opportunity to work with a renowned editor by the name of Jay Cee. In a situation devised to launch Ester's burgeoning career and future, Ester breaks down to the point she can no longer read, write, or function. What brought about such a decline in what appeared to be such a firm, confident woman?Sylvia Plath eloquently paints the decline of Ester Greenwood in the novel because it is a self-portrait of her life and her past. The revolutionary work depicts a witty, insightful caricature of Sylvia Plath and her deep, dark struggle with accepting the role of a mother and wife, fulfilling society's expectations. Ester's rebellion against the confines of the female spirit entraps her in the Bell Jar, a world that restrains her from attaining her intellectual and career goals. This invisible barrier leads Ester to thoughts of suicide and self-deprecation. Her relations with her family, friends, and lovers are caught in the web of her confusion, and as the web become more complex, Ester's thoughts become darker and she plummets further into oblivion.Plath so expressively elaborates the decline of Ester and constructs the perfect conditions for her downfall. From the setting of the hot, steamy, bustling New York City streets to the calmly eerie street her mother lives on, Ester's surroundings depict her own feelings and state of mind. She begins in a state of confusion but relative bliss in her plush New York City hotel, to isolation and dreary thoughts of various deaths she could incur while staring out the window alone in her mother's quiet house. Ester's talk about alcoholic beverages additionally gives insight into her state of mind, when she goes from craving soothing, cooling drinks that appeal to her like vodka, to craving a wet and depressing drink that \\"tasted more and more like dead water\\".The honesty with which Plath portrays Ester, stripping her down to flesh and bone, exposing every daring, suicidal, morbid thought that dashed through her mind, to her random revelations, allows for anyone to find some channel to connect with Ester. The confidence of the reader is won over by her modesty and frank nature, making them vulnerable to her spell. Under the pseudonym of Ester in The Bell Jar, Plath paints the inspiring and intriguing story of a renaissance woman. In every sense of the word she is a woman; she resisted male domination and spun a raw, uncensored and unsweetened depiction of the effects of society on a young, defenseless woman."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"** spoiler alert ** The first time I read this book, I got to the suicide scene really late at night and it freaked me out so much I vowed never to read it again.

She is recognized as brilliant by her peers and by the committees who keep awarding her scholarships and academic prizes. She has won the opportunity to spend the summer in New York city, living a glamorous life as a magazine junior editor.All of the opportunities of the world are open to Esther.... and this fact absolutely paralyzes her. She is terrified of making the wrong decision, of losing out on something by choosing something else. She begins to feel that doing anything at all is futile and nothing in her life matters anyway.When Esther is passed over for an elite summer writing course, her world begins to crumble. She feels as though her life is slipping from her control, and she spends a great deal of time thinking about the various ways she could commit suicide. It seems that drastic measures are required to calm Esther's troubled mind, and she finds them in an asylum for women.I found the workings of Esther's mind to be fascinating. In so many respects she seems like any young woman trying to find her place in the world and decide which path she will take and, by definition, which paths will be left behind. The mental anguish she faces at participating in day-to-day life, though, is clear and beautifully written. Esther is smart and amusing and terribly troubled, and it was devastating to read about her decline and her difficulties with simply living her life."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I read several reviews about this book and I wasn't sure if I should have purchased it.

The syllabus called for a few of Ralph Ellison's works, Toni Morrison's, and Sylvia Plath's. Sadly, since the course was only ten weeks, Sylvia Plath's \\"The Bell Jar\\" was not discussed in the class. I didn't bother to read the book until out of college.After reading reviews online, I decided that I needed to take the time to read it. Plath starts the story off really slow with Esther Greenwood explaining her internship over the summer. For the first fifty pages I had no idea why it was deemed a classic. However, though slow, I still had a desire to read what happened to Ms. Greenwood. The more that I read of the book, the harder is was to put down. If she would have shown the same symptoms today, I do not believe that she would have been locked up in an asylum. The book really makes society take a deep stare into itself to observe what is happening to the people of the nation.Being an English literature major in college, I had the opportunity to read countless classics and consider myself to be well read. I can honestly say that \\"The Bell Jar\\" is the only book that is considered a 'classic' that has ever made me cry uncontrollably one minute (when reading about the electro shock treatments) and then a few moments later be laughing hyterically (when Esther gives the nurse a piece of her mind when he serves her two different kinds of beans in one meal).This book is a must read for the female population, and I recommend everyone reading it. I don't really know why but I had a tendency to compare Esther to Holden Caulfield because of her self destruction and her \\"could care less about what is right\\" attitude. It's such a shame that Plath took her life so early when she clearly had an incredible gift of writing."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"This is my favorite book of all time.

Plath beautifully wrote her story about a woman's undefinable mental battles combined with the demands of instant perfection from others (academically, socially, career-wise, and talent-wise), her own insecurities, and her own desires to be what she wanted on her own terms (something that didn't happen in her generation.) I could really relate to Esther in many ways, and I was swept away with the beauty in which it was written. It was interesting to be someone on the outside looking in on someone who was on the inside looking out. It was also interesting to get a glimpse of the struggle professional and intellectual women faced with the demands of 1950's housewife society.

Sylvia Plath fell into the latter category, and while the positive end of her spectrum meant that she created some shockingly good work, the negative end ensured that she would meet a tragic and self-inflicted end. Her suicide I think, remains the most mechanical, yet most poetic death of all the great writers, and it's a pity that shes often remembered as \`that woman poet who stuck her head in an oven' when in fact she was well spoken, eloquent woman whose command over the English language was much vaster and encompassing than yours or mine.\\"The Bell Jar\\", her only full length fictional prose work, is almost autobiographical in patches. The publishers make it clear that this is not Plaths' own story, but you cannot help but identify the lead character as Plath herself. The way I see it is this - Sylvia created a fictional character, but gave it her mind and thoughts, leading to one of the most fascinating fictional characters in modern prose. To me, this was the literary equivalent of a convergence of both David Lynch's masterpieces \\"Inland Empire\\" and \\"Mulholland Drive\\". The same \\"a woman in trouble, yet she doesn't know it yet\\" theme permeates the entire novel, and by the time it reaches its (somewhat obvious) conclusion, you're left wondering how Plath didn't invest more of her time in churning out full fledged prose novels.Simply put, this novel chronicles the descent of a womans' mind, but its so much more than that. It speaks of mental disease with a frankness that the author probably didn't quite comprehend at the time. Maybe she did, but either way, I think what she was doing her was to capture the state of her own mind frame by frame until that fateful day in real life when she so notoriously took her own life. \\"The Bell Jar\\" has its moment of adolescent wandering and naivete, which I found quite endearing considering the age of the author when she wrote this. Perhaps she wasn't mature enough to deal with life as she grew older, or maybe she was too caught up in her own web of literary wonder to crawl out of it. I think all the great poets were afflicted to some degree with this disease, and Plath is no exception.If you're interested in a semi-autobiographical (though the blurb won't admit it!) book by a great poet, this is the book for you. Its never boring, and is quite an easy read as Sylvia trades in her famous double entendre poetic metaphors for more easily accessible and simply written language. Short crisp sentences. Clear dialogue. And yet, the sentences get shorter, and thoughts get more fragmented as we plummet with the author into the very depths of insanity. An unforgettable, and somewhat scary experience - but as a book lover, one you should definitely experience.Five Stars."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"Sylvia Plath was one of those mysterious figures in twentieth century literature whose work I had never read...until now. This is one of those rare novels that is arresting from the first page to the last, not least because of its obvious autobiographical nature, in its thinly veiled descriptions of characters drawn from Plath's life during a six month period in her early twenties, primarily in the character of Esther herself. Plath indicated after the novel was written that this work was autobiographical, with only the addition of a little fiction to give it a little more colour. We witness the descent into herself of a compelling literary character, one in whom the seeds of melancholy reside deeply. The society girl who does not quite fit in, not feeling fully connected with her friends, her boyfriend, or herself. One who has a mother who is remote, a father who died while she was a young girl; a younger brother who is absent. She disconnects further, and we see the marks of a deep depression descend on her, as she starts to withdraw from life into her solitude, and a wretched one at that. Depression and sleeplessness and hopelessness overtake her and she goes through the motions of therapy, treatment, being committed to an asylum, electro-shock treatment, a pervasive obsession with death and suicide, and ultimately, several attempts to end her life. This would be great fiction if indeed the sadness of its direct parallels to Plath's life were not present. Some of her descriptions are deeply disturbing, in a way that I have only otherwise encountered in someone like Augusten Burroughs (a present day writer of a similarly harrowing memoir, \\"Running With Scissors\\"). In any event, this novel is further truth that some of history's finest writers and artists are also among those most tortured and unhappy.Not a happy read at all, rather one that left me with an overwhelming sadness, but filled with appreciation for its beauty and strength. Despite her early departure from this earth (Plath ended her life shortly after the publication of \\"The Bell Jar\\"), this work, along with her collections of poetry, remains and keeps her alive to those who read her words."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I had heard of \\"The Bell Jar\\" for a long time before I picked it up to read it. My friend and fellow writer, Greg Goodsell, liked to read Sylvia Plath's work at the Open Mic's we attended. I would hear her name and think, \\"I am so woefully under-educated in these classics.\\" For the past few years I have set to righting that wrong.Sylvia Plath's tale of Esther Greenwood's stumble into insanity mirrors her own journey in many uncanny ways. It is not unlike the words of Virginia Woolf who wrote \\"\\"If one shuts one's eyes and thinks of the novel as a whole, it would seem to be a creation owning a certain looking-glass likeness to life.\\"Esther's life mirrors not only Plath's life, it also mirrors many others of us who have experienced depression. The voice is as clear and familiar as the rooms in my home - known intimately through daily experience. Plath's writing is evocative, clear and haunting.We are witness to Esther's journey first as an intern at a woman's magazine - a highly coveted position - to her tumble into deep depression, hospitalization, and return to \\"the outside\\". We witness her continued losses (one of her friends succumbs to suicide, her experience of shock treatment, her first love relationships.My favorite lines in the montage of tremendous lines are these, both from the final chapter::\\"A fresh fall of snow blanketed the asylum grounds, not a Christmas sprinkle, but a man-high January deluge, the sort tha snuffs out schools and offices and churches, and leaves, for a day or more, a pure, blank sheet in place of memo pads, date books and calendars.\\"\\"I took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart. I am, I am, I am....\\"This book is now used in many classrooms. This is a very good thing, to explore insanity as well as witness a writer capable of creating such beauty and at the same time, not being able to continue with her own life.I would also suggest readers study Plath's poetry, my favorite collection being \\"Ariel\\". Finally, if you are especially taken with the life of Sylvia Plath, there is a DVD you may want to rent starring Gwyneth Paltrow in the lead role and is entitled \\"Sylvia.\\" I found it to be highly telling and entertaining."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I found Sylvia Plath's \\"The Bell Jar\\" to be an excellent read and source of understanding. It is not just another book, but a mirror in which the souls of many are reflected. Young women of all generations, both young and old, can relate to the situations young Elly finds herself in, from the awkward boys she meets and the \\"perfect\\" best friend, to the moments she feels as though life itself is not worth living. Ultimately, she is the female version of young Holden Caufield, and for that reason, the book finds such success.While I found it quite easy to relate to the main character in the book, I found bits and pieces of the story itself to be quite confusing. Several questions remain unanswered, and one must work actively to \\"connect the dots.\\" However, perhaps the abrupt twists and turns Plath takes throughout the story are meant to throw the reader off course, and further explore the inner workings of Elly's psyche.All in all, I would rank Plath's \\"The Bell Jar\\" at 5 stars, because that it was it truly deserves. Never before has a book kept my mind so intrigued and eager to move forward than that about a young woman named Elly."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"In the autobiographical novel of a young girl struggling with her place in life, I have learned about the society of the 1950's and the workings of a brilliant mind gone awry in Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar. This young girl is Ester Greenwood, a teenager enrolled in the honors program in her college, and who seems to be having everything go her way. Her high school love, Buddy Willard, proposed to her, and she was also sent on a scholarship to see the glamour and glitz of NYC for a month. All this may seem like a dream come true, but Ester finds herself in a nightmare. Her friends don't seem to matter to her, she is repulsed by fianc&eacute;e-to-be, and her dream of becoming a professor/poet isn't as enticing as it once was. Ester keeps sinking down deeper into a slump and becomes more detached from the world. When she comes home for the summer, her condition worsens, she swallows a bottle of sleeping pills, and shortly finds herself in a mental hospital. Her recovery is steady, and eventually is released before her next college term, but she learns important lessons about herself and her world in the mean time.These lessons involve the complicated society of the 1950's, where women are happy being wives and homemakers, and willingly submit to their husbands. Ester's mental instability was not portrayed as dark and disturbed, but merely confused. Ester found herself \\"sitting in the crotch of a fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant loosing all the rest, and as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.\\" (63) One fig was a husband, another a successful career, and still another a ticket around the world. Ester's indecision 50 years ago made me realize how people have stayed the same, and showed how realistically she was characterized. The story of Ester was a coming of age novel where she began to mature and see how her life would unfold. Her case was not resolved perfectly, since with every life story, there are always doubts and mistakes. The nonperfect ending was part of what made me like the book so much.The Bell Jar was a perfect selection for me, being a young girl in a changing society. It showed me how much people are influenced by their relationships and surroundings, but not in a moralizing way. The book was witty and surprisingly humorous considering its subject, honest and bold. What I also enjoyed about the book was the ties that were present to the real life of Sylvia Plath, who had a mental breakdown and suicide attempt as well. The similarities to a true story made the setting and characters very real, since some characters were loosely based on people in the author's life. The plot isn't particularly suspenseful or fast-moving, but I was very drawn into it, and I recommend others to read this clever and interesting account of a young girl's undoing and recovery."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I just read the Bell Jar, and I was shocked at how much I could relate to the main character. Esther is 19 years old, and at that age I was feeling and experiencing so many of the same things. The time was different, the specifics were different, and our genders are different, and yet this book hit so close to home that it was uncomfortable, and yet cathartic, to read it. This book perfectly depicts the feeling of being a very young adult in our society, and looking at the world around you and seeing absolutely nothing that appeals to you. It depicts the confusion, pain, isolation, and even insanity that can be the result. I would recommend this book to anyone, but especially to young people who are struggling to find their footing in a society that can be cold, frightening, and overwhelming."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I read this book upon the recommendation of my best friend. I am a teenager and like many of the other people who have written reviews for &quot;The Bell Jar&quot;, I have suffered from depression. When I was reading this book, I was surprised by how similar Esther's feelings were to my own. Some reviews mention that they feel that her depression is not credible. I on the other hand thought her depression felt real and justified, almost tanglible. The bell jar is a perfect metaphor for how you can sometimes feel while afflicted with depression. The detached feeling can be insufferable. I thoroughly enjoyed, and was touched by this book. It is definitely worth a read..."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"This seems to me to be one of those books that you absolutely have to read even if you know you'll hate it - just because it's so important, so touted and so, well, very well-written. Like the summaries say, it &quot;chronicles a gifted young woman's descent into insanity.&quot; It's very realistic because it was drawn directly from real life - the protagonist (one Esther Greenwood) _is_ Sylvia Plath, more or less. Plath very vividly describes every detail of every day, and fleshes out her character completely.My one impression was bewilderment at the emptiness, soullessness and lack of purpose of most of the characters in the book, Esther included. However, this was not due to the author but due to the author's subjects - people _are_ really like that, and you'll realize that at some point in the book and you'll hope to hell that you're different. (So just for that little revelation, I recommend it.) Every one of the characters is so real that you probably know someone exactly like them - the crusty Jay Cee, the means-well-but-is-a-complete-jerk Buddy Willard, all the various young women who think nothing of giving away their bodies to a fleeting acquaintance, Esther, who is incapable of achieving anything despite her obvious talent and so plans to affirm her identity through sleeping with someone she just met, etc. None of them are exaggerated in the least.At the end, the story will leave the readers asking why all this happened, why Esther went crazy, why she couldn't do something with her talents, why no one seems to have any reason to take up space on the earth, whose fault is it, what do we do about it, why it has to be like this, and so on. The book provides no answers to any of that, and unfortunately, it's too late to ask Sylvia Plath to answer."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I loved this book! It's not a very long book, only about 200 pages or so, but man oh man it's an intense read. In my case it took me a year to read this book, so I felt like I was right with Ester Greenwood. I'm the biggest Sylvia Plath fan that I know and I was turned on to her by reading &quot;Daddy&quot; in an english class I had. And I just have about everything that she has done. Her way with words is sexy and at the same time dark, it seems very unusally for a woman in the 1950's and 1960's to have written like that, but I think it's great she broke the gender role! It's truly a shame that she never wrote another novel like this one, even though there are rumors that there's half of an unfinshed book of hers out there. Man we better call Mulder and Scully."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics)","review":"I have just re-read Sylvia Plath's, &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; having first read it some 20+ years ago as a teenager. Now, as then, it flowed gracefully before me as though I were sitting beside a stream, watching water move, instead of words across the pages of a paperback. Plath's unmatched mastery of metaphors astounds. Her grace and style and ease make &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; seem like one is hearing one's own thoughts; her thoughts and her words would be my thoughts and words in a parallel situation. They would be the thoughts and words of women all around the world, were we all so articulate to communicate them as efficiently as does Plath. Style, it seems, was her greatest weapon.&quot;The Bell Jar&quot; is Sylvia's autobiography-meets-enough-fiction-so-as-not-to-make-my-friends-and-family-ticked-off-at-me. She remarks in one passage about some works of writing being such that she loved them so much that she wished she could climb in, into the pages, between the lines as though between the opening of a split rail fence. &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; is like this. The reader feels they know Plath -- she is like the best friend you always wanted to be more like. Her story here is not simply an interesting compilation of anecdotes, but a friendship and connection with a young woman too brilliant. Because there is such a thing.I highly recommend this book, and ANYTHING and EVERYTHING by Sylvia Plath. Seldom has so gifted a writer placed foot upon this planet."},{"Title":"The space ship under the apple tree","review":"Louis Slobodkin is well known as an illustrator of children's books.

Spanning a so-far-incomplete life, we can follow Levines progress of maturation. While the beginning poems are strong, it is the middle and end pieces that were the most startling, poems about the working class and later his son. His ability to mix narration and the more typical elements of poetry is extraordinary. Compare the first and last sentences of One For The Rose: Three weeks ago I went back / to the same street corner where / 27 years before I took a bus for Akron, / Ohio, but now there was only a blank space / with a few concrete building blocks / scattered among the beer cans, Instead I was born / in the wrong year and in the wrong place, / and I made my way so slowly and badly / that I remember every single turn, / and each one smells like an overblown rose, / yellow, American, beautiful, and true. Levine writes American poetry in the American diction better than anyone since Whitman or Sandburg. His language is conservative and seems simple at first, but when the poem blossoms we are all the more surprised and excited because of it. This book is a gem to read and contains a story, making it as hard to put down as your favorite novel."},{"Title":"New Selected Poems","review":"In my opinion, Philip Levine is perhaps the most honest poet writing in America today. As a master's candidate in an English department, I've endured much of the postmodern fluff that dominates modern poetry. In Levine's work, you won't find the typical introspective ramblings of the self-obsessed modern poet. Levine writes clearly and distinctly, with images that carry ideas. Levine doesn't resort to petty academic parlor tricks to describe the disappearence of self--check out \\"Silent in America\\" for a portrait of a man with a voice so powerful that he cannot even use it.In *New and Selected Poems*, readers will find a real master craftsman at work. Along with artfully buried rhymes and off rhymes, Levine also experiments quite successfully with both meter and syllabic verse. The amazine thing, however, is that unless you really pay attention to the work, you miss these things. Levine hypnotizes with his ideas and phrasing and clear, sharp images.Here are the voices of the lost; here are the voices of the damned. Levine rejects the postmodern destruction of self and has become a voice of the American poor in the Whitman tradition. As an epigraph in *New and Selected Poems* reads, \\"Vivas for those who have failed.\\"Levine has had a great influence on me and my work. Anyone writing poetry should check out Levine's work.

His dispassionate exposure of the premeditated and unimaginably sinister methods used by Communists to steal and retain power is a service to the free world...especially given that so many modern, radical organizations (particularly those on the left) utilize the very same tactics to cynically manipulate opinion and exert influence.

The pictures are quite charming - and I think that my girls get a kick out of Emma having two Moms, like they do. And they think Mesha is cute. They're really lobbying hard for a kitten, and that's another reason I got this book. As sort of primer on proper cat treatment. It works for that too.My babysitter was reading it to the girls the other day, and she omitted to read 'A Two Mom Story' while reading the title. One of the girls called her on it.

Most of these books seem to focus on the two moms or two dads as a central part of the story, and this is fine to a degree.

THIS book however, is PERFECT for any toddler, because it really is more about childhood than anything else. while my daughter was very interesed in the two moms part, and kept identifying 'mama' and 'mommy', she was mostly interested in what emma was doing to poor meesha and seemed to really identify with her character. after two reads, my daughter already had most of the moms' lines memorized, yelling at the book, \\"NO!

I would only say that this book is good if you are a novice when it comes to horses. Anyone with experience would find this repetetive and boring. The book only covers very basic points about horses. The book also does not give details about anything- it's more of an outline. I would close by saying that this book is probably one to steer away from."},{"Title":"Understanding Horse Behavior (Horse Health Care Library)","review":"I agree with the other reviewer here. This book barely scratches the surface on horse behavior. To me it raised more questions than it answered. Very brief and superficial discussion. I have been involved with horses for thirty years and just recently discovered the usefulness of understanding a horse's perspective in day-to-day handling and training. If you are looking for a good book on understanding why horses do what they do and what to do about it, read all three of Mark Rashid's books, available here at Amazon."},{"Title":"Understanding Horse Behavior (Horse Health Care Library)","review":"Unfortunately I found this book was not only vastly lacking in educational detail, but was appalled by one of the recommendations made by the author on catching difficult horses. I would have expected a novice lay person to come up with depriving the horse of food and water in an effort to make them \\"dependant\\" upon you for thier very life (and therefore grateful to be caught and fed), however finding it in a book obviously marketed to beginners and novice horsepersons felt this was largely irresponsible. The book is also filled with biases and general assumptions about the expected behavior of horse genders and breeds. There is also a comment that Thoroughbreds are Warmbloods... ? Just wondering when this happened? There are better books out there."},{"Title":"Understanding Horse Behavior (Horse Health Care Library)","review":"I bought a horse vet reference on an auction site and the seller threw this book in as a \\"bonus.\\" Guess they wanted to get rid of it.

There are plenty of good references out there on horses. This is *not* one of them.I agree with the previous reviewer who pointed out the author's recommendation to withhold food to get the horse to start coming to you. This is simply cruel and wrong.

Gerry Leitner's guide was invaluable both in the planning and in-country parts of our trip. This guide is appropriate for both budget and non-budget travellers.Leitner's book -- unlike other guides -- provides a host of essential detail. Some examples include bus schedules, seasonal dates of operation, and accurate phone numbers. The information is unusual in its comprehensive character. In fact, we were -- in some instances -- able to get more accurate and complete information from Leitner's Travel Companion than local sources. This was all the more surprising in view of the fact that my wife is an Uruguayan national and a native speaker of Spanish.The excellent organization and outstanding maps in Leitner's guide always keep the traveler oriented. Again in contrast to other travel books on Chile, it is easy to find information and understand the relation of parks and towns to a region and of regions to the entire country. This makes it easy to plan a trip or change itinerary at a moment's notice.As a final note, the far south of Chile and Argentina otherwise known as Magallanes, Patagonia, and Tierra del Fuego -- notwithstanding its awesome beauty -- is a real place and not a mythical realm. This travel guide keeps the traveller's feet on this real ground. Its content encompasses and in many cases excedes the sum of all other travel guide literature on this region."},{"Title":"Chile and Easter Island: Travel Companion","review":"We recently returned from Chile and found this guide to be almost useless when it came to reccommending restaurants and hotels.

Of the five (yes five) IFR books I have this is the most useful and most used. Enjoy and best of luck with your IFR training."},{"Title":"Ponzi's Scheme: The True Story of a Financial Legend","review":"We've all heard of the Ponzi Scheme, what they referred to in that era as \\"robbing Peter to pay Paul\\". But this well researched book traces the tragic story of how Charles Ponzi came to America, what he did before the Ponzi scheme and what happened to him afterwards. It would make a great movie! Situated in Boston, he ran ads for great returns and when many middle class people invested, publicity soon followed with various members of the media warning that it was a scam. No common criminal, he took the press on and argued the opposite winning much public support.It is a fascinating tale! The side story of the faithful wife who only wanted her husband at home without the money and the final outcome of their marriage is also heartwarming and tragic.I like business biographies and this certainly qualifies although I wouldn't consider him the classic success story. This book offers so much more with detailed history of that time period and the roles regulators, politicians and media played in society at that time. And the story itself is charming in many ways. Charles Ponzi was a common man that on the surface became wealthy and everyone rooted for him. But it only lasted so long. If you have interest in finance you will like this book. If you have interest in the history of the early 1900s in this growing country you will be interested. If you like novels and good character growth I think this will also be of interest as it reads like a novel as he develops his scheme."},{"Title":"Ponzi's Scheme: The True Story of a Financial Legend","review":"I love books that tell the story behind a well-known phrase with a little-known background, so Ponzi's Scheme was a natural selection for me. Turns out it was a great choice. The story of Charles Ponzi, an Italian immigrant to America, is a fast-moving rollercoaster of a tale told with skill by Zuckoff.The result is a very readable book with a combination of good lessons for its reader about too-good-to-be-true propositions, great characters, good history, financial lessons, and a tradgedy of Shakesperean proportions.Highly recommended for history buffs, fans of character-driven stories, people in financial markets, and anyone who's curious to know the story behind the phrase \\"Ponzi Scheme.\\""},{"Title":"Ponzi's Scheme: The True Story of a Financial Legend","review":"Zuckoff has written a first-class biography of Charles Ponzi. His writing style keeps the reader deeply engrossed in the story and wanting to know what happens next. Zuckoff recounts various communications between the main characters, all of which he says comes from letters, newspaper accounts, etc. He also does a very nice job paralleling the lives of the scam artist, and the newspaper publisher who finally exposes the scam.Although he was hardly the first to come up with the con game, Ponzi will forever be associated with pyramid schemes and \\"robbing Peter to pay Paul\\" schemes. The way he did it was brilliantly simple: Come up with a way of making money that seems completely legal and is relatively easy to explain. Market that scheme to folks that are in the same boat as you (e.g., same industry, ethnicity, religion, neighborhood, etc.) Pay the astronomical returns to the initial investors. Then let their word of mouth recommendations bring in additional investors. Repeat the process and watch the money pour in.It is difficult to read this book and not empathize with Ponzi. Even though the reader knows that many of Ponzi's \\"investors\\" will become victims of the fraud, Ponzi's amazingly seductive personality is able to win over most people. The question that lingers throughout most of the book is whether Ponzi ever actually intended to pay off the investors with a legal - and feasible - money-making idea, or whether he simply wanted to scam the victims out of their life savings. The answer is finally provided by Ponzi himself towards the end of his life.This book - and Ponzi's story - serves as a great reminder of the old adage that if something sounds too good to be true, then it probably is. But what is truly amazing is that these same Ponzi-type schemes continue even today, whether it is stock \\"pump and dump\\" scams, late-night infomercials on how to get rich quick, or large-scale Enron-like frauds. By appealing to people's instinctive desire to make money, the end result of these schemes is usually the same: the investor becomes a victim. This book makes for a great read, as well as a great life lesson."},{"Title":"Ponzi's Scheme: The True Story of a Financial Legend","review":"Zuckoff paints Ponzi as someone who desperately wanted his international reply coupon scheme to work legitimately, and then merely didn't know exactly how to get out of it and \\"go straight.\\" He almost makes you feel sorry for the guy.To his credit, Zuckoff does explain his sources very well in the back of the book. However, even using the substantiated facts that he himself presented, one wonders if Ponzi really was trying to legitimate his career, pressures from his wife and mother aside.Even according to Zuckoff's own account, trouble followed Ponzi like mice to cheese. How many times have you been arrested? Me neither. Given the series of events and the fact that Ponzi kept lying to everyone (even behind his facade of charming confidence), I don't think he deserves an iota of sympathy (although Zuckoff and the New York Times did bring up interesting questions about Ponzi's investors and their characters--the desire to get something for nothing).Most telling are Ponzi's quotes and actions after turning himself in for the fraud committed under the auspices of the Securities Exchange Company and serving his prison term for that. Here we see the desperate thief running from the authorities and making a pretty stark \\"confession\\" (as Zuckoff states) later in life which shows little remorse.I wonder if Ponzi's character was more consistent than Zuckoff describes through this book. He started off as a person of questionable character and ended the same way. I just don't think he was as desperate to legitimize his scheme as Zuckoff makes him out to be (he seemed to do a lot of thinking about how to manipulate the coupons, rather than doing; and what he really got close to doing (stealing from his own bank), wasn't very legitimate).His charming character and devotion to mother and wife aside, the guy seemed to be a crook through and through.Still, it's a fun read; it does make you think about who Ponzi really was."},{"Title":"Ponzi's Scheme: The True Story of a Financial Legend","review":"In a very engaging account of the arguably the \\"best\\" financial scam (before Enron days atleast), Zuckoff narrates the fascinating story an Italian immigrant to the US and his seemingly unending tale of woe, charm, financial trickery - all combined! As the plot (even though this is an actual account of real events, it reads as if it were one of the best written thriller!) develops, one cannot but imagine if any other person could have survived the events Ponzi had to suffer through. Using a brilliant narrative technique, the author develops the main actors' roles in a systematic manner, most notably those of Charles Ponzi, his wife, and Gozier (publisher).Each chapter also includes a reproduction of a relevant photograph obtained from the famed Post, Boston Library and other sources. Those pictures are so well chosen that they capture the essence of the ensuing chapter very well.As can be expected from a professor of journalism, the book is well documented with plenty of detailed notes and bibliography for any serious reader.It should be pointed out that the Epilogue should not be forgotten at all. The unravelling of the \\"plot\\" happens mostly in the epilogue and contains numerous twists and turns associated with the fascinating life of Charles Ponzi.An excellent read, but make sure you have cleared out an entire day or weekend for it, because once you start reading it, you wont stop until you are at the last page!"},{"Title":"Ponzi's Scheme: The True Story of a Financial Legend","review":"I needn't write a lengthy review as some of my fellow armchair critics included here have done. I will only second what the majority of them have said. Even J. Edgar Hoover would have had a difficult time disliking this guy!. I'm sure if one had actually been there and suffered personal losses as too many did, he would see it much differently, but from the perspective of this author, Ponzi was a most likeable person and you can't help rooting for him, and poor loyal Rose) until the bitter end! Buy this book! You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Ponzi's Scheme: The True Story of a Financial Legend","review":"Nowadays, the phrase \\"Ponzi scheme\\" is applied to everything from putrid boiler-room operations to the housing boom. That makes it instructive to take a look at the phrase's actual namesake. Charles Ponzi was a con man, to be sure, but he also was a gifted promoter and cheerful dreamer who captured the shadiest side of the American spirit. In this fascinating, novelistic account of Ponzi's meteoric rise and inevitable fall, journalist Mitchell Zuckoff painstakingly recreates the 1920 zeitgeist that allowed Ponzi to delude and scam so many investors. Times have changed, but the underlying human nature that allowed Ponzi to raise so much cash remains the same. We recommend this page-turning history to investors who want to be equipped to spot hype and scams designed to lure the gullible."},{"Title":"Ponzi's Scheme: The True Story of a Financial Legend","review":"While I consider this a remarkable story filled with rich details, I detected a significant journalistic gap and bias on the part of the author that I find mysterious. I sure don't buy, for example, that Ponzi was as benign or well-intentioned a character as the author made him out to be. Charismatic, strategic and highly skilled, absolutely. But Ponze was also very deviant and that didn't arise accidentally. He'd been a criminal and served hard time and about that experience we learned next to nothing or IMO it was glossed over. Hard time is not and never has been a church picnic, not in a penitentiary during the early part of last century for certain. Some details from what he was likely exposed to inside would have helped fill in these gaps for me. Some additional comments from creditors who got stung would have been interesting to include, too, but it all wraps up very quickly in the end. A little too quick for my interests."},{"Title":"Ponzi's Scheme: The True Story of a Financial Legend","review":"I always like to read books which tell the story of a person in history who we hear about all the time but never get the details. I found Ponzi's Scheme to be well-written, informative and entertaining. I also feel that the hallmark of a good biography is that it tells the stories of the people around the subject of the biography as well as the subject. Ponzi's Scheme fits this hallmark with its stories of Richard Grozier of the Boston Post and Ponzi's wife Rose, among others. As for Ponzi himself, I was left with the feeling that although he did come across a basically a nice person, I felt that his passion for greed was his fatal flaw and that he should have realized that it would have been better to have the love of his wife and settle for an ordinary life rather than scheme for quick riches which hurt those who believed in his scheme, his wife and himself at the end. I do feel, however, that he would have made a great host of a \\"reality\\" TV show over someone like Donald Trump. Ponzi's Scheme is a good book, especially for those who are interested in Boston history."},{"Title":"Ponzi's Scheme: The True Story of a Financial Legend","review":"Until the Madoff scandal, I didn't realize that a \\"Ponzi scheme\\" was actually named after a real life Mr. Ponzi. But I was gripped and horrified by the Madoff story, and so when I saw this book I picked it up as an impulse buy. I hadn't heard of the book or the author, but I would now read other books by Mitchell Zuckoff.Ponzi starts out like the classic immigrant, coming in search of the American dream. At first, he even seems to have a legitimate business model. He's basically planning to capitalize on the different values of a particular commodity in different currencies. Buy low, sell high.But he wants fast cash, and a lot of it. And legitimate businesses just don't work that way. So he turns to a pyramid scheme which generates huge amount of money with incredible speed. Until the inevitable moment when the whole house of cards comes crashing down. Unlike the Madoff scheme, which lasted for decades, it doesn't take long for Ponzi's so-called investors to lose their shirts.It's an astonishing story, told in a fast, breezy way. I read the book in record time (I'm not a real speed reader but I read this in just a few days). What I think amazed me most about the book is that Zuckoff manages to make Ponzi almost likeable. Or if not likeable, at least he seems human. You get a sense of his hopes and dreams, where he came from, and where he wants to go.Now if someone could just make Madoff seem human that would really be a neat trick."},{"Title":"Ponzi's Scheme: The True Story of a Financial Legend","review":"This book is excellent.

Ponzi made some people a lot of money, caused a lot of people to lose money and went from great wealth to poverty in rollercoaster ride time.The book is a fascinating study for those interested in business, persuasion and a great reminder that what sounds too good to be true, probably is.Ponzi is painted as having been a complex character that knew what he was doing...knew it was wrong...knew it would ultimately collapse, but was not without heart and caring for some.A truly well written and page turner of a book.Kevin HoganAuthor of The Psychology of Persuasion, and, The Science of Influence"},{"Title":"Ponzi's Scheme: The True Story of a Financial Legend","review":"LOVED this book. Zuckoff's account reads like a well-honed work of fiction, but, as he states in his notes on sources, \\"the truth was better than anything I could have invented.\\"The unexpected bonus was a marvelously interesting history of early 20th century Boston politics and newspapers. I grew up here and had heard tell of many of the names mentioned in the book, but never had them fully fleshed out. And of course, I now fully understand the meaning of the phrase, \\"Ponzi scheme.\\"Mr. Ponzi was a charming thief, and though he brought ruin through unethical means to countless people whose faith was terribly misplaced, Zuckoff understands that in order to \\"hate\\" a character, you have to care about him first. No good villian is 100 percent evil, otherwise, the reader has nothing invested his his tale except clean and simple revenge. In Zuckoff's hands, the verifiable facts of Ponzi's life and character bring to life a villian who adores and is faithful to his wife, loves his mother, literally gives the skin of his back to a stranger, and accumulates 15 million dollars in 10's from laborers and 100,000's from Brahmins and thinks, in the end, he can make good by literally robbing his own bank.You couldn't make this stuff up, and lucky for us, Zuckoff didn't have to!BRAVO!!!!"},{"Title":"Ponzi's Scheme: The True Story of a Financial Legend","review":"The book was a present for my wife.

The book is basicaly a biography of Ponzi, with the majority of it focused on Ponzi's racketand eventual exposure.But there is much that this book does not even bother to look at.For example Ponzi is exposed as a con man in the fall of 1920, yetthere is no attempt on the part of the author to place the Boston Post's concerns about Ponzi in the context of the prevailing social darwinism of the time.Namely a belief that immigrants such as Ponzi could only succeed if they were crooks.The book does not explore what caused Barron to come out against Ponzi after having defended him.Nor is there any attempt to explore Ponzi' s political views, if any as Ponzi did have a patronage position in Mussolini's regime.What saves this book from being a 1 star book, in my view is that it is such an enteraining read."},{"Title":"Ponzi's Scheme: The True Story of a Financial Legend","review":"Our desire to get ahead financially is insatiable, especially in this capitalist society. A 50% return on my investment in 45 days? Where do I sign up? Too good to be true? Well, you know what they say... We think we are smarter, more sophisticated people today. Maybe so, but if we are, it's because we know about things like Ponzi schemes, or think we do.Mitchell Zuckoff provides the best detail yet, of the life and times of the man who gave his name to an illegal financial scheme, Charles Ponzi. The narrative is straightforward and factual. It's interesting, but a little dull. Charles Ponzi was a very charismatic man, very shrewd; think Donald Trump. This book provides many facts, but little in the way of emotional motivation.I recommend this book to everyone interested in human gullibility and the financial world. You won't learn a lot about either, but you'll have many facts about Charles Ponzi."},{"Title":"Ponzi's Scheme: The True Story of a Financial Legend","review":"In short, this is the best history book I have read in years. Prof. Zuckoff takes a historical figure whose scheme is well-known but whose life story, until now, is not. The absence of historical literature on Charles Ponzi is remarkable because the man lived a fascinating life.What is amazing about Ponzi's scheme is the amount of success he enjoyed. Over the course of 6 months, he was able to raise $10 million based on his promises to return 50% on investments. This amount, in 2006, would be quite impressive. But Ponzi did it in 1920, when the average American had little savings, rarely invested in anything, and did not have access to widespread information, like the internet.Prof. Zuckoff does a great job of capturing the essence of America in 1920. The characters are lively. The writing is crisp. The observations are insightful. If you are remotely interested in American history, this is a must-read."},{"Title":"Ponzi's Scheme: The True Story of a Financial Legend","review":"The folly of the get-rich-quick formula was already a familiar story in 1920 when Charles Ponzi's descent into financial criminality forever connected his name with the pyramid scheme. The smart talker and smart dresser --one Boston newspaper dubbed him the man who put the \\"crease\\" in Croesus-- had tremendous powers of salesmanship and a quick mind for seeing monetary gain where others saw merely mundane transactions.His abilities, channeled into legitimate finance would likely have made him rich and respected. Tragically, those assets --his smooth tongue and quick mind-- were the very instruments of his degradation and destruction. Zuckoff parallels the life of Ponzi, the fatherless and penniless immigrant, with Ponzi's nemesis, Boston Post publisher Richard Grozier. Grozier was born with every advantage of wealth and position; yet he struggled under the crippling burden of a larger-than-life father. The early life of Grozier --he was suspended from Harvard College several times due to his lack of focus on his studies-- suggested a young man on the way to a life of no distinction. But just as Ponzi makes his fateful choice for quick money and illegality, Grozier decides to accept his destiny to be the man to expose Ponzi's fraud to the people of New England who are recklessly investing in the 50 percent in 90 days scheme.David Trumbull.[...]"},{"Title":"Ponzi's Scheme: The True Story of a Financial Legend","review":"This is a great biography of Charles Ponzi who, as we all know, gave his name to the scheme whereby an investment fund pays profits directly from the pooled receipts rather than utilizing receipts to produce any real income. Banks make their money by taking money from depositors and then renting it out. In Ponzi's day, banking was blissfully simple--pay 3% to depositors and collect 6% from creditors, a simple business model that tantalized Mr. Ponzi who, we learn, was a tremendously gifted individual with a quick wit and charisma who did not lack faith in himself. Ponzi made his money by selling the public on the fact that they would indeed be able to make a profit and then proving sufficiently capable of doing so that the needed new deposits continued to pour in to his fund.Where this study becomes fascinating is in its exposition of the mindset of Mr. Ponzi who came very, very close to pulling it off. Mr. Zuckoff takes pains to point out that in writing this book he did not interpolate from extant facts and scrupulously notes his sources. Apparently Ponzi was of the type that just can't stomach the hard work of doing things the accepted way; however, ethics are ethics and regardless of his motive--Ponzi did commit fraud because he was not creating income with his depositors money. Yet, Ponzi's fraud was more of a \\"short cut\\" as he never really knew exactly what his liabilities were and was on the brink of figuring out a way to use his fund that would have produced profit; as he himself noted, he could have cut and run with the money but instead was trying to figure out a way to invest the funds. In fact, he did bank the money, so if he was guilty of anything it was overselling the returns. Really, Ponzi created a kind of liquid venture capital fund that just didn't ever get around to making investments. He could have pulled off his scheme and the way the book is written you are rooting for him to succeed.Ponzi's public persona created such confidence that his fund was able to weather repeated attacks by the media. In fact, his strong public image and his ability to sway opinion actually stymied most of the law enforcement agencies whose responsibility it was to ferret out fraud. However, his past criminal record was his undoing. A sharp reporter figured out how to dent the public trust in Ponzi and a bank examiner unafraid to do his job managed to lock up Ponzi's remaining cash thereby forcing a default. In my opinion, but for Ponzi's past transgression, he would have ended up successful. There's a lesson.The story is simple but the man was complex. His ability to appear completely unruffled in the face of the most dire of situations continually disarmed the media as well as the police, who were so accustomed to looking for signs of guilt that they let the guy go on repeated occasions. Even though you know what is going to happen it is fascinating to watch Ponzi continually evade detection and capture. There is a real lesson to legitimate business people regarding self-confidence and the power of dressing well.And as a postscript: Anyone stupid enough to think we've progressed as an economy should turn on the TV after 11 PM and see ads for pills that either melt fat or grow a specific body part. Ponzi lives."},{"Title":"Ponzi's Scheme: The True Story of a Financial Legend","review":"We have all heard and used the term Ponzi Scheme, but almost none of us living today know the story that gave birth to the term. In this skilful and intelligent biography of Charles Ponzi, Mitchell Zuckoff shows us Ponzi's character flaws, his charisma, how he developed his scheme(s), and how the enemies he made brought him down.Charles Ponzi was born Carlo Ponzi in 1882 in the town of Lugo, Italy. His family sacrificed to send him to a prestigious university where he fell in with rich kids whose lifestyle he enjoyed. In trying to keep with them he ended up having to leave school without finishing. His family sent him to America where the streets were paved with gold, so they told him. Of course, like most Italian immigrants of the time, he had hard times. However, hard work was distasteful to him.This combination of a desire to live rich lifestyle combined with a disdain for hard work and an impatience to build wealth led him, predictably, to problems with the law. He was obsessed with get-rich-quick schemes. Then came the lightening bolt. In 1920, he saw an International Reply Coupon. These coupons were merely meant to provide prepaid return postage for international mail. Let's say I sent a vendor in a foreign country a contract. I could include the appropriate coupon so my vendor could return the signed contract at my expense.Ponzi had about 1/3 of a good idea (noticing the mispricings between the currency exchange rates and the fixed priced coupons). He knew that there were mispricings in these coupons because of the currency devaluations in certain currencies after the Great War. So, all he had to do was buy coupons that were under priced, turn them into stamps, turn the stamps into cash, and he would have oceans of money! So, he plunged ahead without bothering to work out all the details in his scheme. But he needed cash to start the ball rolling. The solution was Ponzi notes. He offered 50% interest on your money in 45 - 90 days. He found the first few \\"investors\\" and when he paid on time, money began flowing in. Soon it was a torrent of cash. It wasn't long before Ponzi had an ocean of money; millions of dollars. He was big news and a hero to many. He developed a patter noting how he was making all this happen for the little guy because he didn't care about money whereas banks took all their profits for their shareholders.Zuckoff writes a fascinating account of how Ponzi tried to find a way of going \\"legit\\" while he robbed Peter to pay Paul as he stalled for time. Unfortunately for Ponzi, his sudden and shocking success brought unwanted attention from government and media types including the Boston Post. It is kind of funny how things went bad for Ponzi because the people who were after him had less of a clue than he did (except for C.W. Barron - the financial writer). The author also shows us the one true thing in Ponzi's life, his love for his wife, Rose.It is hard to feel too sorry for those ending up losing money in this scheme. They were also going after quick riches and even under the best of circumstances high return investments also have high risks of losing everything. Of course, Ponzi's scheme was no investment, and it was all risk. There was never much of a chance that it would ever do anything but crash. Although, I couldn't figure out why he didn't try gradually lowering his interest rate and extending the return period. It doesn't matter. Those after him were going to bring him down anyway.The book takes us through the trials and jail terms. Ponzi's fame had made him too politically profitable to be left alone or punished only once. His life ends sadly as do the lives of a few of those who built their careers going after him. It seems to me this book would make a fabulous movie or mini-series. However, you would have to find just the right actor to pull off Ponzi's greatest assets: his confidence and charm. He was only five foot two so; the actor would also have to be short.Anyway, this is a terrifically entertaining read and I recommend it."},{"Title":"Ponzi's Scheme: The True Story of a Financial Legend","review":"As a trader living in New York, I feel a morbid fascination with the Madoff story. $50 billion up in smoke, two suicides so far, and the legal juggernaut is just beginning to rumble. To read up on the background I bought Ponzi's Scheme by Zukoff - and am glad I did!The scheme itself was simple enough: Ponzi became aware that the coupons for purchasing stamps abroad were priced differently in different currencies. One could spend a dollar in Austria or Italy - and get several dollars' worth of stamps in the USA. A profit opportunity was definitely there, but it was a very small opportunity. The volume of coupons sold in the US was under $100,000. Meanwhile, Ponzi took in millions from people to whom he promised profits from speculating in postal coupons. The real opportunity drew people in - but in reality there was no way for masses to profit from it.This is also what Madoff did. He claimed to be trading spreads between stocks and options: essentially riskless, low-profit, reliable trades. The profit opportunity was there, but the volume of the instruments he claimed to trade was very low - the spread story simply attracted people whose money was used to pay departing investors and line the pockets of crooks.With the collapse of Ponzi's scheme, the total investment losses came to a then-staggering three million dollars. Those who did not exit in time got 37 cents on the dollar back from the liquidators. No such luck seems to be in the cards for Madoff's victims.While the technical aspects of the scheme are simple, Zukoff weaves a wonderful yarn. I could not put his book down. He is a wonderful stylist, with an eagle eye for details. I loved his digressions, for example, the story of The Boston Post, the newspaper that helped blow Ponzi out of the water.Reading Zukoff's book opened my eyes to a surprising aspect of the personalities of three \`ponzi schemers' I know about - Ponzi himself, Madoff, and a European acquaintance who was running a scheme among his family members and friends last time I saw him. All had a likely script for profits - but no ability to extract those profits. They all seemed like very nice and attractive people: Ponzi donated a skin graft to a stranger, Madoff was highly regarded in New York philanthropic circles, and my old acquaintance - well, that's a story in itself.I highly recommend Ponzi's Scheme to all who love a good story. Incidentally, I downloaded my unabridged copy from audible.com (now a division of amazon), and the voice of its reader was superb."},{"Title":"Ponzi's Scheme: The True Story of a Financial Legend","review":"Ponzi's Scheme is the true story of Charles Ponzi, the namesake of the Ponzi Scheme. It follows Charles Ponzi's life, from his childhood in Italy to the his infamous scheme through his death in Brazil. The main focus is, of course, the days his Securities Exchange Company's famous 45 days 50% interest scheme. It also follows the life of Richard Grozier, the acting owner of the Boston Post, the most vocal and early critic of the scheme.Ponzi's Scheme has many strengths. It is well written, especially when the authors lack of fictionalizing events is taken into consideration. This leads to the second pillar which Ponzi's Scheme is built upon, outstanding research. Mitchell Zuckoff's long hours researching Charles Ponzi and Richard Grozier is well translated into an entertaining narrative which doesn't get bogged down in unnecessary dates and facts.I can recommend Ponzi's Scheme with no reservations, it is very well written and informative piece about the man behind the idiom.

I knew it was named for some Italian who in the 1920s made a ton of money scamming it out of innocent victims. But that was about all I knew -- until now. This book educated me on the man behind the scheme and that this entire episode occurred over a period of a few months with the peak being over several weeks between late June 1920 through mid August 1920. The man is portrayed as somebody who figured out a way to make big bucks off international postage due to currency exchanges. He did not set out to wrong his investors but he did just that. It is kind of a tragic tale of a man who knew he was in over his head and trying desparately to stay afloat. He had big dreams and tried to make them happen but time ran out on him. It was a typical case of if only he had a few more days he might have pulled it off and gone legit.I was expecting some dullness but there was nothing dull about the man or the book.

The story is classic and should be read by anyone interested in investing."},{"Title":"Ponzi's Scheme: The True Story of a Financial Legend","review":"Since Halloween, the big story in South Florida has involved a lawyer of my acquaintance whose recent and ostentatious wealth is alleged to be the result of $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme. This lawyer, Scott Rothstein, was the talk of the bar for many months prior to his sudden departure for Morocco in a leased Gulfstream V along with a duffle bag stuffed with millions of dollars. To everyone's great surprise the lawyer returned about a week later and for the next three weeks prior to his arrest dined in expensive restaurants where he assured reporters he would work the rest of his life to repay every penny.Charles Ponzi, whose get rich promotion in Boston in 1920 was not the first such plan to rob Peter to pay Paul, nonetheless forever lent his name to such schemes. Ponzi's progeny have included in just the past year and a half or so Robert Madoff, and Allan Stanford's investment houses. These supposedly respectable firms were disclosed to be massive Ponzi schemes. Rothstein's $1.2 billion scam paled in comparison to Madoff and Stanford who drew in $65 billion and $8 billion respectively.Ponzi, by contrast, was a relative piker. Even adjusted for inflation his take amounted to only $89,000,000 in 2009 dollars. What Ponzi had, besides a larcenous heart, was rock-steady nerve and a dramatic flair. Turned down for a loan to seed his business by the Hanover Trust, a small Boston bank, he bought controlling interest less than a year later and used its assets like a personal checkbook. Confronted with photographic proof that he was the same Charles Ponsi convicted in Montreal ten years earlier for forgery, he coolly denied it. As the press and authorities went after him, it only drove more prospective investors to his doors.Books about financial crimes can be dead dry. Mitchell Zuckoff has largely avoided this fate by his keen focus on Ponzi's surrounding cast-corrupt politicians, crusading editors, savvy cons, and dishonest lawyers. 1920 was a time when it just seemed likely that an Italian immigrant could turn $100 into $150 in forty-five days using international postal reply coupons. Even in the fullness of time, such naivet&eacute; has been repeated over and over again. My bet is that it will go on as long as people have more money than brains."},{"Title":"Ponzi's Scheme: The True Story of a Financial Legend","review":"I thorough enjoy this book. it reads as though you are Ponzi's brain worm.i at first wondering how do the author achieve this. but it appears that the author could back up all these thoughts with documents he found.one if the best reporting books i have read. apart from the \\"seabiscuit\\" story."},{"Title":"Ponzi's Scheme: The True Story of a Financial Legend","review":"A captivating story of an Italian immigrant, financier (or swindler, whichever you prefer) whose name has entered the English language due to his meteoric rise and fall in the 1920's. If you have ever wondered about the meaning of \\"Ponzi scheme\\", this is the book. Mitchell Zuckoff does a great job of revealing the character, as well as documenting the entire fraudulent investment operation Ponzi setup and operated (150% returns in 45 days, by paying returns to investors from their own money or money paid by subsequent investors, rather than any actual profits). A real page-turner and an educational read."},{"Title":"Ponzi's Scheme: The True Story of a Financial Legend","review":"This book should have been called \\"Ponzi's Cogliones\\" because Charles Ponzi had a huge pair.Ponzi was not the first guy to try to pull of a rob-Peter-to-pay-Paul scheme, but he clearly was the most well-known, well, at least until Bernie Madoff came along and made us all feel violated. But, unlike Bernie Madoff, there was a lot to like about Charles Ponzi, as he had some redeemable characteristics (eternal optimist, good son, good husband) and undeniable charisma. Sure, lots of people lost lots of money, but, as in most of these cases, the true villain was their own greed.The book was very enjoyable and I couldn't help but like Mr Ponzi, if not even admire him somewhat. It was an entertaining look into an era almost a century old and learn how much, and how little, has changed. It was a good reminder, too, of the perils of greed and pride.Charles engineered the original Ponzi scheme, but I am sure he won't be the last. I am sure, however, he will be the last one to make you smile about it."},{"Title":"Ponzi's Scheme: The True Story of a Financial Legend","review":"We've all heard of \\"Ponzi Schemes\\" but most people don't know the story behind them. This is that story. An Italian who game to the US via Canada and build a huge fortune based on postal coupons.To me, there was more to this story than just the \\"ponzi scheme\\" part. It's a story of a man who had a goal of how he wanted to live his life and went after that goal. And how he did it was very interesting. A few scams here and there, etc. The postal coupon was probably the most legitimate of his dealings, in my opinion.Good story.

After serving his sentence, he was deported from the U.S., divorced by his American wife, and living without a dime to his name just as he had when he first arrived in the United States.So how did this famous 'Ponzi Scheme' work? Read on...The Business: Currency Speculation in the form of International Postage Coupons. If Ponzi bought coupons in bulk in countries with weak currencies, converted them into stamps, and cashed them in the United States or other countries with strong currencies, he would soon be the richest man in the world! (EXAMPLE) In the United States, $1 could purchase 20 Postal Coupons. With that same $1 U.S. Dollar, you could purchase 66 Postal Coupons in Rome Italy. 66 Postal Coupons purchased in Rome for a dollar would be worth $3.30 in the United States. Profits of $2.30 on every dollar spent, or 230%. Other countries might have even more devalued currencies and profits would be even higher. The Hitch, Ponzi understood, would be getting cash for the stamps he bought with the coupons.Unfortunately, the post office would not allow a person to redeem a Postage Coupon for cash. Still excited about the concept, Ponzi decided to push forward with his plan anyway and decided to worry about the problem of exchanging the Coupons for Cash later. With the promise of 50% interest in 45 days, or 100% in 90 days, Ponzi Opened the doors to his new business dubbed 'The Security Exchange Company' the day after Christmas in 1919. Within 7 months since he had opened for business, he took in $9,600,000 from thirty-thousand investors. Not suprisingly, he still handn't found a way to make a profit through the postal reply coupons nor any other investment and kept paying old customers interest with new customers investment money.Eventually the Local, State, and National Government took notice and began looking into Ponzi's outlandish claims for enormous profits. During their investigations into his \\"business practices,\\" he voluntarily refused to accept new investments but still paid out either the principal to people who had invested with him but didn't wait the entire 45 or 90 days to withdraw, or when their Ponzi Notes matured, the principal + interest. Upon hearing of the Investigations, people turned up in troves to withdraw their money. Eventually the money ran out and Ponzi's business went bankrupt. All told, twenty thousand people who had held Ponzi notes at the time of the collapse received refunds equal to 37.5% of their initial investments.All in all, Ponzi was a con-artist that swindled thousands of people out of their hard-earned money. But he wasn't all bad. He saved the life of a woman that was badly burned by an explosion. Upon hearing from a doctor friend that a caring Nurse was in desperate need of a skin graft, Ponzi voluntarily had 152 square inches of skin from his thighs and back removed. The donations would leave him with broad white patches of scar tissue on his back and legs, however, he saved the nurse's life and she recovered.This book features old pictures of Ponzi, his family, his home, and other important people, & places at the beginning of every chapter that I found very entertaining. There are also quotes from ponzi and others taken directly from journalists which were in Newspapers of the day. In the end of this book it's stated that in the last years of his life, failing health, broke, Charles Ponzi wrote his own Autobiography called 'The Rise of Mr. Ponzi' which was not published until after his death.

Barnum knew human nature all too well. Take a look around you. How many times per day do you encounter those annoying radio ads, TV infomercials or bulk mailings that tout the latest way to get rich quick? It is increasingly hard to avoid them. You hear the stories and see the smiling faces of those who have allegedly made a killing by following some prescribed plan by a huckster with a book or DVD to sell. I suppose that in most cases these schemes are perfectly legal but I always wonder about the morality of most of them. You certainly never hear anything about those unfortunate souls who lose money in these deals. Yet the quest for easy money is really nothing new in America. Throughout our history Americans have sought out and been victimized by these schemes. It seems we never learn. Perhaps the granddaddy of all these many schemes was foisted upon the unsuspecting public by an Italian immigrant named Charles Ponzi. In his colorful 2005 offering \\"Ponzi's Scheme: The True Story of A Financial Legend\\" author Mitchell Zuckoff presents a portrait of a man with a plan. It is a fascinating and entertaining read to say the least.Charles Ponzi was truly a man for his time. With a largely checkered past that he adroitly manages to camouflage Ponzi opened the Securities Exchange Company in Boston in 1920. His offer was really quite simple and obviously too good to be true. Ponzi promised his customers to return their initial investment plus fifty percent in just 90 days! Now this was just the kind of fantastic deal that would appeal to many folks in the freewheeling decade of the 1920's. Ponzi cleverly positioned himself as a friend to \\"everyman\\" and criticized the banking industry for hoarding all of the profits for themselves. But what Ponzi's investors did not know or refused to believe was that the Securities Exchange Company was merely a front for a classic \\"rob Peter to pay Paul\\" scheme. This deal really was too good to be true. Nevertheless, tens of thousands would invest their hard earned money with Ponzi and when all was said and done many of them would lose a large percentage of their initial investment. What makes Ponzi such a fascinating charactor to study is that he really was a very charming and likeable fellow. Mitchell Zuckoff does a outstanding job of painting an intimate portrait of the man who would become a household name. Zuckoff also introduces us to the interesting cast of charactors who would have roles to play in the investigation and ultimate conviction of Charles Ponzi.In a strange sort of way Ponzi would attain the notoriety he set out to achieve. In the late 1950's the Oxford English Dictionary actually added the term \\"Ponzi scheme\\" to its listing of words. A \\"Ponzi scheme\\" would be defined as \\"a form of fraud in which belief in the success of a fictive enterprise is fostered by payment of quick returns to first investors from money invested by others.\\" It was really just that simple. As I indicated earlier this is history more Americans should be aware of. I found \\"Ponzi's Scheme\\" to be an extremely well written and entertaining book. Highly recommended!!"},{"Title":"Ponzi's Scheme: The True Story of a Financial Legend","review":"Mitchell Zuckoff does a fine job of detailing the rise and fall of Charles Ponzi, for whom the notorious pyramid scheme is known. The author details the beginnings of Ponzi in America, his thirst for success, and his continual attempts to rapidly achieve the success which he thinks he deserves. Though less detailed in this book, the continual fleecing of Americans was an accepted tradition in securities trading and business ventures of the day. Therefore, little sympathy could be felt for the speculators who couldn't resist the temptation to get-rich-quick. The book points out Ponzi's vague desire to be legitimate, but his self-promotion and desire to succeed overwhelm any good judgment remaining.

It's too bad; it always bothers me when I read books about people with such potential that take a turn to the dark side, but I do love a non fiction that tells such a good story that it could almost be a fiction drama.The book is very enjoyable. It takes us through a, \\"magical time, when anything felt possible\\". Ponzi starts his great scam just at the brink of the roaring 20's when prohibition-which started in Jan 1920 was just setting in and the Boston-Irish politics were played out through sometimes underhanded dealings and new inventions and discoveries had everyone excited about the future.

Mr. Zuckoff lays out its derivation in this terrifically readable book.The real Mr. Ponzi immigrated from Italy, moved around, being arrested in Montreal and Mississppi, before settling down in Boston where he started a \\"Rob Peter to pay Paul\\" scheme which now uses his name.Ponzi offered 50% return on investment in a mere 45 days in 1920. Mr. Zuckoff points out how the American psyche was so ripe at the time for such get rich schemes. Ponzi took advantage of that mindset and in a brief period - just a matter of months - compiled a fortune.It is truly unclear from the letters, quotes and litany of acts by Ponzi whether he ever believed he could repay all his investors or was knowingly just trying stay ahead - one step before the law and one step in front of running out of money to pay investors. Certainly he could have fled back to Italy at any time before getting caught, but he never did. Until the authorities caught up with him he was able to continue paying his high ball interest. Mr. Zuckoff's portrayal of the con artist shows him to be so charismatic and colorful that the reader gets swept up into him just as his many Boston supporters did during the Ponzi-mania. You almost have to root for the little guy.Mr. Zuckoff also portrays the antagonists - whoops - the journalists and authorities that catch up to Ponzi very well. The editor of the Boston Post is another rags to riches hero of the book.Although this is, for the most part, the history of Ponzi and scheme, the author paints a complete picture of the times in which he was able to perpetrate his scheme/crime. This is what makes this book a more comprehensive history than just the telling of the scheme and how it was uncovered.To make the book even more entertaining, it is written almost like a novel, with each page revealing a bit more of the story.This very readable book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Torregreca: Life, death, miracles (A Delta book)","review":"This very graphic and descriptive book opened up my eyes to the realities that many of our ancestors faced in their lives.This compassionate woman described her time in a small townin Italy in a sharp contrast to most books on the subject,perhaps somewhat like &quot;Christ Stopped in Eboli&quot;For the person interested in Recent Italian history, this bookwill greatly enlarge your understanding of the plight of the southern italian.if you are looking for romantic fluff, don't read this book."},{"Title":"Torregreca: Life, death, miracles (A Delta book)","review":"This and Women of the shadows are wonderful books.The year's it was written and lived matter little,it's the people and the women who wrote about them that matter."},{"Title":"Torregreca: Life, death, miracles (A Delta book)","review":"A must read for those travelling to the Southern Italian hill country to show you what conditions were like before it was refound after 1962."},{"Title":"Torregreca: Life, death, miracles (A Delta book)","review":"I was misled by Frances Mayes' name listed next to the author's.She wrote only the introduction.

I only wish that the author would bring this book to someone to fix out the format and layout in order to make it a more interesting, understandable read. All textbooks give over tons of information; pick one that is not so incredibly boring."},{"Title":"America's First Cuisines","review":"This book is one of my favorites in recent years. I have become interested in the history of foods and Sophie Coe was an incredible scholar. Her books are great reading and amusing. Unfortunately she is no longer with us but she has left us with two wonderful books on the foods of the Americas (The True History of Chocolate--finished by her husband Michael Coe, another great writer of history. I highly reccommend this one as well)."},{"Title":"America's First Cuisines","review":"The list of food products discovered or created by the American Indians seems endless: corn, manioc (cassava, yuka, or tapioca) squash, beans, chocolate, tomatoes, potatoes, peanuts, pineapples, avocados, vanilla, and chile peppers -- plus for your Thanksgiving table, turkey, and for your wicked moments, tobacco, coca, and magic mushrooms. Conversely, there's been very little written about pre-Columbian cusine. Coe's book fills this lacunae.The Spanish destroyed every aspect of Indian culture they could but enough accounts of Indian food were recorded to partially construct what they ate. Coe focuses on the food of the three main civilizations in the Americas at the time of Columbus: the Aztecs, Mayas, and Incas. A lot more information survived about the food of the Aztecs than the other two.Working with fragmentary information Coe has reconstructed the cuisines of these civilizations -- and rich indeed were the foods they ate -- dozens of variations of tortillas and tamales, a heavy reliance on chiles, innumerable varieties of potatoes, and a huge variety of chocolate dishes that seem ripe for the exploration by culinary adventurers, entrepreneurs, and writers of cook books. The notion, often advanced, that the pre-Columbian diet was boring, primitive, or deficient is refuted persuasively here.The book suffers a bit from being an overly broad summary that left me hungry (groan!!!) for more information about many foods only barely mentioned. There's plenty of material here for additional books and questions to be answered. To echo an earlier reviewer: what did the Italians eat before the tomato amd the Irish before the potato?Smallchief"},{"Title":"America's First Cuisines","review":"I have interests in cooking and history. This book covers both and in an excellent way. The author's writing style is engaging and entertaining. I felt drawn into the book immediately and have a hard time putting it down. Ms. Coe's insights are funny and the amount of detail presented feels just right. She covers first the foodstuffs unique to the Americas then dives into the specifics for the Aztecs, the Maya, and the Inca. She discusses both pre-European contact and post-European contact cuisines and cultures.It isn't really a recipe book but her descriptions of the food gave me many ideas on how to prepare some of the dishes listed. It is truly a culinary anthropology book but don't let that put you off; it is easy and worthwhile even for us lay-folk. I also have a copy of her book on chocolate and am looking forward to reading that when this one is done.I recommend it if you have any interest in cooking, history, the Americas, or any of the cultures listed."},{"Title":"Pennsylvania's Heritage","review":"This lushly illustrated book belongs in every American library and any home that values diversity and Old World traditions. Dozens of bright, colorful photographs by Blair Seitz make the lively text by Georg R. Sheets a pleasure to behold. I counted dozens of ethnic groups represented in this hard cover large format volume. From the Native American Festival held in Sullivan County to the San Rocco Festival held in Aliquippa, this book makes you feel like you are there. Ukrainians, Italian, Croatians, Irish, Swedish, Lithuanians, and Jewish groups are just a few of the traditions explored here. Take a look at the foods, crafts, parades, festivals, music and holidays that add to the festive Pennsylvania experience reflected around the globe. It's a must for anyone conscious of the fact that we live on a very small globe, indeed."},{"Title":"Building Domestic Liberty: Charlotte Perkins Gilman's Architectural Feminism","review":"If you are researching the life and work of Charlotte Perkins Gilman this book will be an incredible resource for you. The author of the book does a great job of presenting historical context that shaped Gilman's attitudes. Details of Gilman's life are insightful and useful for connecting her life with her works of both fiction and nonfiction. And, the reason that this is one of the best books about Gilman is that it provides a very straight-forward and concise outline of her philosophies concerning socialism and feminism. Overall, this has been the most useful and insightful book about Gilman that I have found so far, and I would highly recommend that if you are doing research about her, start with this book."},{"Title":"Double Drink Story : My Life with Dylan Thomas","review":"Dylan Thomas was an enigma to me until I read this book; albeit the book was more about his wife.

I wouldn't recommend &#34; Double Drinking Story: My Life with Dylan Thomas to those who enjoy well written works, or for those who want a more in-depth biography of an incredible poet.

So this book is a very valuable tool.When asked by a patient about a medication I can say what I DO know and then I can look up anything else that I am not sure of so this book saves me steps and time and I've never had a negative patient comment about me looking up the info in front of them. Also it is very professional to be prepared to answer a question WHEN it is asked and NOT to have to leave to look it up and then possibly get distracted by another patient or another higher (more critical) priority and forget to get back with the patient with the medication question!

This is a symptom of what is known as Postmodernism. The fact is, though, that PoMo has been pass&eacute; for nearly twenty years. It was in its last throes when he first got going, in the late 1980s. It's always bizarre to read -ismic devotees who are waiting at railyards that no longer are served, and this is what DFW is, in spades. Basically, if you want to be PoMo you must lack humor, love clich&eacute;s, be rapt by stilted conversations and stereotyped caricatures, and be able to type on a word processor as quickly as you can for as long as you can and then hope someone with an even more horrid life than yours will sort through your genius. In 1996, this method resulted in a reputed three thousand plus piece of lard first draft that DFW turned into an editor, as he was apparently oblivious to what was good or bad within, which was eventually trimmed to about two thousand in a penultimate draft, which was then cut to about twelve hundred pages, and this became his infamous novel, Infinite Jest- a work that has already made the lists of some of the worst books ever published, even as others decry it, what else?, genius. That book, however, is not the subject of this review.The tale Luckily The Account Representative Knew CPR is a tale with potential to be passable, due to a few nice descriptions, and shows that at least DFW possessed some potential, unlike Dave Eggers. But, then self-conscious posing does it in....Here is the excerpt:That night Gimlet and Tit fellated me, and Boltpin did as well. Gimlet and Tit made me happy but Boltpin did not, therefore I am not a bisexual. Gimlet allowed me to burn her slightly and I felt that she was an outstanding person. Big acquired a puppy from the alley behind their house in east Los Angeles and he soaked it with gasoline and they allowed me to set it on fire in the basement studio of their rented home, and we all stood back to give it room as it ran around the house several time.While this is immature self-conscious writing, it also gives no insight to its cartoonish speaker and comments in no way on the action. And this sort of masturbation is the sum of the story times a hundred. It is just masturbation, pure and simple. And so go the rest of the tales in the book, and the last one- a novella called Westward The Course Of Empire Takes Its Way, combines all the flaws of the prior tales into one ridiculous piece whose self-consciousness doesn't even succeed in self-parody, with such subtitles as Foreground That Intrudes But's Really Too Tiny To Even See: Propositions About A Lover. I won't even get into the supposed narrative of the tale since that's not the point of the writing- it's really a comment on non-narrative cast as narrative about nothing- got it? Its only real points are to seem cool, and woo gullible coeds. DFW rocks, dude!Please, do not even think of trying the old dodge of claiming I've quoted DFW's crap out of context, because PoMo negates context! And when I say what something's about, in his work, I really mean that in a vague sense, as PoMo is never really \`about' a thing. Thus, his work lacks connections to the outer world, despite the name dropping, and is suffused with detailed minutiae that serves no purpose, and is so ill-written, that even were there a sense of purpose under the lard, no one would care to extract it. In short, self-indulgent writing is merely self-indulgent writing, not daring, much less innovative, and to even call this writing trash is to demean the hardy biosphere of vermin. Fluff is the heart of his work, and solipsistic nihility its soul. DFW is, at best, \`potentially mediocre', and that might be attained in twenty or thirty years, if he gets cracking now. Of course, history shows that in about fifty or so years this sort of crap will be openly seen as the long practical joke it is. Good, and especially great, writing forces connections upon a reader by bringing things up from the depths to the pellicle of its engagement, and allowing the reader to pop the bubbles or not. PoMo and DFW have no such aspiration, and therefore no bubbles surface in their anaerobic cesspool. Now, breathe out, slowly...."},{"Title":"Girl with curious hair: Stories (Contemporary American fiction)","review":"Ignoring all the fuzz about postmodern writing, I constantly found myself asking, what kind of impact did writers like Thomas Pynchon, Don DeLillo or William Gaddis might have had to other writers and, even more significant, what trace have they left in modern writing. In David Foster Wallace's collection of short stories, &quot;Girl with curious hair&quot;, I found a large portion of my questions answered.I've just finished it in almost one sitting, and like so often, when the book you've just finished didn't turned out to be total crap, you start missing its characters.I miss Julie Smith from the &quot;Jeopardy !&quot; show, I wanna stick to &quot;Sick Puppy&quot; and his punky friends visiting a Keith Jarrett (!) concert. I feel sorry for old pal Chuck Nunn, jr., who, after a car accident, had his eyes constantly popping out their holes (!!). I deeply felt for the woman who &quot;appeared in the David Letterman show&quot;, don't be nervous anymore ! And then finally there's David Boyd, first boy and close friend of the president of the United States, Lynton B.Johnson !David Foster Wallace presents each of the five stories in a different tone, a different style: There's the more traditional narrative form in the first story, pure satire (with shades of Brett Easton Ellis's &quot;American Psycho&quot;) in the second, and a haunting yet nightmarish and illogical atmosphere in the third one. The fourth story comes with a dry, almost documentary-like kind of prose, while the fifth and last story (the LBJ story) once again returns to more traditional grounds.But don't worry: David Foster Wallace successfully manages to avoid pretentiousness or self-indulgence and never lets &quot;Girl with curious hair&quot; end up in a writing skill showcase !This book is funny, it's brilliant, it should be regarded as a modern classic, but word comes around his other books are even better &lt;...&gt; oboy !"},{"Title":"Girl with curious hair: Stories (Contemporary American fiction)","review":"Why do so many reviews warn readers of the complexity of Infinte Jest? I found Infinite Jest to be a hundred times more readable than most of the stories in Girl with Curious Hair. The last story is ridicliously difficult to read and the ending makes no sense at all. Why would an author who deftly satirizes meta-fiction even in his first book (which some reviewers compared to the great metafictionists) purposefully try to be so difficult? Like the main character in Broom of the System tells Rick Vigorous: why don't you tell a real story instead of a story about a story? As a huge David Foster Wallace fan, I have to admit that I positively abhor Broom of the System and most of Girl With Curious Hair. They seem to be like cold, heartless exercises in how-avant-garde-can-I-be? and not at all pieces of writing that seemed like they were written by the author of Infinite Jest. But as my title eludes to, I am postively enamored with My Appearance. As an indictment of postmodern irony and its inability to truly accomplish anything, the story is flawless (well maybe the didactic dialogue can be a little off putting). More than any other living author, David Foster Wallace tackles the most important issues of the day to his generation and mine: drug abuse, depression, loneliness, irony, sex, and television. And, unlike other authors, he doesn't do it in a cute or ironic way. In an anthology of literary criticism from the 1950s, I read an article in which a critic expressed her feeling that writers of her decade had lost the ability to write about their culture and instead chose to focus on subjective explorations of individuals outside the bounds of society. I find current writers to be having the same difficulties, though instead of decadent novels about sex, drugs, and depression, todays writers write novels about mysterious byzantine paintings or soulless \\"satires\\" of the media in which the same sort of heartless humor and everyone's-a-whore philosophy found on late night TV is used to supposedly \\"skewer\\" that very phemenona. Those who are unafraid to face real, scary human realities like Wallace are the real heroes."},{"Title":"Girl with curious hair: Stories (Contemporary American fiction)","review":"True to form, D F W offers some very \\"literary\\" story, some po-mo fireworks, and caps it off with a silly sitcom feel. But I kept asking myself through the read, \\"Is this worth it?\\" Some stories, like \\"Little Expressionless Animals\\" yes, others like \\"John Billy\\" one has to ask, what's the point?I agree with the earlier reviewers, Pynchon infiltrates this text, making these stories about rock stars, tv celebrities, and politicians seem less, well, unique. And while Pynchon steps back on the narrative and sort of accepts the absurdity of his premises (like in Vineland), Wallace also wants this sort of authenticity, this emotional punch, which at times seems contrived.So, he is essentially writing for two (or three, including himself) audiences, the lit critics and the fans, and unfortunately he cannot hit both, so he settles on m.o.r. fare that's vaguely insulting to his characters. I mean, his characters, like Boyd in \\"Lyndon\\" come off as caricatures, silly stand-ins for the BIG POINT he wants to get across to the grad school audience.I think D F W was talented and had a great deal to say, but I also think that he is best simply telling a story, instead of having to add literary value, because let's face it, there's only so much to the joke of a bunch of conservative \\"punkrockers\\" in \\"Girl with the Curious Hair.\\"My recommendation, pick this up, but do not feel beholden to finishing any one story."},{"Title":"Girl with curious hair: Stories (Contemporary American fiction)","review":"I have not yet finished the last story, but I couldn't wait.

The different voices, the moral tone, the evocation of time, space, time/space, the absolutely hallucinogenic skill and joy in language. &quot;John Billy&quot; is so damn strange and so damn wonderful, sporting, among other gems, the priceless: &quot;The cleft rigger got levitationally joined by some other civilians.&quot; Get on the stick and ride this puppy."},{"Title":"Girl with curious hair: Stories (Contemporary American fiction)","review":"This book was simply not as good as other David Foster Wallace writings I've read. However, it is probably the funniest, and possibly the most absurd plot-wise of his I've read. The first story was probably the funniest and the last (novella length) story, \\"Westward the Course of Empire Takes its Way,\\" was probably my favorite, in which he trashes postmodernism in oft-clever and funny ways. There's no footnotes/endnotes in this story collection which is a common element in his other writings and which I find to be one of my favorite things about his writing. I can't pinpoint all the things that make me feel this collection is inadequate, I think it's just not as good is plenty sufficient though. So overall, not as great as I'd expect from David Foster Wallace and definitely not a good place to start for new readers of Wallace."},{"Title":"Girl with curious hair: Stories (Contemporary American fiction)","review":"I had not heard of David Wallace until I read his remarkable graduation address, \\"This is Water.\\" I was hoping that this collection of short stories would convince me to make the investment in his enormous novel, \\"Infinite Jest.\\" The verdict is: No.Not that Wallace isn't an exceptionally skilled and brilliant writer. Even the execrable stories in this collection contain flashes of brilliance. Wallace seems to give in to self-loathing and misanthropic impulses. He doesn't like his characters or himself, and, particularly in the last, endless, and terrible story in this collection, spends his time playing games, being satirical, and showing how clever he is. The guy who wrote \\"This is Water\\" is nowhere to be found in this story. I don't care how clever you are, Mr. Wallace: if you show contempt for your reader, your reader will show contempt for you.Still, I found one story in this collection to be truly great. The story \\"Lyndon\\" captures Lyndon Johnson in all his complexity. It shows the evolving relationship between Johnson and a low level aid who becomes his most trusted aid, the way Johnson crossed all boundaries in relationships, his overriding need for love. Johnson becomes a truly tragic and in some ways sympathetic character in this story.There are other worthwhile stories in the book. Wallace writes about popular culture, which is a neglected area when it comes to high literature. His first story regarding a Jeopardy game show contestant is moving. And his story about an appearance on the David Letterman Show is a very funny exploration of the mean spirited nature of contemporary comedy.The \\"Girl with Curious Hair\\" is not a good story, despite being used as the overall title for the book. I don't buy the characters, and Wallace is just being cute and satirical.It's very hard to rate the book given its uneven quality and given that Wallace, who is unfortunately now deceased by way of suicide, possessed great talent that was often squandered. I give it 3 stars given his talent, and given the strength of the \\"Lyndon\\" story, even though I disliked a number of the stories in the collection."},{"Title":"Girl with curious hair: Stories (Contemporary American fiction)","review":"Fact: Wallace was a better writer than any of his contemporaries.There are no bad stories here and three of them are brilliant; the title story, \\"Little Expressionless Animals\\" and \\"My Appearance\\" are all well worth a read. The standout however was \\"Lyndon\\" about the hapless american president. This story stayed with me long after I read it. It was emotionally affecting and believable as a piec of historical fiction. One of the best short stories I have ever read."},{"Title":"Girl with curious hair: Stories (Contemporary American fiction)","review":"There are some great stories in this D.F.W. collection, \\"Girl With Curious Hair.\\" Unfortunately, with this being a D.F.W. book, there will probably be a few that the reader won't care for (At least that has been the case with some of the other D.F.W. essay/short story collections I've read). Fortunately, \\"Girl\\" opens on a really strong note, with \\"Little Expressionless Animals.\\" The story follows Julie Smith. A woman who, without giving too much away, makes a living by appearing on the game show \\"Jeopardy.\\" She is also dating one of the show's staff, Faye Goddard.\\"Animals\\" is told in a non-linear manner, and it's through the use of flashbacks that the story touches on some of the more important people and events in Julie's life, in such a way that you get to know Julie better than you do most character's in full length novels. I know that after finishing \\"Animals,\\" I wished that D.F.W had actually expanded on this story to the point where it was a full length novel. It's a memorable experience.The next story that I really enjoyed was the book's namesake \\"Girl With Curious Hair,\\" which follows a yuppie by the name \\"Sick Puppy,\\" who is attending a Keith Jarrett show with his punk rock friends. After a few pages of reading Sick Puppy's masochistic schtick and racist remarks I started to think that this character was a parody of the way Bret Easton Ellis writes his character's, and, low and behold, when I did an search online to see what I could find out about this story I was proven correct. Apparently, D.F.W wasn't too enthusiastic for B.E.E.'s writing style, and skewers it, needing only to take up 20 pages to do so.\\"Lyndon\\" is the first-person account of David Boyd, an intern who worked for Lyndon Baines Johnson while he was both a senator and president. The story hints at a possible homosexual relationship between the two, and the suspicion is further flushed out by quotes from other characters that are peppered through out the narration. The ending is both comical and weird, and left me wondering if any of Johnson's relatives have read this story.\\"John Billy\\" is memorable simply for how funny it is. The story concerns a young man, who, after being in an car wreck, has the ability to pop his eyes out from their sockets. This seems to be the main point behind the story: to mention this as many times as possible (That's what I thought anyway, I'm probably wrong). The repetition reminds me of another D.F.W. piece \\"The Depressed Person\\" from \\"Brief Interviews with Hideous Men,\\" where the narrator constantly reiterates just how depressed she is, but keeps saying it in different ways.Finally there is \\"My Appearance,\\" about a well-to-do-actress who goes on the David Letterman show. The actresses' husband and a close friend worn her about how Dave is going to make a fool of her and that to save face she should beat him to the punch by making deprecating remarks about herself first. They also get her to wear a small headset so that they can tell her what to say during the interview.The other stories in this collection simply weren't my cup of tea, but hey, that's not to say that they're not anyone else's? I will say that even though it wears it's welcome out about seventy pages in, the novella \\"Westward the Course of Empire It's Way\\" has some interesting commentary on metafiction, postmodernism (Whatever you want to call it). And that while the premise was interesting (A reunion of everyone who's ever been in a McDonald's commercial, meeting together to take part in another McDonald's commercial), the characters, unfortunately just aren't.Overall, \\"Girl With Curious Hair\\" makes for an engaging read whether you're D.F.W. virgin, or someone who's familiar with D.F.W.'s oeuvre."},{"Title":"Girl with curious hair: Stories (Contemporary American fiction)","review":"DFW is obviously brilliant. The last story had me in rapture, the story about David Letterman was perfectly written, and the first story left long lasting traces on me. That being said, DFW has no idea how to end a story and often, doesn't know when to stop writing. But his characters are memorable and he knows how to change voices with the best of them. Damn shame to lose a great writer."},{"Title":"Girl with curious hair: Stories (Contemporary American fiction)","review":"Reading this collection brought to mind a review I once read of a film, a paraphrasing of which best sums up this work: this is such a close copy of Thomas Pynchon that it's not plagarism, it's quotation. The extended fugue on Jack Lord and &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; in the last story (&quot;Westward...&quot;) could've been lifted directly from &quot;Vineland&quot;. Overall, the world-weary hipness and extended verbal (literal?) arabesques wore me out. At least Pynchon was genuinely funny, at intervals."},{"Title":"Girl with curious hair: Stories (Contemporary American fiction)","review":"DFW is a phenomenal writer. This book is a good introduction to him for those that may not have the time or attention span for Infinite Jest.The title piece is probably the weakest story, with a stream of conciousness that just doesn't quite work right. Most of the other stories and beautiful and exhilirating, though. Westward the Course of Empire Makes Its Way (I think I got the title right, it's been a while) is the best short story I've read in years. The Jeopary Story (I can't remember the name; you'll know it when you get to it) is insane and beautiful.This is a must read.By the way, I just don't understand the unfavourable comparisons to Pynchon.

As in OF ALL TIME. This collection hinted at the genius that would eventually write the incredible &quot;Infinite Jest.&quot; Can't wait for more from DFWallace."},{"Title":"Girl with curious hair: Stories (Contemporary American fiction)","review":"Okay, so here's the deal w/ DFW: the guy is extremely intelligent. he is also overtly aware of his intelligence and displays it all over the place. this bothers people. some things to remember and know about DFW: he was a philo. major as an undergrad; his first book was an investigation of the theories of ludwig wittgenstein, also an overly intelligent fellow and very hard to follow. Something else: in this collection of short-stories, the one titled \\"the girl w/ curious hair,\\" DFW displays that he also knows one thing or another about fiction and that he has read a lot of it and doesn't like most of it. the title story, \\"girl w cur...\\" is a cool story is you think you like punks and nihilists and sado-masochism and other stuff, but it helps to know something about bret easton ellis's stuff, and to know that DFW hates (HATES!) BEE w/ some serious passion. Then there's the two stories about real-world characters, \\"little expressionless animals\\"--the opening piece, and i think it's pretty damn cool--and \\"lyndon\\" are investigations/explorations of using \\"real-world characters\\" (which for legal reasons has to be roundly denied) that was pioneered by the exceedingly weird and totally fun robert coover who wrote \\"the public burning\\" whose main character was richard milhouse nixon and was the first book to use a \\"RWC\\" as a protagonist. so there's that. then there's the piece of cathartic/psyhological diaglogue, in which DFW dips his fingers, there's \\"john billy\\" which is kind of a stab at faulkner but is also pretty cool and a really great read near the end (which i find is pretty true of most of DFW's stuff, it takes a while to build up and the guy is a straight-up bonafide (a word he hates) genius at bringing it all together and making you feel good when you finish a story). there's some other stuff in there (like \\"everything's green\\" which is only two pages but still isn't his shortest piece which was only like five lines, and both of those are cool). finally, there's the final fiction, a novella of about like 150 pages or something and it's all-over john barth (author of \\"the floating opera,\\" \\"giles goat-boy\\" (which is way weird), \\"the sot-weed factor\\" and others) principally his exlposive collection of shorts, \\"lost in the funhouse.\\" ytou should read that entire book (it's short) in order to really get what DFW is after in \\"westward the course of empire makes its way,\\" and he's really after \\"metafiction,\\" look it up. so this is all to say that DFW is writing fiction, and it's way cool fiction, well written and crafted, with interesting characters and solid \\"stories,\\" but it is way helpful to know his sources. this kind of fiction--intertexual and in some ways needing a well-literary-read reader--is not for all. it's some damn fun stuff on it's own though. i recommend DFW to those w/ an interest in where \\"serious literary fiction\\" might be making it's way; to those who also enjoy and appreciate vollmann, powers, pynchon (seriously pynchon), gaddis, barth, maybe updike a little but not totally, and some other guys, yeah, mostly white males, but also cynthia ozick, whose fiction is slamming, especially her shorts which are hard to come by. so there's that, which is nice."},{"Title":"Girl with curious hair: Stories (Contemporary American fiction)","review":"I have recently gotten into modern fiction, after years of reading Hemingway and others during his time and before. A writer whose work entertained me recommended David Foster Wallace in an interview, so I decided to get _Girl with Curious Hair_. Now I have another writer to admire. &quot;Here and There&quot; is a brilliant short story, and it appears in the 1989 edition of the O. Henry Awards. In this story, he takes a common theme (the breakup of a romantic relationship) and presents it in a beautifully original way. I also enjoyed &quot;Little Expressionless Animals&quot; and &quot;Lyndon&quot; -- though I'm not going to pretend to understand the ending to that one. The main problem I see with this book is the inconsistency of the stories. When Wallace is on, he's on; when he's not, he's not. I can't make any sense out of the title story. Plus, it's not as well written as many of the other stories are. The last story seemed like one big ramble, though there are humorous moments. Overall, though, this book is definitely worth buying. &quot;Here and There&quot; is a superb story."},{"Title":"Girl with curious hair: Stories (Contemporary American fiction)","review":"This collection of short stories is, sadly, much stronger than the more recent batch released in Oblivion. D.F. Wallace still seems stymied by the mammoth success he generated with Infinite Jest; it's been 12 years and still no new novel. If Oblivion is any indication, maybe he used up most of his brilliance with I.J.The good news is that this book contains some real gems of short fiction. The title story is one of the most frightening, deeply disturbing pieces I've ever read. Nothing supernatural happens, but its depiction of dementia spawned by the horrific child abuse in the narrator's past really gets under your skin. Other strong entries are \\"Little Expressionless Animals\\" and \\"My Appearance.\\" The final story, though cited as a precursor of sorts to Infinite Jest, didn't do much for me.All in all, this is a stunning piece of work that goes far beyond the boundaries often associated with the short story format."},{"Title":"Girl with curious hair: Stories (Contemporary American fiction)","review":"Ok so she claims she has weird hair like whatever who the hell does she think she is dying her hair a diferent color everyday just to impress some neighbor of hers!

However, it is obvious the author is still searching his method. Some stories are just dead and strange. The author at his best is far more unsettling and unblinkingly addictive than Vonnegut. Other stories... are just not as they could be, and disappoint. I can only hope that David Wallace can pull his talent together continuously through a full book, and soon."},{"Title":"Girl with curious hair: Stories (Contemporary American fiction)","review":"I read Girl With Curious Hair after Infinite Jest, so I thought I had some idea of what to expect. The stories in this book are so different from one another, and from Jest, that I shall now review them separately.Little Expressionless Animals-This story blended the absurd business of game shows perfectly with the absurd story of a savant lesbian and her autistic brother. This was probably my favorite story.Luckily the Account Representative Knew CPR- This story was the very crisp. It is short, and it is still detailed, but it is not an extravaganza like the others. It is a good story, though, and very clever.Girl With Curious Hair- This story is hilarious and very perverse. My brother says it is pro-Republicanism, but I do not believe him. It may be too perverted for many people.Lyndon- This is a good example of DFW's ability to recreate actual famous people. It is also a comment on the different kinds of love people have. I don't think that I understood it.John Billy- John Billy is an excellent example of DFW's style. It is a simple story about the hometown hero Chuck Nunn Jr, told in a complicatedly Kansan dialect and with a bizzarre twist at the end.Here and There- This is a story that I enjoyed very much. It is a dialectic account of the failure of a genius to love. It has an anti-ending similar to Infinite Jest, though, which many find troublesome.My Appearance- This may be the best story in the collection. It explores the conflicting themes of sincerity/naivite and irony/cynicism. It also stars David Letterman.Say Never- This story was about a man who cheats on his wife and then with his brother's girlfriend, and then confesses. It is told from his p.o.v., the brother's, and their mother's friend Labov. I didn't like this one that much, but the style is, as usual, amazing.Everything is Green- This one is only two pages long and doesnt make any sense as far as I can tell. If it were more than two pages long, I might advise skipping it. But then, if it were more than two pages long, it might be good.Westward the Course of Empire Takes Its Way- This novella made me think alot, about stories and postmodernism and commercialism. I liked it alot. However, like Barth's Lost in the Funhouse that inspired it, at the end I did not understand it.On the whole, this is an excellent collection and there is something to like about each piece, except maybe Everything is Green. I recommend it and Infinte Jest to pretty much anybody."},{"Title":"Girl with curious hair: Stories (Contemporary American fiction)","review":"I don't mean to toot my own horn here, but I feel that I'm a pretty well-read guy. I love David Foster Wallace. I'm even on an e-mail list devoted to the guy, but I'm not a huge fan of this collection.I loved 'Infinite Jest', 'A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again' and 'Broom of the System', but it seems that Wallace's short fiction is *very* difficult to read.You could compare this collection to Wallace's more recent 'Brief Interviews with Hideous Men' if you wanted, but I think you'd find them terribly different. 'Brief Interviews' seems to have a coherent theme throught, but 'Girl' seems to be nothing but a terribly challenging puzzle.There are, of course upsides. I found 'The Jeopary Story' to be terribly funny and I also thought that 'Westward the Course of Empire Makes Its Way' was very well written. Yet falling downs include the title piece and some of the other, sometimes terribly short, stories.You have to wonder sometimes if Wallace isn't just being difficult on purpose. Thinking to himself, &quot;could I possibly make this more difficult?&quot;If you're new to Wallace, pick up his collection of non-fiction essays, the previously mentioned 'A Supposedly Fun thing I'll Never Do Again'. Wallace is a terribly funny writer and his amazing talent shines in his non-fiction work. 'Infinite Jest' is damn good as well, but not for the casual reader."},{"Title":"Girl with curious hair: Stories (Contemporary American fiction)","review":"Each story is a gem in it's own space. Wallace pushes the envelope of fiction writing into a place that is worth the effort to follow. Get your dictionary by your side and be prepared for an unexpected ride. My only regret is that some of the stories end unfinished, which is a clever ploy and shows that he does not pander to the American desire for a pat finish. A much easier and fulfilling read then Infinite Jest."},{"Title":"Girl with curious hair: Stories (Contemporary American fiction)","review":"its completely annoying that few people seem to be able to talk about DFW without bringing up Pynchon (i am a case in point, i suppose); the comparisons between them are simplistic and easy, and really they are completely different from one another. beyond that, the difference between DFW and other writers is that he (DFW) is the best writer in the world and after reading him i find myself only interested in other authors only in as much as they have influenced/been ignored by/or subtly reminded me of DFW. Pynchon fanatics are often a testy lot to deal with, and obsessively find similarities and apings of their boy to such an extent that they seem to suffer some classic Pynchon-paranoia. heck i myself love Pynchon but to me he and DFW are living on different planets. also its not like Pynchon and Delillo have some kind of patent on the right to write about pop culture and television etc.: a writer almost cant not write about such things: its just the way it is. aside from my blatherings about Pynchon and DFW i just have to say that its almost impossible to believe that One human being could have written all of the stories in this book: DFW exhibits more scope, inventivness and flatout artistic intelligence in this one collection of stories than most writers do in two lifetimes. He has the amazing ability to simply be Right On with all of his ideas, characters, descriptions... The last story (and also the longest at 140 pages) is beatifully sad, and is just the type of original fiction that you rarely ever find."},{"Title":"Girl with curious hair: Stories (Contemporary American fiction)","review":"Collection of short stories, a lot of fodder for philosophical discussion.

I don't think I've ever seen such a wide array of forms and styles in one collection. Wallace's stories engage me on a number of levels. He does a lot with meta-narrative, but never enough to detract from the symbolic ideas he's building. The real draw here, though, is his use of language. His choice of words and the combinations he puts them in are a source of continual surprise, and the tortured syntax he often employs might annoy some readers, but it also forces you to relax and yield to the many pleasures these stories have to offer."},{"Title":"Tiempo De Cerezas/Time of the Reds (Fiction, Poetry & Drama) (Spanish Edition)","review":"Buen&iacute;sima novela que trata principalmente de conflictos generacionales en la Espa&ntilde;a de los 70.

Delicious. Transgressive. Hot. Pritchard's stories never settle into either of the predominant camps of dirty books, on the one hand \\"Letters to Penthouse\\" frat-boy fantasies, or the limp erotica of the \\"gossamer-and-moonbeams\\" school on the other. (Though Pritchard evidently started out writing youthful imitations of the latter variety, including a story involving blueberries, described with charming self-deprecation in the Afterword.) Favorite stories are \\"Pretend,\\" an extended D/s fantasy, \\"Too Beautiful,\\" in which an aggressive narrator finds himself subtly dominated (and loving it!) and \\"Lizza,\\" a feverish, hallucinatory chronicle of incestuous siblings whose appetites for transgression lead them from ferocious copulation to a violent crime spree. The collection isn't just porn, though -- the stories stand up (beautifully) to comparisons with more straight-laced contemporary short prose fiction. Sometimes funny, sometimes sad. Sometimes both at once. And always filthy."},{"Title":"Too Beautiful and Other Stories 2 Ed","review":"Reading this book brings gut reactions - titillation, shock, excitment.

Having read Rossi, Bandler, Grinder, Gilligan, etc., and struggled to get through their overyly analytical obfuscations of Erickson's methods, I was delighted with this simply written, clear, and easy to follow text. The reason I didn't buy it sooner was that I had read his other book &quot;Taproots&quot; and found it too abstract and disappointing. What a long way the author has come since he wrote Taproots! He presents Ericksonian ideas in a way that is delightful to read, down-to-earth, and effortless to follow. O'Hanlon is an excellent teacher, especially for those of us who are jargon-ically challenged. My only gripe is the high cost of this rather brief volume."},{"Title":"Solution-Oriented Hypnosis: An Ericksonian Approach","review":"This is an engaging and extremely readable introduction to Ericksonian Hypnotherapy. Profoundly less &quot;technical manual&quot; than the Grinder Bandler stuff, yet is certainly not dumbed down.Written with humor and undertanding in the informal style of a seminar in a manner that anyone could learn from.I would recommend this to anyone interested in Ericksonian Hypnosis."},{"Title":"Solution-Oriented Hypnosis: An Ericksonian Approach","review":"O'Hanlon's introduction to solution-oriented work and ericksonian hypnosis is top-rate, while managing to avoid excessively leaning on the purple coat-tails of Uncle Milty (Milton H.

Those experienced in one or the other modality will find something of value in learning about the overlap between the two disciplines, and the way they can amplify each other.For the curious reader interested in hypnosis, or the beginning student of either method, this is one of the best combinations of readable style and substance on the market"},{"Title":"Solution-Oriented Hypnosis: An Ericksonian Approach","review":"Bill O'Hanlon is a great author!

The artist has become a shaman, venturing into the inner space in order to find and define a greater reality. With the revival of metaphysical and occult beliefs in our modern technological society, we have gone full circle, since our culture was born in magic and mystery. Through the centuries, and especially so since the growth of rational thought, we have transformed myth into history, magic into reason and mystery into technology. Despite the construction of a complex mechanistic environment in our urban sprawl, certain philosophies of reaction have emerged and some of these may be grouped together in what has been termed &quot;the consciousness movement.&quot; This is a body of attitudes and views which challenges the prevailing scientific world-view in terms of its pre-eminence as a belief system. The consciousness movement is asking questions like: What is the most complete span of perception accessible to man, what is his most deeply felt sense of reality and what does it consist of? The relevance of the current magical revival clearly lies in its inclination towards discovering the primal impulses of the Western creative imagination. The author weaves together a whole spectrum of creative manifestations, from the Tarot and Salvador Dali, to Jung, the Golden dawn and Pink Floyd, charting the riches of a subconscious world that we are endeavouring to bring to consciousness as never before. For those interested in popular music, the chapter titled The Rise of Cosmic Music offers a feast of reading. It discusses, amongst others, the music of Steppenwolf, Donovan, Mick Jagger, David Bowie, King Crimson, Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd, Santana, Peter Hammill, Bo Hansson's music inspired by Lord of the Rings, the German Electronic Music of bands like Tangerine Dream, Peter Baumann and Klaus Schulze. We are living in interesting times, in an era where we may experience major transformations in the consensus reality. The emergence of a far-ranging and eclectic cosmology to mirror the shifts in our everyday world-view will not be far behind. Drury allows us to see the bigger picture and has done an excellent job. The book concludes with notes, a bibliography and an index. Black and White reproductions of beautiful and sometimes frightening paintings grace the middle section of the book. My favorites include Wilfried Satty's &quot;Child and Signs in the Sky&quot; &amp; &quot;Gemstone&quot;, Max Ernst's &quot;Birth of the Galaxy&quot;, Diana Vandenberg's &quot;Rex et Regina II&quot;, Rosaleen Norton's &quot;Individuation&quot;, and T.

Like so many other city guides by Richard Saul Wurman, this book combines an architectural overview with historical, anecdotal and practical aspects of the city in such a way that makes it a great companion to have before during and after the visit. As a matter of fact even if you don't go, you get the pleasure of intimate knowledge of the place."},{"Title":"Access Washington, D.C. (Access Washington, D.C.)","review":"When some friends mentioned they had never visited DC, I decided that I'd use some of the gazillion frequent flyer miles I have and fly them and the family up for a week and serve as a tour guide.I lived and worked in DC earlier in my career and have visited probably another 25-times as well on business, so I wasn't sure a printed tour guide would be particularly useful. But, just to be thorough, I picked up a copy of this guide \\"Access Washington DC\\" along with another, titled \\"The Unofficial Guide to Washington, DC.\\"I liked the handiness of the Access guide, it's lighter, thinner and easier to carry around; the Unofficial Guide is heftier and every extra ounce that you're carrying around all day does get a bit annoying.The Access guide is also easier to read -- pages are divided by section of town, it is profusely illustrated with easy-to-read maps, has multicolored headings to separate text and has an excellent index. I also liked its design; it's visually interesting and has an attractive cover with a nice double-column layout for its text. All of this makes it inviting to pick up and read. While I like the numbering of restaurants and sites in the text and how they are marked on the maps, I wish the text font was just a bit larger and that they had placed the subway map up front instead of in the back. But, these are just nit-picking points.The Unofficial guide is bland in comparison. It is printed in black, white with grey-tone inset boxes, its text goes the full width of the page, left-to-right and its size is a bit intimidating to someone who might want to just check a resturant description and address or get a description of a monument or historical site.As for content, each guide appears to be focused on a different target market: The Access guide oriented toward tourists -- with its text devoted mainly on restaurants, monuments, parks and historical and other sites of interest. And, the Unofficial guide appears to be designed as a combination reference book and tour guide -- perhaps aimed at those who move to DC or are there for significant lengths of time on business.For example, the Unofficial guide is divided into the following segments: \\"Planning Your Visit to Washington,\\" \\"Hotels,\\" \\"Visiting Washington on Business,\\" \\"Arriving and Getting Oriented,\\" \\"Getting Around Washington,\\" \\"Entertainment and Nightlife,\\" \\"Exercise and Recreation,\\" \\"Shopping in Washinton,\\" and FINALLY \\"Sightseeing Tips and Tours,\\" \\"Washington Attractions,\\" and \\"Dining and Restaurants.\\"I used both and found content in each worth reading and believe that our trip was enriched by my use of them. As such, I would advise purchase of the latest edition of both -- skim the Unofficial guide before the trip and at night in the hotel and carry and use the Access guide with you.Additional Note: A lot has happened since 9-11, more security and lines, no more tours of the Pentagon or the FBI Building; six month waiting lists to tour the White House; you have to get in line at 6 am for tickets to tour the Washington Monument and the Bureau of Engraving; the Capital tours are in plush new facilities, but groups are herded about.Still, there's no other city in the world like DC. The museums are fabulous, the IMAX at the Air & Space and the Natural History museums are great fun, the sights are inspiring and the food is wonderful. For a clean, safe, free and walkable sightseeing vacation for the family that likes to sample foods from all over the world -- DC can't be beat!R.

The color coding for attractions, restaurants, hotels and shopping make skimming for your favorites a breeze. More often than not, their sly 'insider' comments are right on the money. I used ACCESS Washington, DC to acclimate myself to my new home, and I still use it whenever company comes to town. Like any travel guide, the latest edition is a must (but even that won't compensate for fickle diners and undercapitalized restauranteurs) and it's certainly time for a newer version than the 2000 edition. But having said that, I still purchase an ACCESS guide if I'm going to spend any time in a city I haven't fully explored."},{"Title":"Access Washington, D.C. (Access Washington, D.C.)","review":"I am so sorry that the Access Guides seem to be disappearing. For my first trip to Washington DC, I finally ordered the 2007 version of this book--nothing newer seems to exist--and even with such an old publication date, it proved to be much more helpful than the other guidebooks that I'd already purchased. I love the Access format because it travels through each neighborhood in the city. Each section has a map with a number that designates a hotel's, museum's, shop's, restaurant's location. And the detailed information offered about each of those places is always helpful and often quite drole. I was in a quandary about which hotel to choose in Washington--location is always the most important thing with me. Access allowed me to make that decision by showing me where the hotel was placed and what restaurants, museums, etc. were close by. Other guidebook require a map of the city and then much page turning since their format is not so consumer friendly. Most guidebooks lump all hotels together, then all shopping together, etc. (I really don't need to know about shopping or restaurants in Arlington if I'm not going to get to Arlington.) Since the publication date of this book, several restaurants near the hotel had disappeared, as had the Border's book store. But, still, I found the Access guide offering the best information in helping me to sort out where to go and what to do. I am sorry to see this publication unavailable. I've made this guidebook my first choice whenever I consider traveling somewhere new. The books are always fun to read and the best source that I've discovered for quickly making me feel grounded in a new place.

The book was written in 1950 in a gentle narrative style. It is not a technical book, although it covers aspects of how a steam car is put together, and provides a great comment on the passing of skills as technology moves on. We are now three generations - arguably four or five now - away from those who actually built Stanley steam cars, but there are new generations of enthusiasts keen to keep these unusual cars on the road. The book is a timely reminder, in this age of increasing environmental awareness, that steam cars produce no pollution, because the external combustion process burns completely, as against the relatively inefficient internal combustion engine. Woodbury is a real character - one who by his own admission bites off more than he can chew and chews like heck. The result is a triumph of tenacity and determination over doubt and difficulty. He has no special qualifications, just a passion for an unusual machine, and a really engaging conversational writing style. I found it hard to put this book down."},{"Title":"The story of a Stanley Steamer","review":"This is a wonderful journey to take. If you love a bit of nostalgia and a good read, buy this book and enjoy it. If you love old cars, buy it for its subject matter and enjoy it. If you have a fascination with steam and old steam cars, buy it for the detail on how these old steamers were built, driven, and maintained. If you own a Stanley Steamer, and don't already have a copy, then something is very wrong. This is a delightful read about a retired college professor turned water-powered wood mill operator, who becomes obsessed with owning a vintage Stanley Steamer. Even if you don't care much about cars at all, it's still a wonderfully written true story with loads of human interest. Jay Leno mentions this book on his website.Lance S.

We especially enjoy this CD series for trips in the car, as the time passes quickly while enthralled with the plot. It is a wonderful book series, and if you can't find time for reading, this is a great way to expose your family to good writing. \\"The Last Battle\\" happens to be the last book in the series, so be sure to start with \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" and \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" first.

Furthermore, how do you interpret these interrelated economic and psychological signals and what are their impacts on financial assets?

The text does an excellent job in providing trading scenarios into the asset classes and how economic indicators can turn short or long positions into potential profits. I'd also recommend \\"The Traders Guide to Key Economic Indicators,\\" by Richard Yamarone for novice traders desiring to get an inside look into the economy."},{"Title":"A short synopsis of the most essential points in Hawaiian grammar","review":"This book is a brief grammar of the Hawaiian language as it was encountered by American missionaries in the Nineteenth Century. It was originally written in 1864, perhaps for new missionaries who wished to master the language through grammar-translation methods so that they could better spread the Word. It begins with a two-page summary of pronunciation and phonology. Then it turns to parts of speech, with examples of nouns, pronouns, adjectives, numerals, fractions, verbs, etc. This section concludes with a two paragraph article on word formation. The second part of the book covers syntax, with examples of such topics as affirmative and negative sentences, attributive adjectives, predicates, infinitives, possessive constructions, dependent clauses, and comparatives. At the end of the book are seven short passages presented in word-by-word translation drawn from the Bible and Hawaiian mythology.For all but the most determined reader, this book is a very frustrating tract. The author repeatedly displays the chauvinistic linguistic attitudes of the Nineteenth Century, in which Greek and Latin were held to have the most worthy types of grammars, while English grammar was acceptable if imperfect, and grammars from \\"savage\\" languages such as Hawaiian were lame, unable to express complex concepts. Thus, Alexander often points out constructions that can't be translated directly into Hawaiian or laments the lack of complex structures (but provides very weak coverage of grammatical areas in which Hawaiian is more complex than English or Greek). Of course, this was the accepted approach of the time, so Alexander can't be faulted for it specifically.Setting aside these points, readers interested in learning something of the grammatical structure of the language will find the book quite frustrating. With each grammatical point, Alexander provides a brief description framed in the terms and analysis of linguistic understanding of his day. Since this description is at odds with current grammatical terminology, hence frequently hard to comprehend, readers must rely on the examples to see what meaning was intended. However, the examples are most often presented as complex phrases, for which whole phrase English translations are provided, but not word-by-word translations. Thus, unless one already knows the meanings of each of the vocabulary items in the example, it is impossible to even identify where in the phrase the relevant grammatical construction appears, let alone understand how the construction works. Diligent work with an extensive dictionary will be needed to make any use of the examples.It's impossible to tell from the text alone whether the book might be relevant for study of modern Hawaiian. Certainly, students wishing to study the modern language might be advised to look elsewhere for a more readable grammar. But perhaps this volume may have value in its documentation of how the language was spoken one hundred and fifty years ago (that is, if the example sentences were spoken by fluent speakers, and are not simply missionary translations)."},{"Title":"A short synopsis of the most essential points in Hawaiian grammar","review":"...but, reproduction looks faded.

Chamoiseau manages to create both a rich alleghory on the death of oral tradition, and a keystone cops-style farce. The style and language that Chamoiseau plays with here is a delight to read, and takes on an added weight considering the setting. It's reminiscent of Rushdie's mishmash of Indian and English to make a point in Midnight's Children. Kudos to the translator for not attempting to translate everything in the text. There are footnotes to a glossary, which at first seems daunting, but is very rewarding - I never thought footnotes could lead to so much laughter (I take that back, D.F. Wallace). Ultimately, this book is a love affair of language. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Solibo Magnificent","review":"Patrick Chamoiseau's Solibo Magnificent is a powerful novel, both hilarious and tragic at once. In Fort-de-France, Martinique, Solibo (a Creole nickname meaning somersault or pirouette) has dropped dead in front of some of his followers after uttering a non-sequitor, \\"That potato!\\" His band of listeners, believing this to be a part of Solibo's act, wait patiently for the great man to rouse himself. When he doesn't, the police are brought in, and they at once suspect the witnesses , which include the character of the author, of having murdered Solibo. What follows is part slapstick, part theater of the absurb, part philosophy, part tragedy, part magic, all poetry. Somehow Chamoiseaux manages to meld these elements into a coherent whole that makes this novel an extraordinary experience.As other reviewers have noted, this story is not only about the death and murder investigation of a beloved storyteller, but about the death of the oral tradition in general. Chamoiseau leaves no doubt that he intends the reader to walk away with this notion. Written words are inadequate to describe the power of the spoken; one has only to read the reconstructed version of Solibo's last words at the end of the book to understand this. Despite the somewhat heavy-handed approach to his theme, Chamoiseau tells a riveting story with natural lyricism. (Kudos to the translators!)This author deserves a much wider readership (or is it audience?)"},{"Title":"Solibo Magnificent","review":"An incredibly readable story of an endangered species: the oral tradition. That the telling of this small epic is done with adding both French and Creole phrases (translated in a glossary) is *essential* to understanding the people living in Fort-de-France.

Chamoiseau beautifully portrays the conflict between the ancient oral tradition of story-telling and the modern scientific and linguistic reality.On one level, the book is a gruesome and bloody burlesque on police methods of investigating a murder. On another deeper level, it is a lament for a disappearing culture of stories, magic, demons and superstition in favour of logic and the written word. It is also a tale of colonial stupidity and inevitability.Chamoiseau's prose is lyrical and evocative. It is more of an oral history than a verbal study - an attempt to revive the oral history of his culture.He includes himself as one of the characters, contrasting his status as a mere story-teller with the central character, Solibo, the embodiment of a dying culture.Martina Nicolls, Author of \\"The Sudan Curse\\" and \\"Kashmir on a Knife-Edge\\""},{"Title":"Solibo Magnificent","review":"Solibo Magnificent can at times make you laugh and at times make you sad at the loss of tradition.

Solibo the story teller who dies while telling a story emerges as magnificent even after death. His audience, their innocent belief in him and his words makes a touching tale as they are pitted against the cold logic of police investigation to detect the murderer. Interestingly , it is cold logic of medical investigation which brings the suspected audience respite. The beauty of \\"belief\\" and the ability of cold logic to hound or bring justice are so well captured in this readable book.

Thanks to Amazon I could know about this book from so far away a land - India.Solibo Magnificent"},{"Title":"Solibo Magnificent","review":"Anyone who is at all sensitive to the gap that exists between the spoken word and the written word will immediately become thoroughly immersed in Chamoiseau's Solibo Magnificent. The narrator of this tale about the death of a storyteller and the events that follow his death struggles at times to capture on the page the vivacity of what only speakers can express. I've now read this novel three times and during each reading I stop and think about how differently I speak and write. Having derived such pleasure and intellectual challenge from Solibo Magnificent, I plan to read every other work of his that has been translated into English.The novel is both pathos and a comedy. It begins with a formal police report of a fatality and a listing of people who have been rounded up as suspects in the homicide. Solibo, we learn, died in a public park and is immediately surrounded by people who debate about the best way to revive him. Instead of preparing for a funeral, these same people tell stories about Solibo and his miraculous powers. For instance, once, a farmer tried unsuccessfully to kill one of his pigs. When Solibo came to visit him, the farmer told of his frustration; Solibo looked the pig in the eyes and told it to die. The pig died. The power of the word revealed!What is most revealing, however, is the gap that exists between the abstractions that are encased in language that can be written and the concrete nature of the language that is spoken. In one case, one suspect is taken to the police headquarters and questioned. The policeman, who speaks only French, asks, \\"What is your address?\\" and \\"When is your birthday?\\" The suspect doesn't understand either question. He is only able to answer when he is addressed by another police officer, one who speaks French and Creole. That policeman asks, \\"When do you go to eat dinner?\\" and then, \\"After which hurricane were you born?\\"In these examples, one discovers a fuller meaning of the idea of assimilation, in this case, one that failed to take root, even though the French had dominated the island of Martinique. In its own way, the novel is a story of resistance to assimilation and a testimony to the value of such resistance for everyone who has been raised in a culture that places such great value on writing alone.Chamoiseau began the novel with three epigraphs. One is a fragment from Italo Calvino. Anyone who has been enchanted by a work by Calvino will find Solibo Magnificent a joy to the eyes and to the inner voice that talks to us in silence."},{"Title":"Joseph Knight","review":"When a friend of mine pointed to several paintings of sailing ships on his dinning-room wall and asked what type of ships they were, I replied \\"Clippers.\\" He replied \\"Slavers\\". His family had made their fortune in the 18th century in the triangular trade from Scotland to Africa and then to the West Indies. I had not been aware of the involvement of Scots in the slave trade until then. Having just finished Robertson's book, I now feel I have a good grasp of not only the extent of the involvement of Scots with slavery, but also a feel for the nature of their involvement. As advertised, this book is everything historical fiction should be -- a great read and highly informative (obviously well-researched).I particularly enjoyed the use of dialect and the wit of 18th century Edinburgh at the height of the Scottish Enlightenment. That section felt so authentic that I imagined sitting at the table enjoyng a glass or two of Claret with Boswell and company. The only part of the book that did not work too well, I think, was the use of a long letter (from Paisely)that described a meeting with Joseph Knight.But the book is more than just an historical novel -- it explored the meaning of slavery and of freedom: not something I had ever pondered about before.A great and satisfying read."},{"Title":"Falling into Theory: Conflicting Views on Reading Literature, 2nd Edition","review":"This book examines, explores, and supplies representative samples of literary theory.

Instead, Richter explores literary theory as phenomena, its origins and its value. He does this through three essays he authors: 1) Why We Read, 2) What We Read, and 3) How We Read. Each section is not just Richter's thoughts, but also references to pertinent opinions of well know cultural critics and professors who have written on issue. He paraphrases their thoughts and opinions with each section, but also supplies the full (or a large portion) of the original essay that he references in an appendix to each section, providing the reader even further reading to explore if the reader finds a view interesting and worthy of exploration."},{"Title":"Falling into Theory: Conflicting Views on Reading Literature, 2nd Edition","review":"I used this in my English class last semester and I loved it.

The Return of She","review":"&quot;The Return of She,&quot; although not as exciting or groundbreaking as the classic &quot;She,&quot; is nevertheless a worthy sequel, and one that all admirers of Haggard's original story should enjoy reading. It is a direct continuation of the earlier book, and as such may be called required reading for all fans of Ayesha, Leo Vincey and Ludwig Holly. The novel contains many exciting scenes, including a great avalanche, the pursuit of the death hounds, Ayesha's reincarnation, and the climactic battle with Kalloon. The Dover edition comes with beautiful illustrations from the original 1905 edition that greatly enhance the text. In light of the fact that the overwhelming preponderance of Haggard's books are sadly out of print, this book becomes even more worthy an addition to any fan's library.

And yet again, the battle between the spirit and flesh, the mortality and divinity, of man. In this one, however, it began to slow about two-thirds of the way thru, as if Haggard were stretching at times. But then he roused himself magnificently to a thrilling finish! The scene of Ayesha and her army riding across the plain to save Leo is the stuff of movies. It is no less a book than the first, which is unusual for sequels. This one takes place in Tibet, rather than Libya, and Haggard foresees the importance of radium."},{"Title":"Ayesha.

The story is expanded and concluded satisfactorily in a new setting with the same blend of suspense, tenderness, and philosophy that characterizes She. One of the book's weaknesses is that the numerous references to characters' past lives and Ayesha's own origins make the back story even more opaque than it is in She. Hopefully Wisdom's Daughter will make things clearer. I very much look forward to reading this and other Haggard novels."},{"Title":"Ayesha. The Return of She","review":"The 1957 hardbound is a gem of a book without the marvelous illustrations one longs for inearlier incarnations, but easily found if you cruise ancient archives elsewhere on the internet. Yet, SHE is the most dynamic female character of that century and she reincarnates, like her literary self, beautifully.Ripped off by countless other authors and filmmakers from Harryhausen's animated skeleton battles (hope I didn;t spoil that) to Speilberg, SHE is untouchable as literature. Superbly written in a language of a century-past, Haggard's 2nd installment in the legend of a goddess waiting for her reincarnated love to come back is amazing stuff. Once the stuff of pulps, Ayesha is now an exercise in spectacular imagry and diety-worship. What, or who, would make two old men travel across mountain ranges, killer ravines and battle insane warlords? Do you have to ask? In this round, there is the 2nd woman, another queen, as a deja vu to what transpired before... and may be fated to be played all over again. And is this mysterious high priestess indeed SHE who must be obeyed? Only by reading this book, taken from the found and partially-burned writings of Holly himself, can you begin to understand the mythos of SHE. BTW, the \\"found manuscript\\" idea was recycled very well in the Harry Flashman books by George McDonald Fraiser, so a tip o' the Hatlo hat to him for such a well-done homage to Haggard.No illustration or film version thus far has really captured Ayesha's beauty, frailty, vanity or warrior rage. It's a tall, tall order to imagine anyone trying to film this follow-up to an epic as it is, truly, a bigger epic than SHE. Curl up with it; there are college courses devoted to SHE, Haggard and her mythology. Amazing that the best written tales of goddess worship were written by a man... over a century ago. They have yet to be equalled, and never, ever will be matched.My highest recommendation for a great adventurous read!

He now, of course, only wants Ayesha. Mortal types, in the end, can't handle the heat."},{"Title":"Ayesha. The Return of She","review":"One would suppose that Haggard felt confident with writing sequels considering the success he had with KING SOLOMON'S MINES and ALLAN QUATERMAIN. Unfortunately, the sequel to SHE is sub-par. Having read only 4 books by Haggard, I could hardly consider myself an expert on his writing, but the one aspect of his writing which I found so intriguing and entertaining was his descriptions of Africa and of the racist imperialist views of the Europeans in Africa. However, in AYESHA, the story takes place somewhere near China or Thibet or Russia (the exact location is never given, but only alluded to). Haggard has stepped out of an area in which he was comfortable, knowledgable, and successful. Unfortunately, by stepping out of the area in which he found the most success, he has fallen down and offered up only a meager tale which has to fight to hold the reader's interest."},{"Title":"Rurouni Kenshin, Vol. 5","review":"I give rurouni kenshin on the whole 5 stars. Given the nature of the beast (This is a series, and you are going to end up buying all the volumes, no matter how good each individual one is), it seems a little pointless to write an individual review for this one volume in the series.However, I feel the need to proffess that both vol's 5 and 6 have a nice bit of character development, but in terms of plot, it just doesnt FEEL like it goes anywhere. Watsuki himself states that this volume is slow and that the series will pick up(Boy, does it...).The volume takes us through a story involving Yahiko first. This is a nice story, as it really does show us how little yahiko is evolving as a swordsman (He just seems useless compared to the uberpowerful baddies sanosuke and kenshin are always schooling) through Kamiya Kasshin Ryu. Yahiko was in need of some panel time, as he always seemed from the beginning to be a gimmick character created by Watsuki. It also shows that Kaorou is not the wimp she's made out to be (Again, she suffers the same problem as Yahiko, she just doesnt seem strong compared to the Sano and Kenshin calibur).So a little over the first quarter of the book is devoted to some character development. After that, we have the entrance of the next arc, the Raijuta arc.The Raijuta arc is particularly interesting, simply because it causes a further linkage coming up. And it introduces Yutaro, who becomes Yahiko's rival. Their exchanges are particularly funny. Anyway, Raijuto is a high calibur swordsman who just seems to go around bullying dojo masters into accepting challenges from him, for no other reason than to be a jerk and get said masters to shut down their dojos. Yutaro seems to be his annoying twerp of an apprentice. Of course all of this makes an odd twist midway through, which I wont spoil for you. While not really left at a cliff hanger (Unlike volume 7, grr), you will still want more (and i mean more than usual) because this volume seems to not tell much in its 200 pages. The overall plot moves along maybe an inch as we see the little sub plots of yahiko's battle, yutaro v. yahiko, etc move. It's simply unfulfilling by the end. This is easily avoided though, by purchasing volume 6 with 5. Volume 6 \\"suffers\\" from the same problems (takes a while to get somewhere, but we do get a conclusion, a satisfying one at that), and it delves into a rather interesting side story involving sanosuke.In essence, volumes 1-6 are all just the calm before the storm. They compromise the first main arc (there are 3) of the RK series, the Tokyo Arc. The Tokyo Arc is personified by the little individual adventures that dont seem to have much relation to each other. Volume 7 is where the series really picks up, as it goes full blown into the Kyoto Arc, one full of awesome political intrigue, awesome sword fights, and more revalation into Kenshin's mysterious past. The Kyoto arc will connect all these little stories the Tokyo Arc told you, and it will get the MAIN plotline chugging along.But I really digress. 5 and 6 seem almost meant to be purchased in a pair, so i recomend you do as such. This one vol by itself isnt filling enough to satiate your RK needs, trust me."},{"Title":"Rurouni Kenshin, Vol. 5","review":"I love the Kenshin manga and the Kenshin anime. It's my favorite next to Yu Yu Hakusho. I seriously recommend for evryone to read this even if have seen the anime because it is different and certain characters look better in the manga."},{"Title":"Rurouni Kenshin, Vol. 5","review":"Seriously, how can anyone not like Rurouni Kenshin? I mean, it's got something for everyone-romance, comedy, action, history-what's not to like? The plot of these books is extremaly interesting, you never get bored and I am DYING to get the next one as soon as it comes out!This series is about the swordsman Himura Kenshin, formerly known as Hitokiri Battosai (Battosai the Manslayer) As a hired assasin, he helped bring about the Meiji age and end the Bakumastu. Now, however, he uses no sword but a sakabatou (reverse blade) that can't kill anyone. He took to living as a rurouni (wanderer) but all that changed as he was confronted one day by Kamiya Kaoru, female instructor of Kamiya Kashin-ryu. Want to know what happens? You'll need a lot of commitment and a lot of money to find out, because the only downside to this series is that the whole story totals into a whopping 28 books! But if you're going to get into manga at all, this is definately a series worth buying!"},{"Title":"Rurouni Kenshin, Vol. 5","review":"Rurouni Kenshin is one of the best mangas of all time. Its funny, romantic, and has some of the best action and characters of all time. The manga is much better than the anime since it moves along quickly to the Legend of Kyoto saga against, but it does have Volume 5. I love the whole series but this one part seems tedious. But despite that its still awesome. It revolves around the appearance of Raijuta, a swordsman who feels that the old ways of the samurai have died out, and its time for a new way of teaching sword. Kenshin, representing the old style needs to prove that there is still value in the old ways. Thats not the best plot synopsis, but its generally OK.The real reason to get excited about this volume is how close it is to Volume 7. In the sequence of the manga series, Vol. 7 is where Saito Hajime is introduced to the plot, and the Legend of Kyoto saga begins. I own that volume in Japanese and I will attest that it is the high point of the series. I also know that Volume 6 was recently released so that just means even less time before this masterpiece of Japanese manga comes out.The Romantic Meji Swordsman, Rurouni Kenshin is probably the very best you can do as far as mangas go. Volume 5 isn't that important to the over all plot but is still a five star read. Read it and marvel at Nobuhiro Watsuki's storytelling skills.Oro!"},{"Title":"Rurouni Kenshin, Vol. 5","review":"Yahiko has mostly been used for comic relief and background, since he's a tiny prepubescent kid who doesn't have any exceptional strength or sword skills (yet). But that changes dramatically in the fifth volume of Nobuhiro Watsuki's \\"Rurouni Kenshin,\\" where a subtle focus shift shows that Yahiko is growing up fast. The second half of the volume is a bit weak compared to the brilliant stories that came before it, but it's still worthwhile.Yahiko keeps mysteriously missing out on his training sessions, and his friends guess that it's because of a girl (Sano), food (Kaoru) or sword training (Kenshin). They end up following him the next day to a part-time job at a restaurant, where it turns out that he's defending a pretty young woman from some thieving thugs. And though he's no match for the thieves, Kenshin starts to teach him how to fight his own battles without help.Then a trip to another dojo goes horribly wrong when an old friend of Kaoru's is taken down by a vast savage-looking man, Isurugi Raijita -- he's incredibly powerful (able to split the floor with a practice sword), and insists that he wants to give kenjutsu back its \\"purity\\" and strength. And after a brief bout with Kenshin, Raijita is determined to have the powerful rurouni as part of his \\"revival\\" movement -- and apparently \\"no\\" is not an option.\\"Rurouni Kenshin Volume 5\\" is rather weaker storywise than the volumes that precede it, mainly because the second of these two stories centers on someone less imposing than the assassins and onmitsu of prior stories -- namely, Raijita himself. That said, the second half of this volume seems like a slow windup to the conclusion in the next one, so it's a good idea to have the sixth volume close by.But it also serves as a bit of a growth experience for Yahiko, who suddenly graduates from being the Comic Relief Squirt to a young man who's honorable, passionate, and becoming stronger by leaps and bounds. Additionally, the little guy also gets a love interest of sorts. He also gets a rival in swordsplay: a young apprentice of Raijita's, who comes across as an annoying little runt who squabbles a lot with Yahiko (but will presumably get fleshed out later on).As for Raijita, he seems like a megasized fanatic, who wants to kill or humiliate anyone who doesn't join his little self-glorifying crusade. And he doesn't care who -- or how many -- die to get his sword-revolution moving.And in the middle of these two stories, Watsuki weaves in his usual web of razor-edged action scenes filled with pale angry eyes and swinging swords, a hint of romance, and plenty of comic relief (including Kaoru strolling out of her room with a tied-up and knocked-out Yahiko hanging from a stick). And as always, there's the underlying message of Kenshin and his world: that glory, power and strength aren't worth killing for.\\"Rurouni Kenshin Volume 5\\" is a bit weaker than its predecessors, but it's still a solid story-and-a-half about swords, love, and more swords. And this one wonders where the story of Raijita and his apprentice will go next."},{"Title":"Rurouni Kenshin, Vol. 5","review":"Seriously, how can anyone not like Rurouni Kenshin?

But that didn't last long, because Larry did a fine job of bringing together some great Alaskan classics.I fell in love with Alaska ten years ago on my first visit and I have been reading everything I can get my hands on since. So, I had read several of the excerpts in books I have read, but for the most part, they were new to me. Thanks to Larry's introduction, I now have a dozen more books on my wish list from reading this book.If you are hoping for more Kaniut written stories, there are only four in the book and only one has not been published before. Two are from Cheating death and the previously unpublished story is from Larry's upcoming book Swallowed Alive.So, I recommend the book, but be sure you are expecting a great collection of Alaskan literary outtakes and not the typical Kaniut, white knuckled collection of survival stories."},{"Title":"Tales from the Edge: True Adventures in Alaska","review":"After reading dozens of other books about Alaska and it's peculiar and adventursome folks, I found this book very disappointing. Not because it is a bad book, but because it appears to be a book about exciting stories from Alaska. This book isn't about exciting adventures as much as it is about stories of people from Alaska. While I was looking for tales of adventure, I got to read about a Governor and his legislative stories, Wildlife managers and their public and political struggles, and occaisionally a story about something outside of a building. To be fair, there was a fishing story where a boat was stranded, and the story of a woman dogsledding across the country, and even some not so exciting stories about some bush pilots. To put this in perspective, I don't consider finding wolf tracks while dogledding across Alaska very riveting. The dogsledding part is fine, but the most exciting part of the story is that the woman saw some wolf tracks, (not actual wolves, just tracks)If you are looking for adventure stories, this isn't a very exciting book. On the other hand, if you are interested in some historical information and stories about Alaska and some of the people you would probably find this book interesting."},{"Title":"Tales from the Edge: True Adventures in Alaska","review":"stories seem to last forever and take way to long to go like it seems nowhere good book to get lost with because you will probably get rescued before you get anywhere with the stories."},{"Title":"Tales from the Edge: True Adventures in Alaska","review":"Author Larry Kaniut, puts his experience as writer and editor together and complies a good selection from Alaska adventures from some of the best adventure writers on the alaskan scene, including some who have left us.

Broad parody ('Neato Keeno Time', 'Hamburger Hi-jinx') rubs shoulders with barbed social commentary ('MOTORCITY Comics' #1, the Fritz the Cat epic, 'Fritz The No-Good') and lighthearted sexual fantasies ('SNATCH Comics' #1 &amp; 2, 'Dirty Dog'). There's also lots of rarities in this volume (ie: the original front cover for Janis Joplin's 'Cheap Thrills' LP, a previously unpublished alternate cover for 'ZAP' #3, a poster for 'The Zap Show' from 1968, comix from 'The East Village Other' and 'Chicago Seed', etc...). For those unfamiliar with Crumb's work, volume five presents a respectable cross section of the oeuvre of the grand old man of Underground Comix."},{"Title":"The Complete Crumb Comics Vol. 5: Happy Hippy Comix","review":"Perhaps best-known for his Janis Joplin Cheap Thrills album cover and the X-rated film adaptation of Fritz the Cat, R. Crumb is the man who in the sixties brought the comics underground to light--a fact which made many with weak stomachs and bad consciences want to close their eyes. But the sublime and grotesque black-and-white drawings insist that you look as Crumb gives play to his sexual fantasies and keen social observations. Crumb draws it as he sees it, lampooning hypocrites of every ilk, from university thinktank eggheads to brutalizing cops to wigged-out counter-culture types with their hippier-than-thou halos and hangups."},{"Title":"The Complete Crumb Comics Vol. 5: Happy Hippy Comix","review":"If you like R. Crumb you will enjoy this. If you own lots of his stuff already you probably have most if not all of the work in this volume. However most people do not have the early Zap comics Yarrowstalks and other early examples of his work and so this is a good way to see some of his early stuff. I was born and grew up in San Francisco and was a teenager during the late 60s early 70s and find his views of the whole hippy, love movement perfect caricatures of the era."},{"Title":"The Complete Crumb Comics Vol. 5: Happy Hippy Comix","review":"Like all (or most, the ones that I have seen) of 19 Volumes of R.

Pay close attention to the civilian medical research. Imagine a family member affected by the anthrax vaccine. One should reach an identical conclusion to mine. The AVIP is BAD medicine.

Kate has a somewhat dysfunctional relationship with Jake who seemed to take advantage of her and who does not treat her well. For some reason, Kate was unable to break it off with Jake, partly because she loved him and partly because she wanted to build a family with him. Kate's life was turned upside down when Mirri, a old actress as well as a sex symbol showed up at Leonard's door step to stay for the summer. Mirri was the exact opposite of Kate and was on Kate's nerve constantly as she was always giving her advice which Kate felt she didn't need. However, Kate realized rather unwillingly that Mirri, in fact, had a thing or two to teach about men.It was quite a predictable read as there aren't many surprises along the way. The strength of this book comes from the development of the characters. The characters had their faults and weaknesses but by the end of the book, they have come to a realization of what's important and became more mature. It was also interesting to read about the relationship between Kate and Mirri and how they have grown to rely on each other for help. Their friendship, I think, was the highlight of this book. This wasn't the best chick-lit I have ever read but it's still better than average."},{"Title":"The Goddess Rules","review":"I give it three and a half stars. It was so slow to start that I almost gave up, but a few chapters in, the pace picked up. Still not a suspenseful pageturner, but it is a really cute story of \\"Lessons Learned,\\" in Life and in Love.At the beginning, twenty-eight year old Kate Disney has very little self confidence. She doesn't really believe in her talent as an artist and a painter, or in herself as a beautiful and desirable woman. And Kate's life is in a bit of a rut -- living in a shed, not making a lot of money, dealing with an absolute PRICK of a boyfriend. She's dated Jake for three years, and he's still taking her for granted. He doesn't call for weeks, then he shows sporadically and makes love to her, but otherwise unwilling to be committed. She can't even say to him that he is her boyfriend without him freaking out and running off into the night.And then an amazing and famous former screen siren, Mirabelle Moncour, comes into Kate's life. I am not sure what Goddesses had to do with anything. Gratefully, there is no list of Goddess Rules that Kate Disney is asked to follow. Kate just learns a lot from the beautiful and eccentric Mirri Moncour. She doesn't seek to be a duplicate of Mirri, and the two are so different that Kate hates Mirri at first. But Mirri does know some things about life and love, and gives Kate some good advice: be confident in yourself. With Mirri pushing her, Kate learns to believe in her inner \\"Goddess\\" -- the beautiful woman within her -- and that she deserves to be treated like a special and beautiful woman, because every woman is special and beautiful in her own way. The more Kate believes in herself, the better things turn out for her. Kate finally gets the kind of love that she deserves.Of, course, Kate doesn't have perfect judgment, so she still stumbles along the way. And so does Mirri. There are chapters where they both did things that made me cringe. But, overall, their mistakes make them seem more real and human."},{"Title":"The Goddess Rules","review":"Good girl Kate Disney is doing just fine in her life before Mirabelle Concur walks into it.

She was once a very famous actress, who discarded men like tissue. Presently, she still does this, and she is back in civilization to get Kate to paint a picture of her lion cub.Kate is both irritated and intriqued by Mirri, for this is a 50 something year old woman who has relations with a very famous married actor in the hammock outside of her room. Can Mirri teach Kate how to leave men panting instead of letting them walk all over you? Can Kate teach Mirri that love is not as horrible as she makes it out to be?Kate will also get to choose between sexy/unpredictable Jake and her sweet artist friend Louis who has recently come back into the picture and needs Kate's help with his project. Kate may never grow up when it comes to relationships, but she will learn a lot about herself.The ending won't surprise you, but the journey keeps you going."},{"Title":"The Goddess Rules","review":"I have loved reading Clare Naylor's witty novels since Love: A User's Guide. She has a way to write that draws me in and does not let go until its final pages. Yes, her novels are often predictable, but the manner in which her stories are written more than makes up for their banality. The Goddess Rules is about Kate Disney -- a struggling artist who does not know her place in the world. She lives in a shed in a chic house owned by an eccentric gay friend, is in a revolving door relationship with an unreliable man, and makes a pittance painting portraits of rich people's pets. But when legendary Parisian actress Mirabella Moncur moves into the house, her life isn't the same. While Kate paints a portrait of Mirri's lion cub, she reluctantly listens to the sixty-year-old sex kitten's advice on life and love. Kate does not like Mirri's uninhibited and transparent nature at first, but as her life begins to make sense and she encounters several romantic prospects, she realizes that Mirri is not the arrogant, self-absorbed woman she once thought she was, especially when she discovers something that has haunted Mirri for years.The Goddess Rules was a pleasure to read. I have not read chick-lit this good in a while. Clare Naylor is the only Brit-chick author out of the famous lot of them (Jane Green, Marian Keyes, Helen Fielding) whose work has remained consistent over the years. Her crisp wit and sharp dialogue are terrific. She mixes the usual single-girl-in-London foibles with sweet, heady romance. Naylor's work is not particularly unique per se, but it is nevertheless wonderful. The characters are great. Mirabella is quite a colorful character. The fact that this novel features a beautiful, sexually confident sixty-year-old woman who can make younger men fall madly in love with her makes the book all the more special. The way the character was written makes the aforementioned descriptions quite believable. Kate is the usual dazed and confused twenty-something-going-on-thirty woman going through relationship dilemmas and career woes. However, that is not to say that she is not a terrific character, because she is. I also liked Louis and Jake -- they were very well developed, especially Jake. The one thing I do not like is how the Jake situation was resolved. The aforementioned issue is a loose end that I did not like, especially since the story centered on Kate and Jake for a vast part of the novel. And, like others here have said, the ending is a little too predictable. Then again, I had expected it to be. All in all, The Goddess Rules was a great read and another terrific offering by Ms. Naylor. And I love the book cover. The outside package gives the story justice."},{"Title":"The Goddess Rules","review":"I avoided this book during dozens of trips to the bookstore. The title and the cover seemed too cheesy. However, I finally saw it at Target one day and gave it a chance. I'm glad I did.The Goddess Rules is a nice beach read.

If you are looking for a fun distraction, this is it."},{"Title":"The Goddess Rules","review":"Kate Disney has her life all figured out--a job that she loves (well, painting pet portraits isn't exactly her passion); a loving boyfriend (well, Jake's unfaithful ways leave a bit to be desired); and a fabulous home (well, technically she lives in the shed behind her friend's lavish home).Kate is content to move blindly through life, that is, until Mirabelle Moncur, a larger-than-life cinema diva, breezes into her life and opens her eyes to a whole new world. Mirri is elegant and brash and says exactly what is on her mind. She introduces Kate to the goddess lifestyle. Everyone has a lot of growing pains in store when Kate walks the line between goddess and plebeian.The Goddess Rules is a fun romp with some truly hilarious scenes. Mirri's fabulous over-the-top life provides most of the humor in the book. The most engrossing part of the book, though, is seeing the surprising relationship develop between two very unlikely friends.Though Kate and Mirri couldn't be more different, they have much to teach each other and much to discover is truly the same between them.Armchair Interviews says: As is typical for chick lit, The Goddess Rules provides a lighthearted look at finding love and discovering yourself.

Mirabelle, who always has men falling at her feet, begins to teach Kate the rules of love and sex and most importantly makes Kate believe in herself and that she is worthy of true love.Since this is chick lit, the ending will be no surprise for you but it was fun getting there.

Mirri, who has a penchant for rescuing big game animals, is still able to entice men half her age into her bed. Under Mirri's tutelage, Kate makes some dramatic changes in her appearance, tries not to let Jake take advantage of her, and works on finding her inner-goddess. She even starts a new romance with her college pal, Louis. It turns out that Louis has had the hots for Kate for sometime. Just as she is willing to take a chance on love, Jake comes back into the picture, and proposes. Figuring Jake is a sure thing, and Louis is not, she chooses Jake, much to Louis' heartbreak.What follows is the aftermath and consequences of her decision. The relationship between Mirri and Kate is engaging - the two are separated by several decades but manage to forge a loving mentor/mentee relationship.

Then there's Louis, the unkempt, adorably rugged, introvert and Leonard, Kate's gay friend and neighbor who's known Mirri since his wilder younger days.

She lives in a shed, she paints animals for a living, and is unhappy with her life. Yes, the requisite gay best friend is around. But this time there is another character, the fascinating Mirri. Mirri is an old-time movie star who drinks, smokes, has sex with men any old time she pleases, and knows the ins and outs of love, men, and how to make a man fall in love with you. After a somewhat rough introduction to her (walking in on Kate and her jerk boyfriend in the middle of them... getting busy), Kate decides she doesn't much like Mirri. Mirri seems to think Kate is dowdy, lets men run all over her, and doesn't know anything about keeping a man interested.But when Kate's jerk boyfriend Jake doesn't show up for her birthday party, she begins to realize that maybe Mirri might be on to something. And thus begins an unlikely friendship... and Kate begins to learn about life, love and happiness. And perhaps find a true love that has been there all along.I enjoyed The Goddess Rules. It was a nice blend of romance, comedy, and fascinating characters. Despite the much-recycled plot, it managed to throw in some surprising plot twists and turns. The writing style was addictive and the story flowed well.The downfall to this book was just the predictability of the overall story. Also, Kate let herself be treated so badly by her boyfriend that it got pretty annoying. She needed a good slap in the face (not literally of course) to wake her up. Thankfully the brash and enigmatic Mirri was around to do it.Overall, this was another great read from Clare Naylor. I definitely recommend it to all chick lit fans, and anyone who enjoys a great book!"},{"Title":"The Goddess Rules","review":"Mirabelle Moncur is clearly a goddess. From her enchanting looks that haven't faded at age 60, to her commanding and domineering presence in any situation, and the way she flawlessly goes through men like sex is nothing, the women screams confident, secure, and goddess-like. Kate Disney is the opposite. Unlike Mirri, Kate will never be a film star, never be sultry, and can't seem to get past the \`slug' of a boyfriend, Jake, who treats Kate like she is indispensable.When Mirri, animal activist living in Africa, moves to London, she and Kate quickly become friends, and Kate tries to be more like Mirri. She breaks it off with Jake, heads to Capri for a short fling, and begins to live her life more freely and passionately, finally beginning to take a real interest in her career as a painter. But when an old friend reveals himself as a love interest and Jake suddenly is the pining boyfriend she has always wanted, Kate is unsure what her next move will be. In the end, Mirri shows her the true meaning of love, in a very Mirri-like fashion.The Goddess Rules by Clare Naylor is not only a humorous book with engaging plot twists, but also shows the struggles of someone trying to figure out what love is. Is it right to be with someone that loves you simply because you love them? That and other puzzles fill the plot and will keep readers interest hooked, especially with the supporting cast filling in any holes. I will say that I thought at times the book seemed to go on a little too long, but it only took a few more pages to get me interested in a new situation that started. The ending was particularly a jaw-dropper, and kept me thinking about the characters even after I was finished reading about them."},{"Title":"The Goddess Rules","review":"Kate Disney is living in her godfather's garden shed since she sunk all her money into her worthless boyfriend Jake. She does not have much self-esteem even though she is a well-known animal portrait painter and is a well regarded artist of the genre.Jake stands her up, brings her down and runs around on her but Kate always takes him back because she really loves Jake or anyway she has convinced herself that she loves him. I can relate to Kate's predicament of taking back a man that does not respect her since I have been there in the past as well.The story takes a turn when Kate's godfather welcomes a vistor to his estate, Mirabelle Moncur, a former famous actress who counsels Kate on her love life. This gist of the story is that Mirabelle teaches Kate about how to live by your own rules and to respect yourself. That was the only part of the story that I found somewhat unrealistic. I found Mirabelle to be rather coarse. She is a free-spirit, to say the least, and there are numerous scenes where Kate watches Mirabelle have sex with a much younger man and then directs Kate in how to pleasure a man while having sex. I could really have done without those parts of the story. I thought they were gratuitous. The language was raw and coarse as well.However, I enjoyed the conclusion of the story when Kate finally realizes that sometimes somebody we love is right before our eyes. The coarse language and sex may turn some readers off but if you get past those parts, there is a decent story here."},{"Title":"The Goddess Rules","review":"I was a little disappointed in this book. My favorite book of Clare Naylor is Dog Handling. It has a great plot until chapter 20, I don't want to ruin it for anyone. Of course the ending was great, but I did not know if I could finish it after chapter 20."},{"Title":"The Goddess Rules","review":"I don't read a lot of novels and when I do I like an escape, yes, but also intelligent reading and a variety of interesting characters - some whom I may relate to and some that are like north and south poles. This book has a couple of characters that are in the latter category, but none in the former. The main plot is nothing new, but it still made a nice escape. There were a few English cultural references that I did not fully understand...but I expected it as the author is from England and the story takes place there. One thing I do not appreciate is having to put up with frequent usage of the \\"f\\" word, and thankfully the author keeps it to a fair minimum in this story. Overall an ejoyable book."},{"Title":"The Goddess Rules","review":"I'm working my way through Naylor's titles and I like the fact that they aren't just carbon copies of the one before. This one starts out with insecure Kate lavishing devotion on a boyfriend who treats her badly. She takes a dislike to the aging French film star, Mirri Moncure, who gives her unwanted advice on her dubious romance. I didn't like the film star or Kate either, at first. Gradually Kate and I were won over by Mirri's joie de vivre and outrageous behavior.There are funny moments (think Bridget Jones), touching scenes, and growth in all the characters. I enjoy the British descriptions and way of thinking which butts heads with the French approach to life and love in this book. Hang in past the initial resistance to the characters and you will be rewarded with a good story."},{"Title":"The Goddess Rules","review":"Kate, ironically enough the daughter of a taxidermist, is a burgeoning painter of animals, making a name for herself in London. She lives in Primrose Hill in the garden shed of a wealthy, eccentric gay man named Leonard. Recently broken up with a cad named Jake, Kate is in the middle of putting the pieces of her life back together, with the assistance of friends and family members. She's really quite an ordinary 28-year-old woman- until she meets screen legend Mirri Moncur.Mirabelle \\"Mirri\\" Moncur is a French actress world-famous for her conquests. Now over the age of 60, Mirri has returned to London from hiding in Africa for over twenty years. The actress absolutely adores wild animals, even keeping them as house pets. That's how Kate Disney meets Mirri- one of Mirri's lovers was Kate's present landlord. But that is the kind of influence Mirri has upon men- she can even charm the homosexuals. Mirri swoops into Kate's life by walking in on Kate and her ex boyfriend having sex, announcing that Kate will paint the portrait of her favorite lion cub. Mirri doesn't bother asking for things, because she already knows that she will get them.Kate finds the 1960s sex icon and her eclectic taste in pets a trifle off-putting at first; Mirri having sex in Leonard's back yard with a famous, married A-list celebrity in his thirties doesn't help, either. It eventually proves to be one of the most exciting and interesting commissions Kate has ever done.Then there's the case of Jake, Kate's ex-boyfriend. He's making her life miserable, though she keeps going back to him time and time again for the sex. Within five seconds of meeting him, Mirri has fashioned him a \\"slug,\\" and turns out to be absolutely right. It proves that, although Mirri seems like a complete flake, she is in reality quite perceptive about the characters of others. The heart of this book lies around the relationship Kate and Mirri have with each other, despite differences in age and life perspective. This compelling tale about being single in the big city is both inspiring and heartwarming. Its too bad this isn't selling that well- The Goddess Rules is a rare and unknown gem that ought to be more widely read."},{"Title":"The Goddess Rules","review":"i loved the story. though it was predictable, it did manage to keep me glued till the end! loves it!"},{"Title":"The Goddess Rules","review":"Well-written chick-lit that entertains and brightens a long drive (I have the unabridged audio version read by the fantastic Rosalyn Landor). Thoroughly enjoyable story."},{"Title":"The Goddess Rules","review":"Kate and Mirri Moncur's first meeting was less than auspicious; the diva/screen goddess burst in on Kate and her slug-like boyfriend in an intimate moment. Nonetheless, she hires Kate to do a portrait of her pet lion cub, thus beginning a strange friendship. Rightly pegging that Kate's current off and on lover is a rat, Mirri begins teaching Kate how to enjoy real men. Under her tutelage, Kate blossoms, but then, the rug is pulled out from under Kate, and she may lose the one person she can truly love.* If you like Bridget Jones, then perhaps you will enjoy this book as well. However, for the most part it is populated with shallow characters who care mostly about pleasure. *Amanda Killgore"},{"Title":"Lifespan Human Development","review":"I have used Dr. Gormly's book for several years as the required reading in my Development courses...her book is unique in that it is not patronizing of the reader (as are several other Development texts), is clearly written, and does not contain &quot;padding&quot; as is found in too many other texts.

What is surprising is that Kress had its own architectural division--and a spirit of community involvement. This is what &quot;Main Street&quot; once meant. Wonderful pictures--highly recommended, and Thomas is to be commended for her research and her excellent book."},{"Title":"Philosophical Foundations of Tort Law","review":"I bought a whole stack of books on law and philosophy during the several months before I actually started law school (in fall 2000, at the age of 37). Most of them were just for &quot;personal use&quot;; as you can tell from my other reviews, I have a longstanding interest in philosophy anyway. But I waited until I completed a semester before reviewing them, so that I could plug the ones I found most useful.This is one of them. There are nineteen essays in this volume, all by heavy hitters among today's legal theorists. Almost every single essay is about the philosophical foundations -- or lack thereof -- of the concepts of tort law. And almost every one of them is extremely helpful in understanding the rationale(s), if any, behind these concepts. (Wanna know what a &quot;necessary element of a sufficient set&quot; is, and what it has to do with the legal concept of causation? See Tony Honore's essay. Wanna know what intent has to do with torts? Check out John Finnis's piece.)Now, I'm not saying you _need_ this book as a first-year law student. You don't. But if you have a background or an interest in philosophy, it will be of tremendous help to you -- both as a series of discourses that elaborate critically on the fundamentals you'll be studying in class, and as an introduction to the current crop of legal scholars. If you like this stuff, you'll want to go on to, e.g., John Finnis's _Natural Law and Natural Rights_, or Jules Coleman's _Markets, Morals and the Law_ and _Risks and Wrongs_, or . . .And quite apart from the intrinsic interest of the material itself, if your torts professor, like mine, is interested in public-policy issues, you'll find this collection extremely handy. It _may_ even help you eke out a few extra exam points (though I don't know yet whether it did so for me).(A valuable bonus for all you law-and-economics watchers: Richard Posner has an essay in here in which he admits the justice of most major criticisms of his outlook -- but says he doesn't care because he no longer has any confidence in systematic moral theories anyway. His retreat to pragmatism is unsurprising; Richard Wright has two brilliant pieces in here that, among other things, pretty much demolish the foundations of L&amp;E. Wright's critique of the much-abused &quot;Hand formula&quot; alone is priceless.)By the way, the _other_ book I found very useful (though expensive) was _Liability and Responsibility_, edited by Frey and Morris. That volume complements this one pretty well."},{"Title":"Philosophical Foundations of Tort Law","review":"In my view, it's the best compilation about philosophy matters about tort law. It seems to me that this book includes interesting works such as : &quot;The Practice of Corrective Justice&quot; by Coleman; Wealth Maximization and Tort Law..&quot; by Posner; Right, justice and tort law by Wright; Intention in tort law by Finnis, The basis for excluding liability for economic loss in tort law, by Benson; Necessary and sufficient conditions in tort law by Honor&eacute;; Contributory negligence.. by Simons; Risk, harm and responsibility by Perry, and so on. Without the slightest doubt if you like the tort law, you should have it."},{"Title":"Philosophical Foundations of Tort Law","review":"Very good. The numerous essays included provide torts attorney (as well as the otherwise interested) a good opportunity to sit back, relax, and rediscover the many and fascinating issues which underlie his industry. As much as in any other field of law, plaintiffs' attorneys (and also the defense bar) focus their attentions to what the law is, to the neglect of why it came to be that way and how it ought to be. Read this to return to your philosphically concerned earlier days. Leave your procedure-dominated worklife behind for a moment and examine again the central questions, more deeply than when studying the casebook: what is agency? responsibility? what role punishment in tort law? to focus on rights or strictly economic considerations? is there room for principle in tort law? A convenient opportunity also to visit or revisit the legal theories, as focussed upon tort, of such important legal theorists as Richard Posner and Jules Coleman, among others. In the end, in your daily life you'll revert to the the law as it is-but once again you'll possess the intellectual grist to ask, Is there or might there be a coherent theory behind this important field of law, or is the practice of tort litigation merely a compromise, worked out over the years, patched together out of the various initially principled approaches?"},{"Title":"Warriors of Fire","review":"All I can say is Wow! I love reading and I usually go in for the lighter reads, but a friend recommended this book. It held my attention from beginning to end. I will not spoil it for others, you have to read this.

The author of this book obviously loved his job as a firefighter, and his writing seems to come right from his heart. Thank God for all you firefighters out there."},{"Title":"Warriors of Fire","review":"Fine book, sad but always optimistic and often funny, very pleasant to read.Written by an experienced fireman, with a very big heart and a great humility. In a sequence of many short episodes he tells the history of a part of FDNY from the 60' to 80'.He doesn't keep your attention with tough exhibitions or spectacular performances, but with the passion and love he put in his work, also in little facts.I like the great ability to depict complex facts and situations in a very few words. His purpose was to share his experiences and wishes to everybody: he make it.I am sad to learn that he died in 1998.

This book is a great addition to any library. There were many new facts and annecdotes about the Olympic, Britannic, and Titanic that I did not know. Perhaps the only quibble is that as solid as the text is regarding the Titanic sinking- the same old accounts were used. Necessary in some instances, but some other accounts that are used far less could have enhanced the chapter. The other thing is that the book deserves a better format. I would think that such a book deserves a larger format, giving the reader an easier time to examine the pictures and reading the text. Overall- the book succeeds in making the reader learn more about these ships."},{"Title":"The Olympic-Class Ships: Olympic, Titanic, Britannic (Revealing History (Paperback))","review":"This book is my favorite of all time. I thought I knew everything there was to know about the Titanic and her sisters, but I was wrong. This book is amazingly plentiful with information. Makes for a great read.Hope this helps!"},{"Title":"The Olympic-Class Ships: Olympic, Titanic, Britannic (Revealing History (Paperback))","review":"I've read a number of books about the Titanic and Britanic. This book places these two ships and the Olympic in their historical perspective. The Olympic served in WWI and even ended her career with grace. She was scrapped to provide jobs for an economically depressed region. I learned a lot about social norms for the period and about competion on the Atlantic runs. It was fact filled, but not boring. I would recommend it."},{"Title":"The Olympic-Class Ships: Olympic, Titanic, Britannic (Revealing History (Paperback))","review":"Very detailed with wonderful pictures.

Little did I know then that it was as criminal as anything found on the front page of a major daily.Ann Hagedorn Auerbach does an outstanding job of piecing together the jagged financial picture of the crumbled puzzle pieces left by J.T. Lundy. The book also poses poignant questions - many remaining unanswered today - concerning the death of a great champion who seemingly was worth more in death because of the huge insurance windfall gained by Lundy.And please don't be fooled by the pomp on major race days covered on national TV/cable; the Thoroughbred industry is driven by racers graduating to the stud farm and commanding oftentimes six figures per mating.Though the book is about 10 years old, you will wonder if there are more Lundy's cooking up schemes to defraud others while striding nonchalantly under the backdrop of beautiful turf, colorful silks and million-dollar runners."},{"Title":"Wild ride: The rise and tragic fall of Calumet Farm, Inc., America's premier racing dynasty","review":"The climax of this powerful narrative is the mysterious death of Alydar, Calumet Farm's famous racing stallion, insured for $36.5 million. The book is a thoughtful, probing account of mushrooming greed and moral confusion. Auerbach shows how speculative financing created a situation in which Alydar was worth more dead than alive. Reading this carefully documented story, one wonders why the it never got fully told on the evening news. It is a sad, shocking story, partly because it seems to foreshadow the larger consequences of speculative fever, of an economy in which greed is the ultimate value and the chasm between poor and wealthy grows wider every day. But the fact that Auerbach's book has led to two governmental investigations and subsequent indictments suggests that she has tapped into a kind of moral sense in our society that bodes well for the future. Powerful writing."},{"Title":"Wild ride: The rise and tragic fall of Calumet Farm, Inc., America's premier racing dynasty","review":"At last a detailed explanation as to what caused the implosion of the seemingly solid Calumet Farms throughbred racing dynasty. How could things go so wrong, so fast? An interesting mix of human pettiness, ignorance and weakness, greed, and then the Farm was lost to greater and greater accelerating debt. Detailed portraits of many of the Calumet favorites, especially Alydar, who's accidental death stopped the cash machine that was keeping the farm afloat in a sea of debt. Interesting crosscurrents of bad feduciary management by the trust's bank managers, criminal activity, gangland ties, possible drug peddling for cash, contracts that were fast and loose and pledged the same assets over and over again. If you like racing and remember the Calumet lock on winning and its great horses, this is a fascinating book. If you are looking for just a \\"horse\\" book you should look elsewhere, but this is a great story from the get-go."},{"Title":"Wild ride: The rise and tragic fall of Calumet Farm, Inc., America's premier racing dynasty","review":"You couldn't make this stuff up.

Rest in peace Alydar.The author follows the money trail expertly, & as a horse person, I have seen this scenario in a smaller scale before (downfall of a stable etc) due to greed.It is a shame that real horsepeople do not own these farms/stables. Money is still directing what is happening to all horse breeds to this day. Witness the \\"Dubai\\" (Doobie) Brothers are still buying up the best bloodstock of the USA, & they are not just limiting themselves to Thoroughbreds (also Arabians, Saddlebreds).I gave the book only 4 stars as it is depressing. However, it is very well written."},{"Title":"Wild ride: The rise and tragic fall of Calumet Farm, Inc., America's premier racing dynasty","review":"The author did an excellent job of researching the topic while presenting the information in a format that was easy to read.

The author's biography states that she has worked at several large well known newspapers, so you'd assume that the book would read like it was written by a professional journalist. Instead every page seems to be full of painfully flowery prose and run on sentences full of gossip, inuendo and anecdotes often from unnamed sources about the main characters. Her characterization of these people is really two dimensional and often contradictory; an unsuccessful attempt at objectivity?After trying to read this book as it was published it's hard to believe that the author reread her first draft much less submitted it to someone to edit.Very interesting subject, it just seems like the author didn't have the time or the ability to do it justice."},{"Title":"Wild ride: The rise and tragic fall of Calumet Farm, Inc., America's premier racing dynasty","review":"Author did a great job with what was given her. Some parts of the book can be boring with legal and financial stuff; but on the other hand, you're left in suspense throughout the book as well. The cast of character's would have done well to read this or read anything for that matter! My hero in this saga is Courtenay Wright Lancaster, who finally said \\"something's wrong\\". Alas, it was too late. This book and Secretariat by William Nack are the best books I've read on horse racing."},{"Title":"Wild ride: The rise and tragic fall of Calumet Farm, Inc., America's premier racing dynasty","review":"The industry was crippled by the kinds of actions described in this book.

From the moment you open the book and begin reading about the night Alydar died, you can't stop. A more interesting story could not have been written. I still can't believe it's all true. I read this about 8 yrs. ago. And, recently I picked it up again. I couldn't put it down. If you're a horse or racing lover, you really will get into it and I think you will anyway, even if you aren't a horse racing fan. It's a great story of the rise and fall of an empire. How a man went from having nothing to building this empire, taken over by his son and rising to greatness and then tragically falling into the hands of an unbelievable crook. If you've never been to Lexington, Kentucky and seen this great farm, you're missing something. It's the most beautiful site you could see. Just like in a picture. Miles and miles of white pristeen fencing, red and white barns, rolling pastures that go on and on, mares and foals at their sides. It's truly a piece of yesteryear that must always be preserved. I am so glad it has been preserved so far by it's current owners and I hope that that never changes. When I ride by it and think of the great horses that stood in that stallion barn and all of the history, it's just mind boggling. This story is a tragic story, too, in many ways. I cried when I read the part about the death of Alydar. You must read it."},{"Title":"Wild ride: The rise and tragic fall of Calumet Farm, Inc., America's premier racing dynasty","review":"Had no idea what happened to one of the greatest race farms in America. This told it all. Quite a shock, very devestating."},{"Title":"Wild ride: The rise and tragic fall of Calumet Farm, Inc., America's premier racing dynasty","review":"Actually, I am still in the process of reading the book, but nearing the end. It is really sad. I read it with tears because back in 1969, my parents took my sister and I to visit Calumet, and I was extremely impressed as a horse-loving (and owning)teenager.One of the highlights of the trip was seeing 29 year old Citation. We also saw Needles, another Kentucky Derby winner who was standing at Calumet at the time, and I'm surprised no mention was made of him.The same day, we visited Leslie Comb ll's Spendthrift Farm that actually went belly up before Calumet, but not that long before.There, we saw Nashua, Swaps, Creme dela Creme, Sword Dancer, and Gallant Man. The lesson is that these are living, breathing creatures, not meant to be portfolios or their welfare put at the whim of human greed and avarice.I read the book wishing I could slap Lundy full in the face, and to this day, I fully believe he had a hand in Alydar's death because it would be to Lundy's advantage at the time to collect on the insurance. I am surprised that the Lloyd's of London didn't require a more extensive investigation before the payout was made, but they probably still believed in Calumet's peerless reputation, and a part of them didn't want to imagine anyone at Calumet would do anything like this. They just didn't know Lundy. That's too bad. I hope Lundy lives the rest of his life in regret, poverty, and pariahhood."},{"Title":"Wild ride: The rise and tragic fall of Calumet Farm, Inc., America's premier racing dynasty","review":"This is an awesome piece of reporting on a complex subject.

In fact, after I finished it in two days, I read parts of it again!! The author gives factual details about a terrible tragedy, and the loss of a wonderful horse. With the recent interest in horseracing, after the tragic loss of Eight Belles, people should be aware that horseracing is not all mint juleps and fancy hats.Wild Ride is a gripping tale of what happened to Alydar, the horse that propelled the last Triple Crown Winner, Affirmed, to his status in history.Even if you are not a horseracing fan (which I was not, until I read this book!), you will learn so much about the behind-the-scenes events of an American tragedy. Somewhere else I read these quotes: \\"Dogs and cats have become our pets, but horses, we have deemed, should be our slaves\\"...........and \\"Every person who has ever owned a pet will stand before God to testify as to his master's stewardship\\".

Sure it's a fun tale, brilliantly told, of one of the most famous horse farms in history. But it's so much more. It's also a fantastic insight into excess and fraud and how businessmen commit it. Read it for the blood and guts and glory of horse racing. The story of Calumet is wonderful. But hang onto your hats. Auerbach's indepth investigative journalism shows the anatomy of a swindle. How J.T. Lundy, owner of Calumet, and his cohorts turned the most beautiful animals in the world into cash machines. How they debased the tradition of one of the noblest sports. Auerbach is undaunted by the complicated financial shinnegans that these people concocted to billk banks out of millions. In fact, I believe that her reporting is the reason that Lundy wound up getting indicted and convicted. And she tells it in such a compelling way that even someone who can't add 2 plus 2 can see how the rich sometimes get richer at our expense. Read it and weep. But know that in the end, justice was done."},{"Title":"Wild ride: The rise and tragic fall of Calumet Farm, Inc., America's premier racing dynasty","review":"Ann Auerback's investigational story is a compelling journey into a rarely discussed aspect of horse racing.Auerbach details the history of Calumet Farm, once America's most famous Kentucky horsefarm. The author's love of horses is evident in her detailed account of events. It took much courage for Ann Auerbach to uncover and discover the truth about Calumet's fall. It will also take some backbone for Alydar fans and horselovers to read the facts presented.I read this book for two reasons. I wanted to understand how a farm like Calumet could go from the best to the worst.I also needed to know what happened to Alydar after his racing fans were no longer watching him. Wild Ride answered both of my questions in a methodical and journalistic style."},{"Title":"Wild ride: The rise and tragic fall of Calumet Farm, Inc., America's premier racing dynasty","review":"Reads like a novel.

Lundy and the investments he made that ultimately led to the Alydar tragedy.Citation - one of the greatest racehorses of all time and easily the greatest horse ever bred at Calumet (no offense to Whirlaway) - gets a whopping paragraph mention.Many portions of this book get bogged down with discussions of trust funds, banks, liens, etc. If you want to know how not to run a business, this is for you. If you want to know how not to run a horse farm, this is for you. If you are just plain curious in how Calumet went so downhill so fast, this is for you.If you want to read about horse racing - this book is not for you.Auerbach seems to grasp the basics of horse racing...but she apparently never actually visited the farm...several times referring to Keeneland (which is directly next door to Calumet) as several miles away...Since she's a Wall Street Journal writer, obviously the business side of everything is extremely sound."},{"Title":"Wild ride: The rise and tragic fall of Calumet Farm, Inc., America's premier racing dynasty","review":"Once again, truth is stranger and more powerful than fiction. In one book, Wild Ride provides a family saga, an industry history, an as yet unsolved murder mystery, a portrait of the greed of the 1980s, and an insight into a world only lived in by a few, coveted by many and musunderstood by most. This saga artfully weaves the history of the Calumet Farm, considered to be among the true dynasties of the fabled Bluegrass area, with the history of thoroughbred horse breeding and racing. Even if the horse racing industry did not interest the reader (but almost everyone at least watches the Kentucky Derby!), the speed in which the power of greed and corruption, along with an amoral attitude can cause an old-line successful business to collapse in a matter of a few years is astounding and compelling reading. Ann Hagedorn Auerbach skillfully takes the reader on a ride through the Bluegrass country, after clearly doing a tremendous amoung of digging into the past and present to off the reader a comprehensive tale that is very, very hard to put down. A great read on multiple levels."},{"Title":"Wild ride: The rise and tragic fall of Calumet Farm, Inc., America's premier racing dynasty","review":"WILD RIDE, by Ann Hagedorn Auerbach, (New York: Henry Holt, 1994) reads like the murder mystery that it very likely is. Subtitled &quot;The Rise and Tragic Fall of Calumet Farm, Inc., America's Premier Racing Dynasty,&quot; the book is the work of a journalist who specializes in reporting about white collar crime. But Auerbach is more than that: she is an admirer of horses also. The tragic hero of WILD RIDE is Alydar, one of the foremost stallions in american racing history, who was euthanized in November, 1990 after breaking a hind leg in his stall. While offering no definitive prrof that Alydarwas intentionally and fatally injured to collect $36.5-million in insurance proceeds, Auerbach examines the incident in extreme detail and weaves the death of the stallion into her exhaustive account of the management of Calumet during the tenure of chief executive officer J.T. Lundy. although the book is currently out of print, the recent reopening of the Alydar investigation may change that. In any case, WILD RIDE would make a marvelous primer for anyone who hopes to follow the course of the current federal probe into the stallion's death."},{"Title":"Wild ride: The rise and tragic fall of Calumet Farm, Inc., America's premier racing dynasty","review":"An intriguing, non-fictional tale of corporate greed and thoroughbred racing in the 1980's against the backdrop of the history of the great Kentucky racing stable of Calumet.The characters include a multi-million dollar race horse,Alydar---famous for being second to 1978 Triple Crown Winner Affirmed, heirs of Warren Wright who took their inheritance for granted and ignored the source of their riches---Calumet, the banks who continued to loan millions of dollars to Calumet solely on the value of their star stallion Alydar. Even if you are not a fan of thoroughbred horses, the story is as much a moral tale for the 90's as it was for the 80's.The story moves fast, and is particulary fascinating when the author flashes back to the heydey of Calumet. The antidote retold by the author describing how Alydar was named is particularly amusing. The painstaking research into the where to's and how to's of syndicating breeding shares to star stallions and borrowing money against shares can be dull reading if you are not interested, but can be skimmed over since this is not the focus of the book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Wild ride: The rise and tragic fall of Calumet Farm, Inc., America's premier racing dynasty","review":"One of the saddest stories in modern thoroughbred history. This book was full of terrific research, unfortunately most of it was very sad and distressing to find how one man could bring down the greatest American racing icon of the 20th century - Calumet Farm. Excellent work and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Wild ride: The rise and tragic fall of Calumet Farm, Inc., America's premier racing dynasty","review":"This is a true story with some history of Calumet in the glory days and an account how one man took a fortune and not only made it a deficit but involved one of the greatest horses in the world to do it.
