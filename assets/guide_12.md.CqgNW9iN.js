I read this book as an English III assignment. It was very insightful to the society we live in today and yet in some aspects very far off. Bradbury's predictions of how the future will be/is is very weird and cool and disturbing of how our society is and how he talked about school shootings long before they ever occured.I think overall this was a good book and a very good book for discussion."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is a book that will make you think. As you are reading this book, questions pop up that you would have probably never thought of. Set in the not so distant future, Bradbury plunges you into the life of Guy Montag. He is a fireman who was always taught to ask how, not why. His job is to burn, not put out flames, never asking the reasons behind the burnings. He goes through life happy, not knowing anything is wrong. He lives in an unperfected utopia. Due to one event, his whole mentality crumbles and chaos emerges as he goes through a transformation, making everyone around him his enemy, except the few people who have gone through this metamorphosis. No longer ignorant he becomes isolated, pushing for some way out.This book is probably one of the best books I have ever read; it might even be my favorite. If you like books such as The Giver, or the short story Harrison Bergeron, then this is definitely a book to read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I love books like this more than I can express. Utopian society type books are probably my favorite things to read. So, naturally, I picked up Fahrenheit 451. I had heard great things about it from everyone except a good friend of mine who said simply that although he didn't by any means despise it, he thought it was a tad corny. I began reading the book and immediately fell in love with the style of writing. But, as I read on, I found that the book just felt a little... off. I think that it may have been a little unbelievable really, especially the Mechanical Hounds and such. I was also disappointed about Clarisse, although I won't go into detail about that. The thing that I really liked though, was that Bradbury hit the nail on the head when it comes to the development of political correctness. Overall, the book was alright. It was a quick read and I am still certainly glad that I read it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Here's another book that I should have read in school, but somehow never did. In a future where entertainment caters to the lowest common denominator, and in which books are forbidden, the job of the fireman is to burn contraband books. However, Guy Montag has a secret...he's a fireman who reads books. When his secret comes out, he has to flee for his life.Bradbury's writing is wonderfully evocative, painting clear pictures of his vision of a dark future. In this era of &quot;reality television,&quot; this book has a definite prophetic feeling to it, as if we were actually well on the way down the road Bradbury warns us about. The importance of books and literacy for preserving knowledge and ideas must never be forgotten."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Guy Montage is a fireman. But he doesn't stop houses from burning down. He starts the fire. They light the houses with books on fire, becuase books are considered bad. Not all books, but some, like the Bible, and any book containing thought. Books like porn, and goverment writings were premited. This is how the goverment at the time controled the people. By not letting them learn.Montage meets his new next door neighbor. Her name is Clairesse. Which in Spainish means clarity. And she does live up to her name.

Whereas \\"1984\\" implies that the downfall of the elements of language and pure animal instincts led to the degredation of society and \\"Brave New World\\" argues that beauty and truth are essential, \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" places its claim on the existence of literature. This fast-paced novel transports the reader to a world where firemen don't put out fires, they start them, and where philosophers and lovers of books don't have a place in a college classroom, but rather as bums on the streets. With descriptive passages and thought-provoking characterizations, \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is a delightful novel.However, I was slightly disappointed in the lack of depth it contains. I am an avid fan of Utopian literature, but I found it difficult to get swept up in the emotions of the novel. Without a doubt, it was pleasant to read, but if you're looking for a deep and enriching book that will make you laugh and cry and bring to light new perspectives on life and society, this isn't the most suitable novel for you."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Well, it's not a bad book. Actually it should not be considered a book though, it is, rather, a short story. The ideas expressed are all very valable but there isn't much of a story and the science behind it laughable. Bradbury makes good points and argues well, it's just that if you're reading this book (or any book for that matter) it probably implies that you already like reading and value books pretty high. So Bradbury is preaching to the converted. This book makes a great reading list though, many names are dropped and books are quoted from. Instead of reading this book you should read any of the books mentioned in it. Or just as a reminder of why you love to read so much."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This was a great book. It is very thought provoking and powerful.The future world he proposed gets more likely every year. It's message gets more important.Even if you don't like sci-fi or Ray Bradbury, this book is worth it just for the insights he makes."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I thought about the rating of this book (for my taste personally) overnight. I really liked this book, but I felt cheated. Why isn't there more? I wished Ray Bradbury would have kept going with this book. The reason why I wanted more was because I wanted to know what else would happen with Montag when he returned to the ruined city.Ray Bradbury ushered many feelings when I read this book. I was scared of that Hound. I was angry at Millie's friends and Millie. I was kind of impatient with Clarisse. I was confused whenever Beatty was speaking. When it came to Montag, I thought he was not only &quot;foolish&quot;, but smart, too.This futuristic look of the world is quite imaginative, but it could be real. Fire fighters starting fires instead of putting them out. No one able to read without losing their livelihood. Living in the fear of war and dying without knowing a real reason why. Being caught in the world of visual entertainment that entails walls as televisions, and the weirdest part, people caring more about the television &quot;family&quot; more so than their own flesh and blood. It is a possible future, but one man's vision is not necessarily the truth of this world.I liked this book, but I just wished there was more.Joy."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I enjoyed many things while reading the novel Fahrenheit 451. I especially liked how the society that Ray Bradbury created was an exaggeration but this exaggeration was not so distorted that it seemed unrealistic. In the novel Bradbury states that its cars go normally 100 miles per hour, an every day thing for woman is to have an abortion, inside the peoples' homes there are television walls and he also describes other futuristic ways of life.There also were not really any emotions in the book, which was another part about the novel that I enjoyed. For instance, the way Guy felt about Clarisse. You knew throughout the entire novel the effects she had on him and she is thought about, but never really talked about. I liked how even though this novel was written about fifty years ago, you can see it the events that Mr. Bradford described happening to our society. It hits you right at home and Ray Bradbury does a good job of warning us what the future might possibly be like.Another thing I also enjoyed about the book was how fire was constantly used and how it was always used as destruction and bad thing until the end. Whenever Bradbury describes the camp fire that was warming and welcoming because the Montag escaped the society and met up with other people that wanted to bring books back. These people were around that campfire and it was not threatening or anything.There were very many good parts to this book, however there were also some parts of the novel that I did not particularly like. In the beginning of the novel, I think Ray Bradbury goes into too much detail with the description about Guy's pleasurable experiences while on the job. I do not feel that it is relevant to the novel for him to include such information. I think that it started out very slow. During the slow beginning, there was a lot of symbolism and allusions to literature in the novel. I was not very familiar with these uses of symbolism and allusions so I did not pick up on that particular part of the novel."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Guy Montag is a fireman who burns books in a futuristic American city. In Montag's world, firemen start fires rather than putting them out. The people in this society do not read books, enjoy nature, spend time by themselves, think independently, or have meaningful conversations. Instead, they drive very fast, watch excessive amounts of television on wall-size sets, and listen to the radio on &quot;Seashell Radio&quot; sets attached to their ears.Montag encounters a gentle seventeen-year-old girl named Clarisse McClellan , who opens his eyes to the emptiness of his life with her innocently penetrating questions and her unusual love of people and nature. Over the next few days, Montag experiences a series of disturbing events. First, his wife, Mildred, attempts suicide by swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills. Then, when he responds to an alarm that an old woman has a stash of hidden literatur. The woman shocks him by choosing to be burned alive along with her books. A few days later, he hears that a speeding car has killed Clarisse.Montag's dissatisfaction with his life increases, and he begins to search for a solution in a stash of books that he has stolen from his own fires and hidden inside an air-conditioning vent. When Montag fails to show up for work, his fire chief, Beatty, pays a visit to his house. Beatty explains that it's normal for a fireman to go through a phase of wondering what books have to offer, and he delivers a dizzying monologue explaining how books came to be banned in the first place.According to Beatty, special-interest groups and other &quot;minorities&quot; objected to books that offended them. Soon, books all began to look the same, as writers tried to avoid offending anybody. This was not enough, however, and society, as a whole, decided to simply burn books rather than permit a conflicting opinion."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read this book when I was 12 for school and it schoked me then.

He has an amazing ability to paint a scene without unnecessary description and create tension with characters you can truly identify with and live in their skin. He will be missed."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is a story of conflict. Conflict between the work the main character Guy Montag does and his true beliefs. These beliefs have not been fully realized by him yet.We are introduced to Guy as the model citizen of this future world. He is a public servant, a fireman. Unfortunately, something has changed and now the firemen start fires instead of putting them out. Their mission is to find and burn books and the houses that are hiding them. Guy Montag was very good at his job and for the first many years, he did it without thinking or feeling.Several things happened to Guy that made him actually start thinking about what he was doing. He started wondering why he had to do what he had to do. Why was he burning old ladies and their books? He met his neighbor Clarisse McClellan, a young girl whose family just moved in. Clarisse made Guy think about things that he never realized before. \\"Bet I know something else you don't. There's dew on the grass in the morning.\\" He suddenly couldn't remember if he had known this or not, and it made him quite Irritable\\" (p. 4). It was these little things that people didn't take time to think about anymore.Guy started spending more time thinking about his job and why he was doing it. This was partly because he saw Clarisse almost everyday and she evoked a different type of emotion that he couldn't quite understand. By just pointing out that there are more things in life than work and television, she started to open his eyes. \\"And as many times he came out of the house and Clarisse was there somewhere in the world. Once he saw her shaking a walnut tree, once he saw her sitting on the lawn knitting a blue sweater, three or four times he found a bouquet of late flowers on his porch, or a handful of chestnuts in a little sack, or some autumn leaves neatly pinned to a sheet of white paper and thumbtacked to his door\\" (p. 13).After Clarisse disappeared, his world completely changed. He decided that he didn't want to continue down the same path he was heading down his whole life until this point. When asked what had changed in his life, Guy replied \\"I don't know. We have everything we need to be happy, but we aren't happy. Something's missing. I looked around. The only thing I positively knew was gone was the books I'd burned in ten or twelve years. So I thought books might help\\" (p. 38).In the end, Guy has finally changed everything about himself and joined with a band of likeminded people. He has become what he spent ten years trying to destroy. He was now himself a book. \\"Montag. Granger took Montag's shoulder firmly. Walk carefully. Guard your health. If anything should happen to Harris, you are the Book of Ecclesiastes. See how important you've become in the last minute!\\" (p. 69)."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is one of the most famous works of science fiction, and with \\"Brave New World\\" and \\"1984\\" represents one of the most memorable and haunting dystopias. In a future world, books are banned and firemen actually set fires instead of extinguishing them. The state exercises a form of social control through controlling what sort of information people have access to. It turns out that not all books are banned, only those that we would today consider \\"great works\\" - Plato, Shakespeare, The Bible, Darwin, etc. For me one of the biggest surprises about Fahrenheit 451 was the rationale that was offered for the burning of those books. In a nutshell, they offended politically correct sensibilities and the authorities felt that they would undermine the social cohesion. This expunging of the classics from the culture has an uncanny resonance with the attempts over past few decades to expunge them from the undergraduate liberal arts curriculum. And rationale is also similar: these books are not \\"diverse\\" enough and may offend the sensibilities of an ever-increasing list of \\"minorities.\\" It is hard not to wonder if a milder, softer version of dystopian future that Bradbury was worried about in the early 1950s has not in fact arrived.Bradbury's writing and ideas are somewhere between those of George Orwell and Philip K. Dick. His style is very engaging, and even poetic. His writing is at its best when one of his characters engages in a prolonged monolog. However, the plot development could use some improvement. There is very little in terms of transition from one scene to the next, and most scenes are overly compressed. It is very hard to follow the plot developments at times. Nonetheless, Bradbury is a wonderful stylist and unlike much of science fiction this book is a pleasure to read on a purely literally level as well as for its sweeping ideas.As a last note, I found it incredibly ironic that I read this book on Kindle. Based on this alone I am fairly optimistic that reading and great books will not only survive but in fact thrive well into the 21st century."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 was a great book, definitely something you can discuss in a group setting.

Great read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is an excellent book for someone who is into pondering the meaning of life and stuff like that. However, it's not the light, entertaining book that some may be looking for. Most of the book is a metaphor, and if the reader is willing to think about what is represented so much can come from this book. The idea of the book is fascinating and Bradbury's demonstrates his point perfectly with his amazing word choice. There are so many themes and life changing lessons that can be pulled out of this book. If the reader dives beneath the surface of this book, they will get a whole lot more from this book than they would from a cheesy love story."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury did an excellent job writing Fahrenheit 451. Set in a future time period, Guy Montag is a fireman but he doesn't stop fires, he usually creates them. Most of the time he burns books, one of the many things that are censored from the society in Fahrenheit 451.Ray Bradbury is great at writing descriptions. On the first page he describes Montag burning books buy saying, \\"It was a special pleasure to see things eaten, to see things blackened and changed. With the brass nozzle in his fists, with this great python spitting its venomous kerosene upon the world, the blood pounded in his head, and his hands were the hands of some amazing conductor playing all the symphonies of blazing and burning to bring down the tatters and charcoal ruins of history.\\" The whole book is full of descriptions like this. Most of the time this is a good thing because it kept me interested but sometimes descriptions seem a little too long and are just dragged out.The story instantly captures you within the first ten pages or so. The book is generally an easy read and was interesting all through out and made me want to keep reading."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"An average book, canonized as a classic because of its &quot;important&quot; message.

However, I found that the fantastic I expected from this Bradbury book was not as fantastic as I found in his other novels.The book storyline itself is very interesting. Indeed, Bradbury gets his point across. At first, the book seems Orwellian, as if there is a tyrant or Stalinist leader in America. But this is not true, and the actual reason _why_ the books are burned is very interesting. The reason was a completely new concept I never really thought of.Bradbury makes you think.This novel tends to reflect heavily on Bradbury's fear of &quot;the bomb&quot; and of course, the opression of book reading (as does his other classic, &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot;).There has been much critical review about Bradbury's treatment of one of the main characters, Clarisse. Her ending tends to be unanswered and incomplete; however, this should not have an effect on your choice of reading the novel.Overall, the book should _definitly_ be read. I cannot necessarily agree with Bradbury's perhaps-paranoid version of the future, but his point is well taken and well respected."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I picked up this book with such high expectations-Ray Bradbury is relavtively famous, the book is fantastically reknowned, and it is about censorship, an issue that I really care about.Well. My expectations were smothered, stabbed repeatedly, and left on the floor to die. This is not a good book. Bradbury's writing is incredibly confusing, and some pivotal parts of the story are so removed from the main plot that you can't understand them.Bradbury has a penchant for killing off characters. For example, one character, that changes the life of the main character, is dead 20 pages into the book. If she was burned 'cause she had books, fine, but she got run over by a car. How stupid is that?Pass this one up, and for a real futuristic utopia, try 1984. Just not this."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"While I can appreciate Bradbury's views on television's effects on people, I believe he gave far too much credence to the communistic approach to controlling people by doing away with books. Considering the beautiful complexity of a book like Dandelion Wine, this was disappointingly simplistic and unrealistic. And as to the war and the 'bomb' at the end, he stepped totally out of reality, since by the time this was written, the world would have known that the effects of radiation went far beyond the initial destruction. And he gave no explanation as to why there should have been a war at all. Bradbury ignored these issues to the detriment of his entire concept."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I bought this for her as she needed it for her english prep class.

So when I happened to read the synopsis of it I was quite excited to find this classic.Any story about book burning and censorship gets me quite riled up. I adore reading books and would hate a world where they are not allowed. Even in today's world of 24 hour TV, ereaders and all the other technology, there is nothing quite as relaxing and entertaining to me than reading a book. I started this book with high expectations and a real desire to love it.The concept of the story is great. Given that it was written in 1950 as a short story in Galaxy Science Fiction and then transformed into a book in 1953, the author was very forward thinking and he got a lot of things spot on. The dependence of people on large screen TVs and the rise of reality and interactive TV along with the dumbing down of society that it seems to cause. Luckily, the whole book banning and burning has not happened!It was in the execution of the writing that I felt let down. It was just all a bit too poetical and pretentious for me. If he had stuck to the telling of the story idea it would probably have been one of my all time favourite books but he somehow tried to be too smart - perhaps I am just too dumb - but the style just did not work for me. It was supposed to be allegorical but I was just missing what the underlying meaning was!That being said, I am still going to look out the movie and give it a watch, even just to see Julie Christie in one of her classic roles.I gave the book 3 out of 5 for the concept of the story but I didn't rate the writing style very high."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is in the vein of 1984 and other great books that show amazing foresight.

I think this is a great book for high school students to read for class for many reasons. First, Bradbury shows that it is okay to fight for what a person believes. I feel this is a great life lesson because if no one fought for what they believed, then everyone would all believe the same. That is good for high school students to realize because most teenagers keep their beliefs to themselves for fear of being bullied or made fun of. Even though fighting for what a person believes can cause that person to go against authority, which should not be encouraged in today's society, the overall result is better than not fighting for their belief. Secondly, Bradbury shows how society is able to change by the using examples of how the society in Fahrenheit 451 has changed and the reactions the people have in the society. That is also a great life lesson for high school students because nowadays students are so focused in on technology and their social life that they do not realize that the world outside them is majorly changing, not always in a good way either. I think that the students that read Fahrenheit 451 will have a positive attitude after reading this book. Mainly because it gives the students a different perspective and point of view of today's world and how they can improve what they think should be improved. Bradbury makes an excellent high school book author because he knows how the teenagers think and so he can help express to them the importance of fighting for what they believe in their own \\"language\\"."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is a classic and predicts many products that we use today such as flat screen tv on the wall, blue tooth, and drones."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"this is a very good science fiction book. it reminds me the important to read books.

Books, the main type of individual thought which is being erased at this time are burnt when seen. The main character is a new type of fireman, one who burns down houses with books in them, rather than saving them.The writing in this book is amazing, parts of it you have to read twice just because of the amount of visual and symbolic words used. The book also gives a strong look into how people think, and what the world could come to. Ray Bradbury is a great writer, and although none of the situations he wrote about came true, the book will stand the test of time forever as a classic."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a worthwhile novel, if only to read about a possible future earth where books do not exist and to make one think about the impact of censorship. The book is short enough that you can finish in a single sitting, but you'll want to savor parts of it, so I don't recommend making this a one-sitting read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"THIS BOOK IS ONE OF THE BEST I HAVE EVER READ!!!! i read it in 7th grade, read it in 8th grade and saw the play in 9th.

F451 is a really great book to read, but a fabulous book to discuss. We had some of the richest discussion about human nature and societal pressures during our seminars on this book. I liked this book so much, my essay on it made the exceptional writing board! (which only happens when I really care) Most of the books read at school get a bad rep as overrated classics written just for English geeks who love slowly digesting and turning over every stone in the book, but Bradbury's writing style is so warm annd easy to read, anyone can conquer this classic. Unlike other books of its genre (science fiction) its ideas of science fiction in a somewhat more approachable manner, stuff you could really see happening.

Named after the temperature at which paper catches fire and burns, the book tells the story of one extraordinary week in the life of Guy Montag, a \\"fireman\\" whose job it is to burn the houses of those harbouring books. Until one day he begins to think that his job is not as worthwhile as his society would make him think. This single act of questioning leads to a chain of events. By the book's end, the world that Montag once knew will never be the same again.Part fable, part thriller, Fahrenheit 451 is a fascinating and provocative read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 sees the future of the world, and it hates what it sees. People have become apathetic and worthless. No one cares about morality or the search for truth. Everyone is a mindless drone.As mentioned by other reviewers, the story is in many ways prophetic. It's fascinating how the author predicts modern technologies like projection TVs (the TV parlor), iPods (ear thimbles), and even Bluetooth headsets (Faber's \\"green bullet\\").My favorite part of the story is Beatty's lecture in Montag's house, just before he leaves. Through Beatty's character, Bradbury warns of out-of-control government growth and the brainwashing and indoctrination of children. We'd be wise to heed this warning.This book is a fairly easy read because it's short, but it provides plenty of food for thought."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"451F refers to the trigger temperature for paper to burn (though 450C is more popularly thought to be the right temperature - no matter, since \`Celsius 451' just doesn't have the same ring).Set in a postmodern era, a lawless America has turned itself into an anti-intellectual state which persecutes anyone who is caught in possession of books and worse, reading their contents.Into this setting steps a new breed of firemen, who abandon their traditional roles by actually setting fire to these books whenever a \`concerned' member of the public reports on their neighbour. Intellectuals and professors go underground as universities and higher institutes of learning are eradicated. People \`interact' with their newfound virtual families, which are akin to real-time projections of our modern day talkshows (replete with canned applause and laughter) on their walls.Fireman Guy Montag is forced to question his existence and life as he knows it, when confronted with seventeen-year old neighbour Clarisse, who tells him of a past where people were not afraid to think and question.This book is so clearly ahead of its time with chillingly accurate predictions of the numbing (dumbing?) effects of technology, which breeds complacence and unquestioning acceptance of status quo.One especially disturbing scene was the way the manhunt for the fugitive Montag turns into a televised spectator sport, not unlike reality TV programmes in the Noughties.Published in 1953, this dystopian novel still remains relevant and current in the 21st century, though one wonders at the impact of e-books and the future of the books as we know them.Highly recommended - to be read as a companion to Don Delillo's 'White Noise'."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"My daughter has to read this for her 10th grade english class and I decided to check it out myself.

Scary look into a possible future if the censors get their way. One of several books assigned to high school students which intrigued me. Several selections in the high school cannon are introspective of the human character. The value of this theme is obvious considering the carefree attitude most of the youth have today. The afterword and the Coda point out some interesting things about rewriting books to include everyone. We don't have to be politically correct ALL the time, especially if it is read it in the historical context it was written.

In this futuristic setting, nobody seems to be concerned with anything but their own happiness. These people spend majority of their time on frivolous things like fast cars, large televisions, and a type of ear-piece radio. All of the books in the city are to be burned because they create conflicting views amongst the people, ultimately resulting in fighting and unhappiness. Majority of the people are unable to form their own independent thoughts, as the schools are even changed in a way that students only learn facts and not problem solving, logic, reason, or other philosophical subjects. The main character, Montag, is a firefighter that has always done his job (burning books) without questioning. However, after a strange series of events, he slowly begins to develop his own thoughts, and starts questioning the society he lives in."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"1950: A year in which one of the greatest novels of our time was written. Fahrenheit 451 was originally written as a short story and was titled \\"The Fireman.\\" This was Ray Bradbury's first novel but definitely not the last. Taking place in a society where reading books is outlawed, firemen are paid not to put out fires, but to start them...on books.Guy Montag, the main character of the book and one of the most dedicated firemen, had his routine life turned upside down after meeting a young teenage girl named Clarisse. Meeting Clarisse was the first turning point in the book. Clarissa asked Montag the very personal question of \\"Are you happy?\\" (10). This struck Montag as a huge shock considering he did not know how to answer it. Evaluating this question took up most of Montag's time. After being called to set ablaze to an elderly woman's home, and burning her to death in the process, he knew the answer to Clarisse's question. Living in a society where knowledge is turned down, where his wife is too wrapped up in her \\"soap operas\\", and where people want to kill each other for fun, wasn't how he wanted to live. Unhappiness was the basis of Montag's life. He realized that there must be something in books that fulfill people like Clarisse and the woman who burned herself, he had to find out what was in them.Montag's boss, Captain Beatty, caught on that Montag might be exploring books, or even housing them and tried to discourage Montag. After finding an old friend to help him interpret the books, Mildred his wife, became frightened and eventually turned him in which was the major turning point or climax in the book. After that point, an adventure begins. Bradbury uses his unique literary devices and other writing techniques to truly bring the reader into the story.Many allusions were used and referred to in this novel. The most vivid was the allusion of the Phoenix. A Phoenix is a mythical bird that over time dies and catches on fire, burning to ashes, and then is reborn through the ashes. This bird can be related to the mechanical society in which the characters of the novel live in. The knowledge and the conditions of the world in which they used to live in, eventually died and burned as does the Phoenix. However, the symbolism of the rebirth could perhaps also be foreshadowing the ending of the novel.Bradbury's similes, metaphors, and other literary devices combine to allow the reader to better visualize the imagery and place themselves into the scene. The organization of his words alone, contribute to the understanding of the sentence structure. \\"They had one machine. They had two machines, really. One of them slid down into your stomach like a black cobra down an echoing well looking for all old water and the old time gathered there... It had an Eye.\\" These words are connected with a simile and a metaphor, making a better visualization for what was taking place. Symbols were also widely used throughout Fahrenheit 451.The titles of the first two parts alone, serve as very important symbols in the book. \\"The Hearth and the Salamander\\" symbolizes both the fireplace and the creature who is believed to be unaffected by fire. The hearth, where the fire is housed, symbolizes the heating of a home and the salamander which is the official symbol for the firemen. \\"The Sieve and the Sand\\" is also very symbolic. Depicting that if placed on the sieve, the sand would fall straight through, not accumulating any of it. This is comparable to Montag trying to read the books. The words were going in, but also going straight back out. He did not know how to keep the knowledge he had just gained.Overall, I think this book was a wonderful interpretation of a man who knew things were wrong and who built up enough courage to go after what he believed in. Possibly a prediction of the future, Bradbury influentially shows the readers of Fahrenheit 451 that knowledge is a very sacred thing and its sacred components, the books, should not be taken for granted."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A book revolving about the burning and destruction of books seems kind of ironic, right? But that is exactly what the plot of Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is based on. Taking place in the not so distant future, Fahrenheit 451 revolves around one fireman, Guy Montag, whose job was to start fires instead of stop them. Living in a world where is was a crime to read books, punishable by getting your house burned down, and where the government controls all forms of entertaining media, Montag never questioned what he did for a living. All this changes one day when he meets a strange seventeen-year-old girl on the way home from work one day, and asks him a simple question; \\"Are you happy?\\" This triggers a chain reaction within Montag when he comes to the conclusion that he is, in fact, not happy with his life. Throughout the rest of book, we see how Montag struggles with this and how he quests to do something about it.Bradbury breaks down Fahrenheit 451 into three parts. In the first, the reader is introduced to the protagonist, Guy Montag, and his life and background information up to this point. However, as mentioned earlier, when he meets the young girl, Clarisse McClellan, everything is turned upside down for him, making this the defining moment of this part. She asks him if he is happy which starts to make Montag really sit down and think, a rarity for the people in this particular setting.\\"He felt his smile slide away, melt, fold over and down on itself like a tallow skin, like the stuff of a fantastic candle burning too long and now collapsing and now blown out. Darkness. He was not happy. He recognized this as the true state of affairs. He wore his happiness like a mask and the girl had run off across the lawn with the mask and there was no way of going to knock on her door and ask for it back,\\" (Bradbury 12)Through the author's use of similes, it is easy to see that this is the beginning of the change within Montag after his encounter with Clarisse.From there on, the reader experiences the inner conflict raging within Montag, and then later, outside him. With Bradbury's frequent use of symbolism and metaphors, the reader can get a clear picture of just what is going on in the protagonist's head, yet not so much that the reader would not have to think about it. The way Bradbury writes with these literary devices also helps him depict the imagery of each scene. An example being:\\"With the brass nozzle in his fists, with this great python spitting its venomous kerosene upon the world, the blood pounded in his head, and his hands were the hands of some amazing conductor playing all the symphonies of blazing and burning to bring down the tatters and charcoal ruins if history,\\" (3).Keeping with one of the themes of the book, Bradbury is also constantly comparing things to the aspects of fire, or fire to a blooming flower and he compares books to wings or birds of purity and peace. The unique style in which Bradbury combines these traits helps to distinguish Fahrenheit 451 into the classic novel that it is.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed Fahrenheit 451. I found the plot intriguing and oddly believable for a futuristic sci-fi piece. It was written in a way easy to understand yet not so simple that it takes away from the novel. The characters were well developed and the protagonist was likable as well as easy to sympathize with. There was little to complain about except maybe the ending seemed a bit too abrupt. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good science fiction story."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I'm a highschool freshmen and I read the book last year when was in 8th grade.

If you haven't read it you're really missing something."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If it's written by Bradbury, its got to be good. He is one of the best science-fiction authors, and Fahrenheit 451 is no exception. It is dramatic, with broken bonds, chase scenes, and runs with the law.

Once you read such an awkward book by the master author of science fiction, Ray Bradbury, youre' bound to be memerized by the proceedings. This slightly short book sometimes made me ill at ease, or uncomfortable, because the book is self-conscious in a way. Bradbury's book is almost a conspiracy theory in many accounts, because it deals with the banning of books in an almost non-existent world.The basic premise is that reading a book in this \\"world\\" is against the law, where the penalties are hugely severe. The heroes, or anti-heroes in my book, are the fireman. Instead of their priorties of saving human lives, the fireman are hired basically to burn books. When a unhappily married fireman named Guy Montag questions the burning of books, his view becomes to deepen more and more. He soons to appearicate books, yet his wife and collegues soon mark him as a lawbreaker. Montag soon becomes a fugitive, and details his found use of books toward other intelligent minds who also are fond of books as well.I love Bradbury's interesting vision of the world his book. His beliefs in the future world are almost uncanny to today. But his future world is frightening and paranoid as well. I read the book twice, and I have become found of the characters and terrific and knowlegeable storyline. Yet, I feel FAHRENHEIT 451 should be taken not so lightly. The theme of this book feels so close to home, I feel like Bradbury's \\"world\\" might become our society in the years to come."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a science fiction novel written by Ray Bradbury. The title represents the temperature at which paper burns. The author describes a future society where censorship becomes so severe, that the job of the town's firemen is not to put out fires, but rather to start them by burning books. The government tries to prevent its citizens from learning their own or independent ideas. The main character is Guy Montag. He is one of the firemen. His job is to burn the books. At first he does his job, but later he meets Clarissa, a ghostly image that could represent his conscience, and begins to question his duties. He has an internal conflict because on one hand he wants to do his job, but on the other he doesn't like burning the books any longer. Mr. Montag begins to accept books as a good thing. He starts to store them in his house, but his wife turns him in to the law and they confiscate his library. He escapes and joins an outlaw society that keep the contents of books memorized so that they could be written at a later time when such action is permitted by law. Mr. Bradbury's goal is clearly to show us the extreme to which censors could control a society simply by controlling what we read. This is a great book -- read it!

In fact, the only emotions left are negative or false. I think everyone should read this book once and see if it opens your eyes.

Montag's neighbor, a young girl named Clarisse, is excited by the ideas of reading books. He then decides to hide a stash of books in his home.I found this book to be really strange.

Through all this symbolism, Ray Bradbury truly made this a great book because you had to piece everything together as if it were a puzzle. I liked how the setting took place in the future. Their world was always &quot;on-the-go&quot; and non-stop in a way that they had no time to socialize. They always had a controlled schedule. The government was very strict because they controlled what they were allowed and not allowed to do, and if anyone disobeyed these harsh rules, the consequeces would be severe and possibly fatal.

It was very complicated and confusing, but Ms. O., my teacher, helped explain the book. All of the metaphors and similes symbolized something. All of the symbolism in this book was so amazing once you understood it. Light and dark, symbolizing good and bad, was used often in Fahrenheit 451. I loved this book once I understood all of the symbolism. Fahrenheit 451 was written 50 years ago, but is supposed to take place in the 24th century. It's funny, because some things are reversed. The main character, Guy Montag, is a fireman, but not the kind of fireman you're thinking of, a fireman in the future. They go around lighting peoples' houses on fire if they have books. You're not allowed to read in the future, because the government knows that books create curiosity and cause you to think. The future government doesn't want anyone to believe in anything else except what they want the society to believe. You have a speed minimum, and if you drive slower then the speed minimum, you get a ticket. The whole world just rushes from place to place. The government knows that if people don't rush around, it might give them time to think. No one talks to each other, and it seems as if no one loves each other. Teenagers kill each other for \\"fun.\\" In some ways I see our society turning into this, and I probably wouldn't be very surprised if it was like this in the 24th century. It's just horrible to think that our world might turn into a mindless, hypnotized world. This book makes you think, and it makes you realize how wrong censorship is. It was written in 1953, and that's a little while after World War II, so Ray Bradbury, the author, probably got some of his inspiration to write this book from Hitler. If Hitler ended up winning World War II, I could DEFINATLY see our world turn into Ray Bradbury's \\"future world.\\" Guy Montag's big internal conflict starts when he meets Clarisse, a crazy-17-year-old. She's different from everyone else, because her family talks to each other at night instead of watching TV. She asks Montag if he's happy, and that one question starts everything. He realizes that he isn't happy, and he becomes curious about books. There is no book like Fahrenheit 451. Its constant metaphors, similes, and symbolism cause you to think about things that you would never begin to think about.-->Gabby**Holy Angels Class of '04!!!**"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 was a very strange and different book.

They burn books and are addicted to T.V. One man, Guy Montag, starts to see things differently. He doesn't like how his life is and the people who are in it.

It is not only a good story with a strong message regarding freedom of speech. It is beautifully written and very easy to read.

More importantly, that it makes you think.Farenheit 451 does this and more. As I read it, it horrified me how much it applies to today's society. People are always offended about one thing, or they want you to delete that. Some people detest reading at all and are content to spend their days watching sitcoms - most of which are not funny and have no point to them whatsoever. These days, people seem to be longing for an easy, brainless, sacchrine happiness and existence. Farenheit 451 shows what happens when those people get their wish.A must-read for anybody of any age - five stars from me! If you like it, and haven't already read other books of this genre (dystopias and such) - may I also recommend 1984 by George Orwell, Anthem by Ayn Rand, and The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The real purpose of burning the books is clearly explained by Montag's boss himself.

False sense of social stability achieved this way is the same fallacy that is so brilliantly explored in this book.

This book deserves the status of a classic, all right. It has memorable characters, vivid sentences and scenes, and holds a mirror to the errors of society. Though fifty years old, the book is surprisingly modern in its perceptions.The story follows Guy Montag, a fireman. His job is to start fires, rather than put them out. When the station receives calls about homes that harbor books, the Salamander fire engine races out with kerosene hoses to douse the residence and destroy the threatening pages.What is really under attack in Montag's world is thought, intellectualism, connection between people. The effects of TV and useless trivia, the conflict between art and entertainment, are highlighted here in the flames of Montag's burning. When Montag turns the corner, deciding to combat this world gone mad, he faces deep and long-lasting consequences. And the world will never be the same.Bradbury succeeds in writing a very personal, yet very global tale. The heat of this novel still emanates today.

What makes this book truly great is that it takes you on a shocking and (pardon the pun) inflammatory journey and drops you off wondering \\"if this could ever happen\\" where you live. Great fiction does more than entertain briefly. It makes us think. Great fiction gathers us in its webs of intrigue and forces us to see our own world in new ways. This book is timeless. At any point in civilization we can see the effects of the control of information (for better of worse) on us as individuals, and therefore on each of our own very thoughts and actions that we believe to be so highly personal, the 'one thing' that no one can take from us. It is for this reason that this book should be read by everyone at an early age. This book does not proselytize: it shows us the fate of living under censorship and allows us to choose the \\"safety\\" of overt thought-control and \\"decide\\" if that is what we wish for ourselves.

But don't let that scare you, it is a GREAT read. It makes you think, and Bradbury does a great job, style and themewise. I chose Bradbury for a Critical english report (not a review, as in, ~15 page critical analysis) and it is great just interpreting his style and themes"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In Guy Montag's world, a fireman's job is to start the fires. The firemen are paid to raid homes and burn any books they find there. 451 degrees Fahrenheit is the temperature at which books burn. Guy loves his job--at least, he thinks he loves his job. He has never really thought deeply about it, until he meets his new neighbor, sixteen-year-old Clarisse. She is a very strange girl, and she points things out to Guy and asks him questions that make him reconsider his life. After talking to her, he begins to think about whether he is realy doing a good thing, burning books. He thinks about his wife, who watches television all day and listens to a walkman all night, and occasionally overdoses on sleeping pills. Does Guy love her? Does he even know her?Guy begins to rebel. He starts secretly reading books, which is strictly forbidden. He contacts a man who used to be a professor and he goes to visit this man, hoping the professor will help him to change things somehow, to change the world and to turn his job back to one that fights fires rather than starting them. When his wife turns him in, Guy becomes a fugitive, forced to run away from town where he can hide to avoid prison. Will Guy be able to change the world, or will he be hunted down by those who want a world without books?This book presented an interesting view of an alternate reality, and there were good details about this society of the future. However, this book was driven more by ideas than by people. There wasn't a whole lot of character development or investigation. I would have liked to have known more about what the characters were thinking."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Some of the reviewers have panned this book for the writing style. I thought it was wonderful and honest. The emotional, and some times totally unemotional, conversations are so close to true speech. I think it was probably easier to understand that in the audiobook format. The version that I checked out from the library had an afterword written by Mr. Bradbury, after looking at the story over 30 yrs after he wrote it. In it, he addressed some of the feedback he has received over the years about this book. He also stated, in no uncertain terms, exactly his views on censoring of books and even of opinions.I REALLY enjoyed this book and some of the conversations it has sparked with my husband and friends about the subject matter. I highly recommend it. Especially to those who think there is nothing wrong with the empty entertainment that is pressed upon us today. We need to start thinking and talking again about things that matter. So we , too, can remember...remember...I love it. Read it (or listen to it)."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, focuses on Guy Montag. Montag is working fireman, but his job is to do the exact oppisite of taking down fires, instead he makes the fires. All is well, until he meets a professour who tells him about the dreaded future with new and advanced technology. It's up to Montag to dispose the new future, that could be tomorrow, where burning a building gets him into big mess. In my opinion Fahrenheit 451 has a very unique and compelling plot that is dearly recommended to fantasy and science fiction novel fans. Fahrenheit 451 is also recommended to readers who focus on challenging themselfs because of some of the language and transitions the novel makes."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book Fahrenheit 451 takes a look into a futuristic where all books are banned, and simple things, such as being a pedestrian can get you arrested. The book was written around the end of World War II, and was probably influenced by Nazi Germany because of their effort to censor everything. The main character is named Guy Montag, who is a firefighter. He is not a typical firefighter that we would think of though, his job is burn books. His life changes one day after having a conversation with his neighbor, Clarisse McClellan, who asks him if he is happy or not. After this conversation he ends up on a wild journey that then leads him to fight to save the one thing that he used to destroy.This book has stood the test of time and is a true classic. It has been referenced to in many other books, TV shows, and movies since its publication in 1953. Ray Bradbury does an amazing job of writing the novel, with numerous twists and turns. It had me on the edge of my seat while reading the book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury does an amazing job at creating a wonderful tale. Reading this as a 14 year old, I think it we be much more enjoyed by an older crowd. It is a great book. It is very interesting in my opinion how one can completely turn around all his beliefs so quickly... a wonderful story for everyone above the age of 8."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a classic science fiction novel written by Ray Bradbury and published in 1953. This book has followed in the purpose for which the genre of science fiction was created; to predict and speculate about what will happen to humans in the future--and especially--to warn readers away from the less desirable futures. So much of what is written in this book has already or may come to pass that readers may find it disturbing to read.One aspect of Fahrenheit 451 that I thought was particularly well done is its realistic portrayal of human behavior. One instance where this was displayed occurs right after Guy Montag had turned traitor and started both reading and trying to save the books he was supposed to be burning. The very firehouse he worked for programmed a mechanical hound, called simply, the \\"Hound\\" to search for and destroy his DNA code. As the media built up feelings of antipathy and hatred of Guy, the public responded by growing increasingly excited and exultant about seeing him caught and killed, even to the point of following the media's suggestion that everyone check to see if Guy is outside of their house. This, to me, sounds like an accurate representation of human responses to the media's stimuli.Another aspect of Fahrenheit 451 I liked was that the main characters are given backgrounds and histories to make it possible to understand their actions, opinions, beliefs, and morals. For example, the book describes an occasion in Guy Montag's childhood when power was down for an evening and he and his mother used candles instead of electric lights, and talked, instead of watching TV, which helps to explain Guys rationalizations for preferring real people and hating the characters on the three-dimensional TV. Also, Clarisse, one of the supporting characters has a very rich past that is highly developed. In her case, this takes on the form of her father and uncle, who greatly influence her opinion and provide the background and embodiment for most of her convictions. They never actually appear in the book, but Clarisse's descriptions of them and constant references to them make them seem almost like characters themselves.One of the things for which this book is the most renowned--and, in my opinion, is its most valuable feature is its philosophy. No matter which opinion is being portrayed, the dialogue and explanation of that philosophy is passionate and convincing. For example, when Guy first goes to the retired Professor Faber, Faber describes three things which men need if humanity is to be truly free. The first is, a wealth of information, the second, time to analyze this information, and the third, the right and ability to act on this information.I have given this book a five-star rating because I consider it to be one of the finest literary works of this century, because not only did he right it with fine character development, but also with a unique plot and profound philosophies."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A great story to pass the time during travel, such as on a plane or in car, because it should only take 2-and-a-half Hours to read. It starts with Guy Montag, a fireman whose job is to actually start fires, primarily to burn books and their owner's houses. After being encountered by a strange 17-year old girl who asks not only \\"what\\" things are about but \\"why\\", and witnessing a woman commit suicide by lighting her house (bearing books) on fire rather than let the Firemen do it themselves, he decides there must be something else to books than just words and paper. The story is about his struggles to revive the book world and save it from certain destruction."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, the setting is a place in the near future in which reading books is prohibited and being caught with them is punishable. The book begins with Guy Montag, whose job in life is to go around and set fires to houses in which books are being kept. When a woman sets fire to her herself and her house rather then give up her books, Guy starts to question what exactly he is doing. At first he does not believe this is wrong, but when he takes a few books home one day, he is enlightened and realizes that the burning of such great works would be preposterous and their loss monumental. As soon as he has this awakening, he comes under danger due to it.This book is not only about censorship as although it may seem this way. This book portrays an eerie depiction about what the world would be like without some individual freedoms. No one wants to offend anybody in the city that is the setting for the book. Because of this, freedom of speech is limited. The book makes you dig deep into your own mind and really makes you think about how the world could be different.There were many strong points to this book. The first is the interesting and thought provoking plot. Through much excitement in the novel, it keeps you interested until you turn the last page. Another great strong point is the great details. I could truly sense that I was in the book and it played similar to a movie in my head. There is more then enough detail to give you exactly what the author wants you to see, while leaving some to the imagination as well. The only weakness of the book that I found was it starts off a little slow in the beginning, but other then that is an amazing readFahrenheit 451 is a pleasure to read and leaves you wanting more. The book is an instant classic and I suggest anyone who has any interest in science fiction to read it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 absolutely cathes the reader's attention of the importance of books. In this story the government has become so corrupt that it has banned the ownership of any sort of literature. It is not until the day when protagonist Montag realizes, while talking to a young girl, how unhappy and naive he actually was. Bradbury takes the idea of a Utopia society and turns it completely upside downThis book shows the damaging effects on the censorships of books and stresses the importance of literature. This is a highly recommmended book to those seeking to open their eyes and realize the truth of how society can be. However, the story moves at a slow pace and many undifined things are exposed in the begining. Other than that, this is an exceptioally good book with an even better moral."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 was an interesting book, not because of it's plot, but because of the way it made you think. It's exemplification of the way too much censorship can ruin the world makes you a little more aware of censorship everywhere. The book is about Montag, a fireman who starts fires that destroy books. In this futuristic world, Books are not allowed due to the controversy they create. People who do not follow the strict code of staying home and watching TV are persecuted. One day, after a meeting with a girl, Montag begins to realize the true beauty of books. Not a terribly hard book to read, Fahrenheit 451 had a few difficult vocab words and a few chaotic scenes, but mostly kept the plot simple. I would recommend this book to 6th or 7th graders trying to expand their vocabulary, or anyone else who wants a book that makes them think. I give this book a 7/10, only because I like more complex plots."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury once called himself a writer of &quot;speculative fiction.&quot; He most certainly based that statement on this very book. Bradbury's view of the future from 1953 is proving its merit now that it is beginning to come true. Similar to Aldous Huxley's Brave New World and George Orwell's 1984, Bradbury's novel tells of a world in which the government has entrapped society in a web of propaganda. Bradbury's novel differentiates itself from the other two, however, in that it focuses on this oppressive government's censorship of literature and the &quot;firemen,&quot; who burn these illegal books. Fahrenheit 451 also is far more entertaining to read, as it is in pure Bradbury style, with vivid, colorful writing, and Bradbury's standard metaphors at every turn of the page. A great read for any Bradbury fan, a science fiction reader, or anyone who wants to see society with a whole new perspective. in sum, this book proves that Ray Bradbury has got the future's number. That number is, of course, Fahrenheit 451."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury is an eerily prophetic science fiction novel written in 1953. This book deals with concepts such as censorship which was prominent in the '50's and today as fewer and fewer people read books. The story is based around Guy Montag, a futuristic fire fighter who doesn't put out fires for a living but instead burns books. One day he meets a young girl named Clarisse who changes his view on books and life. From then on Montag is a changed man and attempts to overthrow the fire department and everyone else who is against books. After killing the fire chief he flees the city and meets up with a group of outcasts who are pro-books. They have memorized entire books hoping that one day they will one day again become accepted. This is a great book and I reccommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury in his classical novel Fahrenheit 451 uses symbolism, imagery, and literary devises to create an abhorrent world filled with censorship. In Fahrenheit 451, Ray Bradbury gives a frightening vision of the future where firemen don't put out fires--they start them in order to burn books. Bradbury paints society as holding happiness as there highest goal, where trivial, useless information is good and ideas and knowledge is bad. One of the most reoccurring literary devises in this novel is symbolism. We often see symbolism in the character's names. For example, one of the main characters, Guy Montag can have two translations. Guy signifies Guy Faux a famous man we associate with effigy, and Mischief Day (Nov.4), and Montag is the trademark of the Need American Paper Company, also a brand of furnaces. More symbolism is shown when we meet Faber. Faber is America's leading pencil company and it is going to be the pencil that writes on Montag's paper."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Reading on and on, and flying through the pages of an exceptional novel, sums up my spellbinding experience with Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451. With its wide array of characters I shared their pain, sorrow, and excitement. Its many themes forced me to ponder about our civilization's future. The picture that Bradbury painted of a particular community was magnificent. Most importantly, I encountered a society that seemed alien and threatening, but also familiar enough to be real. It is a story of censorship and consumerism, a novel concerning the future, a tale describing the transformation of a man are words that merely describe the power of this novel. Fahrenheit 451 is a well-written, organized encounter with the life of an ordinary fireman and his legacy."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In the book, books are banned for making people's minds corrupt. Firemen now don not put out fires, they simply just start them. Guy Montag, a fireman for 10 years, never questioned his job of destroying books. Until he met a 17 year old girl who told him of a great past. Then, Guy meets a doctor who tells him how he can save the planet from another dark age.Ray Bradbury, I salute you! This book contains some of the most thoughtful sentences and words, and talks about such topics as censorship, politics, and the corrupt police. Too bad it was short. This is so good, I might read it again right now! The only thing that's stopping me is that it's a library book. I NEED THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If you have not read this book yet, you are missing out. This book by Ray Bradbury exposes you to why books are very important.

If you have not read it yet, you must because you are missing out on a terrific story."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I chose this book because I have read Ray's books before and enoyed them. The title seemed interesting, so I took it. His style of writing can be confusing, so you must concentrate while reading. I gave this book a &quot;thumbs up&quot; because it had an unexpected ending."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In 1980 I had to read this book for one our class assignments. I was brought into the world of the book burner, and was scared! This could really happen, I kept saying this over and over. I have been trying to locate this great book for years! Now I can share this with my children, and hope they see what I did, and to insure that it never does!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I think that Fahrenheit 451 was an outstanding book to read. At first I was mad at the point that i had to read as reading assignment for school. But as contiued reading I was very happy that I read this book. I also believe that this may happen in the future so be careful what you wish for. So if you have not read this book read now and you will see what I'm talking about."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I was actually forced to read this book for a high school english class, and fell in love with it. It's simply chilling in it's portrayal of the &quot;future&quot; and the deliberate ambiguity about Clarrise is very cool. The deeper themes in this book make it one completely rife with feeling. A very poignant book, it's definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradybury proposed advertizing which is everywhere, kids who kill one another for no reason, people who no longer even bother to think for themselves because their thoughts are fed to them by TV. Tell me this isn't America in the 1990's. And Bradbury had it right in the 50's. And Clarisse stills haunts me, asking &quot;Are you happy?&quot; I hear her every time I think to purchase something I have seen advertized, something I think will improve my happiness. She had it right, real experiences make us more alive, not what we buy."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Kind of confusing, but is wonderful once you get into it. Really makes you think.

It was the second-best science fiction book that I had ever read (the best book being the Giver)."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I thought that this book was great and it really makes you wonder. This book was written by a person who had a great imagination, the best. And like Einstein said, &quot;Imagination is more important that knowledge.&quot; Which I thought was the moral of the book. I would reccomend this book to anyone who wants to read where one page makes you read the next."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is a very important must-read for every person living in America at this time in history. The paralells that can be drawn from the story in this novel to the &quot;dumbing of America&quot; that is going on today are quite unnerving, and quite scary. This book should be required reading for everyone who has ever turned on the television to escape from the world (which is just about everyone in this country)."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is a thought-provoking book. 451 society and today's society are frighteningly similar in many ways. Also, on a deeper level, Bradbury uses symbolism to make the work even better. This is a must-read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The stereotype of teenagers in general is that they hate to read books. Well I am one of those teens that fit into that category, and, having read this book for an assignment, I have to say that I don't regret substituting passing notes for reading this book. The descriptions of the future are so exact and precise that it's mind boggling. Clarisse (In Part I) portrays almost perfectly what nobody else could. There are parts of the book where you expect one thing to happen, and you get something totally different and say to yourself &quot;Whoa...&quot; and you are almost forced to think about it. I can't reccommend this book enough."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In my honest opinion Bradbury is one of the best contemporary authors, not only in US, but worldwide. Its a must read for a well educated person."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Amazingly written!! Ray Bradbury is a visionary. The book was intriguing, and suspenseful. When I read it I couldn't put it down!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It seemed at first that the book was too far-fetched, that It could never happen. However the more I read the more I saw connections to life today. In many ways it has been very prophetic. It basically displays what happens when a culture values convenience and comfort over honesty and truth.great read, recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book foretells our future by describing advances in technology. The scary part is how close we are. The sea shell radio can be portrayed as teenagers and their headphones. Mildred and the gals might as well be the stereotypical women who are having a tough relationship week; the ones who watch chick flicks with a tub of ice cream all week end. If you are interested in seeing what people from the seventies though about the future then this book is a good fit. Also, if you are interested in the future and sci-fi this is also a good book because their are some inventions not yet invented that are mentioned. I was required to read this book for my 9th grade year and I probably won't be reading it again because its just not one of those books. Not one of those books with descriptive features you might miss and want to read again for, or characters you can adore, or even events you would be on the edge of your seat to read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The things in this book hold so true to the majority of society now.

Would recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This novel is brilliant and amazing. The plot centers around Guy Montag, a fireman who's job it is to burn books and houses containing books. The world has made books illegal, making humans almost like robots who are lazy and obsessed with technology and fun. This novel is a definitely sci-fi, but it also could be considered future fiction or dystopia. There is a lot of action and adventure within the story, but I also like the philosophical implications that Ray Bradbury put in there. A wonderful read that will keep you captivated and thinking!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A classic that I read years ago with a message that is as relevant to day as it was when written."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This has always been one of my favorite Bradbury books. Just bought this for my kids and they have enjoyed it so far as well."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book, as many of Bradbury's, is incredibly interesting.

Not only is this novel an amazing tale the first time it is read, but it contains the same excitement and wonder many times thereafter."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Wow! I just finished this book for my 8th grade reading class two days ago. It was the wierdest book I've ever read, yet in an awesome way. The things Bradbury talks about in this book that should come as a shock are almost prophetic. I'm not suggesting that our world will come to the point of men burning books for a living any time soon, but it's kindof scary to think about the glimpses of some of these things (ex. TV &quot;families&quot;) that we are already beginning to see. I think that we should take this book as a warning not to let ourselves be so worried about being happy that we let ourselves be trapped in the kind of world Bradbury illustrates. This was an awesome book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"As a gifted student I deal with things relating to this book all the time. I have found that the school systems, in order to please everyone, find a way to mask stupidity and praise every child meaninglessly. In Farenheit 451 the lack of books is like the school system's mindless praise. There is nothing that displeases anyone. I find this classic novel a shockingly truthful account of the not-too-distant future. A must read book for anyone."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is really good because it offers a different perspective on life. Some of the things in the book are coming true already. For example as soon as my sister comes home from school she turns on the TV and watches talk shows and soap operas."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book was wonderful. Fahrenheit 451 is an great testiment to, not only the writing ability of Ray Bradbury, but also his ability to write in the future. It is an exemplary piece about the consequences of living without free speech and free thought. It's a creepy book that easily mimics our future society if we are suppressed. Absolutely fascinating. A philosophical and an exciting read!!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read Fahrenheit 451 in my English class, and the class is still reading it. I'm one of the few in my grade who understood it, but I'm not sure why. I thought it was a never-put-down novel, because Montag starts out loving to burn books, then a young girl (Clarisse, 17) sets him straight. He realizes all the work that has been done for the books to be written, so he starts working against the firemen, who burn the books. He gets caught with books, and his house is burnt. He is considered a fugitive, and at the end of the novel, there is a very exiting chase, to the death."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If you are younger than 16 this book is much more enjoyable when read as a group and commented for any doubts. Ray Bradbury leaves his message clear about what can happen if people keep censoring books because of upset minorities."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read this book in 8th grade as part of a requirement. I found the book to be excellently written and with an amazing plot line. You'll despise the hound while pondering Montag. I recommend this book for ANYONE who enjoys a bit of imagination."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a book that I highly recommend, particularly to today's youth,because I feel that the message is one very much needed in a society dominated by television. The book was a sort of prophesy by Bradbury in the 50's, warning Americans of what may happen to young minds today and in the future, if we allow television to blindly influence our lives and society. I view the &quot;families&quot; as the television, dangerous because it delivers suggestions to the brain, before one can approach it with analytical thought. Visual suggestions can alter your way of perceiving life if one doesn't approach it with question and analysis. Books, however, allow one to analyze and reason out ideas for themselves. This is a point clearly illustrated in Brabury's book, the importance of reading; the enhancers of free thought. Once again, I strongly recommend Fahrenheit 451 be read, particularly by the youth of the 90's and the millenium. This is definitely a book needed in our age of runaway technology."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A book you have to think about, and that makes you question society and the way you think."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"What a treat to re-read this book with the added bonus of the Coda at the end and the Conversation with Ray Bradbury.In my memory 451 was about book burning, but it is actually about the death of thinking and conversation and culture. Anyone who watches TV today knows we are certainly headed in that direction with the dumbed down shows and news casts. We are certainly not supposed to question authority. Our library checkouts and bookstore purchases can be monitored for daring to read outside the boundries of correctness.Dare to read this book and think about what Ray Bradbury foretold."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have to be honest and confess that my rating is really three stars + one star for the historic value. This is the novel that 7th grade English teachers across the US recommend to teach children the value of books-- I guess that that fact alone earns it a star.Bradbury creates a vision of a world where Firemen burn books when they're found instead of putting out fires. People have wall-sized interactive television which has taken the place of family life. Teenagers are encouraged to drive as quickly as possible when bored, and bearing children is officially nearly forbidden. One fireman, spurred on by a non-conformist neighbor, begins to question his task and becomes alive to the value in books.While some of the messages certainly are still relevant, the book is not as strong of an effort of other Bradbury novels. The tone and the heavy message focus date the book and tend to say more to someone interested in the concerns of the 50s then they really appeal to modern readers.Difficult not to recommend, all things considered, but don't expect too much."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ignore the people who claim this book is boring, horrible, or even offensive-this is one of the best books written, and paints a future that sometimes doesn't seem that far off. A book worth reading again and again."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In Ray Bradbury's Fahenheit 451, we get to look at a futuristic world where books are banned and reading is prohibited. The narrator is a firefighter named Montag and unlike the firefighters of out modern society the firefighters of Montag's world start fires to burn books as opposed to extingushing fires to help citizens. Through the novel, we see how the government controls society by watching the citizens everymove and controlling what they may see or hear by using their own propaganda. This can be seen through Montag's wife, who is a drug using zombie addicted to watching government TV twenty four hours a day. Montag eventually becomes a victim when becomes interested in the books he is hired to destroy, steals them and hides them in his home. Through Montag's experiences we get a close look at how individuals in his world have no control of their destiny. However, when it seems most bleak and Montag is close to being discovered, Bradbury introduces some savior like characters. Fleeing from the law, Montag finally discovers the Book People living in the forest. These people memorize books and then they repeat the book to others so that books will live on forever in their memory even though they are being destroyed by the government. Although Bradbury builds a complex plot, the message is simple, when a society tries to control peoples basic freedoms so that they can manipulate them with their own propaganda, its time to start heading for the woods."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, is a classic story of censorship, in an overprotective society. Stories are told of people's happiness, newly found after learning from the many banned works of classic authors such as Shakespeare. This distopic society uses feigned happiness to mask the true meaning of life. They are overwhelmed by external stimuli to prevent them from learning anything new from within.This is an excellent book, and I reccommend that anybody who has had any experience with censorship read this. Anybody who has already read Fahrenheit 451 should read it again, and again, to see how society has changed to, or away from this form."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury's classic is another look at how the world could be headed for literary distruction. In his own thoughts at the end of this novel he compares the actual burning of books to the figurative slow burning of books by abridging. He believes that every book should be left in it's original text as the auther so intended; every verb, adjective and comma.This book is a must read for all appreciaters of any type of literature. It reinforced my forgotten belief of a book's true value.So throw down that remote and pick up a good novel, unless of course there's a good episode of Seinfeld on ... or a good movie... and of course you have to watch the world series, and every other sports playoffs .... ahhhh forget books they take up to much time anyway.

But that was before Clarisse, before the books. No longer able to stay blissfully ignorant of the wrongs of the society around him and the misery of the people so engrossed in their technology, he begins his journey for knowledge. But how far is he willing to go?Ray Bradbury sobers us with the world he creates, leaving us to wonder - could our future be heading down the same path? With odd and many sided characters, such as Mildred who calls television actors her family during the day and downs sleeping pills at night, the book refuses to be put down.In his book, Bradbury proves that knowledge lives on long after it is created; even when the source is gone, things can still be remembered and often still ring true.Within a single novel, hard to find in this day and age, a story that transcends time is found, one where you hope and worry for the protagonist. Is there any chance of success against government as a whole and is rebellion and knowledge worth it? That's for you to decide after reading this book. For we are taught that, though knowledge sobers us, we must be sober to be ourselves.With an unpredictable ending and realism not found in most books today, you will regret it if you miss this book. But wait until you are ready to decipher it, because symbolism is found everywhere, from salamanders to people."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit was an interesting book to read. I am one who does not enjoy reading, but after seeing a roommate read the book I became interested. It has a good plot to it and it is not a very lengthy book. Because if this it makes for a very quick read and is great for those that do not have lots of time for reading. In the past I have read other dystopia novels such as 1984 and I did not enjoy them. I find them to be disturbing and rather boring to me. On the other hand I was able to keep focus while reading this book and I actually enjoyed it. It is good to finally read a dystopia novel that would not want to give me night terrors at night. I found the book to be helpful and made me think about what if these things were true in today's society. There are times when the book can be a little confusing and boring to read, but that is the same with any other book you will read. You just have to be patient and continue to read it through. Over all I thought this was an excellent book to read and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I am a 13-year-old girl in an Extended Projects Program English class, and so I read this book (because it was a classic, and that fulfilled the assignment). I think that this was a very futuristic and imaginative story, as other Bradbury creations. I would reccomend this book to any bright student who enjoys any type of books ranging from sci-fi to plain fiction, or anyone who just likes to read classics. I must admit that there were some facts and happenings in this book that I did not necessarily understand completely, or a line of events that seemed out of order or somewhat confusing. This is definitely not an easily interrupted book - one must have a long period of time on his hands to get through a few chapters. Overall, I recommend any of Bradbury's books to anyone with truly good taste in books. :-) Thank you for reading this On-line Review."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book epitomizes what is most wonderful about Bradbury's work; he tells fairly simple tales but they can also be explored for their depth of meaning. As we see in other books like &quot;Brave New World&quot;, the primary characters in &quot;Farenheit 451&quot; may appear to be naieve or even stupid, at times. But, one doesn't have to look very far or very hard to see examples of blind acceptance of ideas and leaders. To intelligent, critical minds, this acceptance is often ludicrous. Look back 60 or 70 years and you see a whole nation succumbing to stupid ideas - and 6 million people died.&quot;Farenheit 451&quot; is a prime example of what science fiction can often do better than any other type of fiction - give us parables or lessons of those things that are best and worst in ALL of us"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury tells a bizarre tale of a world were firemen burnbooks, books are banned, and vidio media rules.

All in all,a fine book, true to nature, and exciting."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"At age 41 and as a former college English major, this is perhaps an unusual book to have just read for the first time, especially since most people seem to get to it in high school. For some reason, this was not part of my high school's curriculum and it has evaded me until now. However, with Mr. Bradbury's recent passing and in his honor, I decided now was the time. This is a book that has fairly embedded itself in American popular culture so, despite not having read it and having seen bits and pieces of the 1966 film starring Oskar Werner, I was already familiar with its basic premise and themes. And as they say, the book is better than the movie!As is the case with great science fiction, it continues to be as relevant today as it was at the time of original publication. Especially relevant is Bradbury's emphasis on electronic media's usurpation of peoples' attention. Everyone has a \\"Wall\\" (i.e. big screen television) that spews mindless entertainment. Everyone interacts with a disembodied \\"family,\\" which might be like the Internet-based social networks of today. With the addiction to these media, people stop knowing or caring about what's going on around them to the point where they even begin to forget why they do what they do or even how they met their spouses. Superficial interactions supplant true human intimacy. Most significantly, they lose their capacity for critical thought because their society has promoted the idea that individualism leads to conflict and avoiding conflict is paramount even if it results in a society of conformists. Ignorance, as they say, is bliss. The irony is, while Americans may not be fighting amongst themselves, they are fighting with the rest of the world. Their abdication of critical thought keeps them placid and easily tractable, but provides no salvation.If you're trying to understand why you should read this book, the reason is basically this: It's a parable about what happens when people don't read at all."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Awesome book!

I was shocked hear of Ray's passing!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I bought this for my English 10 class and we used it to begin our reading. It matches the novel perfectly and allowed us to stop and discuss often!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, is a controversial book that takes place in the future. It revolves around a firefighter named Guy Montag, but is very unlike firefighters of our time. In Fahrenheit 451, the job of firefighters is to burn books and houses where they are kept, even if that means burning the people in the homes. The people of authority believe that books are bad for society because they cause conflict between groups of people. They also make people think more than necessary, which always causes trouble. Because of the censorship in society, the citizens have become no more than robots; the few people who refuse to conform are killed by the government. Montag finally sees the truth to the life that he has been blindly living for thirty years and decides that there is need for reform in society, and that he can help to change it.The main characters of this book are Montag, Mildred, Clarrise and Fire Captain Beatty. Montag is a fireman from the third generation that burns books. He is not often aware of the actions that he takes. But when he meets Clarisse he opens his eyes and starts to realize the true meaning of books and life. Mildred is Montag's sick wife. She is suicidal and her only life is with her fake \\"family\\" within the walls of her parlor. Mildred doesn't care about Montag, nor does she understand him. Clarisse is an intelligent and adventurous seventeen year old girl who becomes friends with Montag. She introduces him to the meaning and beauty of life. Clarisse is very different from other because she \\"ask's \`why' rather than \`how'\\". Captain Beatty is perhaps one of the most interesting characters of the story because he is the enlightened man who has given up because it is simply easier to lose than to fight.The main themes are censorship, ignorance, and redemption. Censorship is shown in destruction and fear because authoritative figures burn houses down that have books and other material that is harmful to the community; books, magazines, and anything that is educational that might cause someone to question the community that they live in. For example, the firefighters burned an elderly ladies' house because she questioned the community. The leadership is so corrupt that they end up burning the old lady as well because she wanted to stay with her books and they didn't feel like trying to get her to leave. Montag shows ignorance when Clarisse starts sharing her ideas with him and he thinks that she is crazy even though almost everything she says is completely true. Eventually he starts to question his own actions about burning houses. He redeems his ignorance by listening to her and finally by having a paradigm shift and fighting back against his own fellow firefighters and society's structure.One of the strengths of the book was a strong use of imagery. One example being what Montag said about his wife Mildred: \\"If only someone else's flesh and brain and memory. If only they could have taken her mind along to the dry cleaner's and emptied the pockets and steamed and cleansed it and reblocked it and brought it back in the morning.\\" In this small passage you could imagine the picture your head and live the scene. Ray Bradbury used strong imagery to enhance the story and make it seem more real. Another strength of the book is the use of symbols, such as Montag, which is the name of a paper manufacturer. Some of the weaknesses are that some of the characters, mainly Mildred and Clarrise, did not play a big enough role in the story. They made short appearances and then left or died, but they were two of the most interesting characters. One final weakness of this story was that the end came so suddenly and it felt as though we had been ripped off because the whole story led up to an unexciting end. In conclusion, the book was a good book it was very interesting and had some meaning in it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Timeless work on a futuristic society completely and utterly ignorant of any reality except their corporate jingles, giant TV's, and fake families. A look into a shallow desensitized self censored society where intellectuals are targeted as criminals, books are outlawed, and those who refuse to submit are tracked down by the mechanical hound.Fahrenheit 451 is a frightening look inside of a corporate dystopian hell where there is no \`We the People' just \`we the market' and the State is omnipotent. Out on the fringes of the state's control remains a remnant of society, mostly hobos, who are dedicated to preserving the words that many will never read. A classic example when people stop thinking for themselves."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's story of how he wrote this genius book in the UCLA basement on a manual typewriter at 10-cents an hour is such a perfect start. The nine days in dimes that he spent came to so much good. This is a classic because it is science-fiction that predicts our world today. If you look closely, you'll see ipods and cell phones and flatscreen TVs in Bradbury's artistic vision. The message is obvious but insidious. We know that books are the knowledge of our anscestors, that writing is ideas and that without them we would be vapid, yet we still don't actually get it. Bradbury has created a world with evil every bit as tempting as our own, then turns it all around into a greater good. It's magic!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The reviewer who said there are frightening similarities between the book and what we see happening today is bang on the money.I first read the book in highschool, then reread it several times when I became an adult. I hope they still give this book to high school students to read. It's written clearly and cleanly and is easily digestible. Much like brave new world, we should be shocked at the society portrayed in the book. But if you look carefully around you we are more like that society that we care to admit. I have a friend, a university grad, who refuses to read any books because she thinks they are geeky and dry. She prefers the world of TV and glossy magazines with few words. How different is she from the main characters wife?It's an excellent book you will read quickly but think about for ever."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It's hard to write a review for this book that is different from all of the others.All I can say is this is a classic story of censorship and and government intrusion in our lives. This is the 50th anniversary edition and I really enjoyed the author notes in the back. Over the years, Ray had been asked by many people asking to modify his work so it's slightly less offensive, something specifically talked about in this book!Certainly makes you think."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"What would it be like to live in a world where firemen go around burning books to \\"protect\\" citizens from thinking? What book would you be if you could be a book? This is one of my favorite thought-provoking dystopias about freedom of the press. A companion book for discussion could be God's Smuggler which talks about smuggling Bibles (a forbidden book) behind the Iron Curtain. Both books are age appropriate for teens and adults."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I just finished reading this book for the third time and it simply gets better with age, like a vintage wine. How can we picture a world where there are no books, particularly novels?Like most of us on Amazon, I'm a voracious reader and have been since I was in elementary school. Books transport us to another world and allow us to have insight into lives, situations other countries that we may never otherwise experience. Good books pose tough questions about ethics, coping with adversity, and dealing with loss, sorrow or facing hard choices -- for example, Sophie's Choice, when she had to choose between which one of her children she would save from the Nazis.When I was 19 and I first read this book, I thought it was just about banning books. I didn't fully comprehend the depth of mind control that would be involved in restricting information, and consequently creating a reality that is so sanitized that it bears no resemblance to real life. No wonder people were glued to the flatscreen TVs and hooked on mood altering substances to get through the day.As always, Ray Bradbury does a fantastic job of making us think long and hard after we put this book down. The video version is also quite good, but I sometimes had trouble making out people's accents, and it was created in the days before subtitles were available. Altogether, a terrific read that bears rereading over the decades."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is set in a dystopian society that any book-lover would loathe. Firemen don't put out fires, they start them. They burn books, all books, for the safety of society. Guy is a fireman who is content with the world around him, until he starts reading a contraband books.Censorship, freedom of speech and the idea that knowledge is dangerous are at the forefront of this novel. Even today, people are still banning books and trying to stop certain ideas from infecting the minds of the populace. The books relevance has clearly stood the test of time, but perhaps that's more a problem with society than praise for this book.While the premise is scary and all too possible, the writing itself is dull. Fahrenheit 451 is a short book full of description. In this case, being overly descriptive isn't a good thing. The wording is choppy and the only time you can really get into the flow of the book is when Bradbury goes on a rambling tangent.The concept is sure to outrage and book-lovers will easily become enthralled with Guy as he embraces the knowledge and power books provide. Fahrenheit 451 is a good book, but it is written in a way that aggravating and distracting. I don't think it deserves the gushing praise that's heaped upon it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read this book for the first time when I was probably 13 and I have loved it every since.

A book everyone should read. I can't wait to have my daughter read it in a few years!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is one of the most famous works of science fiction, and with \\"Brave New World\\" and \\"1984\\" represents one of the most memorable and haunting dystopias. In a future world, books are banned and firemen actually set fires instead of extinguishing them. The state exercises a form of social control through controlling what sort of information people have access to. It turns out that not all books are banned, only those that we would today consider \\"great works\\" - Plato, Shakespeare, The Bible, Darwin, etc. For me one of the biggest surprises about Fahrenheit 451 was the rationale that was offered for the burning of those books. In a nutshell, they offended politically correct sensibilities and the authorities felt that they would undermine the social cohesion. This expunging of the classics from the culture has an uncanny resonance with the attempts over past few decades to expunge them from the undergraduate liberal arts curriculum. And rationale is also similar: these books are not \\"diverse\\" enough and may offend the sensibilities of an ever-increasing list of \\"minorities.\\" It is hard not to wonder if a milder, softer version of dystopian future that Bradbury was worried about in the early 1950s has not in fact arrived.Bradbury's writing and ideas are somewhere between those of George Orwell and Philip K. Dick. His style is very engaging, and even poetic. His writing is at its best when one of his characters engages in a prolonged monolog. However, the plot development could use some improvement. There is very little in terms of transition from one scene to the next, and most scenes are overly compressed. It is very hard to follow the plot developments at times. Nonetheless, Bradbury is a wonderful stylist and unlike much of science fiction this book is a pleasure to read on a purely literally level as well as for its sweeping ideas.As a last note, I found it incredibly ironic that I read this book on Kindle. Based on this alone I am fairly optimistic that reading and great books will not only survive but in fact thrive well into the 21st century."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Wonderful story.

I have read this book in hardback, and it is a very good book by Ray Bradbury."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Simply put, society has always been caught up in the pursuit of happiness. And after so much time, we of the modern world have almost achieved it. The only thing that holds us back is the incessant racket caused by thinkers, and all the time we spend pondering their works, to gain no \\"fun\\" out of it all! Better than, that we ignore {or even burn!} their holier-than-thou books and live blissfully in our ignorance {or should we say pure euphoria?}. Analyzation and thought have only ever given us misery...That Bradbury can create a world so perfectly grasped by this reasoning is an incredible literary feet. This argument has slithered into every mind to the point where you can hardly resist believing it yourself as the novel seamlessly flows from page to page.Guy Montag himself composes the perfect vessel through which to traverse Fahrenheit 451's future. He is wracked with doubts and utterly shaken by his fears... that he is the only person in the entire world who notices its paramount shift towards the abandonment of all the lessons we have learned. Bradbury's writing style impeccably mirrors Montag's convoluted thoughts, his words whipping back and forth along every end of the emotional spectrum, capturing every nuance of Montag's terror, rage, anguish, and sheer morbid indifference to his environs......Those environs that perfectly mirror the [...] of our society. At first glance the book might take place in the modern America in which it was written, building a sense of unconscious connection with the reader... A connection which is soon brutally shattered by the seamless integration of nightmarish facets of our [...]: from fire men who \\"protect\\" with kerosene and a match to massive atomic wars constantly shattering the sky. The way these are injected into the story makes them seem almost fitting, as if our society has already fallen so much as to welcome such things. This cruel betrayal of the reader's thoughts is a powerful wake-up call, and will stir strong emotions within you.Fahrenheit 451 is an unbelievable journey through the future. The world conjured up by the work is as perfectly woven as it is terrifying. Its extreme and twisted inhabitants guide you briskly through the tale, and convincingly complete one of the greatest books I have ever read!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Read this book years ago but in having a conversation with my friend's 16-year-old nephew, i thought i would hope on and give a review to a profoundly impactful book. i tossed bradbury my friend's nephew's way when i heard it was not required reading (i read in high school). the reason being: \\"it's too controversial\\" how sad and yet indicative of the very issues bradbury warns us of in his book. having survived the embarassment of the bush admin. and the perversions to thought and liberty (issues bradbury writes on)i can only hope this book experiences a resurgence in class room reading lists."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"While some authors may have ruined this book by hammering the central theme of the novel with hackneyed phrases and over the top situations, Bradbury succeeds in twisting a tale that manages to nudge the reader towards his point of view.

We have to be allowed to think for ourselves, not told what we should think."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"\\"The whole culture's shot through. The skeleton needs melting and reshaping. Good God, it isn't just as simple as picking up a book you laid down half a century ago. Remember, the firemen are rarely necessary. The public itself stopped reading of its own accord.\\"--Faber to Montag in Fahrenheit 451Montag is a fireman, but not in the sense we understand. In Bradbury's bleak vision of the future, houses are fireproof, freeing firemen from their traditional roles. Instead, firemen burn books, which have been banned by an oppressive government. A fireman for ten years, Montag takes great pride in his work, but has always harbored curiosity about the objects he destroys.Montag's life is changed by a chance meeting with his new neighbor, a young girl named Clarisse. At the end of their initial encounter, Clarisse asks him if he's happy. The question reverberates in Montag's consciousness, causing him to question his ideas and attitudes, especially on the subject of books. Simply put, Montag's life and psyche are transformed by an idea. At novel's end, he has become a fugitive from justice, but he's happier than he has ever been, for he has discovered the power of the written word.Bradbury's classic novel has only improved with age. Reading the book, you have to be impressed by his prescience in predicting the advent of political correctness, teen violence, the ascendancy of television, the sound bite, and the general decline of our society. You'll also be impressed by his economy with words--in less than 200 pages, Bradbury conveys a powerful, moving message about overwhelming social problems. If you have read it before, it's time to reread it. If you've not yet had the pleasure, you'll get to enjoy a sublime reading experience."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is such a classic, and sadly, I had never read it. Now that I have, I can see why it's a classic and can see why it will always remain one and remain relevant. This was a very powerful book. Picture a world engaged in war, a world full of censorship, a world where there is no speed limit, a world where people do not engage with each other, but rather engage with the walls. This is the world that Ray Bradbury has created in Fahrenheit 451.451 is the number that the firemen wear on their uniforms. The jobs of the firemen are not to put out fires, but rather, start them. Books are banned in Bradbury's world. Books are seen as not real, silly, impersonal, influential, propaganda and will not be tolerated by the government. So it is that the job of the firemen is to burn every book in existence and to imprison the owner of the books. Quite a scary thing. One of the firemen, Montag (the central character) has kept some books of his own. Upon reading them, he finds that books should exist, and you can see the dilemma that this could cause. That's all I'll say so as not to ruin the story for those who have never read this.This is also my first Bradbury work, and I'm very happy that I've finally discovered him. He is Orson Scott Card's favorite author, so I figured he had to be a pretty damn good writer...and he is! I look forward to reading more of his work. I have Something Wicked This Way Comes sitting on my shelf, so that'll be the next Bradbury. I also have a short story by the name of The Homecoming illustrated by Dave McKean.It's very ironic that this book has been banned seeing as the book is about books being banned and censorship. My thoughts on why it may be banned is because of Montag's challenge of authority. This is shown as a good thing in this book and he is the hero, and it's generally not well taken in our society when one goes up against the government or any form of authority. I think it's ridiculous to ban this book though. This book speaks volumes about power in the wrong hands, ignorance, and many other themes that I could go on forever about. Bottom line is that this is a wonderful book and although it has been banned in some places, I'm glad to see that it is required reading in so many other places."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The reason I chose to read Fahrenheit 451 was because my teachers and my group chose it for me.. It wasn't a book I knew much about in the beginning. Some of my peers and friends throughout my school had already read it and the reviews by them would have probably been a bit more harsh than mine. Despite persuasion and influence by my peers, I still think it is an excellent book that is definitely worth reading. After I finished Fahrenheit 451 I discovered it is a very controversial and inspirational book.It's a book that is understandably controversial. It didn't surprise me that it was. The book is based around a main character named Guy Montag who was a fireman but not just your normal fireman. Firemen in this book actually make fires. They make fires to burn books. The society in Fahrenheit 451 believes that books are wrong. They think that it is filling your brain with nonsense. A lot of characters in this book aren't very intellectual; they don't have very deep thoughts, and seem to all have a very short attention span. This was the same for Montag until a teenage girl named Clarisse comes into his life. Clarisse is a deep thinking character that had a great influence on Montag. Montag was persuaded to question everything including his job of burning books, which he never had a problem with before. He realizes the truth about books and about being intellectual. He decides to take actionn.This book is not an easy read in my opinion. It uses a lot of rhetoric throughout the book. It contains many metaphors and a lot of the times the sections you are reading mean much more than what it might appear. I had to read these parts several times to understand them. It's not a book that you can skim or really read in one night with ease. It really causes the reader to think. It really helped that it was a group project in my class. That way I could get someone else's opinion on what a certain section really meant or I could get someone else to explain it to me in a better way than I could explain it to myself. It's a really superb book if the reader has someone to discuss the book with and here other opinions to influence the reader's opinions on what a section or area really means.Fahrenheit 451 is a very interesting, inspirational, and controversial book. It shows how a character changes from calling out other people for \\"thinking to many things\\" to a character that is very intellectual and begins to go into deep thoughts such as \\"The sun burnt every day. It burnt Time . . . Time was busy burning the years and the people anyway, without any help from him. So if he burnt things with the firemen and the sun burnt Time, that meant that everything burnt!\\" This quote proves how Montag progresses through the book but it also shows how the book can be analyzed to get a better understanding of the book. Overall this is an exceptional book. It isn't a book anyone should read if they do not have the time, because of this I would recommend buying it to allow the reader to have unlimited time to read and analyze every aspect of the book. It is an inspirational and controversial book about many meanings, such as censorship and rising against unjust leadership and despite Fahrenheit 451 being a difficult book to read, I would still recommend it give it four out of five stars."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is a frightful vision of what the future may have in store for us. The novel follows a fireman, not just any ordinary fireman that puts out fires and rescues people. This fireman, Guy Montag, creates fires. They are required by law to destroy all books and the houses that contain the books. Weird, I know! Montag's society believes books bring harm and destruction to people mentally and even physically. However, Guy soon begins to realize that all the ideas he once believed in were all morally incorrect and he begins to embark on a quest to cease this destruction and find true meaning in himself and in society.I chose this book for an independent reading assignment for school and I first thought, \\"Wow, this is gunna suck!\\" However, like they always say dont judge a book by its cover. This novel gave way to a new way of thinking about how the future may end up. It was realistic and I guess that's why I enjoyed it. I do recommend this book to anyone that likes easy reading and realistic fiction, though I dont recommend doing four seperate essays afterword for a test grade!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is just a short review of the audio book of this great classic read by the author. The rendition is just terrible. It may be interesting to listen to the author's voice, but he is clearly no professional reader (and of course he should not expected to be!!), his voice is hoarse, and the rendition overall very very unpleasant to listen to, to the point that I ended up stopping listening to the CDs after a short while. I love audio books, but this one cannot be recommended at all, unless you have a special interest in getting acquainted with Bradbury's voice. If you want to listen to a good author who's also an accomplished reader of his own stories, try Neil Gaiman!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a read rich with a delicious story and social commentary. Guy Montag lives in a world made ironic because of the stark contrast to the way we wish our society was today. Firemen don't keep people safe from fires, they bust into houses starting fires. Scholars and professors live on the outside of society because of their love for books, philosophy, and sociology where in our world professors are on the inside and the ignorant majority are on the outside because of their lack of interest for the said disciplines.Literature is correctly portrayed by the leaders of Montag's twisted Earth as a tool that helps people keep in touch with their government and the reality of the world in which they live. This realization by the government lead to a life in which people are encouraged to live \`within' the television. Not literally within the television, but completely enamored by a world of entertainment, visual images, and trivial information symbolized by the television. I have a feeling this society isn't hooked to the Discovery Channel.Some go as far as to suggest that our world today is headed towards being like the world of Fahrenheit 451. The explosion of television, fashion, cinema, video games, and the internet certainly suggest that our society is very much interested in entertainment, and probably at the expense of intuitive thought. However entertainment is not a crime, as we all enjoy being entertained. The publishing business is thriving, and so are newspapers, blogs, and other sources of text. It will be interesting to see how far our Earth will progress towards the world of Fahrenheit 451."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I was at the Foreign Language Bookstore on Yanan Road here in Hangzhou when I saw this classic on the shelf. Would you believe I'd never read it? We read some Bradbury in school about 25 or 30 years ago, and he didn't make much of an impression on me. I can't remember why. But knowing the fault could've been mine, I gave him another shot. Books are cheap here, and hey, it's famous, right?Well, folks, it's famous for a damn good reason. Many, in fact. Fifty years old, and it is perhaps more relevant than ever. But so what? Is it good writing? Does it entertain? Does it have real characters? Is it more than just an oh-so-correct theme dressed up as a novel? Oh, yes it is! It's absolutely fantastic and I just plain can't recommend it enough.If you love sci-fi, great. If not, it doesn't matter. I can say \\"transcends the genre\\" with a straight face. Yes I can. I'll be reading this one again, folks. I didn't write it and I'm just sick with jealousy about it, okay?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit gives me a new appreciation of future based plots, it tells of a futuristic world where people have no love of art or creativity, and their lives consist mostly of TV viewing and speeding. Guy Montag, is a firefighter in this strange world, and instead of putting out fires, his job is to start them and to burn all books because they are not wanted because of how they make people think and consider things. This puts us in a place of a heartless society that is, in many ways, like our modern day society.The book is written in an eerie manner that makes you feel uncomfortable about the art deprived world that is being portrayed from the book, which is entirely a good thing. When Montag comes to realize that the world he lives in and the world he has been destroying could be a great place, he decides to stop his work and attempt to create a better world. He finds himself heading through a well detailed journey to create a world with free spirits rather than ignorant drones. The writing of the book is not cryptic however it still has a lost and ghostly feel to it, that really makes you think about our modern day society. For a book written in the 1950's, the idea still applies to today and how our society is in ways heading towards the deprived society that is portrayed in Fahrenheit 451. Bradbury creates a timeless point of how reading, art, and nature are the most important elements of someone's life."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I usually don't like books that look into the future, but Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury is an exception to this. I like how the author vividly describes the future. He makes you feel like you are there when the firefighters light the houses on fire. Firefighters of the future don't put out fires but start fires.People of the future wanted to only be happy. They felt that books make you sad and weren't real. Books were made illegal and if you were caught with a book your house was burned and you were put in jail or burned with the house. I like the main character, Guy Montag. Montag is a firefighter with the numbers 451 on his helmet. He takes great pleasure in seeing the bright orange flames that engulf the books and the house were the books were found. The smell, the excitement is all that he needs to be happy. That is until the day he meets up with the \\"crazy girl\\".The story gets more interesting when he listens to the girl who asks too many questions and she was curious about everything. She opened his eyes to other things around him and he is amused by her curiosity. He becomes more interested in books the day when the old lady gets burned in her house. Montag tries to get her out but all she does is chant about books she has read. She makes him realize that books must be important if she was willing to end her life for them. Then a book falls into his hands and a page opens and he reads a few lines. This is the beginning of his interest of books. He wants to learn more and read more but it would be suicide. He's willing to take the chance.I recommend this book because it has a different perspective of the future. It is very interesting and exciting. Some parts are a little slow but once you get past those the rest is good. There is an unexpected twist at the end that adds to the book. Fahrenheit 451 makes you stop and think about the impact that books have on our lives."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"What makes an excellent story? Many people have their own thoughts and opinions on this subject. But, what makes a book a bestseller? How does Romeo and Juliet, Animal Farm, Lord of the Flies, and other legendary titles sell? Some of the reasons might be that the titles makes the reader comprehend their thoughts. Another reason could be that the story might make the reader gain knowledge of a life lessons or it might just make the reader emotional towards the story. Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury does all three of those things. Fahrenheit 451 is a tremendous read because it makes the reader comprehend their thought about the consequences of their actions, gain knowledge about life lessons on how to be human, and makes the reader feel emotion through out the story.Bradbury does a superior job in his book Fahrenheit 451 on making the reader think through their thoughts about the actions they take through out life. He introduces a confused and semi-depressed main character into his book named Guy Montag. Guy works for fire department in future America not putting out fire, but making fire to burn books. Right away one sees that Guy is not satisfied with his life at all. He is very puzzled about where he should go in life. Guy sees the pain and agony he brings to people because of his job. One day when he burns a women who would rather be burned with her books then die without them, Guy begins to reflect on why does he do what he does. The reader also starts to think about ones actions towards life. The reader begin to see that Guy has made the wrong choice in becoming a firefighter for it brings to much pain towards others and himself. The viewing of Guy's unhappiness forces the reader think about how ones own actions affect not only other people but one's self too. Seeing how one's actions affect one's self and other people is not the only thing that Fahrenheit 451 shows, it also show simply how to be human.Reading through out the book the reader sees that Guy has tons of choices to make. Guy seeing that since people are prepared to die for their books there has to be something amazingly special about them. Guy starts to hide books for future reading. He has a choice to make. He can read the book and jeopardize his life or he can keep on living depressed, with out looking for answers on how to get better. He makes the choice to read the books so he might learn how to live. The reader can see that Guy made the choice to be human, to risk his life so that he might live life to the fullest. The reader picks up that in order to live life too, one will have to take risks also. Guy finds that poetry helps him become less angry and irritated when he reads it. Not everyone in his life thinks the same things. His wife and her friends think that literature is pointless and when he reads it to them, some go to complain. Through this the reader can see that making the right choice to live like one thinks a human should live doesn't always agree with everyone. The reader starts to feel emotion for Guy. What should guy do about this situation? The book does another victories job on making the reader feel for the book and the outcome.Bradbury hooks the reader into the story by forcing one to be emotionally attached to the story. Guy is a character that everyone feels for because somehow one can relate to him. One can relate to Guy by knowing how hard it is to make risky choices, being depressed about life, having a job, or even not knowing what to do about certain situations. Guy has gone through all of those situations and more. After Guy's wife's friends turns him in, he goes back to his job and burns the book he was reading. Right after that the firemen gets called to go out to burn books. Guy finds out that he has to burn his own house. Guy can't stand this fact and kills the firemen and escapes from the law. The reader starts to get even more emotionally attached to the book by the suspension of if Guy will get caught or not. The book does a stupendous job of keeping the reader in the story the whole time. This is the best reason for why the book is not just a ordinary book but fanatic tale of a man who chooses to live rather then to die.From getting emotionally evolved with the book, to learning how to be human, and even making the reader comprehend their actions, Fahrenheit 451 is an extraordinary book. The novel desires not only to be on being on the bestseller list of all time but deserves to be on every shelf of every house. For this book is not just a book but a masterpiece of art."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I taught &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; as the example of a dsytopian novel in my Science Fiction class, although it is certainly one of the most atypical of that particular type of narrative discourse. Compared to such heavyweight examples as George Orwell's &quot;1984,&quot; Aldous Huxley's &quot;Brave New World,&quot; Yevgeny Zamiatin's &quot;We,&quot; Ray Bradbury's imaginative meditation on censorship seems like light reading. But the delicious irony of a world in which firemen start fires remains postent and the idea of people memorizing books so they will be preserved for future generations is compelling. Of course, there have been more documented cases of &quot;book burning,&quot; albeit in less literal forms, since &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; was first published in 1953, so an argument can be made that while all the public debate was over how close we were the Orwellian future envisioned in &quot;1984,&quot; it is Bradbury's little parable that may well be more realistic (especially in terms of the effects of television).The novel is based on a short story, &quot;The Fireman,&quot; that Bradbury published in &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; in 1951 and then expanded into &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; two years later. However, those who have studied Bradbury's writings caw trace key elements back to a 1948 story &quot;Pillar of Fire&quot; and the &quot;Usher II&quot; story from his 1950 work &quot;The Martian Chronicles.&quot; Beyond that, there is the historical record of the Nazis burning books in 1933. The story is of a future world in which everyone understands that books are for burning, along with the houses in which they were hidden. Guy Montage is a fireman who has been happy in his work for ten years, but suddenly finds himself asking questions when he meets a teenage girl and an old professor.&quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; is not only about censorship, but also about the inherent tension in advanced societies between knowledge and ignorance. Reading this novel again I am reminded about Pat Paulsen's editorial on the old &quot;Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; (a series well acquainted with the perils of censorship) about how we might enjoy freedom of speech in this country but we do not enjoy freedom of hearing because &quot;there is always the danger of something being said.&quot; Censorship, in practical terms, is the effort of those who do not want others to hear what they find offensive, for whatever reasons, basically because it leads to people thinking thoughts they do not want them to be thinking. Through the rambling diatribes of Captain Beatty, Bradbury makes this point quite clear to his readers.Even though this is essentially a novella, Bradbury's work retains the charm of a short story. The recurring use of animal imagery throughout the story, the use of the mythic ideas of the salamander and the phoenix, make &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; more poetic than any other dystopian work. Even if it is predominantly a one note argument regarding censorship, it is impossible to deny that Bradbury makes a clear and convincing case for his position. Besides, there is something to be said for any work that insures that beyond the point at which water freezes the only other recognizable number on the Fahrenheit scale is the point at which book paper starts to burn."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It's true: A lot of what Bradbury predicted for us when he wrote his classic Fahrenheit 451 about 50 years ago is becoming more and more eminent in today's world. Scary, yes?Books are on the decline, especially in our younger generation. Although a total ban/burning seems a little farfetched and unlikely, it is possible the public will lose interest in books year after year until there are no books being bought anymore... a sad day that will be.People are relying more and more on TV and other forms of &quot;entertainment&quot; ... some are filling, but most are rather empty. Are we destined to become mindless and frivolous like Mildred and Co.? If we keep on going at this rate, yes.&quot;Cliffsnotes&quot;, although they seem innocent enough, are on the rise. You can see cliffsnotes *replace* the good ol' classics in the classroom today, unfortunately (&quot;learn this classic in five minutes!!&quot;) A lot of today's kids are missing out on the great classics by reading only the material that leaves no room for their own personal interpretation...Children are killing each other, as Clarisse points out (&quot;I'm afraid of children my own age. They kill each other.&quot;) We have our fair share of adolescents murdering their own peers in the . How would Bradbury have known?Seashell radios - aka cd players, perhaps? People don't listen anymore because they're immersed in their own world of music. Not a good thing.All these (and more) got my eyebrow raising. Books that open your eyes and mind are rare gems. Although Bradbury's style might take some time to get used to - it took me a ton of rereadings and highlights to understand - this is very riveting, and I recommend picking up this book. Like my teacher said, your mind will not think the same after reading this classic."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have owned this book for a very long time and have read it more than once. In this day of computers and a near-paperless society, it would be tragic indeed if, for some reason, books were not only banned, but special &quot;fireman&quot; would come to collect and burn them, not to mention the prosecution and punishment of the book-loving individual. This work by Bradbury is among my other favorite sci-fi works, old and new: &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, &quot;Puppet Masters&quot;, &quot;Foundation&quot;, &quot;2001&quot;, &quot;2010&quot;, &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot;, &quot;Ringworld&quot;, all the &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot; books, as well as books as new to the genre as &quot;Advent of the Corps&quot; and others."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 was a good book. There were some good aspects but also a few bad. The first aspect of the novel is how futuristic it is. It was hard to follow in some places. One example is &quot;And the uncles, the aunts, the cousins, the nieces, the nephews, that lived in those walls,&quot; (pg. 44). This is talking about a tv family that Mildred watches but she talks about them like they are her real family.Also Bradbury discribes some things in a way that is difficult to understand. For example, when he describes the stomach pump used on Mildred, &quot;One of them slid down into your stomach like a black cobra down an echoing well looking for all the old water and the old time gathered there. It drank up the green matter that flowed to the top in a slow boil&quot; (pg. 14). This was hard to understand. I had to look at Sparknotes to figure out what he was talking about in some of the parts.Bradbury is very descriptive, which allows you to picture the novel while you read. &quot;With the brass nozzle in his fists, with this great python spitting its venomous kerosene upon the world, the blood pounded in his head and his hands were the hands of some amazing conductor playing all the symphonies of blazing and burning to bring down the tatters and charcoal ruins of history,&quot; (pg. 3). This really describes how he burns books in great detail. You can picture it in your mind what he is doing and how he is doing it.&quot;Her head was half bent to watch her shoes stir the circling leaves. Her face was slender and milk-white,and in it was a kind of gentle hunger that touched over everything with tireless curiosity. It was a look, almost, of pale surprise; the dark eyes were so fixed to the world that no move escaped them. Her dress was white and it whispered,&quot; (pg. 5). This shows how he describes his characters in great detail. He uses character developement so that you get a feeling for all of the characters. He also doesn't have so many characters that you get lost.The book as a whole is very good. The meaning behind it about the society could happen in the future. One day society could get as bad as it is in Fahrenheit 451. They tried to make everyone happy but there was still war and death which make people sad. They were hiding people from the truth of the world by not letting them read books. I think this is a good book and I would recommend it; just be aware of how futuristic it is."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"When I first began to read the book I was excited at the idea of a fireman's job was to burn books, not read them. As I read more I realized that this is what is happening to today's society but not to the same level of watching TV and not reading as much. People watch more TV than ever before and read less. You can ask anyone about any TV show and they probably have seen it. Reading books has become a inferior form of entertainment since the invention of TV and radios and other forms of entertainment.Montag, the main character in Fahrenheit 451, is a fireman who doesn't any longer put out fires, but starts the fires. The job of the fireman is to burn all books because they are illegal and not wanted in society. People have turned to wall TV's or parlor walls and seashell radios that fit in your ear for entertainment and pleasure and enjoyment so they don't have to have feelings and choose between right and wrong. People no longer care about their government or even their on children. Montag thinks that everyone is happy with their chosen society but he meets a girl named Clarisse who is a teenager that moved in next door to him. She talks to Montag about what firemen used to do and Montag couldn't believe what she was telling him. She asked him questions that made him think which he didn't like. She confused him but he listened to what she had to say and walked home from work with her everyday.A few things that changed Montag's views of their so called happy society was when he found his wife lying on her bed having overdosed on her sleeping pills which could have killed her. These men came in to help her by cleaning out her stomach and purifying her blood stream and then they were on their way. Montag realized that this was an everyday event for these men and many people have tried this suicide attempt. Montag understands that the people may enjoy their entertainment but they are still unhappy. He and his wife were even unhappy and he was going to change this. A second reason was when they were called on duty to burn some old ladies books. The police usually would come and arrest the person committing the crimes but they had not come yet and the old lady wouldn't let them burn her books. The firemen covered the illegal books in kerosene and the lady actually lit the match that burnt her and her house down because she didn't want to live without her books. Montag didn't understand why someone would die for their books. What was so good about them? He got fired from his job for having books and ran away to try to change society. He met up with other men who used to be professors at a college and they decided to leave their city and try to start again somewhere else. As they left a bomb was dropped on their city and they saw the remains of the city and turned around to go and start their new society.I really liked this book because I can relate to it. People in our society are reading less and enjoy the entertainment of television and radios just having fun in life. I don't think it will ever get as extreme as written in the novel but is closely related to it. I really enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I thought that Fahrenheit 451 was an ok book at best. I did think that the plot was very creative, but very far-fetched at the same time. While the fact that I am not a big fan of fiction books that stretch the truth may have some say in my decision, I was still disappointed with other things. I thought that the author did a poor job of mixing up his vocabulary as well as using very little detail to describe things. If the author wants to write a book about the future, he needs to do a good job of telling us what he wants or thinks it will be like. I had heard a lot of good things about this book and that is the reason I decided to read it. In the end I was very disappointed with the book and wouldn't recommend it to most people. There were some things in the book that I enjoyed though such as certain quotes. Here is one quote that I enjoyed: \\"Only the \`family' is people.\\"(Page 84). I believe that this means that only people are real, books are not.So in conclusion, I believe that those people who get into crazy future books may enjoy it, but I personally was disappointed. My expectations may have been too high, but either way its only my opinion."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A book to sit side by side with '1984' and 'Brave New World,' Bradbury's classic on censorship is less bleak in execution than 1984 and more focused than 'Brave New World,' resulting in a thoroughly readable tome that remains as relevant today as it was years ago. Not as good as '1984,' nor as overrated as 'Brave New World,' F451 is a pleasing mix of warning, cynicism, and pure future paranoia. Very nice.As always with Bradbury, expect a steady pacing to his prose with an almost melodic rhythm. Bradbury reads well, especially aloud, and rewards readers who allow themselves to sink into the pace of the book.You'll note, 9 out of 10 bad reviews of this book on Amazon come from disgruntled high school students who found Bradbury's phrasings too unwieldy or the story to be too &quot;slow.&quot; (i.e., not action-packed enough). Not unexpected, and rather ironic, when looked at from a certain point of view, as these narrow-minded children would live quite well in Bradbury's fictional future. Bradbury's warnings ring true.Bradbury readers should pick this up without pause. Those who enjoy bleak stories of potential futures, too, should explore this important work."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"... and this one also ended there. Compared to Orwell's 1984 and similar works, this novel is teen romance. It light-heartedly bounds through what it likes to think is a dark future. With all respect to the esteemed Mr. Bradbury, it reads more like Futurama.Aldous Huxley and George Orwell both cover this subject in much greater detail and provide a deeper sense of the darkness of our future. The themes of ignorance, gleeful mass-media mesmerism and inner conflict are better represented in their works.If you understand doublespeak, give this one a miss. It's double-plus-ungood."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury...all I can think of is hard to believe, boring, and extremely hard to follow. This story takes place in a place that is supposed to be in the future where books are restricted and illegal. Firemen did not go to set out fires, but to light books on fire. The main character of this story is Guy Montag, who is a fireman. He becomes friends with an odd girl named Clarisse. She changes his mind about his job and how life should really be. Television is more important than family in this story, and Montag's wife, Millie, refers to the people in the television as her \`family'. This book was very original and out of the blue and also creative. Ray Bradbury's writing style was very interesting. He used a lot of skilled vocabulary that was confusing, and the whole book was like a jumble of words that were hard to understand. Some of the ideas in the book did not really pertain to the book's plot. I would definitely not recommend this book to anyone below the seventh grade. I am a seventh grader in Massachusetts and I hated this book. I didn't like it because it was so boring and it goes really slow. Fahrenheit 451 is this kind of book that makes you feel like reading it was a whole waste of time because it was so boring and pointless. I would recommend this though to people above the seventh grade who like science fiction book. If not, this book is not recommended at all by me."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I believe this book to be completely and inutterably crazy. I dislike it because of its content. Honestly i have read a lot more interesting books. Slowly i start to understand it but barely. Choice of words is what i believe to not be good. I think the story would be and entirely different book if Ray Bradbury would have chosen maybe some words and word phrases that children might understand better.

One of the most un-realistic ideas i've ever heard. First off, everyone in the country is an idiot. Second, that includes the hero. Third, even those who have minds of their own have no intellegence.

By page 3 of the novel, however, I knew this was not a book I would enjoy. While it's a frightening, though thought-provoking look at the way society could become, it was extremely badly written. Bradbury goes on and on for pages of nonsense, and his words leave you with no more enlightenment than you had 50 pages ago. He uses redundant adjectives, and pointless sentences. I was especially annoyed when he would go &quot;inside&quot; Mr. Montag's thoughts and repeat the same meaningless phrases over and over again. I wouldn't recommend this book to a single person, and my condolances to any other student forced to waste their time on this. Fahrenheit 451 is one of the few books I would gladly toss in the fire."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I picked up this book because I had absoutely loved Huxley's Brave New World and Orwell's 1984. I thought I would like this book, considering its subject matter. I was completely wrong. Those that compared this to the other two masterpieces, failed to note one thing: Whereas the other two are written in haunting, intense, breathlessly engaging style, this book is in comparison rather choppy in its language. If the language style was not so dry, maybe I would have enjoyed slightly more. Furthermore, the book lacks any suspense whatsoever. Instead of staying up all night by my bed to finish the book, I had to constantly skip pages because of its rather boring and dry writing. I also found the characters particularly unsympathetic and unable to identify with. Instead of drawing me in, I had to force myself to finish the book (after repeatedly skimming through some unbearably slow sections). For such a small book, it's not easy to turn off a reader so many times. In addition, the book feels distant and unrealistic. It misses the realism to resonate with today's society, but it also lacks the bleak prophecy of a warning. Instead, near the end of the book, the author gave a not very subtlely disguised lecture on censorship, which is fine, except for the face that it feels like the author had left the world of storytelling and abruptly intrude into his own stories. He could not get the point across by the story itself; he had to announce it out. I also found the ending a bit ridiculous and incredulous. If words were so easily preserved in memories, we would not need writing. If the brain were so indiscriminating in its selectivity, we would not have conflicting memories. And although this book was supposedly an anti-censorship novel, I did not walk away from this book feeling the horrow of censorship. Instead, I wished I had not wasted my time on reading this book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"How ironic that a book about limiting access to books is NOT text-to-speech enabled.

He will not buy audio books so the publisher makes no sale at all. He bought his Kindle for the express purpose of being able to read books through the text-to-speech function.

It's far less complex in terms of language and expressions than those two, which makes its reading easy and fast. But Farenheit's story is clearly &quot;too much&quot; inspired by Orwell's and Huxley's work, with too obvious similarities hard not to be comparable at the same time you go through the book. An example, Farenheit's big televisions on the walls in the houses. Remember Big Brother speaking from wallscreens in 1984?On the other side, Bradbury let us know that books are synonims of &quot;culture&quot;, and &quot;development of thinking&quot;, which in my opinion are arbitrary statements. There can also be non educative books as there are non educative tv programmes or popcorn movies.And the story changes its course abruptly at the end.

I felt that the plot was hard to follow and somewhat confusing. Some people have said that this book is written for high school students, but I really don't think that it is. I'm a freshman in high school and I really did not understand what was going on. I figured it out enough to kind of follow the story, but definitely not enough to actually get into the book. This is one of only about 3 books that I have ever read that I did not perfectly understand and enjoy. The basic idea of the plot is that Guy Montag, a fireman in the future, is paid to burn down houses that illegally store books in them. He meets some other characters (such as Clarisse, a 17 year old who lives in his neighborhood) who help him open his eyes to the world that he is being so blind to. If you enjoy reading about censorship or science fiction, this book might be okay for you. If you like stories that are pretty easy to follow and have a more realistic plot, don't bother. -- luckiestarre"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A standard in the dystopian utopia that Brave New World and 1984 also capture, this is the third in a triad of phenomenal dystopian books written that everyone should read. While banned in some jurisdictions, the idea of book burning and reading being illegal is still a serious issue. We ban books in our library systems, and in our schools. While we do not burn books on a regular basis, the vision timeliness of this book still has not faded since it first came out in print.The book centers on a \\"fireman\\" Guy Montage and how he has to adjust his beliefs in line with the people around him that he meets, especially the Professor and the teen-age girl that provide an interesting counterpoint to the vacant wife that he lives with. Books are dangerous, and in the society here, even more so as books are burned, and the newspaper is reduced to a comic strip without words. As he looks around the environment that he lives in and compares his needs to the way that the world is going, supervisors, wife, and friends all notice that he is pulling back from long held beliefs. This is the problem, and the reason that the book works so well. While the society is not constantly monitored like in other books, friends and family eventually have a major impact on where Guy goes, and what Guy does throughout the course of this book. It is almost like he has no control or purpose outside of what others think, say, watch, or do.This is probably the best Bradbury book written, and should be on everyone's bookshelf. Five of Five stars, the more copies in the house the better."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"True FictionThough this book [Faremhieght 451] is a piece science fiction, it relates in its own little ways to the way the world is today. I, for one, can see this world of ours turning into a world with the same basis and same ideals that make up this book Farenhieght 451; a world which trys to keep everyone happy and careless about everything to the point of making people seemingly mindless, and in the process of doing so they destroy everything that brings people feeling and a individual way of thinking. Farenhieght 451 is a must read for anyone who likes a good philosophical novel."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I am a few years out of college and most people are shocked to find out that I have never read \\"Fahrenheit 451.\\" Given how much of an avid reader I am, it is rather shocking that I had never read this. I was never assigned this in High School, though in retrospect I would have rather read this than the books I read in High School, such as John Steinbeck novels, my arch nemesis. I was also shocked to see that as I'm writing this 79 people gave this book a rating of one star. Clearly these people do not know what is out there; this book is not that bad. Granted I have some misgivings about the book, but it brings up some excellent concepts and I can't help but feel these people lack the education level to go beyond what the book is about. Maybe I am simply thinking on this level because I am older and can no longer truly identify with the High School mentality, but I don't think I ever did. There is this factor and the fact that their reviews were quite poorly written for the most part, so they clearly lacked literary prowess and their reviews do not hold much weight.Either way you look at it this book is now considered quite the classic. It is usually lumped together with Orwell's \\"1984\\" and I do agree with others that \\"1984\\" was the better story. Orwell created a much more vibrant and tangible world, Bradbury on the other hand did not succeed nearly as well. I can't help but think that Bradbury likely had read \\"1984\\" and thought of a slightly different worldview and thus did not feel the need to flesh his ideas out nearly as much. Whatever was the motivation for this, it was not a great move. This book starts off fairly slowly and ends on a rather sour note making the reader want to know what happened after.Essentially the reader is thrust into a futuristic world where it is illegal to read or own books. Thus most of the population is borderline mentally challenged and gets most of its information through news blips on their television screens or these radio earbud things. (Strangely we have earbud headphones now that are quite popular.) During this technological advancement they also made houses fireproof and thus no longer needed firemen, but they eventually developed a new job for them... burning books. Guy Montag, a fireman, is our protagonist throughout the story and after meeting a young girl that sends his mind reeling he ends up unconsciously working against this perverted society. He starts to slowly figure out that his wife is essentially a zombie to this society and she doesn't have any substance to her person. The book focuses more on his emotional responses to learning all of these things, and thus in heightened emotional states he doesn't make very great decisions. Although, his Fire Chief, Beatty, is the main antagonist and pursues Montag after he figures out what is really going on with his employee. Beatty was probably one of my favorite characters because he was so eloquently spoken. Unfortunately Montag was no real match for such a man's intellect and there was never a real battle of wits between them. Eventually Montag's disgust for society grows to paramount levels and he naturally becomes the outlaw of the land. Naturally, I couldn't help but see the parallel to 1984's characters. A great fugitive chase takes place and his chased by a robot dog, which is pretty much the only major weak part of this futuristic world, mostly due to the fact it's a goofy idea. Anyway, Montag covers his scent, though I can't help but think this is unrealistic even for this novel knowing what I do about genetics, pheromones and computer systems. Technically a robot dog primarily used for its olfactory sense should be able to detect him no matter what, because on a molecular level you still emit your scent.I don't want to give too much away, but suffice to say the book eventually abruptly ends. I felt like it was rather lacking at this point because I wanted to know what happened afterwards. I can't really give away the ending of the book because there really wasn't an ending. Of which, I left a ton of stuff out here and never even explained what actually happened in full, so don't feel cheated out of the adventure of the book. Once you get into this book the middle section is great and moves along quite briskly, but it trails off eventually.The book is important from a literary perspective because it really shows some of the major dangers in censorship. It even outlines things that are done now. How about the part of this book that points out that it all started off catering to the minorities... how often is that done today. We need to accommodate the small groups so that everyone is happy, it doesn't matter if it's wrong? This is happening more and more in the world today, like if a child has problems learning then it's not the parents fault, it's the schools fault, or it's some obscure genetic related fault, thus it is no the child's responsibility to learn anything anymore. How about making books abridged today to bolster a High Schoolers interest in getting to read a classic? Snip off a few words here, a few words there. Obviously they wouldn't find these books interesting so we have to dumb them down to their intellectual level. Naturally this will help progress society?That's how it all starts, and then people start to wonder why they need the full text at all, why not a paragraph summary? Why not a single sentence? Bradbury spells it out plainly for us in this book that that is exactly what happened in his imagined future. How long before simplicity replaces completeness in our society? Now we learn today that blurbs mean everything and people get a major amount of information from quick blurbs to feed our fast paced society, so they just write clever headlines and people think they have the news. It's progressively happening more and more. People don't want to take the time to read, so they get Cliff Notes. They don't desire to comprehend on their own half the time, so they watch a movie about it where there is less internal struggle to see from the characters. People who think that the problems this novel portrays aren't happening today aren't living in the same world the rest of the intellectual community is living. Those people are living in Orwell's world, in Bradbury's world. And pretty soon they will be the ones making decisions for everyone else in this world when they are the ones who eventually come into power because they are the best at writing clever headlines for two bit readers."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Farenheit 451 deals with the anti-intellectual society that is America. How everyone distracts themselved with materialistic values and doesn't take ahold of education as well as they should. This book was released ahead of it's time and is beautifully written.

All I will say is this book is one of the best I have read in a while. The scary thing is, it isn't to far from the truth as well.People who don't like reading SHOULD read this book. It will make you think, and it only takes a few hours to read. So why not read it?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a futuristic fantasy set in an America in which reading is forbidden, firemen burn books and everyone rushes without taking time to \\"stop and smell the flowers.\\" I believe that the people who compare this work to McCarthyism and Nazism are missing the point. It depicts a world in which reading has fallen out of favor, people watch television constantly, engage in shallow conversations and are in incessant rushes to get somewhere. Funerals are banned because they bring sadness and people have forgotten to appreciate nature, contemplate beauty and love one another.The principal action of this book occurs when a seventeen year old neighbor introduces the protagonist, Montag, to the world of nature. The book progresses as Montag gradually changes into a person more to our ideal.Although set in the future, this book contains much that is familiar. Portions remind the reader of Lost Horizon. More moving than that are factors which we see in our own world. Have we arrived in a world in which television has decreased reading and shortened attention spans? Is our literature and discourse made blander because minorities and special interest groups demand protection from anything which may hurt their feelings? Do we try to equalize the weak by weakening the strong? I am afraid that we see much of this future world in our own. Fahrenheit 451 provides, not only a pleasant read, but also a wake up call for all who are concerned about our culture."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is one of those books that leaves you thinking after reading it, one of those that would have been destroyed in Bradbury's story. A tale of a future where books are burnt so that people don't have to think. They're only allowed to watch TV, especially sports and soaps. Does it sound you familiar?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Simply a classic piece of literature, there is no possible way you can read this book and not take something valuable from it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"So everyone else seems to praise Bradbury's cultural observations and what-if scenario that man is eventually destined for, which I appreciate, a lot, but you can read about in other reviews.When it comes down to it the writing of the book isn't entirely great. Bradbury intentionally made the characters childlike and naive, and the writing had the same feel. I want to think this was on purpose, but it was probably more because it was easy.Why is it in great novels where the world has become a giant conspiracy that there is always only one or two random, seemingly normal people that figure it out. \\"1984\\" and \\"Brave New World\\" also do this and it drives me nuts. There's no real reason why it all of a sudden dawned on the character that the world that has been presented to them is flawed. Why is it only one person ever realizes it, and for no real apparent reason. They just wake up and say \\"wait a minute...\\".I also wish these books went 1. more into the reasons why the society got to the way it is and 2. more into how the character reconciles the truth of the situation and carries on for a better world. The plot is too simple of a line. Society is dumb, man realizes society is dumb, man calls it out, society tries to shut man up, society does something dumb to itself, man says \\"ha, i told you so\\".As far as a thought proviking warning to our culture and framing a plausible future to teach our kids with, this books succeeds. As far as being a well written literary masterpiece this book is overly simplified. But then again, that could be what truly sets it apart. :)"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 was a very good book about Guy Montag who is a fireman. In his world fireman start fires instead of putting them out because the government had banned books so the population doesn't over come the Executive branch.Montag meets Clarisse who changes his life, he see's interesting books can be.My favorite part in the book was when Montag started to run from the police. He had got very mad at the firemen and went crazy. He burned the fire chief with his flame thrower then ran to try to get out of town. The whole city was looking for him and the government even had a mechanical hound that \\"never failed\\" when it came to chasing and finding someone. Well I guess the hound could fail because Montag jumped into a river as he goes out of the town. He wound up on a railroad track with a bunch of other tramps. They would read books and remember them. They were the only library in this world.I recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a very exciting book that draws you in and you'll never want to put down. Fahrenheit 451 kept me reading it till I finished. It has a lot of action and has a really creative story line. It is scary how realistic it is. I wish Ray Bradbury had made a sequel to this book to see what happens to Montage once he followed the train tracks. If you like books that keep you on the edge of your seat and that mesmerize you then you should read \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" by Ray Bradbury."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is not only about censorship and government control but is also about mankind's denial to confront the very things that make us human. Control is a good thing in society however to much control can make you paranoid and a threat not only to yourself but to society. This book is very relevant to even today's time when we seek to censor not only books but anyhting we deem harmful. This book is even being censored as I write. Such cnesorship has its basis within a lack of understanding and puts our society on the path of retrogression.This is book is probably best for those who are just beginning to tapp into their conscious mind and examine the world around them. I recommend this book for a mature, discerning mind"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I believe that the book Fahrenheit 451 was very well written and very interesting. Mr. Bradbury made the book have a lot of good vocabulary for a 12 year old to learn. This book is one of the better books that I have had to read in school. Prior to reading this book I never really liked science fiction books. This book has changed that dramatically. It also taught me fun facts like (before reading this i didn't know) paper burns at 451 degrees. WOW if a book can just do that, i don't even know why people would ban them in the future. LOL :)"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I heard about this book from noticing it cropping up on listmania lists on this website as a very \\"literary\\" book, meaning pretentious and boring. Now i've read it, i can almost not see why its there - true, the book is artistic - bradbury lists every adjectival detail of his narrative, at times painstakingly - if you like prose where if there's smoke, its wispy and curling and dissipating, instead of being able to imagine what it looks like - then Ray Bradbury is for you. At times this style of writing feels laboured, and many recognise it as simple artistic. I happen to feel that a true artist knows when to linger and when to stride forward and get straight to the point. I could argue that Bradbury fits into this category. In fact, his story of Montag, a \\"fireman\\" in a futuristic state where books have become the enemies and need to be destroyed - is quite an action based piece which set the tone for much successive science fiction. Of course, Bradbury was not the founder of this genre, though i don't know much about it, i think George Orwell's 1984 and Huxley's Brave New World preceded it. It is old - about 1950 i think, but it doesn't feel old. I thought Bradbury's nervous fear of the advent of television in the 40's was funny, but has ended up being quite prophetic - TV has indeed come to be quite a maniupulative medium.If you love a book which is big on story as well as being big on ideas, if you love a nostalgic adjective-packed prose, if you love science fiction - and if you don't, just damn well read 1984 and then maybe some Phillip K Dick like i did, and you'll see what all the fuss is about - and btw, science fiction isn't really science, its ABOUT science, or the fantasy of science, what science can do to us, the thirst for knowledge and advancement - but its really about people struggling against a system. Actually, strike all that, SF is about story. In fact, its one of the best genres for telling ideas through story.In Fahrenheit 451, the idea is censorship, freedom of thought, and the repression of it by the state - and its told through the involving story of Montag, the officer of repression who finds himself in a bit of a pickle when he accidentally spies a line of prose on a page he's been ordered to burn, and wonders what the big mystery is.Plus, its short - only about 150 pages - so you can eat it up over a couple of long train rides if time is a factor.For me, though, only 3 out of 5 because i started struggling about half way b.c of the profusion of adjectives. But for some people, its a plus - if you have trouble imagining novels, then Bradbury gives you all the info, almost like on a movie screen.B.P"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a portrait of civilization in collapse.Bruno Bettelheim once gave a lecture in which he said that modern mass-society displays a manic and unhealthy preoccupation with speed and motion, and that this preoccupation betrays the inner emptiness of \\"a hollow man\\". \\"Instead of asking where we are [inwardly] we just jump into the car and say, 'Let's get going'.\\" Like Mike Judge's satiric filmIdiocracy, Ray Bradbury's novel Fahrenheit 451 develops the idea of a fallen modernity to its logical conclusion. But unlike Idiocracy, Fahrenheit 451 is no satire. It is serious social criticism without a glimmer of humor. Bradbury's fictional world is a fascist state built on what NeoCon Philip Zelikow calls \\"public presumption\\", \\"public myth\\" --- shared ideas assumed to be true but not known to be true. In other words, reality is what a government says it is. Bradbury's fictional world shares much, therefore, in common with George Orwell's novel 1984.The plot is built around the awaking conscience of a government employee, a firefighter who has always accepted public presumption as truth. The awakening is not pretty. Guy Montag, the protagonist, begins to question his culture: Mindless entertainment, disrespect for life, constant motion. In Guy Montag's culture, the public presumption is that books are a potential terrorist threat. The job of firefighters, therefore, is to seek out and burn books. Given recent developments in US politics and society, Fahrenheit 451 --- like Orwell's 1984 --- has become more trenchant with each passing year. Bradbury explores the longterm moral and social implications of our present Zeitgeist."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a story about a sick and twisted future in which books are forbidden by a Totalitarian Regime. The concept of this story originates from the time of WWII in which Hitler's Regime was burning libraries across Europe in an attempt to prevent the distribution of knowledge and other negative ideas that could affect his rise to power. This book is an exciting tale about a world in which firemen no longer extinguish fires, but instead start them. The firemen in this world burn all the books and the houses in which they are contained.We feel that this store, despite its dark tone, is a well-written modern day classic that makes the reader better respect books and not take them for granted. I highly recommend this book to anyone that wishes to read a thought-provoking story that provides insight into our future. An interesting aspect of this novel is how well it connects with our world today. Our society is becoming more and more reliant on technology and is becoming less interested in education, which sadly enough, is the same story in Fahrenheit 451. Could this be a reality for our world in the near future?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The world of tomorrow, where no one knows what could happen next. Everyone has their opinion, and Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury is a great example of a realistic future. This book is a cautionary story. The message is that we should consider the dangers of electronics, if we don't, people will start to forget the value of books, reading, and learning. I really enjoyed this book and reading what the author thinks the future holds.Fahrenheit 451 is based in the 24th century where electronics and television are valued more than school, learning, and books. Reading is considered a crime. Firemen are now used to destroy books. Guy Montag is one of those firemen. After meeting a neighbor, Clarisse McClellan, he is left wondering about his world and what it has come to. Upon Clarisse's death, Montag considers books and what is going on. He starts stealing and reading books. Montag says in part 1, \\"There must be something in books, things we can't imagine, to make a woman stay in a burning house; there must be something there. You don't stay for nothing.\\" Turned in by his wife, Mildred, Montag finds himself having to destroy his house and getting arrested. He manages to escape by murdering his chief. While hiding from the police, Montag meets a group of men hiding for the same reason. In the end, Montag leaves his city as it is being bombed and a war has begun.Fahrenheit 451 teaches us that we need to realize the value of books, reading, and thinking. Also, it's showing us the dangers of electronics. Every day some new technology comes along and people tend to rely on it way too much. This book is trying to tell us that we should realize and understand how addicting electronics can be, and that we need to always value books, reading, and learning.Fahrenheit 451 is very good and I really enjoyed reading it. It was very suspenseful and you always wanted to keep reading to find out what happens next. It isn't a very hard book to read, and it also isn't very long. It only has a couple flaws. It felt very rushed in the beginning, and it didn't give a good description of the characters. However, people should read this book because not only is it a very interesting story, but it also cautions us about the future. I give it 4 stars out of 5. If you enjoy this story, some other books like it are: \\"1984\\" by George Orwell, \\"A Brave New World\\" by Aldous Huxley, and \\"The Caves of Steel\\" by Isaac Asimov.Fahrenheit 451 has great messages about how we should consider the dangers of electronics and TV. Other messages include how valuable books, reading, and thinking really are. I definitely think that others should read it as well. I can't wait to try reading other books that are similar to this one."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury wrote the novel Fahrenheit 451 in the spring of 1950, while living with his family in California. At the time that Bradbury was writing the novel, the surrounding society began to read condensed versions of books, not wanting to bother with thinking too much about the actual full-lengthed book. This little bit of information found its way into Fahrenheit 451 and is part of one of its larger themes that deal with ignorance and censorship.In Fahrenheit 451, Bradbury builds a futuristic environment in which books are degraded by burning, a method which enables society to achieve equality. The title is significantly chosen because it represents the temperature at which books ignite. The majority of the members of this revolutionary society do not want books destroying their equality; they hate to feel inferior to others who have read more books and have obtained more knowledge.One of the key elements that Bradbury stresses in this novel is \\"knowledge versus ignorance.\\" In a society with no books, there is a better chance of equality among the people. If all the books are banned and then thrown into an incinerator, the envy and jealously of knowledge stops, which in turn makes society content. Because of this lack of knowledge and experience with books, the general public becomes consumed with technological advances, such as \\"Seashells\\" which are described as electronic devices, situated in the ear, that speak directly to the user. Books are burned in answer to differing opinions. If no one reads books, then no one can be offended by what the books have printed in them. It is all a systematically planned structure to endorse \\"sameness\\" among the members of society.Montag enjoys burning books until he meets his neighbor, Clarisse McClellan, who gives Montag a shove towards a new way of believing. She does not fall victim to the censored society norms and views the world from a different perspective, playing a key role in enhancing the plot. She is described as having \\"odd habits\\" which often times included nature, spending time by herself, and asking questions; all activities which were frowned upon by other members of the community. Clarisse tragically gets hit by a high-speed car and dies, only encouraging the idea that Montag's life needed rearranging. After all, Clarisse was the first one to ask if Montag was really happy in life and only after her tragic death does he realize how unhappy he has become.Truth is what one has faith in. Montag begins to have faith in books and the knowledge that he gains from them, and so he commences to find his inner truth. Bradbury devotes a small section of the novel to the discussion of truths in the chapter entitled \\"The Sieve and The Sand.\\" While Montag is struggling over what the books offer to him and what he reads, he has a flashback to a time when he was on the beach attempting to fill a sieve with sand to win a dime. With this task came frustration because no matter how hard he tried, he could not fill the sieve up with the sand. A similar situation arises with Montag in his present state; he knows that something good will come out of the books, but he just has a hard time \\"filling up the sieve,\\" or figuring out what that something is. In a theological sense, the sand can come to symbolize the concrete truth that Montag desperately tries to find, while the sieve represents the intellect seeking a truth that is much greater, indefinable, and impossible to seize.Throughout the novel, Montag increasingly becomes estranged from his wife, his co-workers, and society as a whole. As he becomes more interested in books, he loses the common beliefs that tie him to the society in which he lives. No longer is he victim to the violent overthrow of nature, knowledge, and books. Montag is able to fight against his doubts and separate himself against the others in hopes of a better tomorrow.Montag stumbles upon a group of men sitting around a campfire, a fire which is comforting and inviting; a stark contrast to the fire that Montag is used to. Granger, the leader of the group, quickly welcomes Montag and describes the group as the \\"Book People.\\" The group is part of a nation-wide network of people devoted to saving books. Each member memorizes a book and waits until the opportune time to tell the retained knowledge. Montag is given a title to remember and recite and thus is initiated into the book society. The novel ends with Montag's spiritual revitalization - own intellectual journey - and the complete destruction of the city due to the war that very few citizens were aware of. Bradbury leaves Montag and the \\"Book People\\" to revive the city and with hopes of a new society where books will flourish.The \\"Book People\\" are alienated from society in that their ideas and theories are different from the accepted beliefs of the city dwellers. Instead of burning books, the \\"Book People\\" acknowledge a book's worth and capture the words of wisdom in their memories. The members of this elite group live outside the city, on the outskirts of the woods or wherever the path of knowledge leads them, thus separating them from civilization.The futuristic environment created by Bradbury may have been influenced by society at the time, however, society may actually be slowly slipping towards this censored environment. Just like in the novel, modern governments now censor news and media to influence the opinion of its people. Internet sites like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter are just a few examples. By promoting censorship and \\"sameness\\" you limit societies progression that is gained the knowledge included in reading. If this trend continues we may all change our names to Guy Montag and hope for the phoenix to rise from the ashes of our destructed society."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"im in highschool right now and had to read this book for summer homework. normally i find reading books for class to be strenuous, but i really enjoyed this book. being the first time i read a piece of bradbury's work, i definently came away impressed with his unique writing style. it makes you re-think how we use technology in our daily lives and offers a future that is frightening to consider. a really good story to top it off, this book is well worth a read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 was the first book I had to read for school that I actually liked, and was therefore to a large extent responsible for keeping my love of reading alive into adulthood. That was nearly two decades ago, and rereading it now has been an equally delightful experience. It is a truly great novel, and this is even easier to appreciate after having read the earlier versions \\"The Fireman\\" and \\"Long After Midnight\\", which by comparison and contrast serve to highlight the structure, the richness of descriptive detail, the astonishing variations in metaphors about heat and fire (and their opposites) throughout, and more. Even apparently trivial lines of dialogue are laden with layers of meaning, as when Montag's wife tells him, \\"You don't look so hot yourself.\\"It is also fairly philosophically sophisticated. While the novel is about a fireman who burns books, and Bradbury is clearly enamored of books, they are just a symbol: \\"It's not books you need, it's some of the things that once were in books. The same things could be in the 'parlour families' today. The same infinite detail and awareness could be projected through the radios and televisors, but are not. No, no, it's not books at all you're looking for! Take it where you can find it, in old phonograph records, old motion pictures, and in old friends; look for it in nature and look for it in yourself. Books were only one type of receptacle where we stored a lot of things we were afraid we might forget. There is nothing magical in them at all. The magic is only in what books say, how they stitched the patches of the universe together into one garment for us.\\"And it is not just about one political program versus another, or even about the individual versus the state, but about independence in the moral sphere, thinking and feeling for oneself: \\"I took the others on faith!...I don't want to change sides and just be *told* what to do. There's no reason to change if I do that.\\"He even abstracts from books to the nature of creative activity in general: \\"It doesn't matter what you do,...so long as you change something from the way it was before you touched it into something that's like you after you take your hands away. The difference between the man who just cuts lawns and a real gardener is in the touching.... The lawn-cutter might just as well not have been there at all; the gardener will be there a lifetime.\\"And there's so much more that's absolutely wonderful in this book that I can't even touch on here. Bradbury isn't always entirely consistent and the book has some other minor flaws, but they are insignificant compared to its virtues. Four and a half stars."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"When Ray Bradbury died on June 5, 2012, his classic novel \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" was sitting on my bedstand. I had picked up the 50th anniversary edition while romancing a quaint, quality bookstore (yes, some still exist) in Montpelier, Vermont. (Sorry, Amazon, it was just a fling, but oh what an affair.) It was a book that I had somehow neglected to read up to this point in my life and thought it high time that I did so.Published in 1953, the story takes place in an American city several decades in the future (which would be, I guess, about now). Bradbury depicts a society in which the state picks up where the public left off: having largely abandoned the written word, people live to be mesmerized by music, by moving pictures, by all manner of electronic stimulation. The state simply completes the migration by banning books altogether; books, the state asserts, cause people only confusion and unhappiness. Fire departments, rather than putting out fires, now burn down houses containing books. (Houses had been made fireproof, so there was no need to put out fires; on the other hand, it takes a lot of fire department-provided kerosene to get them burning.) In the background of the story, the U.S. is also on the verge of nuclear war with some unnamed country; bomber jets forebodingly streak across the sky at supersonic speeds. The message of \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is transparent: electronic media is fast becoming the opiate of the masses, who have become so numbed by electronic sound, image and color that they pay little heed to their potential annihilation.Guy Montag is a fireman (in the new sense) who, having long been secretly intrigued by books, now finds that he is inflamed with the desire to protect them. His wife, who is nearly always either zoned out with a \\"seashell\\"--an iPod-like device--in her ear, or transfixed by the three-wall-sized 3D color television, is frightened by her husband's illicit bibliophilia. Lonely, Guy makes a series of impulsive, dangerous moves that he cannot walk back.The novel moves fairly briskly, and at about 165 pages, one can burn through it more-or-less quickly. Bradbury's language is surprisingly literary, though; the result is a pulp fiction story written in highbrow style. Sometimes his language sings, sometimes it comes off as merely prolix or high flown. I was also struck by how like 1950s television teleplays parts of the novel read: characters talk to each other in articulate mini-speeches, or they erupt in emotional ejaculations: \\"You're mad!\\" \\"Why would I be mad!\\" \\"Because!\\" Think \\"Playhouse 90.\\"Bradbury was prescient about both the miniaturization of electronics (the seashell earbud radio) and its extreme opposite (super large-screen, 3D color television). But he either didn't think of e-books, or perhaps dismissed the possibility as simply a stage towards the utter elimination of books.What Bradbury seemed less able to do was to think beyond the social norms of his own time: besides a sylph who serves as the catalyst for Montag's later actions, the only other intelligent, thoughtful characters are male. Bradbury belittles this line of criticism in the coda to his book (pp. 177-78, e.g., \\"For it is a mad world and it will get madder if we allow the minorities...to interfere with aesthetics\\"), but I don't think he gets off quite that easily. The point is not that there aren't women in the book, it's that almost all of them are nitwits and, perhaps for that reason, they don't appear at all among the story's intelligentsia. At one point, for instance, a group of people who all have memorized books gather round, and not one woman among them. Really, Ray?What of his central point about the rise of electronic media and the decline of books? How relevant is the story to today's reader? To my mind, Bradbury's story continues to be insightful about social trends, just not quite with the same sense of dread. Smart phones and e-tablets proliferate. Bookstores are disappearing and fewer books are being read by fewer people. According to a 2007 study by the National Endowment for the Arts, \\"On average, Americans ages 15 to 24 spend almost two hours a day watching TV, and only seven minutes of their daily leisure time on reading.\\" But do people care? In \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" the sense of dread is heightened by apocalyptic notes of imminent atomic war. Would there be greater concern over the slow death of reading for pleasure if there were a renewed sense of doom in our society?In short, Ray Bradbury's \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is a thought-provoking novel about a dystopian future. It's excellent material for a book club, if there are still any left."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Sorry to all of the people who loved this book: I didn't.The plot wasn't bad, I'll admit, (I won't get into what it is about here, enough people already have) but I didn't care for the writing style at all. It was far too emotional, with all of this stuff that didn't make a whole lot of sense. Besides, whatever happened to Clarisse? She was the only good character, and she was only in it for two chapters! By the end, I hate to say, I really couldn't have cared less what happened to Montag. Don't get me wrong, I don't want to burn books or anything: the plot was an excellent idea, but the story didn't pull me in at all. I was hoping I'd enjoy it, even though I don't like science fiction, but I didn't. It was better than I had expected in some ways, which is why I'm giving it two stars. It makes you think about important things, like censorship and where it will lead us in the future.So, read it if you must, and think about its ideas, but don't expect too much. The best thing about this book is that it's short."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book I read this quarter is called Fahrenheit 451. The author of the book is Ray Bradbury. The book takes place in the future. Some of the environments include: Montag's house, the fire house, and Faber's house. In my oponion, the city and the river were the most important sites in the book. The city is were Montag was chased, and the river is important because this is where Montag finally dodged the city officials. I think that Fahrenheit 451 would best be classified as a science fiction. It is this genre because it is set in the future. Also, it is make believe because firefighters don't burn books in our society. Ray Bradbury has written many short stories, novels, plays, and poems. At 12, he wrote his first short story. He has produced two of his own plays, made two musicals, and helped with an animated film. In 1962 Icarcs Mantgolfer was nomanated for an academy award. Ray Bradbury has had his own television show, named the Ray Bradbury Theater has won many different cable awards. The book is about a firefighter named Guy Montag. His job is not to put out fires, but to set books ablaze. As the story goes along he starts to question many things about his job and the books he burns. About this time Guy starts stealing books. He made many attempts to read them, but he didn't understand them. Guy then contacted Faber, a retired professor, to help him interpret the books. Then Beatty, the fire chief, suspected Guy of burning books. Because this was aganist the law, Bettay went to Guy's house to burn his books. At that time Bettay placed Montag under arrest. Fearing he might be killed, Guy flees from city officals. He finally loses them when he hides in the river. When Guy emerges he meets a group of retired professors and teachers. They helped Guy escape and they recite to him as they travel. That is where the book ended. . The main character of the book is Guy Montag. He is a firefighter. Montag was not very educated, but he was \\"programed\\" to set books on fire. Guy is important to the book because if he wasn't there then there would be no book. He is also important because he is the olny person with the drive needed to change the laws of owning books. He is married to Mildred Moontag. Another improtant character of the book is Faber. He is a retired professor who quit when the college where he taught closed. Faber, a very well educated man, had been illegally reading books very discreetly. Faber is improtant to the book because without Faber's help Montag never would have escaped. Faber is also the person who coached Montag whenever he was in trouble. I think the theme of the book is that we shouldn't take books forgranted. I think Farheniet 451 is saying that books are very important resources and that slowly with technology thay are becomming more and more obsolete. Overall I liked most of the book. There were many dead spots in the book that left me lost. At the begenning I really didn't catch on and understand the it. But, when it picked up, it was a very good and interesting book. This is why I would reccomend it to a friend."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I don't like this book very much. This is the most boring book I have ever read.

I go to a school in Maine and I am in eighth grade. I read this book for an honors English class. I am not a really big fan of reading because I find it to be extremely boring and useless. In fact the only reason I am writing this review is because I am being forced to. This book was one of the better books that I have been forced to read over my school career. There have been some pretty horribly boring books than I have been forced to read but this one isn't that bad. In fact it is a somewhat exciting book. I would recommend this book to a student that is being made to read a book that is like this or if this book is on one of there book lists. This book was somewhat good. I am not really sure what I think about it. The book was very confusing and I found it hard to read. Now that I think about it this book was not very good. I can see why they wanted to burn books in this book because I wasn't a very big fan of this book. It was very confusing and hard to believe and a little to old.

The thought that the day will come when firemen will burn books instead of putting out fires is original and quite symbolic. There are some subtle highlights throughout the text but on the whole it isn't real exciting or fun. It is short and to the point, however.For me, the real story is in the writing of the text and the history of the author. His story is highly inspirational and fun to read. While the book isn't a real entertainment, it is potent in message and subtlties. There is a wothwhile message awating the thoughtful reader."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book Fahrenheit 451 was a great book that I really enjoyed. This book takes place sometime in the future. It is a story is about a fireman, he is not a fireman that you and I think about; instead of putting fires out he starts them. He is a book burner. Because in the society that he lives in books are outlawed and are to be burnt. There were four main characters in this story. The most important was Guy Montag. He was a tall black haired man that questions society and himself. He is a fireman that burns books for a living. He makes a lot of changes throughout the book. By the end of the book he is a wanted man. The next character was Clarisse McClellan she is a young girl that is not like everyone else. She is a free thinker. She helped Montag get started on his journey. Montag's boss is very important in the book. His name is Captain Beatty. He seems grumpy and he enjoys burning books. Towards the end of the book he is murdered. Professor Faber is an old professor that helps Motag learn about society and how it used to be. He is weak and cannot act out what he wants to , so he and Montag act as a team. Mildred Montag is Montag's wife. She is the perfect example of the rest of society. She believes that books are horrible and have nothing to offer. All she cares about is her family that was on T.V. and not much of anything else, just like the society she lived in.Guy Montag questions his job and what he wants to do with his life.One of the best parts of the book is the cat and mouse game that Fire Captain Beatty plays with Montag. Beatty is seen as a man who once had been infected with the bug of individualism, but had since 'cured' himself and now is determined to cure Montag. Beatty explains how his society came to be and Montag learns that somewhere along the line, the process went horribly wrong.I think that this book is a very good book, it kept me interested the whole time that I read it.It only took me about 3 days to read it and that was between work and school. For those of you kids that have to read a book for a book report this would be my choice."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury delivered an interesting concept. This science fiction was about how books are evil and should be burned. Mr. Bradbury gave us a concept that has never been thought about before. Although this idea is completely original, in this case, the amount of originality put into this book is not directly proportional to how much I enjoyed the book.Fahrenheit 451 is about a man named Guy Montag who is a futuristic fireman. Guy is basically paid to burn books rather than let people read them. To me, this whole concept seems too far fetched. Not only is reading or possessing books illegal but it can be punished severely. Everyone in this book is just too afraid to read books. I did not like this concept because that would never happen, and is never possible. People would always be interested even if, and sometimes especially if, it is illegal. Despite the laws Montag starts reading books illegally when he becomes completely dissatisfied with life. He begins to enjoy reading and tries to show some others about reading but instead they do not understand his super intellect.This book makes the reader think about the plot too much. The author should say what is going on rather than make the reader think too much because the reading might read too far into things and not completely understand. Books became illegal to read when minorities got overly upset about books that offended them. Eventually the minorities came got enough people to agree with them that all books were banished. Books have so much to offer that this idea seems completely unreasonable and stupid to me.Eventually Guy learns to like books. He even derives a plan to turn the world against illiteracy. Guys wife leaves him when he is not around and reports that he has been reading books. The fire department comes to burn his house down with all of the books in it. The force Montag to do it instead. Many of the concepts like this one seem like nothing of that manner would ever occur in reality. Did he not pay for that house. Why would someone burn another's house down for such a meaningless crime as reading books.This book delivers an interesting concept which may be too far fetched for myself. If you are a book and science fiction lover, this may not be the case for yourself."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The novel, Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, is about a man named Guy Montag who is a fireman. Unlike most ordinary firemen, he starts fires instead of puts them out. He burns books. If anyone in their town is caught with even only one book in their house, he comes and set the entire house on fire and lets it all burn to the ground. After a while he meets a girl and starts to fall in love with her. However, she likes books, and she reads them. So, he tries reading a book and he loves it. Then he stops burning them and instead he reads them while they live together. One time his boss came to his house while he was reading his book and he had to hide it. While he was talking his wife was cleaning and almost found the book.At first I thought that this was going to be a pretty good book. It might be kind of exciting, being about burning books and all. Since I personally hate reading then hearing about someone that burns books caught my attention. It turned out to be another boring book.This book would be better suited for older adults that like to read. Books that kids are required to read should be fun and exciting books not any of these boring books.

So the firemen end up burning her house, the books that were in it, and the old lady. That made him think that there must have been something in those books worth dying for.

When I was halfway through I was warming to it. I thought about how a lot of Ray Bradbury's predictions have come true, and I geared myself up for a spectacular ending. Well, that ending never came. Bradbury finishes his book by leaving his main character, Montag, wandering aimlessly through the country, reciting books with some other men. Besides being terribly sexist, this book doesn't have much of a plot, and it leaves what little it has hanging at the end. For instance, my favorite character, Clarisse, disappears. Why doesn't Bradbury have something definite happen to her? It is hinted that she has been run over by a car, but the reader knows nothing specific. This book drove em nuts in its vagueness. You can't tell what are actual happenings in Montag's life, what are metaphors for other happenings, and what are simply Montag's imaginings. This book could be a well-loved book by some readers or a hated book by others. Or it could not have any definite spot in a reader's heart. I, personally, don't love it, but I don't hate it, either. I just don't care either way."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Okay,first off I would like to say that I enjoy almost any book I read.

First off, the book starts off with someone trying to commit suicide,and this character is saved even though she's totally wack. Second, the main character is named &quot;GUY MONTAG&quot;. How origanal. Third, the people in this book are IDIOTS! I mean, first they outlaw all &quot;offensive&quot; material, then they condense great novels into two page stories,and then they sit around on thier butt all day watching the &quot;family&quot; argue and OFFEND each other. The best character in the book simply dissappears in the middle of the book, and then she is found dead. Not only that but no one has friends. Not even your spouse is your friend.

The scary thing about this book is that hiding of knowledge is actually being done right now. Maybe not by burning books, but by degrading them and making the population so dumb by drugging the, we no longer retain knowledge as a culture.

In a future world, books are banned and firemen actually set fires instead of extinguishing them. The state exercises a form of social control through controlling what sort of information people have access to. It turns out that not all books are banned, only those that we would today consider \\"great works\\" - Plato, Shakespeare, The Bible, Darwin, etc. For me one of the biggest surprises about Fahrenheit 451 was the rationale that was offered for the burning of those books. In a nutshell, they offended politically correct sensibilities and the authorities felt that they would undermine the social cohesion. This expunging of the classics from the culture has an uncanny resonance with the attempts over past few decades to expunge them from the undergraduate liberal arts curriculum. And rationale is also similar: these books are not \\"diverse\\" enough and may offend the sensibilities of an ever-increasing list of \\"minorities.\\" It is hard not to wonder if a milder, softer version of dystopian future that Bradbury was worried about in the early 1950s has not in fact arrived.Bradbury's writing and ideas are somewhere between those of George Orwell and Philip K. Dick. His style is very engaging, and even poetic. His writing is at its best when one of his characters engages in a prolonged monolog. However, the plot development could use some improvement. There is very little in terms of transition from one scene to the next, and most scenes are overly compressed. It is very hard to follow the plot developments at times. Nonetheless, Bradbury is a wonderful stylist and unlike much of science fiction this book is a pleasure to read on a purely literally level as well as for its sweeping ideas.As a last note, I found it incredibly ironic that I read this book on Kindle. Based on this alone I am fairly optimistic that reading and great books will not only survive but in fact thrive well into the 21st century."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"at 180 pages i realized that i was one-quarter through the story and not even slightly interested in continuing. so i visited amazon ans clicked on the one-star reviews to see if their frustration was my frustration. if i finish it, it will be because i force myself. just before this book, i finished \\"on writing\\" by stephen king who points out [i almost wrote emphatically]: don't use adverbs ever. and if sparingly.

I found it extremely difficult to follow the story which sounded like it was being read by my great grandfather!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Reading this book could be compared to watching a train being derailed while high on shrooms. The very definition of convolution, this book is confusing and ultimately pointless.Our hero, Guy Montag, hardly makes a compelling main character. We know him as little more than a book-burner who begins to have doubts about his task. That's it. Period. Beyond that, he's not developed at all in the ample page space provided. Any other characters have just bit parts and are painfully obviously killed off as soon as the author doesn't need them anymore. It seems Bradbury has misjudged his own timeline, however; many characters, especially Clarisse McClellan, could have been part of a great supporting cast if they hadn't been gotten rid of when he did.Getting back to that \\"pointless\\" bit - well, that's just it. I honestly did not take away a single thing from this book. It was completely and utterly uninformative, and the only way it made me think was to try and figure out where the characters where and what they were talking about. An issue in and of itself, the dialogue in Fahrenheit 451 is so heavily-laden with metaphors, and the parts of conversation passed so often between different characters, every time I discovered what they were talking about was a treasured moment. Anyway, the book doesn't tell me anything. Guy Montag has doubts about his job, and runs away. Ok. So? So what? Why do I care? This had great potential to be a commentary on the suppression of individuality, but like many other possible routes, that thought had been thrown away in favor of... well, whatever this book turned out to be.An exercise in idiocy, this book should not be read by anyone who values his or her time.

He spends too much time describing the story, and his message, as he has rendered it, is too complex to cram into 180 pages. I was told to read this book in school, but was not forced, as i have a passion for reading. Anyone who now loves the name &quot;clarrise&quot; for the sole fact that she was a nice person in the novel is a wierdo. But, other than that, i found it to be a tolerablebook, up until the death of beatty, when the novels plot development peters out, and we are left feeling cudgeled for the rest of the novel by its &quot;moral&quot; Im only 13, so nyah BURN THE BOOK! bradbury has failed miserably in creating this book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I thought there was no point to this book what so ever and i dont suggest anyone to read it...! i had to read it for school and i didnt even finish it because it was so bad!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Our book club recently decided to make every other book choice a \\"classic\\" book which, for one reason or another, none of us has read. Fahrenheit 451 was this month's choice. After plowing through Bradbury's self-aggrandizing Foreward AND Introduction, I was ready to be enthralled. No such luck. This had to be one of the most abysmal books of all time. I suspect there's a bit of The Emperor's New Clothes (a much better read, by the way) going on here. In other words, if you dare to criticize Bradbury, then you must be one of the mindless rubes who hate books and philosophy and creativity and yadda yadda yadda. Fine, whatever. To put it delicately, this book stunk like yesterday's diapers. I have nothing but sympathy for the poor students who are forced to read this drivel for class--at least I had the option of putting it down. I am a college English major and a Senior Editor at a major publishing house, as well as an avid reader. Bradbury's over-the-top vision of intellectuals being rebellious outsiders who are hunted down is hilariously vain. His celebration of intellect above all else excludes other virtues such as love, compassion, humor, etc.. Interesting how these themes are given such short shrift. Bradbury is an overheated, macho, pseudo-intellectual with a chip on his shoulder. After reading this, all I wanted to do was flip on the TV and watch Three's Company reruns in order the cleanse the palate."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I was very disappointed when I received this book.

D. work on loneliness. Censorship certainly is the main theme, but another aspect of the book really touched my and might increasingly become critical for the 90s: I mean the feeling of being mentally isolated from a civilization that seeks nothing but distraction and variety - perfectly supplied by superficious media. Compared to this tendency, books might resemble dinosaurs, they require concentration, tranquility and a reader who is willing to think about the content. Every time I think of Guy Montag, I feel a little bit lonelier in this hasty culture. Unlike the end of the story, you shouldn't wait for collective self-destruction, from an individual point of view it will never be too late to re-discover the quality of slowliness in life, the taste of a conversation with somebody listening and understanding..."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Twenty years ago I had to read Fahrenheit 451 as part of my required reading in the ninth grade. At the time reading wasn't my \\"thing\\". But for some reason, the book never left me, even though I could never remember why. Nothing about the book stayed with me, just the title.Now twenty years later, I have reread Fahrenheit 451 and know, without a doubt, why the book stayed with me.Imagine a world where books are burned. A world where firemen no longer come to the rescue to put out fires but come to burn your house down if you are caught with books. They no longer wield water hoses, but flamethrowers. That is the world that Guy Montag lives in. He is a fireman, and for years he's rejoiced in the destruction that his flamethrower produces, burning the hated nonsensical books of the past. And you know what the ironic thing about that is, books are illegal, yet not because of our government, oh no, because the citizens of our country made it so! It was the peoples choice to turn their backs on books. Life is not happy when you can think and criticize, form opinions, argue points. It complicates things. So what do they do? They dispense with anything that will allow for that type of communication.But then one night after work as Montag is walking home he encounters a young girl, Clarisse. She is a strange one. But why is she strange? She is strange because she actually talks and listens and looks and observes the things around her. And Montag is fascinated by that quality. He begins to question his job, his life. And then to further tempt his questioning curiosity about books and the reason they are so hated, a job comes in. Another burning is to be done. But this time the lady whose house is the next victim of the torch, sets herslef on fire along with her books. She cannot bare to be witness to the destruction and still live. But before the bonfire begins, Montag secretly snatches one of her books. Disturbed and unstable, Montag goes home and we learn that that is not the first book that Montag has lifted from a burn site. He has collected many books over the last year, secretly wanting to learn what the big deal is about reading and books. His life is not happy like it is supposed to be. Everyone is supposed to be happy without books. Without needing to think, to question, to wonder. He wonders what life was like before life became \\"simple\\". But in reality, the simplicity of life is not the outcome from life without books. With murders and suicides and violence and life at high speed, life is very much complicated. People have only brainwashed themselves into thinking that life is simple and happy, because they no longer think for themselves.I read this book just in time for banned book week. I find it very interesting the reasons people choose to ban this book or that book. Religious content, political views, profanity, nudity, sexually explicit, homosexuality. And you know what I gather from those reasons, the people making the fuss are simply insecure individuals. Each one of those reasons are part of our everyday life. If you are secure in who you are, then you would not feel threatened by its content. But you know, this whole thing with banning books due to content actually promotes the non-thinking, non-opinionated aspects of the society in Fahenheit 451 from happening. When a book is banned or is labeled controversial, it makes people wonder. It piques curiosity to learn what is within those pages that someone finds offensive. Take The DaVinci Code for instance. 80 million copies sold in 6 years! 80 million! That is a staggering number, especially in the short amount of time it's been in print. Now if you took away the controversy, and no one made a fuss, how many copies do you think would have sold? I doubt that many! So I say fuss over books, it brings them to light to some one who may not have known about it otherwise. It promotes critical thinking, opinions, and who are we without our opinions and thoughts? I don't agree with banning books, just because the content is written down doesn't mean it's going to become part of society, because you know what, it already is! So who cares if it's written. People do do drugs. People do have sex. People do say bad words. People are homosexual. And yes, people do have different religious beliefs. Just because you ban a book, doesn't make those things go away. We are individuals. We are who we are. And no one should be able to take that away by saying we cannot write this or that."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is one of his finest works. It was first published in October of 1953, and then serialized in the March - May issues of Playboy magazine. The novel originally began as a short story \\"Bright Phoenix\\", though that was not published until 1963, and from there it was lengthened into the novelette \\"The Fireman\\" which was published in February of 1951 in \\"Galaxy Magazine\\". It is a novel of a dystopian society, and stands along with George Orwell's \\"1984\\" and Aldous Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\" as the best early examples of that type of work.Though it is easy to find similarities between \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" and the other two books, there are some key differences between them. In the earlier two works, the State appears to be the controlling force. We see this in the education centers in \\"Brave New World\\" and every aspect of the society in \\"1984\\", but in this work the society seems to have evolved from this through a change in social norms. People are judged by the number of wall sized televisions they have; books and intellectuals are spurned and eventually considered harmful to society. One should be happy, so news of the war is all in the background, and even the attempted suicide, or someone's death are mentioned in only in passing quickly and then the focus is back on happier subjects. People spend more time being entertained by a program called \\"My Family\\" then they spend interacting with their actual family, and for some children are a nuisance, so they are either not had, or if one has them they are sent off and only seen for short periods.One of the most effective parts of this short novel is the way he incorporates the feel of the society into his writing style. One of the key descriptions of the life which the hero, Fireman Guy Montag, is living is noise. He can't think, because of the noise of the televisions his wife has on, and it is apparent that he didn't even notice this until he met Clarisse McClellan, a free-spirited teenager who has moved in next door with her parents and her uncle. His conversations with her are different, they require thought, and there is time for him to think because they happen outside of the noise of life. This noise continues and gets worse when Clarisse disappears from his life, but she has helped bring forward his natural curiosity. The noise continues, and as Guy deals with his wife, her friends, his boss, the mechanical hound, the other firemen, the signs of war, an old professor acquaintance, etc. This noise is felt by the reader two, as Bradbury throws this mix together, though leaves it clear enough that the reader picks up on what is really going on.This noise is there through the first two sections of the book, and into the third section where at last Guy is pushed over the edge and commits the most desperate of acts, and by doing so he frees his mind. From then on, Guy is able to focus on the situation at hand, his being hunted, his escape, and his desire to save the thoughts and words of the books he has been destroying for so many years. He is able to discuss and think about the war and about Clarisse, his wife Mildred, and his actions; even though those are mostly sad and disturbing thoughts. The reader also feels the noise pressure is lifted, though he is certainly in danger.This is a tremendous book, though very short as far as novels go. It is not simply a rewrite of \\"Brave New World\\" or \\"1984\\". Those works were produced first, and those authors are often given more literary merit while Bradbury is too often thought of as a writer of speculative fiction. Those works teach us to be wary of the government becoming too powerful, while this work teaches us to be wary of our own laziness and the anti-intellectual movement of our society through entertainment such as television. This work also teaches us to be tolerant of those who are not like everyone else. This work was selected to receive the Retro Hugo in 2004 for novels written in the year 1953."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"&quot;Fahrenheit 451,&quot; a book in which the future is a scary place. In the beginning, however, it doesn't seem that way. Guy Montag is a fireman. His job is to create fires, not stop them. He burns books. Books, in this day and age, are illegal. Why? Because books promote thinking, and thinking creates ideas, and the leaders of the world don't want people thinking anymore.Montag steals one book, and then another, and another. He becomes fascinated with them so much, that he kills his superior officer when he finds out Montag has books.This book, although calm through most of the story, is a frightening look into the future. People don't think, so therefore, when someone gets killed, no one cares. There is a huge war going on, but no one knows why, and still no one cares.Bradbury really took the name of science fiction and put it to work, creating a book that was so unique it stretches your imagination beyond all belief."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"&quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; begins as an unremarkable piece of writing that makes you wish you had read it in Jr. High school when it would have seemed wondrous by virtue of the &quot;big ideas&quot; it contains. However, half-way through, author Ray Bradbury's dull prose suddenly turns pleasingly lyrical and, in terms of skill and style, catches up to the grandiose theme.The story takes place in a future where firemen no longer put out fires, they set fires - specifically, they set fires to books. The society in which this takes place is one where most people have become so deadened by the vacuous mass media television which pervades their existence, that they don't notice the absence of genuine thoughts or emotions in their lives. They are so numb that even their acts of suicide are committed absentmindedly.The novel follows fireman Guy Montag, who has an emotional epiphany when he meets one person who actually connects with his humanity in a life otherwise devoid of feeling. Feeling sets him to thinking and it's all downhill from there. While there are sections in the book where characters give majestic, pontificating soliloquies about the theme of book-burning which verge on Ayn Rand's literary bludgeonings in &quot;Atlas Shrugged,&quot; there is plenty of suspense and action to offset the grandstanding.Bradbury, known for his futuristic novels is actually more adept here at rendering beautiful descriptions of nature than he is at depicting a three-dimensional futuristic world. When Montag views the destruction of his city by atomic blast, it is less compelling that the simultaneous image of him smelling the leaves and dirt in the forest from where he watches.In some ways &quot;Fahrenheit 451,&quot; chosen by Los Angeles Mayor Kenneth Hahn, as the first selection for that city's participation in the &quot;One Book, One City&quot; reading promotion, was an odd one. The book is, in many ways, a running indictment of the cavernously empty entertainments that many local residents produce on a daily basis. But it's okay, they won't have time to read the book anyway. They're too busy making &quot;reality&quot; shows about adulterous couples on cruiseships which are surprisingly like the stupefying television shows depicted in the book. Maybe someone did read this after all."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"When I was in high School many moons ago, there were three books about the future that were required reading. Brave New World, 1984, and Fahrenheit 451. All three novels were dark looks at the future of a society that had lost its way. Fahrenhiet 451 is an a dark tale about the problems of modern life and how normal things taken for granted can be turned inside out. Bradbury's hero Montag, is a firemean that has the job of actually setting fires to burn books. For those of you who do not know, Fahrenheit 451 is the temperature that paper catches fire. His world is about modern convenience and the lack of intimacy that society had developed over time. His chance meeting with another leads Montag down a path from book burner to exile on the run trying to save what he once destroyed. Bradbury tells a tale of the redemption of a man and the hope of society by learning what is important. It is an excellent read and very thought provoking. For those of you who do not think that books can ever be burned, I named this review what I did because this book is on an official banned book list in the United States. What do those who want to ban books to our children fear from this book? Makes one wonder."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Play the man, Master Ridley; we shall this day light such a candle, by God's grace, in England as I trust shall never be put out. -Hugh LatimerGuy Montag is a Fireman, but in the future envisioned by Ray Bradbury, firemen don't put out fires, they start them. Firemen are responsible for burning books; all of which are banned, so that the people of this dystopia will not be troubled by difficult thoughts. Instead of reading, they watch endless soap operas on large screen TV's and the government provides for all their needs. Guy has had some qualms about his job, but he's never really thought through exactly what it is he's doing. But then, in short order, he meets an odd young neighborhood girl named Clarisse McClellan, his wife nearly kills herself with sleeping pills and, finally, when the firemen are called to an old woman's house, she refuses to leave:Montag placed his hand on the woman's elbow. &quot;You can come with me,&quot;&quot;No,&quot; she said. &quot;Thank you, anyway.&quot;&quot;I'm counting to ten,&quot; said Beatty. &quot;One. Two.&quot;&quot;Please,&quot; said Montag.&quot;Go on,&quot; said the woman.&quot;Three. Four.&quot;&quot;Here.&quot; Montag pulled at the woman.The woman relied quietly, &quot;I want to stay here.&quot;&quot;Five. Six.&quot;&quot;You can stop counting,&quot; she said. She opened the fingers of one hand slightly and in the palm of the hand was a single slender object.An ordinary kitchen match.And before they can light the fire, she lights it herself and Guy is forced to consider what it is about books that would make a person do such a thing. As he tells his wife:Last night I thought about all the kerosene I've used in the past ten years. And I though about books. And for the first time I realized that a man was behind each one of the books. A man had to think them up. A man had to take a long time to put them down on paper. And I'd never thought of that before.As it turns out, the old woman has, like Hugh Latimore, lit a fire that will change the world, because Guy joins the nascent resistance to the book-burning government.He remembers meeting an old man named Faber in a park some time earlier and the hunch he had that the man had a book. Indeed, when Guy tracks him down, it turns out that Faber was a professor and he explains to Guy why books are of value:Number one, ... quality of information. Number two: leisure to digest it. And number three: the right to carry out actions based on what we learn from the interaction of the first two.Each bolstering the other's confidence, Guy and Faber set out to resist the system and, ultimately, Guy escapes to the wilderness beyond the city, where wandering bands of men are preserving great texts in memory, against the day when the knowledge is needed and learning is again valued.While not quite in a league with Orwell or Koestler, Bradbury's classic tale is an important treatment of the central themes of the century (of every century). His vision of a society where people have traded freedom for security had a particular resonance during the Cold War, but it should continue to be read as a cautionary tale. We head to the new millennium in the midst of the most spectacular flowering of Freedom that the world has ever known, but there is a continual tension in the species, between those who value that freedom, whatever its costs, and those who would choose the security offered by a controlled society and those who are afraid of uncomfortable ideas. freedom has the upper hand, but the struggle continues...GRADE: A-"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 depicts the futuristic world that we all fear: One in which freedom of thought and speech are gone; a world where personal communication is cut down to a minimum, and machines and technology are considered friends. In this fictional (but possibly realistic world), pedestrians are few and far between, and firemen actually create fires rather than put them out. Fahrenheit 451 depicts the story of a fireman, Guy Montag, who is a typical twenty-first century citizen; self centered, obsessed with technology, and too busy to appreciate the simple things in life. After meeting a young lady named Clarisse, Montag engages in deep conversations with her, in which he learns to like the small things. Eventually, she even gets him to like the very things that he burns: Books. Meeting this girl also makes him realize how dull and boring his friends and family are, especially his wife. In a climactic ending, Montag escapes from his city after killing the fire-chief and running away with several books. He arrives at a small village of people who each have memorized one book, so as to keep the stories alive (whether or not they physically exist). This book is right next to 'The Martian Chronicles' as far as the best sci-fi books go. As is the case with all of his books, Bradbury paints a picture of a society which has much in common with ours today. He points out the various flaws in our world, but also shows us that there is still hope yet.

But when one woman refuses to leave her home and then stoicly burns beside her collection of books, Montag dares to wonder if all books are so dangerous as the government has trained him to believe.Of course, I can't forget to mention Clarisse, a young woman who seems interested in helping Montag decide for himself whether or not his line of work is justified or foolishly cruel.Fahrenheit 451 is about censorship and the lengths that a future government might go to to restrict the public's ability to access past knowledge. Orwell's 1984 was a slightly better example of this kind of story, but that doesn't take away from the satisfaction of Mr. Bradbury's finely written classic. The book's pace becomes incredibly exciting as Montag learns of his mistakes and decides to go against the common will. The fugitive chase and scholarly transients who keep passages of important texts in their memories(the Bible seems a popular choice of Bradbury)is a near perfect final touch.Go ahead, read this book.

This is definitely one of the more thought provoking books I have ever read in my 13 years on this earth. Considering that it was written nearly 30 years ago, it is quite remarkable in its prophecy. Just look at what's happening in this country today - countless numbers of mindless chatterboxes on every one of our 325 or so cable stations babbling on about Monica Lewinsky or OJ Simpson or George Bush's alleged cocaine use, or some other utterly senseless topic. And just look at all of these old fools in congress and the senate with nothing better to do than talking about Monica Lewinsky and preaching morality to all of us while they're all sleeping around on their own wives. I think the time is already here. There is no desire in this country for any meaningful ruminations of philosophy or history or the meaning of life. We have become that nation of vain, selfish dullards with no other goal in life except to make ourselves happy with our big screen tv sets and our armies of idiot babblers to tell us what to think.

Reading this book today one wonders how a writer 50 years ago could have so much insight into the society we live in today.Yes its about censorship, but its also about today's media and advertising culture. People are fed the news and told what opinion they should have about it... why bother thinking yourself?The parts of the book about television and how the media ties into law enforcement are chilling, in light of the new &quot;Amber Alerts&quot; adopted across the country.Good books make you think about your world, and this one makes you wonder how Bradbury could have known.The afterward (or coda) was priceless, and its comments on censorship and &quot;editing&quot; are far more frightening than people showing up to burn your books.&quot;I will not go gently onto a shelf, degutted, to become a non-book.&quot;"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book points out while at the absolute extreme mind you what the negative effects of censoring books can be. It is Ironic that this book is on the list of top 100 books challenged between 1990 and 2000. Besides being a great social commentary/civil liberties book, it is an exciting book. If you are in the mood just for a good page turner, read the book, if you are in the mood for a good social commentary, read the book.The story is basically about a man with an empty life who's job is to go around burning the homes of people who own books.

Fahrenheit 451 is one of those books that you just can't put down. It's hard to say why, but you pick it up saying to yourself, \\"I'll just read a few pages,\\" and you end up reading for an hor or two because of the way it puls you in. The conflict starts imddediately, solving the problem of a slow beginning that some novels have. The very first few paragraphs show Guy Montag's love for fire that eventually becomes his personal struggle as well as the struggle of the world throughout the novel. There is alot of foreshadowing that you don't really recognize until you see what it's lead to, such as how Beatty doesn't run out of the kerosene-filled house as the others, but walks slowly almost delaying when the old lady pulls out a match. In leads into something very strange later on, but I don't want to give it away. This novel plays off the old concept of how you never really know how valuable something is until its taken away, playing on something as important as making books not only rare but illegal in the future. It also shows how destructive the world has and will become, with wars lasting technically 48 hours, and are decided in less time than it takes to blink.

The style is very good and it's loaded with phrases and metaphors for you to figure out well into the night. Nevertheless, I loved it and it's one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"FAHRENHEIT 451 is a grim yet thought-provoking novel of a dystopian future. Other novels that show a bleak future--1984 and BRAVE NEW WORLD come to mind--focus on what their authors see as the root cause of the implosion of human values. Ray Bradbury envisions this implosion as a gradual process of extreme cultural homogenization that, in the words of the novel's antagonist, Fire Captain Beatty, reduces 'everyone to the consistency of paste pudding.' Whatever it is that stamps one individual as different from another, the society of FAHRENHEIT 451 ruthlessly if not mindlessly grinds down and out that uniqueness that once marked a creative thinker.Guy Montag is a fireman who likes his job, which is to start fires and not extinguish them. He burns books to ashes, and then burns the ashes, as his firemen's slogan boasts. He sees nothing wrong with that, and at the start of the book, he is not unlike nearly everyone else in his acceptance of the Way of Things. Yet, Bradbury hints early on that Montag's mind and soul are ripe for a literary infection that is just as contagious as the Black Plague ever was. He meets a young girl Clarisse, who insists on asking him questions whose apparent nonsensical purpose is really meant to probe the paper thin layer of protection that Montag had built up over the years. She asks him if he is happy. She asks him if he has ever looked at the moon. With these seemingly innocuous questions, she infects Montag with the forbidden desire to know the 'why' of things. By the end of their first meeting, Montag now knows that his life has been a cotton candy lie. For the first time in his life, he can see that the society in which he lives is dedicated to the ultimate communistic ideal: each citizen is encouraged to reach only to a preordained level. To attempt to reach beyond that lies the swift punishment of the flamethrowers and the Mechanical Hounds. After only a few days, Montag is now stealing and reading forbidden books. The plot is not what sells the book or what has made it required reading on most college and high school campuses. The lure of FAHRENHEIT 451 is the manner in which Bradbury weaves the threads of present day trends of soap operas and quiz shows into a quilt whose collective and stifling weight crushes individualism just as surely as Orwell's Big Brother does in 1984. Bradbury uses a number of symbols (fire, books, the salamander, the Phoenix) which allow the reader to view a troika of social elements that contained within themselves the promise of death to the Thinking Man. Bradbury creates a triangle of public school education, technology, and interpersonal relations, all of which are perverted to create a society whose primary function is to use one's brains as minimally as possible for unthinking personal pleasure. The school system drills learning by rote in children's minds. No books are need for that. Technology provides huge televisions so that the stars of these shows interact with an audience to the extent that true human relations are shunted aside for a fake television 'family.' Personal relations of family and friends are then limited to inane conversations of the type that we here in the real world see on our tv commercials. Montag sees his wife Mildred as bad off as any of her equally brain-dead friends. He tries to infect her and them with the same teasing questions about the Meaning of Life that Clarisse used on him so successfully. To his horror, Montag learns that they are immune to the germ of curiosity. He cannot change his society, though he tries mightily by plotting with a former college professor named Faber to plant forbidden books in the homes of firemen. He learns that since he cannot change society, he must leave it.One of the best parts of the book is the cat and mouse game that Fire Captain Beatty plays with Montag. Beatty is seen as a man who once had been infected with the bug of individualism, but had since 'cured' himself and now is determined to cure Montag. Their extended dialogue is one of the great literary dialogues between oppressor and oppressed. Beatty explains how his society came to be and Montag learns that somewhere along the line, the process went horribly wrong. By the novel's end, the reader can only hope that the literary virus of infection will never meet its cure. For Ray Bradbury, this cure was not very far away. For Guy Montag, the cure was even closer."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This one of those books that are like no others that I have read.

A man soon sees that it is wrong to set books on fire and tries to stop all that are against books. I think this is really a book like no other."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I originally picked up Farenheit 451 for a summer reading book but in being touched deeply by this book and the realization that the book wasn't on my summer reading list I realized it was much more than just a quick read. I love reading but this book really made me think about how some of my friends despise reading. Now, it doesn't seem like much, but in Guy Montag's society, the main character, reading and just owning books was a crime. I started thinking about how much knowledge can be attained through books, and this book made me think about what books offer. That is because this book offers so much to the reader. The only thing I didn't like about this book was that it had no closing to the story. I personally like closings but some people like to imagine the end and it always works for teachers to have a finish the book kind of project. But anyway, this is a truly great book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Guy Montag, a futuristic fireman, works for the fire station where the goal is not putting out fires, but starting them. That is what they do. In this futuristic book, books are not allowed. If you are caught with books, your house will be burnt to ashes. One day on the job, Montag is sent to a woman's house to destroy it. The woman refuses to leave the house and is killed in the fire. Montag wonders what would possess a woman to do such a thing. Montag remains bothered by his event for a long time. He is unable to go on with his daily routine as he did before. After meeting with professor Faber, an old friend of Montag's, he receives a book from the professor and takes it home and begins to read. Montag quickly falls in love with the literature he is reading.Montag's life begins to fall apart when his wife reports him to the fire department. While on duty one day Montag answers a call to his own home. He arrives just as his wife, Mildred, is leaving. With Faber's advice, Montag rebels against the society killing his ex coworkers. Montag escapes the law and finds a group of people much like himself. Together they cultivate the knowledge they have gathered over the years and await a time in which they will be able to share the knowledge.Fahrenheit 451 is a well-written novel that invokes thoughts and questions in the reader's mind. Bradbury is a descriptive writer who paints a picture of a society that is not unrealistic or unimaginable. Written just after the era of Stalin, Fahrenheit 451 deals with oppression and an overly powerful society. Complete with futuristic technology and entertainment, Fahrenheit 451 is worth reading."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451, I am not a huge fan of science ficion, but I decided to read this book for class. It was really distubring book about future socitey. Something really disturbs me about this book;it is that fire fighters are starting the fires but their true job is to put fires out. What I like about this book is that Clarisse helps Montag to understand about books, so that's why montag starts hiding books in his house. My opinion to you is that whatever you do,try not to read this book. I know you won't like it. I know I didn't."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It was very confusing at some parts.

This book was not all that good but it brought out some specific details that the people on earth should really think about. Things such as reading and thinking for themselves. It also shows how the world would be if people don't stop taking books for granted and start reading and understanding these things because they can really help you out in the world today. This book wasn't really good but it made me think. Some people I know never read a book in their life because they say they are boring or the fact that they don't have time to read. At times, I'm like that. But I know and understand the importance of reading. Eventhough what I am saying isn't anything about the book, I'm just str8ning the facts."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury's attempt to pull us into a futuristic world juxtaposed with elements of the early half of this century did amaze me. It was an easy read, but I found that some people have expanded the meanings of this novel through a bizarre form of free-flowing symbolism. They have deemed it a modern American Literature Symbolism Bible, a title that I personally abhor. It's a good book, but not one of such importance that one should completely be absorbed in its meaning weeks after reading. This book's portrayal of Dentim's Dentifrice could be the key to understanding life, but I seriously doubt it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, is an interesting tale of a strange and ominous future which is hauntingly convincing. It is the story of a man named Guy Montag, who's job it is to burn books. He loves his job until he meets a girl named Clarisse McClellan. When she disappears Montag begins to further question his job and his world. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The story was quite fascinating and I could often relate to the characters. I also liked Bradbury's descriptions of various objects in the book. However, the most amazing thing about the book was that the strange and twisted world it describes did not seem that far off. This is especially remarkable as the book was written forty six years ago. Bradbury was able to predict many things that would happen, for example the increasing picture quality and use of the Television. I would recommend this book to people who like science-fiction or futuristic books. I would not recommend it to people who prefer more traditional books. I would also not recommend it who will get annoyed by an eccentric writing style or find it hard to understand as even I did a few times."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book really makes you think and most of the things that are in this book about teens and technology is coming true in our world today, kinda scary."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Being one of the first Anti- Utopian stories I've read, it was very formative on how I look at life.

I can compare this futuristic story with that of Huxley's Brave New World and Orwell's 1984, both of which I read right before this one. I kind of think that this one was totally more interesting that the other two, no doubt about it. It's primarily about a fireman, Montag, who works for a book-burning fire deparment. One day the thought of reading those books that he burns crosses his minds. As a result, he steals some and hides them in his home. His wife, Mildred, reports him and all of a sudden he becomes a wanted fugitive. You wanna know how to the book ends? I suggest you read it. =P It makes you actually wonder about what the near future will bring us. Kinda spooky, eh? When you're not allowed to voice ur opinions like I'm doing now.

Ok, not to be rude or anything. =o) L8rz."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The protagonist in this story by Ray Bradbury, was a fireman named Guy Montag. The main antagonist was Captain Beatty who was the chief of the firemen. The story takes place in the future in a city like any other today. The only difference is that everything is run by computers and books are illegal to read and own. Unlike today, where firemen stop fires, their job was to burn books and houses they were in. It did not matter if there people in them or not. As the story developes, Montag becomes curious about what the prohibited books contain, so he steals them. Towards the end of the book he gets caught and becomes a fugitive. Although the book has a good message, it was extremely boring. It made us reflect on our own lifestyles, yet we didn't enjoy the way Bradbury wrote it. It was dry and basically boring. Yet the theme about finding our humanity and ourselves was eye opening. It made us wonder if our civilization will end up as Bradbury's novel depicts. Will we end up, so wrapped up in ourselves and our technology that we will no longer have time to love others and have a mind of our own? Or will we just walk through life, not feeling any emotions whatsoever towards anyone or anything and believe, in our dogmatic way, that this is happiness?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book although very confusing , as the author uses too much detail , was intruiging .

As I read this book, I got more and more confused. The plot twisted and turned and left me hanging wondering \\"wait... what happened?\\". Mr. Bradbury used large words that I learned as vocab. I would recommend this book to no one under the age of about 13, maybe 12. I chose this age because of the hard concepts of burning books and the fast-moving plot of the hound."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book was very interesting, but I wouldn't consider it a Sci-Fi. It takes place in the future, and firemen don't put out fires, they start them. Its about a fireman named Montag who starts to question the law that says you are not aloud to have books, and his adventure after. It was a difficult book to read, but there were some good vocabulary terms. It was also very descriptive. On a scale one to ten I would give it a six. It was a very creative story, but I am not a fan of many futuristic books.

It was a bit weird for my liking."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I heard so much about this book before I finally picked it up. And when I did get around to reading it...I wasn't impressed. Yes, the author's ideas are scary: That in the future, firemen set fires to burn books. One firefighter, Guy Montag, begins to look at his life more closely and discovers how empty it is. He begins to take books home from many of the places he has destroyed. Clarisse, Guy's next door neighbor, and seemingly the one that set his book-stealing into motion, is one of the most interesting characters. Unfortunately, she disappears without much explanation. I did see some good messages in this vision of the future, but I felt a little bit cheated too, because I wanted to get a better glimpse at this society that spawned this fire fighter-book burners. I'm not debating if it should be a classic or not, I'm just saying it was not personally a very good book to me."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Sure, this book gives some harsh warnings about the desensitization of our culture and the withering away of intellectual importance, but its radical premise detracts from the story's legitimacy and worth. Bradbury anticipates a complete elimination of all books and literature, and I do agree that we are moving in a more automated, fast-paced society with less emphasis on love and personal relationships. But we will never reach such an extreme level, its simply a rediculous concept. I contest that we cannot worry about whether others are getting their daily dose of Shakespeare, Joyce or the Bible, and if we choose to read on our own, we will always have the chance to do so. I imagine that if you are reading this review, you don't run a high risk of losing interest in books in your lifetime. Yes, Bradbury does offer a striking prophesy of the direction of societal development, but to use this book as the basis for an outrcy against our culture's future is ludicrous."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I am a huge science fiction fan and heard from many people that this is one of the ultimate Sci-fi classics.

Do not waste your time reading Fahrenheit 451."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book painted a very dark and bleak future for mankind. Part of the future is firemen that don't fight fires but rather burn books. Why? Because the powers that be determined that what was in books could offend, confuse, depress, and sadden people, etc.Fahrenheit 451 depicts a society where it is best to make books illegal and burn them in order to keep society &quot;politically correct&quot;. Just keep people happy watching television and and doing other mindless activities.I thought the book was well done in depicting the dilemna one firefighter faces and the actions he takes while living and working in such a world.The book probably deserves 3 1/2 stars."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This Book is very cool. I liked it a lot, because of it's seeming reality to real life. The reason this book is so freaky is that it's slowly coming true. I really liked the way it ended, also the way you struggled with Guy Montag(the hero) as he struggled with himself. This book is really cool."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is an unusual book about an alternate future. In this book, firemen have to start fires instead of putting them out. But they don't just randomly burn down peoples houses. They burn down the ones in which people have books; you may by thinking why would they care about books. Well, in this alternate future, books are illegal. I bet that this seems very ironic to you, but yes, it is a book about there being no books. I didn't like this book. I felt that that his writing style was very unusual. The author, Ray Bradbury, didn't have difficult sentences, but he did seem to jump around. He would never be very clear. Within each and every page he would jump around, or lose the readers attention by rambling on in an unorthodox style. If there were a prime age group for this book it would have to be junior high schoolers to high schoolers. That is probably because it is about that difficulty and this alternate future may be the most appealing to this age."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"First off, I have to say that the idea isn't that far fetched. It's hard to imagine that someone in 1953 could depict our life so close to what it is like today. Television seems to run our lives and less people settle themselves in books. I say this because I'm one of them, although I do enjoy a good sci-fi novel (ie. 1984, Dune, Brave New World). That said, I have to conclude that Bradbury did in fact write a flop! It is true what they say about how you can't buy a book by it's cover. I, just as many others, was encouraged to read from the title. The concept is excellent and to a point, realistic. What seems &quot;wrong&quot; with the book however is the lack of depth the other characters have. Clarise, the girl who turned Guy Montag's head in the other direction, who had great potential, dies in the begining of the book. Her death seems meaningless as a result of lack of depth... Mildred, Guy's wife, who turns in her own husband, also lacks depth. The second reason which makes this book a flop is the lack of a conclusion. Not to spoil the ending of these great literary pieces, but the main characters in 1984, Brave New World, and Dune either die, are defeated, or emerge victorious (not in that order). But in F451, Guy ends up roaming the lands with a bunch of Harvard and Yale hobos. The government, Big Brother, or whatever you want to call it, which was so obviously against him, couldn't care less if he existed. And Guy's cause failed to alter anything, other than relocating him to the woods. There seemed to be no major conflict. Sure, people will argue that the chase was a conflict, but it was not solved. Now, if this book was part of a trilogy, then maybe there is some reason to leaving the question unanswered to what was the purpose of Guy's puiny uproar. But the fact is that the book is cut short. It deserved a better ending or even a better beginning. Whatever the case I felt thirsty for more at the end of the book, I had many questions unanswered, like what really happened to Clarisse, was she killed by a racing car or was she hiding from the government too? Does Faber get in touch with those printing guys or is he caught by Big Brother? There needn't be a happy ending, but to deprive the audience of an ending of any type spells out B A D S T Y L E."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is about a fireman named Guy Montag. He lives in a day and age of very high technology. Instead of having televisions they have \`parlors'. Which are rooms where pictures are displayed on the walls and it is very interactive. Guy's job as a fireman is not an ordinary fireman's job. In this future time houses have been made fire proof. Therefore there is no need for firemen who go put out fires. However the government has banned all books from the United States. They figure any book can cause disagreement by someone. Even the smallest minority could find a book that they think is prejudice towards them. Hence, Guy's job as a fireman is to burn any and all books that are found. However, a young girl moves in next door to Guy. She stimulates his interest in books. At first she just tries to get him to slow down in a world that is constantly speeding up. She tells him to stop and smell the flowers. This girl is found dead, but she left an impression on Guy Montag. Guy collects books from the ones they go and burn. He begins to hate is job as a fireman. He finds a man that also likes books and has been planning to destroy what the fireman do. Then, Guy Montage is reported to have books in his house. While on the job the fireman receive a call to go and burn some books. Guy is startled when they pull up in front of his house. The head fireman gives a blow torch to Guy and has him do it himself. Guy burns his entire house down, but by now he has almost gone insane. He ends up killing the head fireman and running. The authorities chase him for hours. Guy is able to escape down the river. He finds a group of people who all have ran away because they love books. Soon after he leaves the city the next world war starts. Guy's city is one of the first to get flattened by bombs. The people in the city had no warning. They were told it would never come so close. Guy Montag and the head fireman, Beatty, where actually very much alike. In the beginning they both went out and burned books with no second thoughts. However, Guy soon begins to think about what he is doing. This is when we find out that Beatty also once read books. Beatty found burning the books as an escape to loving them. When Beatty is about to be killed by Guy, Beatty does no try to move or jump away. He seems to just stay in place like he is ready to die. He has burnt enough books and he is ready for it to end. Death is his new escape. In this novel, Ray Bradbury shows us the importance of books and what could happen if we forget about books and what they teach us about ourselves."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is a bit boring once you start reading it, but it is a good book after you get into it.

But its not. Or maybe if it was written before the genre defining steps made in 1984. But its not. It is simply self delusional in attempting to convey an idea, plot or any form of characterisation.For starters, why did a fireman after 10 years of diligently loving his job suddenly realises the futile nature of his ways after listening to a girl talk rubbish for 2 minutes intervals over a 4 day period? Why is it OK to get high on drugs and drive 90MPH around everywhere, but not read a book about philosophy in case a conceivable minority gets offended!? And why are books banned but every other type of media isn't. The book seems to suggest its their inherently edgy content, so why just ban particular books? Why employ an entire emergency service to do this job? And most importantly, how could any of the technological devices be engineered with the risk of the fire department coming round your house at any given moment to burn it down if you dared read a single book!? This could be all be forgiven if it was written well or follows an interesting story, but it just fails in every sense of the word. I have no idea why this book got so famous, it is plain stupid."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"When looking for a book to read, do not pick this one. I give this book two out of five stars because I did not understand the language, it is irrelevant to the world today, and some parts of the book make no sense.The book Fahrenheit 451 is written by Ray Bradbury in the 1900s. It is about a fireman named Guy Montag, and is based in the future. But instead of putting out fires, like today, the firemen in this book do the opposite: burn books.I read this book about two months ago in English class. I have written an essay about many topics that come up from this book, and have done other things with it.First, this book is full of crazy metaphors and similes. I did not understand most of them. Some have nothing at all to do with any of the material or other parts in the book. It's as if you have to be super smart just to read and understand this book.Second, the author makes references to the book being how life will be in the future, but it is not. We are not obsessed with our TV's and being chased around by huge robot dogs. It makes no sense to say something like this, and then it not be true. I know he wrote this a long time and that is what he thought, but still.Finally, some parts of the book make no sense. Like the part where the main character seems to be talking to himself, but he actually isn't. I did not know this, and neither will most readers. The author should have made this clearer to the reader.Something I did find good in this book, however, is the fact that the author is very creative and is very good at writing action and suspense scenes. For example, when Montag, the main character, tries to cross this one huge street, and there as a car coming straight at him quite fast.I do not recommend you to read this book. You should definitely pick a different more interesting book to read, and one that will possibly make more sense than this one.Written by Kelsey Lamb6th period English"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book was confusing at times...boring at other...down right cruel at other.

For example, when the city is bombed, there should be some line of chaos and the people inhabiting the city running for their lives.

Editing was either skipped altogether or done by a blind man...one of the two.Overall, though, 'Fahrenheit 451' is an average book. I did not feel connected with any of the characters, and could've cared less what happened to Montag. Clarisse disappeared too early without much reason as to why--I assumed her being hit by a car was false, but apparently not--and the future looks bland to me. Luckily, though, I won't be around to see it.(Also, the &quot;war&quot; seemed tacked on without any real reason as to its existence in the story, save for maybe wiping out the human race so we could start over.)Not a great book.

Those deeply passionate about reading and literature will be greatly disturbed (and even devastated) by the bleak world Bradbury depicts in this novel, a world in which books are illegal and burned.I loved that this book gives us pause to think about what books mean to each of us and what their role and purpose is in society and to humanity as a whole. A small tome, it is rife with provocative and serious questions that could lead to many lively discussions. There's a lot of great symbolism running throughout, and is very meaty intellectually speaking.However, there were a few things about the novel that were somewhat regretable, in my opinion. First, the book felt very dated to me; without knowing when exactly it had been published, I was able to identify the decade based on the prose. Also, I generally did not respond to Bradbury's writing, which I found to be folksy and inelegant. I do not think that this book is considered a classic because of the magnificance of the author's writing, that's for sure!Ultimately, this is an important book that everyone ought to read and discuss. It will probably have the greatest impact if you read it as a teen, but if you missed out on it during your high school years, as I did, better to read it late than never. It's a shame about the actual writing, but the issues it examines transcend the weak prose."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A wonderful read.

Maybe it is because it is outshined by the other more well-known dystopia: 1984 and Brave New World. But again, better late than never.The book tells a story from a world without books, when you have a Gestapo-like-secret-police (which is played by fire fighters! believe it or not), which will burn all of your books if you are stashing them.The idea itself quite surprised me, especially since it was written before the era of TV and Internet like nowadays. Only a genius can write something like this, predicting the future decades ahead. The writer concerned about the decline of reading culture, taken over by audio-visual culture, such as TV and now, the Internet. When everything is about entertainment, politics, news, even crime scene and the advance of REALITY SHOW!. How close can it be to nowadays reality.His premise is quite believable. Even some publisher in my country are afraid to print books which are sensitive, afraid that it might offend certain group. Just months ago, the publisher burn the book because of the pressure of religious group, a book writer which are beaten because her ideas are blasphemous. If this continues, the days when publishers stop publishing books about ideas, because it might offend people, are closer than we think.This books are inline with Marshall McLuhan's The Medium is The Messageand Neil Postman'sAmusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business. They are the prophets who shout in the middle of the desert, \\"Beware you commoners, thy world is bleak as long as you are stuck in front of your TV! Read books! Think for yourself.\\"This book remind me why I love sci-fi books. Because of its prophetic nature. The only cause I do not give a five star is because its rambling dialogue. I still prefer Neil Postman's Amusing Ourselves to Death, even though it is a non-fiction, because it is more entertaining."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A compelling book, creating within a desire - a thirst - for knowledge, and a sense of need - need to be an agent of change. Bradbury uses the illustration of an elder who has passed, and when the elder is passed, the mournfulness isn't for the elder but for the what the elder will never do again; hands that had always been active, creating, crafting, and mending would never again create, would never again craft, would never again mend, would never again influence the lives of those around them. For what will you be remembered; for what will you be mourned - for what will I be mourned.Read it - and be changed.\\"And on either side of the river was there a tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month; And the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.\\"Rating System* = tripe** = okay read*** = good read**** = excellent read***** = life changing read"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Very interesting perspective on what the world might be like if automation took over and humanity accepted it !!!Kind of scary to think about.Classic book that I have been trying to find time to read for years.Glad I did."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"What can be said about Ray Bradbury's F. 451?

It's a short read. Short, poignant, and scarily accurate for today's world."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is the fourth time I've read this book, though the first time in over 15 years. It's a science fiction classic about firemen who burn books in a not too distant and far too dystopian future. Bradbury is a great storyteller and weaves an amazingly lyrical narrative. It first grabbed me in childhood as an exciting adventure with a very vivid portrayal of the life of Guy Montag, fireman turned rebel.One of the delightful things I discovered in this re-reading was the idea of the proper relationship to books. The government represented by the firemen sees books as a hazard that causes both inequality (reading books makes people think they're better than others) and rancor (people may disapprove of how they (as minorities) are depicted in books). The citizens have fallen away from reading and are constantly plugged in to their living rooms, which are now nothing other than parlors with wall-sized TVs on every wall. Montag's wife wants them to buy a fourth wall TV to complete the room. If she isn't watching TV, she's listening to audio programs on little seashell devices in her ears. Books don't even register as reality for her; when Montag brings them into the house she is filled with horror at what they mean. Not that they contain horrible ideas, but that their house will be burned down if they are discovered. It's as if the government had already won their point.On the other hand, Montag learns to appreciate books, first by meeting Clarisse. She's the seventeen-year old neighbor with the funny family (her uncle was once arrested for driving too slowly at 40 miles an hour). She is interested in nature and people. She has real conversations with Montag about things that matter. She is a catalyst for Montag to explore the forbidden fruit he has been roasting for so long.Like any amateur, he makes a bit of a mess in how he handles things. He tries to convince his wife's friends that they should listen to books but they all recoil in horror. He tries to play cat-and-mouse with his boss at the firehouse but he is not up to the challenge. He eventually has to flee for his life.He falls in with a group of people who have been memorizing books, to preserve them for the time when the culture is ready. Interestingly, they constantly tell themselves that they are not more important or better than others for what they are doing. They are keeping a trust for civilization. In one scene, Montag is talking to Faber, a former professor who has been keeping a low profile though is in touch with the book people. Faber explains the difference between four-wall TVs and books:.\\"..you can't argue with the four-wall televisor. Why? The televisor is 'real.' It is immediate, it has dimension. It tells you what to think and blasts it in. It must be right. It seems so right. It rushes you on so quickly to its own conclusions your mind hasn't time to protest, 'What nonsense!'\\"[Montag:]\\"Only the 'family' is 'people.'\\"\\"I beg pardon?\\"\\"My wife says books aren't 'real.'\\"\\"Thanks God for that. You can shut them, say, 'Hold on a moment.' You play God to it. But who has ever torn himself from the claw that encloses you when you drop a seed in a TV parlor? It grows you any shape it wishes! It is an environment as real as the world. It becomes and is truth. Books can be beaten down with reason. But with all my knowledge and skepticism, I have never been able to argue with a one-hundred-piece symphony orchestra, full color, three dimensions, and being in and part of those incredible parlors.\\"The difference is between what's engaging and what's overwhelming. Books are a help in understanding reality, not a substitute for it or a way to tune reality out (though certainly some have used books that way). They help the reader to understand other people, other times, other places. But they don't force you to agree with them. The proper attitude toward books is not one of hostility or fear or submission. It's of wonder and learning and growing.The book is definitely worth reading and worth re-reading. Bradbury's death a few months ago really is a great loss.Hear some better commentary on A Good Story is Hard to Find, which is what inspired me to re-read the book. And now I am finally starting Jane Eyre, which they discussed quite a while ago."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This gripping dystopian classic hooks you from the start and thrills as the narrative moves eerily forward. Bradbury's ephemeral writing style may not be instantly accessible to some, but readers can lessen the distance they might feel between the Fahrenheit 451 world and characters by simply diving into the text and enjoying the surreal ride while not getting caught up in specific verbiage. Censorship remains a relevant topic and all those interested in science fiction and socio-political trends will find this tale fascinating."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This has been a classic all my adult life, and, given its topic, I'm somewhat embarrassed that I haven't read it before. While I knew the story, I wanted to see how the metaphor was developed and I was also curious about how this 1953 work held up.The message holds up. There are still censors (TX will not teach higher order thinking skills) and proverbial book burners. Bradbury showed that people, by general disinterest can abet censorship. Not all the police state defenders are \\"sold\\". Citizens find it in their interest to speak out about how books can make you unhappy, cause divisiveness, etc. Beatty, a leader of the censorship fire troops, spouts classical literature and poetry in much the way today's family values politicians exhibit their cognitive dissonance.The text is wordy. The \\"50th Anniversary\\" paperback edition has an interview with Bradbury at the end. He said this was originally a 25,000 word story that he later doubled in size for a novel. The stretching clearly shows.After 58 years, while the theme holds up reasonably well, but the particulars are dated and may be more so as years go on. The main characters are all white men. The two main females are stereotypes: the bored housewife and the ingenue. Many cigarettes are lit. Many Millennials would probably not recognize Beatty's literary references and the literature noted as being preserved is probably not what would be the choices of today.Some of Bradbury's future has arrived. The wall has come to us as Skype, with real people. The Hound is the drone. The seashell phone is now the cell phone. The TV style viewer is the I-Pad. It seems the Freedom to Read issues are settled (but the access issues are not).Bradbury gets 5 stars for the metaphor, but, unfortunately, its development suffers by padding a short story into a novel."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"\\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is part of the troika of great dystopian novels of the 20th century, along with \\"1984\\" and \\"Brave New World.\\" What makes this book even more disturbing is the seemingly voluntary oppression of ignorance of a fun-seeking society turning fascist from within. Ray Bradbury considered this his only work of science-fiction, where he defines the genre as something that would at some point become possible. Contrary to expectations of self-preventing prophecies, these books are at least as relevant today as they were 50 years ago. We are faced with questions of personal freedom where it interferes with national security. Social media changed and continue to change our private life in a way that lets a handful of companies monitor our every move already. We can find almost any information on the internet which may just cover up the relevant and confirmed facts in favor of those that are spread the fastest - we're happy as long as we are entertained (whatever that means).This book is a great piece of literature that will keep you thinking for a long time after putting it down. There is an afterword and a coda to the story which reveals a little more of Ray Bradbury's own thoughts. For me, this was probably the most controversial part where I was missing a clear distinction between censorship and an editing process. I don't think that minorities threaten the liberty of arts - nor should they - when it comes to civil rights and equality."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I never really enjoyed science fiction, but something about this book caught my eye. The story revolves around one lone fireman, Guy Montag, who, oddly enough, sets fire to books instead of putting them out. He lives in a world that doesn't like to see unhappiness and the real truth, so they destroy books and all that causes unhappiness. When he meets a girl who, unlike all of the others, &quot;thinks,&quot; not only about life and the deeper meaning behind the events which happen in our daily lives, which we don't acknowledge because we are all so busy, he becomes obsessed with finding out the truth behind those books and behind life. Along the way, he meets Faber, the elderly man who guides him on his journey. There is a certain tragedy in this book, and although the events in this book don't happen in life verbatim, it is remarkably similar to events which happen in everyday life. This appeared to have been a spiritual experience, not only for the characters, but for the author Ray Bradley. The characters are so tortured inside, caught between what they are expected to do and what they know is right. This book made me think more about what life really is about. And, as demonstrated in this book so many times, you never know when your life is going to end, so as it says in the book: &quot;Stuff your eyes with wonder. Live as if you'd drop dead in 10 seconds. See the world. It's more fantastic than any dream made or paid for in factories. Ask no guarantees, ask for no security, there never was such an animal. And if there were, it would be related to the great sloth which hangs upside down in a tree all day, every day, sleeping its life away.&quot;"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"We were assigned to read this book in our English 9 class, and never before have I read something nearly as interesting as this.

But I fear that such a future isn't to far off !"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This classic dystopian novel must be read by anyone with a passion for literature. It reminds us in enormous sharp signs that books will only maintain an importance in our lives if we keep them actively alive by relating them to our present society. Montag is like many of us, going through every day life and responding to things in the correct way. When one day he receives a kind of wake up call. Revived to life he struggles with his moral sensibility over whether to abandon his home or remain in a life clustered in routine mindlessness. Clarisse is the beacon of hope in our lives. She is our belief that a common sense will prevail in the wake of senselessness. The depictions of our society as media-drenched placid reflections of ourselves is indeed accurate. In almost every creation Mr Bradbury made in this novel a direct parallel can be found in our society such as Montag's wife's television family where a popular computer game today is call The Sims where you create your own families. The statements he makes aren't much more complicated than that, but it is a powerful message indeed and a highly creative and entertaining story."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In a world where imagination and fantasy are shunned upon, there isn't much room for Clarisse McClellan...the young teenage neighbor of Guy Montag. Montag is a fireman unlike the ones today...his group is employed to burn the books the radicals conceal. Ray Bradbury's prediction of the future shows a world in which questions and ideas are damaging, and the only information you are given are minor details. The books are burned for this very reason, Fire Captain Beatty explains this best, \`...and the books say nothing! Nothing you can teach or believe. They're about nonexistent people, figments of imaginations, if they're fiction. And if they're nonfiction, its worse, one professor calling another an idiot...you come away lost.' Clarisse McClellan is Montag's guide to see the way life was. Enjoying the finer things we see and take for granted, like picking dandelions and skipping on the sidewalk. Simple pleasures have become insignificant, and Montag realizes he's part of the problem. After Clarisse mysteriously disappears, Montag begins to hide books in his house, beginning to regain what he never knew he lost. At home he's not alone. In fact he's married and living with his wife Mildred. Mildred is a constant reminder of the pathetic not-so distant future that lies ahead. She spends most of her time with her \`television family', a collection of three large walls in which you interact with the sets. As Montag begins to learn about the past, Mildred gets suspicious and turns him in. The end may surprise you when Montag realizes what he's supposed to do... This book portrayed a hazy, gray picture of the future, much like the book 1984. Although, it did not emphasize key points of the books with any tension or suspense. Overall, this book laid an important lesson upon me, and that is to take this book not as a lesson, but a warning."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This masterful work of future prevention as Bradbury furvently declares it speaks volumes about the ease in which even a society such as our own (especially a society such as our own) can censor the voices of freedom that speak through books. Even though some of the material and references employed are a bit dated, as I said before, this was not intended as a prediction, only a warning. Are we wise enough to heed its message?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book Farenheit 451 is a fabulous book. I think that it is like the book Z for Zachariah in the fact that they are both in the future. Also the people in the books are, at first, leading boring, uneventful lives. Then suddenly their lives change drastically. They are also alike in the fact that the main character in each book makes a dangerous escape. They are dislike because Montag's life changes mostly because of outside influence that he could have stopped. Anne's change couldn't have been stopped by something that she could do. the only problem that I have with Farenheit 451 is that it doesn't have a sequel. I like the the style of writing that Ray Bradbury uses."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is still one of my favourites. It is still as compelling to me now as when I read it in high school at my brother's suggestion.

Ray Bradbury is an excellent author who's writting is compelling and magical.A must read for anyone who loves books."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I LOVED THIS BOOK.When I read it first in 6th grade.... I loved it.

A future where every person is a mindless automaton with no feeling. They go about their life wondering whats going to be on the screen next or what they're going to eat for dinner. Worst of all it is a future where there are no books. It is a future where firemen don't douse fires, it is a future where they start them. Their job is to rid the earth of books by burning them.Montag is a firefighter who is questioning what he is doing. Lately he has been stealing books from the secret libraries he burns for a living. He finally realizes that without books people are mindless automatons who's only purpose in life is not to think.This is a great book and it makes you think of what life would be like if our only purpose in life was to be happy. We wouldn't be able to think for ourselves, just like the characters in the book. I give &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; five big stars."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 takes a look into a world that is overloaded with censorship, has a lack of knowledge, and is full of ignorance. I was quickly captivated to read the book after the first chapter when I learned the main character, Guy Montag, is a fireman who's job is to burn books. This makes the novel begin with a very unique twist since the world is accustomed to firefighters putting out fires instead of starting them.Bradbury takes us though Guy's experiences that change his opinion of book burning. Starting with his encounter with a young girl named Clarisse McClellan, Montag is intrigued with her love of people, nature, and her stories of people who were not afraid of books. She causes Guy to see how dissatisified he is with his life. I feel for Montag as he goes through several disturbing events (his wife attempts suicide, an old woman chooses to burn with her books in her house, and Clarisse was hit by a car) and I understand why his eyes are opened to the bland life he has because of how censored the world has become. I would feel the same too, if I lived in a superficial world were everything is based on fast cars, TV, and radio and didn't include time by yourself, time to enjoy nature, independent thinking, books, and meaningful conversations. Nothing would be left in the world. That's why this book almost frightens me because it shows where censorship can lead to. What if our society just decided to get rid of free thinking to stop conflicting opinions? This novel makes you respect freedom after you begin to wonder if world could one day become like Montag's.At least there was hope for Guy as made friends with a retired English professor (Faber) and decides that Faber can help him understand the books that he hid away from his own fires. The most emotional moment was late in the novel when the fire station gets a call. Montag realizes it's his own house and his wife turned him in. It's sickening how everyone turns against him because he wants to gain knowledge about the old world. This lead to an intense chase that makes you almost want to cheer outloud for Guy as he escapes the Mechanical Hound, Beatty, and other firemen.The final chapter left me somewhat satisfied. It's vagueness at the end makes me yearn for a sequel. That's about the only problem I had with the book. Overall, I recommend this to anyone who has an open mind and loves sci-fi."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is unique in its own way. What goes on in here is not what people usually want to hear. Burning of houses, burning of sacred classics, even burning people. What makes this book likeable is that it makes you step out of your comfort zone into reality. As if it was going to happen if we don't stop doing what we are now. I like this book because of the interesting technology and characters. Clarisse of course is my favorite character. She reminds me of the bright, young, smart, and clever people that live in this world.The main character in this book is of course Guy Montag. He is a fireman, that burns books. Unlike other firemen, Guy Montag is more friendlier. Even Clarisse said so herself. She said he made her forget about him being a fireman at all. Which sets apart Montag from the rest of his group. Which makes him special.What happens is that Montag is apart of the fireman group 451. Being tempted, Montag steals a book, and more and more with each job he does. His captain of course notices, since near the end he said every fireman does this one time in his career. But, soon enough Montag is caught. Therefore being caught, he is forced to be on the run constantly, in fear of the Mechanical Hound, the invention used to catch \\"criminals.\\" Yet, there is a surprise ending, and to see what it is, you'll just have to read and find out."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This tale is far more than a simple scary novel about burning &quot;unacceptable&quot; books. It is a red flag warning about the ever-present encroachment of censorship in the world about us. It is not surprising that this book was indeed heavily &quot;edited&quot; when it was first published. The censors saw their own reflection! Fahrenheit 451 is a book, which sends a strong message we should all heed. &quot;Social criticism&quot; in the written form is all-important to improve our society and prevent our freedoms from being eroded. There are not many other books along this line, but I have found two very enjoyable books, which really do fit into the &quot;Fahrenheit 451 social critique/satire&quot; genre. They are both by the skilled author C.B. Don. One is entitled, &quot;MANAGEMENT BY VICE&quot;...it is a critical, hilarious satire on interactions of technical staff and managers in high-tech industry...and the other, &quot;ACCUSED BY FACET-EYES&quot;...is a fairytale-like science-fiction, which is heartwarming, yet with a sharp ecological message critical of our thoughtless polluting, human practices. Like the classical much recommended Fahrenheit 451, these two books are also our 21st Century must-reads, ideal for every student of satire/social critique! I enjoyed all three books and walked away thoroughly enlightened and with a new perspective on society and life!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's vision of a world without books is genius. However, I don't think he was able to convey all that he wanted to with this book. It could be that the almost-novella length left him without the option to fully develop the characters. I was vexed not knowing what happended to Clarisse, and I was intrigued by the idea of the literati outcasts who roamed the rails. I think that in and of itself would have made an interesting novel. I couldn't understand the reasoning behind the book burnings. Captain Beatty's explanations left me wondering if that was the full story? Humanity is flawed in the extreme,but this seems to suggest a reverse in evolution - human intelligence on a steady downward spiral. I hope that it would take a little more than the explanations given by Captain Beatty to inspire the world-wide destruction of books - especially in this manner. Wouldn't incinerators be much more effective at destroying books than torching houses and buildings? I realize that the book was written very quickly, and maybe Mr. Bradbury got caught up in the passion of writing it, at the expense of character development. But I rated this book 4 stars anyway, because I respect the brilliance of the idea, and Mr. Bradbury made a very bold statement by writing about a topic he felt strongly about. It makes you think, which is more than I can say about the vast majority of literature published."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 in my mind is a very well-written book by Ray Bradbury. Sometimes this book did get very weird, but it all had a purpose towards the end of the book. The author of this book had a very good idea for a story like this and he wrote it very well.Guy Montag has had his job for ten years as a fireman, but books were for burning and the houses in which they were hidden. This man goes out on midnight, runs and watches pages become inflamed in fire. Then he meets a professor that tells him in the future when people could think, and then he realizes what he has to do.I enjoyed this book quite a bit and I would recommend this book for you if you like Science Fiction."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I had to buy this book for school.

Since I was assigned this book to read, I didn't get that enthusiastic with it at first, especially with that title. I thought it was going to be a book were I had to struggle to keep myself awake to read it. After reading the first 4 or 5 pages though, I was proven totally wrong. I became engulfed in this book and couldn't stop reading it. The story felt so real that I could picture it happening in our society without a doubt in my head.I enjoyed reading about how Guy Montag's character unfolded throughout the story and how he realized that just because something was the law didn't mean that it was exactly right. It is good how he followed his beliefs and didn't let anyone tell him that he was wrong. A downside to this book though is that my favorite character, Clarisse, was run over by a car. I believe that Bradbury just added that part to just take her away. I believe if Clarisse would have lived, she would have been at Montag's side and the overall story could have been so much better.Also, I believe that Bradbury could have changed the ending a little. That was the least exciting point of the book. The jets flying by overhead and the city being destroyed was very exciting, but after that, the overall excitement of the book just died off. I am not going to be stereotypical and say that all of Bradbury's books have a dull ending (because I haven't read any other one), but I will say that he should have fixed this one up a little.All in all, Bradbury has written a good book. Not perfect, but good. I think that this is a book that few should be without reading because it can actually knock some sense into them to not be fools and stand up for what they believe in. The book portrays a world that could possibly be our own in a few years.

The language might seems a bit dry, but one must consider the time and environment in which it was written.This book is truely a classic, so grow yourself and those around you; Read this book and then share it with someone willing to discuss it with you.

Given when it was written you must admit it has prophetic qualities, though the media people are addicted to these days are increasingly ones that Bradbury had not imagined. There are uncanny parallels between the 'family on the screen' in the book and the way many people relate to media like facebook. The reason why I don't give it a higher rating is because I personally think the style of writing feels a bit dated. The text contains many features that I myself would have edited away in my own writing. I wonder if a modern agent or publisher would have commented that the manuscript needs polishing before being publishable. It should be stressed that these are my private opinions and I am sure many don't agree with them. Read it and decide for yourself. This is a powerful story about being entertained to the point of loosing touch with everything that matters in life.

Interesting insights into culture and population control."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In Fahrenheit 451 (the temperature at which books burn, for the curious), the Ray Bradbury evokes a terrifying America similar to our own in all respects but one- the fireman there burn books. With the aid of a mysterious girl, Clarice, who says she is &quot;seventeen and crazy,&quot; fireman Guy Montag chooses to defy society and is forced to run for sanctuary, even as a nuclear Armageddon approaches. Bradbury's love of books is evident in his theme, and his love of language is evident in his linguistic acrobatics. Anyone with a burning love of books should read Fahrenheit 451- it is truly a masterpiece"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If you are interested at all in literature, I think this is a must-read. To me, it centers around the notion of censorship and how culture can seemingly determine the sense of happiness which can only really be derived from within. The characters and events seem futuristic in a sense but completely current. The writing style is not 'heavy', but the content certainly is. I believe this book is extremely well written and organized, and very applicable in a time when few people examine the substance underlying the superficial perceptions that are shaped by external forces."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury is one of the greatst books i have ever read because it shows what the world might become if we stop asking questions and only do what we are told. The main character is Guy Montag who lives in a time where books are outlawed and firemen burn them. He is a fireman who liked his job and never asked questions about the things that he did until he met seventeen-year-old Clarisse McClellan who was not afraid to ask questions. She along with a professor he meets helps him open his eyes to the truth. He knows now that he must turn against the very people he works for.I liked this book because it is very realistic of somthing that could happen in the near future. The book can become confusing at some points and is told in third person. This book is good for people who like to read about future \\"what ifs\\". I highly recommend this book to people who like to read books that change their outlook on life."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I had to wait until age 38 but it was worth the wait. It touches on some issues that are quite relevant today - espeically the state of our educational system.It was a very quick read, but thoroughly entertaining. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Really, the story itself ends on page 165. This is a fascinating book, but it left me wanting more. You probably already know that the book is about censorship and book burning in the future, but you also see a little of the political correctness and revisionist history that led up to this future. There is not much more told about how this society evolved.It seems pretty far-fetched, but you can also see some similarities to today... fast, loud, shallow \\"reality\\" TV; hints that the rest of the world despises an arrogant, prosperous U.S.A; and Americans that are too distracted to pay much attention to a war they know little about...Another odd thing is that nobody is WRITING. The firemen are still tracking down stashes of old books, but there is no mention of anyone being caught writing anything new. With all the talk of how important books are, you would think some rebellious soul would want to create something new. On the other hand, characters who also happen to be writers can be such a clich&eacute;. Bradbury managed to write a book about books, and not include a single writer among the characters."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"For the past few years, I've been reading a lot of \\"classics\\" (everything from ancient epics/mythologies/Arthurian legend/Matter of France to Chaucer/Shakespeare to Kant/Hegel/Kierkegaard to the 19th-Century Russian novels to Borges, Joyce, Woolf, Kundera, etc.), so I approached this work from a very literary perspective and with a reasonably solid foundation in literature. That being said, I am not entirely sure why this is considered a modern \\"masterpiece.\\" The concept is okay despite being derivative of earlier novels (of which, as has been said elsewhere, \\"Brave New World\\" and \\"1984\\" are prime examples, though I think he owes a fair amount to Kafka as well (and, given the relatively prevalent fear of totalitarianism/tyranny throughout history, probably many others as well)), but the execution is unexceptional to say--er, type--the least.I find the writing to be sophomoric and unpredictable: sometimes flowery metaphors or analogies are used without real purpose, and there are several unimpressive \\"paradoxes\\" (x is on fire yet x is also cold, y is living but y is also dead, etc.) producing the illusion of depth. What makes such rhetorical language so jarring, however, is that it is almost randomly thrown into an otherwise concise and straightforward narrative, as if Bradbury went back and tried \\"spicing up\\" his writing by thoughtlessly peppering it with unnecessary metaphors. (For example: early on, there is a paragraph discussing Mildred's eyes as \\"moonstones,\\" a poetical paragraph that was initially (for me) utterly confusing because it was totally unexpected and, considering the text within which it is couched, unfitting.) I can respect various registers and don't suscribe to New Criticism's imperative for self-contained organic harmony--I (eventually) loved \\"Ulysses,\\" which is neither consistent nor self-contained--but Bradbury's changes of style accomplish nothing but confusion, distraction, and perhaps an occasional \\"how beautiful!\\" from readers admiring a pretty but misplaced sentence.While the characters aren't developed with any depth, I can respect this decision: the protagonist becomes an \\"everyman,\\" the characters become symbols, the plot can unfold more rapidly, etc. Nonetheless, Bradbury is very heavy-handed with his symbolism and messages (even the ironic reversal of firefighters' duties is anything but subtle) and, despite the \\"think for yourself\\" message, it is almost as if Bradbury is a prophetic preacher telling you what to think. Thus, the novel lacks the nuanced depth of many great works of fiction. Likewise, the plot itself is presented sloppily and often seems contrived: a man who loves to watch books burn suddenly changes his entire outlook because of a few conversations with a teenager? (If the \\"loving to watch books burn\\" were written in free indirect discourse, then fine; Guy has hidden books in his house, slightly unsettled, but still *thinks* he likes burning books. But the narrative appears unilaterally third person limited.) Books must be burned, but there is no mention of paintings, movies, musical pieces, and other art/media, so what happened to those? How, exactly, did culture go from minorities/over-commodification/instant gratification to \\"we must burn every bloody book, dammit!\\"? Moreover, the dialogue is not believable--it feels unnaturally fast, especially Guy's interactions with Faber--and it seems artificial, tailored to further the plot even at the expense of conversational logic.While not always disappointing, overall the writing gave me the impression that it was written by a smart and overeager high-schooler, not a literary master. The book has its audience, but those expecting/hoping to find a modern literary \\"masterpiece\\" will be sorely disappointed."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury is a book I've been meaning to read, was on my list, but was only spurred on to pick up by Bradbury's death. I read The Martian Chronicles and Dandelion Wine ages and ages ago so it was with pleasure that I returned to rediscover Bradbury's brilliance.Guy Montag was a fireman whose job it was to start fires. And he enjoyed his job. He had been a fireman for ten years, and he had never questioned the pleasure of the midnight runs or the joy of watching pages consumed by flames, never questioned anything until he met a seventeen-year-old girl who told him of a past when people were not afraid. Then Guy met a professor who told him of a future in which people could think. And Guy Montag suddenly realized what he had to do...I did know going in that Fahrenheit 451 was set in a dystopian society in which firemen burned books. All books. To ashes. Which made it hard for me to breathe. That feeling persisted throughout the entirety of Fahrenheit 451. Thank goodness it was a quick read. To be honest I skimmed over some passages, much like I would a gory, overly graphic horror scene.\\"It was a pleasure to burn.\\"From this iconic first line on, Fahrenheit 451 moved at a fast, intense clip. It's refreshing to be reminded of how a great story doesn't need to be stretched out into two-three book series like so many books I come across nowadays. Bradbury's writing is economical and compact; despite the radical vision he's presenting, Fahrenheit 451 doesn't indulge in tedious info-dumping or an unnecessary scenes. Though the plot is full of shocking action, it also has many scenes that illustrate Montag's internal struggles.Reading Fahrenheit 451 was very disturbing. Not so much because of the horror of book burning, but because the alternate history that Bradbury painted stemming from censorship is possible, even in this day and age. The unquestioning, drugged-like state of the general population is frightening because it can happen and does happen to some degree today. Everyone is numbed by artificial, dumbed down entertainment. Instead of TVs, there are entire TV walls surrounding people. Seashell earbuds fill their heads with ceaseless, lulling noise. No one has face-to-face conversations anymore. People accidentally on purpose overdose on sleeping pills - yet they don't even know how unhappy they are. Everyone goes around in a haze of oblivion, so much so that no one knows there's even a war going on.The symbolic figure of this dead and deadened world is Guy Montag, a fireman who sets fire to books. In the beginning of Fahrenheit 451, he revels in the power and spectacle of burning these hated things. But in the course of meeting a girl and an old man, both of whom infect him with the idea that the world was once different, Guy suddenly finds himself having a massive crisis of the heart, mind, and soul. From then on, life as he knows it explodes.One thing that bothered me about Fahrenheit 451 was the kind of books that \\"rebels\\" held as worth saving at all costs, even their lives. First of all, no books by female authors. Secondly, the Bible plays a big role. Which is ironic to me since most censors and book banners cling to the Bible as their reason for banning books in the first place.\\"'Do you know why books such as this are so important? Because they have quality. And what does the word quality mean? To me it means texture. This book has pores. It has features. This book can go under the microscope. You'd find life under the glass, streaming past in infinite profusion. The more pores, the more truthfully recorded details of life per square inch you can get on a sheet of paper, the more \\"literary\\" you are. That's my definition, anyway. Telling detail. Fresh detail. The good writers touch life often. The mediocre ones run a quick hand over her. The bad ones rape her and leave her for the flies.'\\""},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The whole concept of this book bothered me.

It was good, but not anywhere near as good as others I've read in this genre. I've found that I don't like Bradbury's style. He's a bit too ornamental, romantic, melodramatic for my taste. He's also rather egocentric--using his writing to serve himself rather than the writer, which turns me off. If you read some of his interviews, you'll see what I'm talking about. Nevertheless, I think all dystopian sci-fi fans should read it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"So, I ordered this book after consistent protesting from my fiance that this was fantastic. Maybe it was a combination of how high he had built it up, or the fact that I was never forced to read this when I was in school, but it did not impress me. It was an OKAY book, I am just was not overly impressed. Plus, I feel kinda cheated that I had to pay so much for it, compared to other Kindle books. Overall, I would recommend it if you are very interested in futuristic works, but otherwise, it is not the best read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury struck bullseye with this novel. It seems almost ridiculous to have firemen to burn down houses because the obtain books in them. But is it really? Today's American Society has already started the burning of books and persecution of those who own them. There are already banned book lists that are preventing the youth of today from expanding their minds. It is a travesty that this is happening, but the fact remains that it is. By preventing High School students from reading &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; because it uses a derogatory term towards African-Americans is ridiculous. We are forgetting what the word &quot;satire&quot; means. To ban Vonnegut's works because they are different is insane. We may not have begun to burn down houses, but we are not helping books to survive. We are too locked into computer screens and televisions to remember what it is to be human. The human-experience can never come from a computer or a television. We must protect what keeps us human. Forget being politically correct, forget Jehovah, Allah, and any other diety... BE HUMAN...READ BOOKS."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"One of the best books I have ever read! Guy Montag is the epitome of courage. The reality of much of Bradbury's fiction is horrifyingly consistent with today's society. The future's view of books is accurate with that of a variety of people today.

Ray Bradbury made this book very interesting especially with his similies and metaphors. In order to get anything out of this book you really had to read closely to enderstand what Bradbury was trying to communicate to the reader. Also, the reader had to use their common sence to understand the story, because it is very different from our world today. The scary part of the story, was how it was written fifty years ago, but the reader can see how the society of today is becoming more and more like the book.Amagine a world were reading certain books ment that you were breaking the law, with possible punishment of death. This was the world Guy Montag lives in. He was a fireman that started fires. In the story's day and age this was a common job. Houses that contained books were houses that needed to be burnt down. Montage enjoyed his job because he did what he was told, and never thought outside of the box. Until he met a girl named Clarisse who made him think outside of the box with three words she asked Montag,&quot;Are you happy?&quot; To learn more about what happens to Montag, you will have to read the book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I first read this book when I was a junior in high school, and I immediately loved it. Five years later, I decided to read it again, just to keep my memory refreshed.Wow, had I forgotten a lot. I mentioned I thought it was great the first time; the second, it was even better. It is easy reading, so I managed to get through it within a couple of days, and would've been able to read it in its entirety if I had had a whole Saturday to myself. As other books that I would group into this general genre (such as &quot;1984&quot; and &quot;On the Beach&quot;), it projects a frightening future in which firemen don't put fires out, they start them--in the homes of people who are reported to possess books. As a raging bibliophile, this is one of the most frightening scenarios I can imagine.Ray Bradbury is a masterful writer who commands your attention like few I have read before. He succinctly depicts the struggle of Guy Montag, the main character and a fireman, as he slowly begins to realize that perhaps his job is not as spectacular and wonderful as it once was. He lives in a climate of violence, where people driving run over pedestrians for sport, and wars come and go as frequently as the change in tides. And, most of all, it is a world where books are viewed as a waste of time, considering TV shows have been condensed to five minutes long and billboards are two hundred feet long so that drivers may see them as they drive by at breakneck speeds. Bradbury paints quite a grim picture of the future, along with his contemporaries, Nevil Shute and George Orwell, that seems frighteningly near. Haven't we heard the news stories about how the younger generation doesn't read? And Montag's wife, Mildred, interacts with her &quot;family&quot; on wall-sized TVs in the parlor...an interactive &quot;reality&quot; show that seems like it may be drawing closer by the second with the advent of all the reality shows in the past year. Rather than having her own life, Mildred seems to live her life in conjunction with these characters on the screens.Bradbury gives us an ominous warning about what may be in the future. We should definitely all pay close attention.This book is more pertinent than ever, and I hope they're continuing to teach it in the schools. It is important that we read these books, so that when things begin looking eerily familiar, we can stop it before it gets to this point."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The premises of Fahrenheit 451 are promising: the ever looming &quot;this-could-happen&quot; is enacted out in the form of Guy Montag and his little world where people desire only 4 screen televisions in their parlour, where advertising reigns supreme, etc. A vast majority of books are illegal because they inspire conflict (the Koran and the Bible, Wealth of Nations and The Communist Manifesto) with conflicting ideas. Who would want that? The human race might actually get somewhere.It's a fantastic concept, and should lead to a great book. However, I've read this three times and each time I get the same general feeling: this could have been so much better. So, read it, just for the sake of reading it, but don't expect a huge masterpiece."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is by far one of my favorite books ever, along with Lord of the Flies. It starts out where Guy Montag is a happy, yet braindead fireman who seems to love his job. Which is burning houses that contain any books. Set in the future, everything seems backwards. Television seems to run their lives. No one reads. People on the street drive more than eighty miles an hour, which causes them to knock people over. And no one seems to care when someone dies. They just drive around knocking people over. Montag's wife Mildred (if memory serves) is just as braindead and likes to watch &quot;the family&quot; and that terrible clown show where the clown gets run over by a train in the walls, which are like giant TV screens that completely surroud her and engulf her. But Montag meets a girl who shows him the beauty of life outside their brainless conformaties. She tells him that, long ago, firemen put fires out, not started them. And he starts to wonder why there are no more porches or decks for people to sit on and talk. He wonders why there are people who love books so much that they would be willing to be burnt with their books. And he wonders what is really in the books.... So while he is reading (illegally) Mildred and her friends are sitting around watching the walls and talking about how many abortions or husbands they've had like it's nothing at all. Montag tries to get Mildred to read with him, but she thinks it's wrong and leaves. All the while, Captain Beatty, a chief at the fire station where Montag works is suspicious of Montag owning books, but he can't prove anything. Until the night Mildred leaves Montag and pulls the alarm that let's the firemen know someone has books in their house. Montag is shocked to have to burn his own house to the ground. He kills Beatty and the other two firemen with the flamethrower and runs away. The police are pursuing him but he eventually gets away, with the help of an old man who used to be a professor. In the end the city blows up. It is kind of a representation of the terrible lives the people there were living and how our society could someday end up like their's. It is a really beautiful book, science fiction at it's finest. Ray Bradbury did an amazing job with this one."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"\\"Fahrenheit 451\\" a metaphor on the freedom of speech. It is not in literary terms that knowledge can be controlled by burning books; there are other ways to accomplish that. As the world is full of people; running with lit matches. Ray Bradbury is basing his attack on every editor; censor; lobbyist; government that see themselves as the caretaker of knowledge and literature; and they control by shackle the words of an author who dare to speak out.The question is very relevant to present times. The news is splattered with stories of doctored intelligence documents; on the bases of which dreaded events occurred."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Reading over the other reviews, they basically sum up how fantastic this book is. I just wanted to add that when I read this book in my seventh grade English class, although it used a huge amount of symbolism and metaphors that would normally be hard for a younger people to understand, the majority of my reading group was able to decipher the book and take a great deal out of reading it. We worked together to figure out a few very difficult things but in general this book was not impossible for a young person. So, to anyone that wants to enrich themselves and really take a deeper look at the horrors of instant gratification, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"When I first heard of the basic plot in which Firemen burn books rather than putting out fires I was a little skeptical. I was most definitely mistaken. This prophetic short story was engrossing. There is nothing I can say which hasn't been said before. Yes the underlying themes aren't so underlying but they are multilayered and provide a buffet of ideas to feast upon."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In an age where most authors write tomes of 400+ pages, this classic by Bradbury says more about humanity, freedom, and the risk of opression from the state (and society) than just about any other book ever written. For anyone who loves books, this is a must-read. Even if you don't consider yourself a &quot;science fiction&quot; fan, this book is an essential - like _Brave New World_, _1984_ etc that should be read by any biliophile. And the story is exciting and entertaining enough that it more than earns its place among the truly classic literature of any time."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time. It's a really amazing story of how the world could be one day if we are all corrupted by the government"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fireman Guy Montag is happy with his work--burning books--until he runs into a teenaged neighbor who really talks to him, questions him, and starts his mind working in directions that don't feel comfortable and that lead him to question his entire existance. In Ray Bradbury's futuristic dystopia, books are illegal and wall-sized television sets, constantly babeling and even allowing user interactivity, rule the world. But, as we learn from the story, this isn't the result of harsh government sanctions, but of popular consensus only supported by the government when books were already almost extinct.Author Ray Bradbury is a powerful and effective writer. His use of the language adds color to a straightforward, if fascinating plot about a man's struggle to come to terms with himself in a world where comfort and 'happiness' are deemed more important than questioning and thought. Like George Orwell's 1984, FAHRENHEIT 451 survives because of its eternal message, its strong writing, and its insights into the future--a future that Bradbury might recognize as something similar to our own present. In an era where book reading declines each year, and where a greater and greater percentage of those books sold are best-sellers by a few favorite writers, Bradbury's message is certainly worth another look.Two characters make this novel--Guy Montag, with his doubts but also his hopes for the future, and fire chief Captain Beatty. Beatty knows the truth, knows more about books than Montag or even most intellectuals, and is willing to argue against them--but does so using arguments from the books themselves. Beatty's arguments are subtle and definitely worth stopping and thinking about--only if we are willing to pay Beatty's price can intellectual freedom survive and Beatty is right--few are really willing to pay.Although most reviewers focus on the book burning and anti-intellectualism that Bradbury describes in FAHRENHEIT 451, there is also a strong anti-war message that runs through this novel and much of Bradbury's early work. As in our own era, wars are expected to be easy and cheap, at least for the Americans. Bradbury argues that expectations don't always make the truth."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"First off this is an excellent book. I'll not bother to say what it's about \`cos everyone else has already done that. What I will say is that this book was written for all of you out there who hated it and want to see it burned. This book tells what is today so very well, with the poetic pose that Bradbury alone can use. No wonder he's only the second person EVER to be printed in TIME, and virtually every major magazine. In one sceen Montag reads poetry to a room of guests, they all burst into tears. The reason for this? They have never heard anything like it before, and can't understand it. Step into any high school English class and you'll find the same thing, kids not understanding and hating the book. Many people hate this book, they don't understand it. It describes mode day perfectly. Look at any college library were they have books that have been banned for being \\"intororant\\" \\"Little House On The Prairie\\", \\"The Bible\\" books that offended. In the world described in this book all, books offend, nobody understand them and if one person doesn't get it WHOOSH! up in flames it goes. That's why student's today read dull gutless books by contemporaries, instead of books to make you think like something by Dante, or Milton. God forbid the poor kid not understand something. A 12-year-old wrote, \\"This book is supposed to be about the future, but talks it resembles today\\" NO KIDDING! This alone shows the greatness of this book, it was written 50 years ago, and tells us about ourselves. They also claimed they could \\"not relate to anyone in the book.\\" What a shock! Got news kid this was written for adults, of COURSE you couldn't relate, how could you? Unless you're abnormally intelligent they couldn't. The teacher who assigned this book to a class of 12-year-olds should have their head examined; they weren't going to get it. Some people say Bradbury has a negative outlook on the future. Anyone who was read a book by him knows that. The reason? Bradbury has a firm grasp on reality, and knows that humans are evil, and will ultimately destroy themselves. He has good cause to be pessimistic, he looks at the modern world and shakes his head, and then try's to do something about it by educating us. For those of you who want to be educated, and are bright enough to understand this book, and the truth it shows, buy it. For the rest of you. Buy a meaningless book by I know not who, and find why nobody knows who they are. And leave book meant for bright people with eyes in their heads alone."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I never really enjoyed science fiction, but something about this book caught my eye. The story revolves around one lone fireman, Guy Montag, who, oddly enough, sets fire to books instead of putting them out. He lives in a world that doesn't like to see unhappiness and the real truth, so they destroy books and all that causes unhappiness. When he meets a girl who, unlike all of the others, &quot;thinks,&quot; not only about life and the deeper meaning behind the events which happen in our daily lives, which we don't acknowledge because we are all so busy, he becomes obsessed with finding out the truth behind those books and behind life. Along the way, he meets Faber, the elderly man who guides him on his journey. There is a certain tragedy in this book, and although the events in this book don't happen in life verbatim, it is remarkably similar to events which happen in everyday life. This appeared to have been a spiritual experience, not only for the characters, but for the author Ray Bradley. The characters are so tortured inside, caught between what they are expected to do and what they know is right. This book made me think more about what life really is about. And, as demonstrated in this book so many times, you never know when your life is going to end, so as it says in the book: &quot;Stuff your eyes with wonder. Live as if you'd drop dead in 10 seconds. See the world. It's more fantastic than any dream made or paid for in factories. Ask no guarantees, ask for no security, there never was such an animal. And if there were, it would be related to the great sloth which hangs upside down in a tree all day, every day, sleeping its life away.&quot;"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"My daughter has received this for the second time now as required reading for school (summer reading requirement). &quot;Oh Mom this book is awful&quot; she said, now for the second time. She read me a paragraph of the book and sure enough, it does sound awful when you read small snippets of the book. This book is not an easy read at all, not because it is overly intellectual -- it's not written very well, sorry Mr. Bradbury -- the author wrote in the afterward, that he wrote it in his early days of writing in various rooms of his house, finally ended up sequestered in his garage. I imagine that if the book was written later in Mr. Bradbury's career, that it would have been written far better than it was -- this is no literary masterpiece, but the concept it contains is a timeless one.That said, my daughter gave it to me to read and I read it in one sitting, wondering what was going to happen to the main character and how this book would end. This book is about a future society where books are illegal. The government has built a society where simple pleasure is the main goal in life, not meaningful pleasure. People live their lives around TV that takes up entire walls of their homes, no truly educational programming is allowed for the same reason that no books are allowed. The TV in this book creates not just light programming for society, but a family in the wall/screens -- it is mind numbing for that society. People become puppets where they live their lives out in simple ignorance and if you dare question the way things are or attempt to hide any books you are persecuted for it. People are simple minded and unquestioning. Enter Clarissa, the sweet teenage next door neighbor who takes simple pleasure in taking walks, letting the rain fall on her tongue, staying up late in the night actually talking to her family, no TV walls active in her home -- people actually listen to each other. The government is suspicious of her family -- not because they are subversive or publicly questioning society, but because of the way they live and think. Though Clarisse is a character in the book for a very short time, she makes an impact on the main character, Guy the fireman, who envies that she and her family talk to each other, listen to each other, and care so much for each other in a society that only cares about keeping the status quo and not getting in trouble. He begins to question what he is doing, burning books -- not so much because of the book burning itself, but for the lives of the book lovers he wrecks in the process. He begins to wonder what is inside the pages of books that people are willing to die for them and steels one of the books from a home his is destroying. He adds this book to the huge stash of books he has already hidden in the air ducts of his home and actually begins to read them and thus begins his own persecution.Though this isn't a literary masterpiece, as I said earlier, it is engrossing and very disturbing. The future society created in the pages is a nightmare. The importance of education, reading, and simply caring about your fellow man are the concepts the reader walks away with. I suspect that's the reason it is tirelessly assigned to kids at school."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I first read F451 in high school... and was moved by it. This was a book that at once fueled my teenage-born desire to fight \\"the man\\" and inspired me to become a science fiction author myself.So why am I writing this review now, more that a decade (sadly, much more than a decade) after high school? Well, I just read F451 again. It is now April, 2004. I am amazed at just how accurate Bradbury's future is. If the \\"slaves to our TV's\\" accusation doesn't strike close enough to the bulls-eye, just look at the role of war in F451 and then turn on CNN and watch for 5 minutes.Bradbury has hit the nail on its proverbial head; in his verbose-yet-eloquent style he has painted a horrible and terrifying future where man fears and scorns knowledge and wisdom. It has gotten to the point where firemen no longer put out fires, but start them--to burn the books which embody everything that is dangerous to a society that fears free will.Reading this again, now, I couldn't help resurrecting a memory. I was at work in the high-tech field (before the crash)... I make a habit of either reading or writing during my lunch hour, and a coworker had made a comment along the lines of \\"why on Earth would you read a book when you can get all the entertainment you'd ever want online?\\". Reading F451, I remember this person, and imagine them in a \\"parlor\\" with their fabricated online \\"Tv walls\\" that cater to their egos and their banal desire for raw and stupid entertainment.My advice to those who don't typically read, those who have siblings or offspring who do not read, and those who think anything that isn't digital is unworthy of their attention: Read this book. The main story (sans afterword, etc.) is only about 160 pages long. There's no excuse. read it.Those who do read (and especially those who write): this is a classic for a reason, and Bradbury's poetic quality is very enjoyable. He creates only a few characters in this book, but from the start you have such depth in the lead man (montag) that you feel pity for him as his wife's stomach is pumped, and you understand why he is drawn to the spirit that is Clarisse. Because you will have the privilege of reading this far beyond the time in which it was written, you will both fear the \\"hound\\" and relate to it. You will also relate to the TV walls and (unless you live underground in isolation) you will begin to fear what the modern media has become.[edit - You shouldn't burn books. Certainly notCluck: Murder Most Fowl. I wrote it, so please forgive the self-promotion, but also please check out my book. Thanks, -edk]"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I'm not a fan of science fiction, and so when my book group chose this book as its monthly selection to read, I was dubious. But then I started reading this small, seemingly simple little book and I was hooked - completely. Yes, it's science fiction. Yes, it requires the reader to accept the reality of a world that is a figment of the author's imagination. Yes, it deals with censorship and book burning and the dangers of mindless feel-good entertainment. And yes, it has a great plot and tells the fast paced story in a mere 165 pages. But in this case, the total effect is much much more than the sum of its parts.There's the quality of the writing first of all. The words run across the page with searing intensity, pulling the reader into a world that feels real and creepy. It pulsates with its theme, which is of fire and firemen and the cruel act of destroying books. It's intelligent and literate and uses some direct quotes from revered thinkers. And then there are some parts that were so humorous that I laughed out loud. Every line resonates with tension. It is a wonderful tale. And, to top it all off, it is optimistic.One of the joys of reading this book is that we have the hindsight of understanding it was written in 1950. The author has that that hindsight as well, and there are an additional 23 pages in the paperback edition, written by the author more than 50 years later. These few pages add dimension to an already complete book and should not be missed. I have no doubt that Fahrenheit 451 is now seared in my mind as being one of the finest books I've every read. It gets my highest recommendation. Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This novel is, in my opinion, Bradbury's absolute best. Bradbury's excellent prose allowed some of his novels to escape the \\"science fiction ghetto\\" and surely this is one book that made the jump over the barbed wire.The plot is simple but shocking; books are dangerous to a trivial and controlling culture--therefore, burn them. Without books, there can be no memory of how things were or should be. Montag is a fireman who's job is, of course, to start fires and create bonfires of contraband books. His wife is absolutely shallow and \\"normal\\"--she watches the daily soaps on TV, which in this futuristic society are full wall-sized plasma screens. She nags Montag to earn more so she can install a fourth screen and surround the room with the escape from reality. Even some part of her, however, senses the bleakness of the world, and witlessly tries to escape in an overdose of drugs.Montag is dedicated in his work, but perhaps his investigative nature leads him into the world of the contraband book-hoarders. What drives a man to leap upon a funeral pyre of his library? A shaken Montag must find out.Bradbury sketches the frightening world of a society with non-readers and non-thinkers, dumbed down by design. What did he see in the 50's that we are just realizing today? He was not only amazingly prescient in his description of wall-sized flatscreen TV, but in the trend to a world where education, reading, and reason are being made extinct, if not downright subversive. Read this novel and marvel at Bradbury's chilling insights."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this book for a number of reasons: Enter the protagonist, Guy Montag. Montag has been a firefighter for 10 years and has always loved his job...as a fireman of the future, he sets fires to houses instead of putting them out. The reader learns from the back cover that Montag has never questioned his duties &amp; has always loved the thrill of a midnight run. However, a mere three or four pages into the book, Montag meets a free thinking seventeen year old girl who makes him realize that he has wasted the last ten years of his life. The reader never gets the sense that Montag was ever really serious about his job...we have to assume he was simply because the back cover says so. So, in a matter of about four days, this seventeen year old girl (Clarisse) has managed to turn ten years of Montag's beliefs upside down. This might not be so unrealistic if Montag &amp; Clarisse had become involved in a meaningful exchange of ideas but, as it stands, their longest conversation lasted only two minutes. A bit too far fetched for me. Then one day Clarisse disappears &amp; we never hear from her again. We get an &quot;explaination&quot; from Montag's wife, but it is just a theory...we never really know for sure what happened to her, leaving the reader to constantly wonder about her. No satisfactory answers are ever given. Nonetheless, she apparently had a profound impact on Montag because she fuels him throughout the rest of the novel. It's just a little hard for me to believe that 8 minutes of one-sided conversations from a 17 year old could change 10 years of beliefs.The book never gets any better. Montag goes on to meet an old English professor who just happens to share Clarisse's beliefs. What happens between them is, in my opinion, just as unbelievable as what happened between Montag &amp; Clarisse. I realize this is &quot;science fiction&quot; and a lot of it is supposed to be far-fetched, but very little of this book could actually be considered science fiction...perhaps the robotic dogs, wall to wall television and those little green ear bullets are science fiction, but not too much more. I found the characters to be more unrealistic than any of the fancy, technological advances of the future.But, I will say this about the book: I couldn't wait to finish it...not because it was an exciting page turner, but because it is a short book and I knew I would be through with it fairly quickly, even though the temptation to just stop reading it was there."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I give Fahrenheit 451 five stars because it is very interesting and pulls the reader into the life of Guy Montag, the main character and narrator. Ray Bradbury uses great imagery in this book so that the reader can picture exactly what Montag sees. Another thing that makes this book so great are the ideas that we take for granted such as thinking. In this book there are very few people who can think for themselves. It also makes you question things like, if there were no book would people still be able to think for on there own? This is a really great book.In this book you will read about a society that is very different from our own. This society takes place in the future. All the houses there are fire proof making firemen obsolete for their old job. There the firemen start fires instead of putting them out. Instead of using water they now use kerosene. Their job is to burn books and the houses they are in as soon as they are found. They follow strict rules which are1. Answer the alarm swiftly, 2. Start the fire swiftly, 3. Burn everything, 4. Report back to firehouse immediately, and 5. Stand alert for other alarms. According to them the first firehouse was built in 1790 to burn books. The first fireman was Benjamin Franklin. All books are banned from everyone. Being caught with a book is a punishable offense.This was Montag's job. He never questioned why he burned them or anything else in his life. Until he meet a girl named Clarisse McClellan who helped him start to think for himself. She asked him questions he never thought of before such as if he was happy and she pointed things out that he never noticed like how the billboards got longer because the cars got faster. All these new realizations helped Montag open his mind to start thinking and opened his eyes to what the government was doing.Clarisse spends her days outside exploring her environment and thinking about how strange the world is. She does not go to school because people think of her as anti-social when she just has a different idea of what being social is. Montag sees her doing some of the most peculiar things such as shaking a walnut tree or knitting a blue sweater. He saw her outside one day in the rain and she explained that she loved the way the rain tasted. Montag had never thought about how rain tasted and that day on the way to work he tilted his head back and opened his mouth to taste the rain. This was not the only time she told Montag something that got him thinking. One morning when they were talking and she told him she thinks dry leaves smell like cinnamon. Her odd revelations to him helped him think more and more.Montag starts to question all the people around him but mostly his wife, Mildred. She does nothing all day except watch her three-wall TV. He realizes he does not truly love her because he does not really know her at all. One night Mildred has two friends over to watch the three-wall TV. Montag listens to there conversation. They were talking about the up coming war and one woman said that her husband is in the army. She talked about how her husband might die but its okay because it's the third marriage for both of them and she won't have ant trouble getting over it. This shows Montag that people are incapable of feeling also. They can't think or feel they just live life and care only of themselves.Another person that helps Montag to start to think and question authority was an old professor called Faber. Montag had met Faber in a park a long time ago and Montag decides to call and then visit him. Faber tells him of a time when people read books and were not afraid of being caught with them. Faber lost his job as a professor when one year he came back to teach and only one student had signed up for the coarse. Faber thinks of himself as a coward because he loves book and believes that they should not be banned but he does not do anything to stop it. He was there when books were being banned and he said nothing because he was afraid. But Faber's compassion and wisdom give Montag courage. Faber stays in his house all the time and creates new inventions. One invention is a little speaker you put in your ear so you can talk to someone. Montag and Faber use this to there advantage.These characters help Montag a lot through out the book. If it were not for them Montag would have never started to realize what he has to do. He must change the society in some way but how? He is only one man. It all starts when he confronts his fire chief, Beatty. But to find out what happens read Fahrenheit 451. This book is a page-turner and you won't want to put it down."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It is ironic that Ray Bradbury's dystopian classic about the horrors of censorship has been on and off various \\"banned books\\" lists pretty much from the time it first appeared. That alone should be enough to pique one's interest. \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" tells the story of Guy Montag, a fireman. He doesn't fight fires - he starts them, in order to destroy books and any buildings that conceal them. He's happy with his job and always has been. But an unexpected series of events causes Montag to begin questioning the things he has hitherto accepted as undisputable. First he sees a woman burned alive in her home when she refuses to surrender her books. Then, Montag meets two people who expose him to ideas he has never before considered - one is a young girl, a new neighbor who proclaims herself \\"seventeen and crazy,\\" and the other is an aging professor with memories of a time before...When I first read the book over a year ago, I paid attention mostly to the plot alone, did not give the book as much thought as I should have, and therefore was not particularly struck by it. Re-reading it a few weeks prior to writing this, I concentrated more on the underlying themes of the book and gained a greater appreciation for Bradbury's creation. Originally written in 1950 as a short story entitled \\"The Fire Man\\" and taking it's final, full-length form in 1953, \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is just as relevant today as when Bradbury first composed it at the cost of a dime an hour in the basement typing room of the UCLA library. It takes a head-on look at the ways in which censorship dulls the mind and seeks to undermine independent thought.The form of censorship we encounter in \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is not the same type of thought control found in books like \\"1984\\" by Orwell. In a way, it is even more insidious. There is no Big Brother figure trying to manipulate the minds of the people. Rather, books are taboo because the people themselves don't want them. The general public has lost all interest in reading. And no one wants that interest revived. Instead, people spend their days in front of enormous, wall-filling television screens. When Bradbury wrote the book, television culture was still in its earlier stages, so the novel shows great prescience when compared with the world of today. Now there are televisions in every home. Televisions are baby sitters, time fillers, background noise. When we're bored, we just turn on the TV and let the real world fade into the back of our minds.In \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" we see this overwhelming dependence on television highlighted as a form of escapism from the reality of the world. Montag's wife spends every waking moment watching \\"the family\\" on the walls of the parlor. If Montag suggests that she do anything else, or even turn the volume down, she becomes distraught. She is literally lost without the world on the screen. It provides an insulation to cushion her mind from facing the darker things that hover just beneath the surface. And Mildred's repeated sleeping pill overdoses are evidence that such darker, depressing thoughts really do await her if she ever stops to ponder the world in which she exists, and just how lacking in substance it has become. In fact, the frequent references to other citizens' suicide attempts give us a clue to the very widespread nature of the problem.These are all things well worth contemplating in today's world. Fewer and fewer people take the time to read nowadays. News can be obtained via television or, as is increasingy more common, via the Internet. Entertainment can be had in the form of movies, video games, and the like. And of those that still do read, simple throwaway novels are becoming keen competition for the classics and other books of real substance. The incidence of depression in our society is increasing rapidly. People are constantly looking for ways to escape the world and to avoid having to think about it.Bradbury's book addresses all these issues and forces the reader to consider where our culture may be headed. Additional insight into the author's thoughts about and struggles against censorship can be gained by reading the Coda and the Afterword at the end, appended to the novel in 1979 and 1982 respectively. In these short passages Bradbury reveals the processes that went into the creation of \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" and the incidents that inspired and shaped it. He also gives us a heavy dose of irony by relating just how frequently others have sought to censor this very book. Admirably, he has turned down every such request, even at the cost of lost business, and \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" remains unaltered from it's original form. The story itself is short, simply written, and can be read quite quickly and easily. But it is worth considerable attention and thought, and deserves to be read by all."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451At the tender age of 9, as my 30 year old father lay in a hospital dying of cancer, my grieving young mother packed me off to a theater nearby. The feature was Fahrenheit 451, the year was 1966, and I was amazed by the message in this movie, enough to go back every night for a week, and beg my mom for the book. Growing up, I often reflected on how I lost I would be without books, and vowed I would read voraciously through life, and never willingly be part of a society who believed in spoon feeding propaganda to people to make them complacent. Lo and behold, my America has crept in that direction. The message of the movie is not what Government can do to society, but what society allows those in power to do to control them. Reading is indeed the antidote to blind faith in bad leaders. This movie carries a timeless message, one I have shared with my children and grandchild, and everyone who I have lent it or given one to."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I must say that this classic, by the master of Science Fiction, is one of the greatest Scifi books written. Ray Bradbury has proved to the literary elitist, that Science Fiction is not just about non-existing technology. No, this novel questions the self-censoring nature of man. It takes place in the future, 1990s, a future for the when the book was written, and tells a tale of a world devoid of books. The firemen, no longer put out fires, but start them. They burn books. Hence the title: the temperature of which paper burns. Though, I suppose the most interesting part of this story is that the policy to burn all books did not come about from the government. No, instead regular people began to democratically burn books themselves because books typically have that one element of life that common people usually do not want to deal with. Controversy."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book deals with the still-controversial issue of government censorship-the worst case scenario. Not only does the government limit people's ability to think for themselves, but the entertainment and advertising industry picks up their slack. This possible universe contains 3-D televisions to live in, cars that travel more than 100 mph, and radios that can be plugged directly into the ear when there's nothing else to do. A society in which presidential elections and the declaration of war is no cause for concern, and certainly not more important than what's happening on the most popular television program.A world where the acquisition of knowledge isn't a goal and where there are no books. In fact, books are illegal, and when someone concealing them is found, their books are burned as well as their house. And if the person doesn't come out of the house...it's a shame, but nothing to lose sleep over.That is Guy Montag's job; to burn books and this is the world in which he has lived, and it is the only world he knows. Until his life is changed forever by a series of revelations, including a friendship with a young woman named Clarisse who tells him what living really means and shows him that his life has really been a ghost-life. After that realization, his life fell apart. He realized he was living an empty life with an immoral, mindless, violent job, a wife he doesn't know-and doesn't love-and no one he could truly call a friend except Clarisse.Confused and distraught, Guy fled to find guidance about books, the future, life, and-most of all-himself, from the one man he thinks can help: an old professor by chance. From there, his journey takes him on a whirlwind of soul-searching and discovery, which will shake your beliefs and force you to reconsider your ethics and all else you hold dear."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's 1953 phantasmagoric blockbuster \\"Fahrenheit 451\\", written at the height of the fabulist's authorial powers, is a tale of a world gone mad, a topsy-turvy America in which black leather-clad firemen race laughing on their steely Salamanders on midnight alarms, not to quench fires but to start them.The firemen of the nightmare world of \\"Fahrenheit 451\\", of which the novel's hero Guy Montag is a dedicated one, comprise an army turned against an enemy far more insidious than Flame: they mobilize against ideas, and turn their napalm hoses on the feeble paper on which those subversive ideas are printed, and on the vulnerable binding in which the paper is housed.When I first read \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" nearly two decades ago, I felt beaten down, nauseated and fatigued. I believed then, and believe now, that it was the most scarily bleak and mercilessly depressing book I had ever read. Even then, I felt the cushion between Bradbury's 24th century nightmare and what we call modern reality was thin and worn.Bradbury gave us until the 24th century to submerge ourselves in the dark, sedated, media-slaked night of \\"Fahrenheit 451.\\" Looking around me, I have come to the conclusion that Bradbury was a pretty optimstic guy.Like Orwell's \\"1984\\" and Aldous Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\", Bradbury's \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is a dystopian vision, a glimpse into a future America that is frighteningly familiar and yet horribly wrong. It is a technologically advanced, subtle, sophisticated world, full of high-definition television screens that take up an entire wall and beam 24 hour programming to a vacant and eager television audience, 24-hour Reality programming that serves up a TV \\"Family\\" more engaging, more lifelike, more agreeable, than their own.This is a world where bored, vacuous housewives exchange barbs on the latest presidential contenders laced with observations on which candidate is the most handsome, and which has the most noticeable (to the Television Audience, naturally) facial bunion or boil. It is a world of 'seashells', tiny earphones designed to nest in the inner ear and breathe a sussurus of music into the mind of a medicated listener.Like his English counterparts Huxley and Orwell, Bradbury has served up a soft tyrannical state manned, not by the zealous, but by zombies. It is a world ruled by the media-addicted, the apathetic, the listless, the medicated, the overdosed, the sleeping. Books have been banned, and consigned to the Flame, not because of a despotic regime, but by the common, courteous consensus of a modern democracy desperately eager not to give offense to anyone.Sound familiar?Much like \\"1984\\", \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" works because it drills down on an unlikely protagonist. Guy Montag, at least when we meet him, sincerely loves his job. His fellow firemen are not zealots or fascists, but simply pragmatic working men who enjoy what they do. There are unpleasant aspects to the work, naturally---among them the incineration of an old eccentric woman who prefer to die with her beloved books---but like most of \\"Fahrenheit 451\\"'s society, Montag prefers not to think about it. Take a pill, or better still take two---and don't call me in the morning. For Montag, truly, it is a 'pleasure to burn'.Like most revolutionaries, though, Guy Montag is simmering from within; dissatisifed with his wife, whose stomach must be pumped on the very evening he returns from the euphoria of the Burn; dissatisifed with the apathetic society in which he lives; dissatisfied with a job which fails to give expression to the rebel soul that burns within, that impels him to challenge his wife's brazen, flippant friends.There are three catalysts that propel Montag to rebellion: the girl Clarisse, whom he befriends; the immolation of the old woman at the Fire; and his own clandestine book collection.\\"Fahrenheit 451\\" succeeds as both jeremiad and prophecy, true, but it also engages because Bradbury is a literary master: his spare, mechanical narrative of Montag's wife having her stomach pumped by two callous, dirty, jocular technicians practically breathes pure horror, and is one of the most soul-deadening passages I have ever read.But \\"451\\" also succeeds because it is a mirror of our own increasingly apathetic, violent, media-saturated world: is it so hard to see ourselves in Montag's trackless, cookie-cutter suburban landscape where bookish teenage girls are run down beneath the wheels of speeding pranksters, themselves bored and looking for the cheap thrill of ultra-violence? Is it so hard to see ourselves in the avidity of the Television Audience, watching the panicked, doomed, frantic rictus face of the condemned man stalked by the mechanical Hound, the images of his death broadcast back by the electronic antennaes on the monster's back? Isn't that merely COPS or \\"Survivor\\" with a bite?I've seen the Future, and it works. Because it is our world I see, our world upon us---for that reason, \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is the most terrifying book I have ever read.JSG"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury does a great job of capturing the future of man, in his desire to reject thinking and embrace mindless leisure. The future world involves a backwards world where firemen start fires to rid the world of books, because that is in the best interest of good social order. But our hero is a fireman who develops a conscience, after meeting a spunky 17 year old who has dreams and challenges our man that the world may have been different in the past.The tension between our hero and his fire captain boss, as well as the tension with his mindless wife, are excellent. The whole story is an eye opener, full of compelling action and riviting philosophical discussion.I enjoyed the notes from Mr Bradbury in the 50th anniversary edition where he admits he subconsciously gave our protagonist the name of a paper company, and the name of his professor friend from a pencil company.This is a classic that will endure for centuries, despite whatever firemen exist in the future."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"At some point, Ray Bradbury states in his novel \`Fahrenheit 451': \`The good writers touch life often. The mediocre ones run a quick hand over her. The bad ones rape her and leave her for the flies'. Bearing this in mind, it is doubtless that Bradbury is included among the good writers. In his novel, he managed to create a parable about the intellectual wakening of a man and the dangers of censorship, in a society where people are not allowed to think.In an undefined future, the firemen job is to start fire. They are supposed to burn books, and the houses of people who keep published material. Guy Montag is a fireman who has never questioned the pleasures of burning, until one day when out of curiosity he takes a copy of a book home and together with his wife he tries to read. However, they have never read a book, and while they can read, they are not able to understand, to connect the sentences. This is just the awakening of Montag's mind. We know there is something about him, and that he won't be the same until we reach the last page.Rather than being far fetcher Bradbury created a timeless story. Things like those describes in the book have been happening for ages. We may not literally burn books, but books, newspapers and magazines are burnt everyday. Like he describes in the book it began with one minority ripping one paragraph, then another, then one more... until the day that it would be better to burn the whole book. We live in the age of minorities, and we should watch out some request.The present edition is followed by an \`Afterword' and a \`Coda' written by Bradbury in first person. In the first he tells specifically about this novel, the process of writing and once more give voice to his characters to talk about themselves and they world they --and us-- live. In the second part, the writer talks about how timeless his novel indeed is. These two last chapters are very clarifying and help a lot in the understanding of the book. My suggestion is: read this novel, think of it, and see how the world can be one day. And then do your part to avoid things in this book becoming real, because \`Fahrenheit 451' can be anything, but far fetched."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Of the people I know who have read this book, roughly three-fourths of them loved it and the other fourth hated it. I would be in the former group.Fahrenheit 451 tells of a not too distant future where all books are banned, and anyone caught with even one book has it, and the rest of their belongings, burned. It describes a future where human life means next to nothing and war is not uncommon. I won't go any further into the plot, as many other reviewers already have.Ray Bradbury has a mastery of the English language that requires the book to be read slowly in order to be fully understood, but it is ultimately very rewarding. For the type of book it is, it is the perfect length. It has just enough details to keep you interested, but not too many to bog down the enjoyment. And it is paced perfectly.I've seen this book getting quite a few comparisons to Orwell's 1984. I have read both books, and I don't think they really compare. 1984 is a slower, much more detailed look into a government, while Fahrenheit 451 is faster paced and focuses on one aspect of the government of the future.I've read the book no less than four times, and enjoy it more each time. It is now one of my favorite books.It does have to be read slowly due to Bradbury's metaphorical way of writing. I consider it Bradbury's masterpiece, and while all may not agree, you should at least give it a try, taking time to absorb exactly what it is Bradbury is saying."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have conflicting feelings for this book. I appreciate the disturbing, yet very real, idea brought to light in this story: what if books really were burned, and that was normal? What if the majority of society was just a slew of brain-washed followers? Those themes, among others, in this book are important to consider, in my opinion. I, for one, cherished books and the freedom to own them more after having read this book. Unfortuantely, I didn't really enjoy the actual reading of this novel. The writing seemed, if not flat, then more devoid of emotion than it ought to have been. I like writing to be descriptive and fulfilling, while still understandable. Bradbury's writing is, at times, flowery past my point of immediate comprehension, and at other times, not quite creative enough. There are certain lines in this book that didn't read quite right, and some ideas I didn't think were adequately explained. The mechanical dog- interesting idea, vague deliverance. The 'family' was interesting as well, though I don't think that Bradbury explored it enough. This novel's main flaw was, in the most extreme sense, flat writing. My opinion might be more biased because of a rather severe project I had to do on the book after having read it, which deflated my liking for it a bit, but I hope I've been as objective as possible. I'd recommend reading this book, as it is a fine piece of easy-to-read literature and a fascinating look into the future of books, though don't expect for a masterpiece on your hand. The writing could definately have been better filled out."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I first read Ray Bradbury in my literature book, in English class. I was instantly hooked.

His style is constant--his use of metaphors has more of an impact than any other author I've ever read. He has a rare ability to deviate from the regular stereotypes of the future, making the settings as believable as if they were set in the present time.I immensely enjoyed this. It really conveyed the image of what a world would be like without books--lacking substance and meaning; having pleasure at violence and taking for granted what they had. Mr. Bradbury never ceases to amaze me. The character, Montag, was a perfect balance of the influences society had impacted him, and his own emerging understanding of reality.I'm greatly inspired by this, and I hope to mature enough to write something of as much quality as Fahrenheit 451."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Sure the story of a nightmare world in which free speech is forbidden, as a parable for the directions our real-life society is going, has been done a million times - both before and after \\"Fahrenheit 451.\\" So why is Bradbury's book a classic? The key is his superior writing skills and offbeat social subversion. In Bradbury's world, free speech has not been suppressed through a fascist exercise in social control and forced conformity, as in Huxley's similar \\"Brave New World.\\" Instead, in this book free speech has been eliminated indirectly through what would now be called rampant political correctness. Every single piece of free speech might be offensive to someone somewhere, so all books and entertainment are eliminated so the masses can waste away in feel-good conformity. Ignorance is bliss in this world. This is a groundbreaking concept for a book written way back in the 50's. Bradbury must have been terrified by the PC hordes that broke out 30 or 40 years later. The one major problem with this book is the characters. The protagonist Montag is ultimately narrow and undefined, even though most of the story concerns his inner struggles. The other main characters - Beatty, Faber, and Granger - exist only as longwinded speechifiers for Bradbury's ideas. But the book is saved by the real sense of creeping dread and social agony lurking in the background, all highlighted by Bradbury's intriguing prose and curveball plot techniques.Be sure to read an edition of this book published after around 1980. Prior to that, editors had abridged the book without Bradbury's consent, removing some troubling passages for the sake of helpless schoolkids (or more likely, their holier-than-thou educators). This is the ultimate irony - censorship of a book about censorship! Be on the lookout for an edition containing Bradbury's \\"Coda\\" (or epilogue) - a blistering indictment of this issue in which Bradbury essentially tells all opponents to kiss his you-know-what, in a quite scathing way."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I guess I've always wanted to be an individual, to look deeper and find the rich goodness of life and freedom in being me. I have found this richness through books. When i discovered Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, it was the book that defined my love of the me that I am. I think Faber said it best, when he told Montag &quot;I don't talk things, sir; I talk the meaning of things. I sit here and know I am alive.&quot; After I read this book I knew I wasn't the only one who craved a richer life through the great world of imagaination and books and knowledge. You see, I am alive and thinking."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury's classic &quot;Farenheit 451&quot; seems to become more true all the time (although it was not intended as a prediction) for example, one of the characters mentions students shooting eachother as if it was an everyday occurence.Beyond that, the plot of &quot;Farenheit 451&quot; is intriguing, poignant, and fun to read.Anyone who has not yet read this classic should pick it up."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbruy creates a world of censorship and what is supposed to be simplistic and fun. The main character, Guy Montag has the profession of a fireman, and rather then put out fires, he begins them. His job is to destroy books, but he soon realizes that there is more to the world than what is told to him. With the help of some very interesting supporting characters Montag's life is drastically changed. This is a really quick read under 200 pages. It was definantly thought provoking and the whole message fits in any time period."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"When I first read this book, I was so incredibly lost. It was the first Bradbury book I'd ever read, and I guess I just wasn't used to his style. There were so many times I would have to reread 5 or 6 pages 3 or 4 times because I was so confused about what was going on. The characters were strange, and I couldn't ever tell what side they were on;it was really unpredictable. It's one of those books where you need to sit down and read it in a quiet atmosphere and focus on Bradbury's symbolism all throughout the book. If you miss the symbolism, you won't get much out of the book. I think it's hard for people under 13 to really understand some of the symbolism that's in the book, so there's really no purpose in them reading the book, since they won't understand it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is an excellent book dealing with the ever prominent debate of censorship. Fahrenheit 451 is extremely well-written and organized and in an age where outrage is frowned upon very, very timely.

Thumbs up to Mr. Bradbury!!!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Did anyone see the Washington Post article a few days ago about more and more people choosing not to read books anymore for pleasure? It's frightening: in Bradbury's novel, this situation was the precursor to the banning of books!I was so moved at the end of the book that I was overwhelmed with tears. What an astounding book! I'm so embarrassed that I never read this important book before now.To all of the reviewers out there decrying it as too hard to read: Yes, the language is a little difficult to get through and interpret at times, but isn't that what reading is all about? Part of the joy and challenge of reading is figuring out what the author is trying to say. It's not supposed to be easy! This is not an episode of &quot;Friends&quot; or an issue of People magazine."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"O K so I admit, I'm more than a touch biased, but hey!! Ray's my man!! I mean the guy is GOOD!! He's got the smarts, he's got the talent and he proves it with every single novel he has published. But I'm not the only one holding such an opinion, after all Disney studios could have had any of ther scripting staff do a screenplay of &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; but nooo. They had the smarts (a very rare and scarce thing in Hollywood) to ask Mr.Bradbury himself to write a screenplay of his own work. According to my memory Mr.Bradbury in a TV plug said that &quot;about 80% of what went onscreen&quot; was his work. Now there's writing that commands respect, and rightly so, when such little cinematic licence as only 20% is taken in filming a given screenplay. Makes a person curious as to how much of Stephen King's own efforts went into, say, &quot;Creepshow&quot; or &quot;Silver Bullet&quot;. I tell ya people Mr.Bradbury has got what it takes!! Go out, read his stuff for yourselves and see if I'm wrong! I mean hey, you all got minds of your own, whatta ya need me telling you what's worth reading for? Read the book(s) see for yourselves and decide, go ahead! Put me and all the other critics and reviewers on unemployment!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Although the author of this book, Ray Bradbury, is mainly known as a science fiction author, this book has become popular and infulential enough that it has had the fortune (or misfortune, depending on your politics) a standard book on English-lit courses. Thus, it is a widely read novel. That fact taken in stride, it's sad that it's message hasn't been more widely transmitted. Fahrenheit 451 depicts a future (definitely a not-too-distant one) in which books are illegal and society is forced to take everything as it is, without questioning &quot;why?&quot; The ironic thing about this is that in subsequent printings, this book has been edited, changed around-.... Parts were taken out of it frequently, and it frequently shows up on banned book lists. What does this say about our society? Nothing too great, I'm afraid. Pull yourself away from the meaningless masses, read this book, take it's message to heart, and try to prevent the future depicted in this book from ever coming into fruitition, and maybe we can take a detour from this headlong-forward trainwreck our society is currently apathetically riding on. As Bradbury himself has said, &quot;I'm not interested in predicting the future, I'm interested in PREVENTING it.&quot; Let's help him."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury is a very interesting book. This book touches on the subject of censorship, and the damages that censorship can have in our society. While some forms of censorship are good such as keeping kids out of movies that they shouldn't be seeing, there is another side to it. Censorship, as shown by Bradbury can be a very damaging thing.In this book, fireman were required to start fires, not put them out. They started Fires by finding people who owned books, and then burning their houses down with the books inside of them. In our society today this would seem a proposterous idea, but somewhere down the line, who knows, anything is possible.The story line in this book is very interesting as well. It is fast reading, easy to understand, and has a great story with believable characters in it as well. I fully enjoyed this book, I actually read it from cover to cover without putting it down because I continually wanted to know what was going to happen to the main character. My advise to those who are interested in this book is to definitely buy it, you will not regret it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I recently read a series of letters-to-the-editor in my local newspaper from a group of middle schoolers who had just read Fahrenheit 451. 8 out of 10 didn't like the book because it &quot;encouraged burning books.&quot; Ahem, did they ACTUALLY read the book or just the back cover? Also many of them were pro-cencorship....I don't know what it is about that class, but I also read this in 8th grade (I am a senior in h.s. now) and I loved it. No one that age should have trouble grasping that the book is ANTI-censorship. Bradbury's style is a little hard to follow at first, but I quickly got used to it and found it fascinating. It is still one of my favorite books, and it gets better every time that I read it (probably because I get older). This is definitely five stars!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"&quot;There is more than one way to burn a book. And the world is full of people running about with lit matches.&quot; -Ray Bradbury (Coda, Fahrenheit 451)This book is outstanding! It is a book for people who love books. It is a testament to the power of books and the importance of the knowledge they hold.It reminded me a lot of 1984 and Brave New World. If you liked either of these two novels, you will like Fahrenheit 451. Guy Montag, the fireman turned fugitive, is a lot like Winston Smith in Orwell's 1984 because he is forced to hide from an organization that wishes to destroy him. He is also like John Savage in Huxley's Brave New World because they both come to see the importance of literature, art, and beauty in the world. All three men are trapped in societies that are all about a quick fix, the easy way out.Fahrenheit 451 offers everything: action, drama, suspense, inner struggle, inspiration, faith. There's isn't really any romance, but the connection between Montag and his young neighbor Clarisse McClellan, who opens his eyes to the world around him, is one of the best I've read.Bradbury makes it clear that this novel is anti-science science fiction. Technology is not important in the great scheme of things. Human interaction, knowledge, beauty, these are what life is all about."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book I read in high school it is my favorite, religious symbolism is powerful (even though organized religion is silly) and the imagery is great."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I really don't think I've come across a book as good as this one in all of my 13 years of life.

This book blends poetry and intricate writing to create a graceful page-turner. I had to read it for my 8th grade English class, and read 90 pages over! I didn't fall asleep until 11:30!

Most of the literiture that I've come across has had ideas that come from other books, but Bradury's idea was clearly original, especially if this was written in the 50's. The language is of the kind Shakespeare couldn't think of. I don't think that even George Lucas could think up such a world. Within the first three sentences I was entranced. The suspense was of the kind that kept me awake, even at 3 A.M., and reading by flashlight. This book will help society be more careful about the future.

I am somewhat amazed at how prophetic some of those books were. This book, written now almost 50 years ago, is a sociological treatise of things to come; and unfortunately - it has come to fruition. I am equally amazed how accurate Bradbury's predictions were. How did he know? What insights did he have? Is he truly a seer? Was this written as a fanciful warning, or of what our society WOULD be? The televised helicopter chase scenes; being more familiar and comfortable with our television families - than our own flesh and bloods. A society composed of Mildreds. No critical thinking - just having FUN. Don't disturb us with thoughts and ideas. We're happy, and we intend to stay that way - at the expense of all else. The banning and the burning of books. The revising and shredding of ideas being performed not by the government -- but by pressures from the minorities, the majorities, the intellectuals, special interest freaks, 2nd rate entertainers. Political Correctness. This book should be required reading for all young people. If you find this book DISTURBING -- then you are already a Mildred. You have lost.

Anyway, i was amazed that they had cliff's notes for it, until i read some of these reviews...its sad really.If you go into every book thinking that you are being FORCED to read it and FORCED to think about it, you won't like it. At least that's my explanation for all the one star reviews.Equally disturbing/humorous are those who say that this book should be burned. That makes me laugh.

Throughout the book, Bradbury says that books are made for people to think and without this ability to think, people are a mass of &quot;happy&quot; that care nothing of responsibility or consequence.This novel had a profound effect on me, even if I am only 16. I do not want to criticize, but there is some ignorance in the other reviews. People want this book to be exciting, like a TV show. Montag seems to prophisize this in his book. He says people like to be led and not think by a TV, rather than lead and think by a book. I guess it is sad that people think this. Montag's prophicy of a psuedo-happy world may realize. It seems to be leaning that way.If you think while you read, this book is excellent. It is a theme book, not plot. I enjoyed it greatly and it has given me a new outlook on life (as a book should).

If you can get past all the abstract adjectives the reading is fairly quick. Enjoy this book, and keep an open mind. It is not politically correct!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is an anti-censorship novel by Ray Bradbury, in which a world is presented that could very easily be our own. Its protagonist, Guy Montag, is a fireman whose job is to burn books, but one night on the job he has a change of heart. He realizes how wrong it is to limit people's minds, and in this moment Bradbury makes the reader reflect about the importance of freedom and humanity. Montag reveals to his wife where he has hidden over twenty of the forbidden novels, and from that point on he finds himself being persecuted by the ignorance and coldness of the world around him. Montag's main antagonist is his former fire chief, Captain Beatty. Over the couse of the book he presents the reader with disturbingly realistic monologues concerning mankind's eventual decline into ignorance. The most alarming part of this decline is, as Beatty points out, that it was the people's choice. This ignorance is not only what leads to the burning of books, but also to a fear of their fellow man which made their world cold and unfeeling. Chilling in its realty, Fahrenheit 451 is just as relevant today as it was when first written."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The major complaint against this book, as far as I can see, is from elementary school students who resent being forced to read works they don't understand.

Occasionally, I reread those books, and some of them still flare up my imagination. F451 is one of those. There is a misconception that scifi authors must predict the future in minute detail, the more so if they deal with social issues, lest their work becomes &quot;dated&quot;. Not so; good authors write about the present. If one chooses to select current trends and extrapolate them, it's irrelevant how accurate a prophet one is. It matters not whether or not firemen will ever go from firefighters to firesetters. What matters is that Bradbury foresaw, and denounced, a society drowned in entertainment - worse still, &quot;infotainment&quot; -, assailed by a barrage of GUIs, emoticons, acronyms, shoot-'em-down, trigger-happy computer games, &quot;educational&quot; software that is none other than, &quot;interactive&quot; TV shows plastered on wall-sized screens, complete with FX and surround sound ... And never a moment to be alone with ourselves and just plain think. From readers'comments, I garner F451 is being given as an assignment to 7th and 8th graders. Too little, too late.

My attitude now towards the subject of potential loss of freedom combined with mass culture, although much more down-to-earth than it was in my teens, is still pretty much the same: respect and appreciation of human freedom of expression. Bradbury is very clear in his fight for freedom, the extreme fictional situation he devised is now more real than ever - true we are not prohibited from keeping books (in this country anyway), but we are offered enough mass culture that most people will spend hours in front of the TV rather than reading books or visiting museums (I do that a lot too).

It is about a future with no books or free thoughts and how humanity has been outstripped by our technology. The books plot and teachings are very important now since our technologies and inventions are being created and upgraded at amazing speeds. The book is also very well-written, with great comparisons and a defining language. The ending, however, is unfulfilling, especially after the incredible suspense the book builds up. On the other hand, a person with other tastes might view this book as a waste of time and money.

It seemed like the chief firefighter, Beatty could have been in the same position, but he fell victim to society either by choice or because he thought it would benefit society. These people didn't know the difference between a &quot;normal&quot; society and a totalitarian society. So to us, the reader, he looked like the hero, but he looked like an antagonist in the society he was living. If we turn the tables around and put Montag into our present day society, and he challenged our present-day society, he would look like the opponent, or the radical right-winged activist. I know I don't agree with those kinds of people, so I probably would not have agreed with Montag if I were in that society because that is the safe way out. That is a safe way of thinking. I think Bradbury is trying to say that most of us take the safe way out when it comes to activism. I'm sure if I acted as Montag did in opposite in this present day and age, I would be looked down upon too. At the end, Montag and his friends try to make a difference in society no matter how hard the path in front of them would be. Maybe Bradbury is making the point that we should make a difference in our own society by taking an activist standpoint in the media, and standing for our beliefs, no matter how radical they might be.

Unlike the typical high school student, reading is one of my most cherished activities. Thus I was pleased to find that we would be reading 'heavy' novels and were expected to do some thinking beyond the usual confines of teen thought. I was shocked at the way most of my peers responded to the novel and the assignment itself. Most hated the novel and were disgruntled to find that we were (gasp) supposed to think? The very idea! It was actually quite ironic to find that the very ideas of lax thought and caring that Mr. Bradbury was trying to convey were precisely what I found in my classmates. It was also a disturbing discovery for me to make. Farenheit 451 was an excellent novel although I believe it was written far in advance of its time. Had it been published just recently, perhaps more people would understand the troubles it predicts, which are indeed staring us in the face. The most interesting part of the novel is that it came in a time when the Guy Montags of the world were frowned upon, as were individualism and self-expression. The struggles which Guy faces are a perfect example of today's struggles. There are some of us in the world who refuse to conform and think exactly like the government wants or society decrees. It makes one truly think about how close we have come to slipping into Guy's society. Look at Hitler and WW II. Look at genetic engineering and euthansia. Mr. Bradbury's novel gives a chilling and striking depeiction of what the world would be like without a few individualists.

The Parlors are symbolic of modern man's addiction to TV and the internet. The vapid importance of American Idol and such are lamented by Montag at the house party. When Montag is being chased by the hound, the network goes live to cover it - very much like today's coverage of police chases.

I know many differ on that opinion but I truly enjoy his works. 451 is my favorite of his writings. I think it is fascinating to see how much the time influenced him. How so many things you see in the movie are now in creation like the wall tv (our flat screen now). This book was required reading in my youth and I feel it should be required today as well. It's a view of a world which could easily occur if we allow our rights to be flushed basically. How we could easily fall into a dystopian world if we become complacent and lack knowledge. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is a Great book. Should be a must read for anyone who thinks that the government should have more power.

One day he meets an odd girl who asks questions that force Montag to introspect and look beyond the limitations imposed by his job. The girl asks Montag whether he is happy and then disappears.The future wages war on the printed word to resist excessive thought. A long attention span it seems is the true enemy of the state. The euphoric electronic haze that society demands to keep happy ultimately serves the state's purpose. The war on books began not as a state mandate but as a devolution of the soul. The Bible has been banned and Jesus made into a peppermint colored advertising icon. First literary digests, pulp fiction, and then the ubiquitous interactive talking walls peopled with idiotic families opiated a population that wanted... indeed...demanded immediate gratification. The state has no problem exerting control after that.A woman chooses to be immolated with her books. The book pyre lights the dark recesses of Montag's kerosene soaked soul as he recounts the girl's question... are you happy Montag? Montag begins a journey of self discovery as he steals a book.As a fugitive, Montag sees his unfortunate double killed on TV as he seeks refuge with outcasts in the forests surrounding the city he has escaped. The show must go on and the networks demand a good ending no matter what the cost. Montag's wife betrays him after he confronts her and her friends with the question are you happy?The crumbling, oblivious society Montag protects is quickly flinging itself apart with suicide, abortion and mass ignorance about hostile foreign countries struggling with poverty. The introspective girl is run over by murderous joy riders...later Montag narrowly escapes the same fate. Ever passing jets hearken of an incipient war.It is remarkable how time can make a book even more prescient than it once was. As I commute to work in Germany, I see the isolated and lonely crouched over social media and muffled into oblivion by large headphones while rocking gently to the train. When Bradbury wrote this book society was struggling with the implications of a new medium called TV. Newton Minow,FCC commissioner during the sixties, called TV the vast \\"wasteland.\\" How true and yet how understated today. Social media is not only an opiate but it is a source of monitoring making it far more ominous than TV or pulp fiction.It seems that the short attention span Montag enforced with his flamethrower served the same purpose as the \\"newspeak\\"-truncated language- that Orwell's state in \\"1984\\" used to protect itself from accountability. The flamethrower state had it easy at the start, it just let the culture do the trick. The chatting idiotic wall families did the rest as Bradbury tells us in the book...P 53. There was no dictum, no declaration, no censorship, to start with, no! Technology, mass exploitation, and minority pressure carried the trick, thank God."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I admit I have never read this important book. Not even for school. Of course I knew what it was about because it is so iconic. A society where reading books is illegal and punishable. The way these criminal readers are punished? Burn not only their books, but their entire houses. Eeek.The story takes place mostly in the head of the main character Guy Montag. He is a fireman in a dystopian, alternate society. Fireman are responsible for burning things that are dangerous, case in point, books. But Guy has an awakening of conscience after meeting Clarissa, his teenage neighbor, who asks him questions that he is now forced to think about whether he likes it or not and after a woman decides to burn with her books.The story is a great deal of Montag's thoughts as he deals with his new views. They are written as a stream of conscience and there is very little container, although I could see the little house where he and his wife lived and his neighborhood and even the woods where he sought refuge. Some of the details were confusing to me at times, but they didn't take away from the context of the story.Bradbury's style is staccato and reminded me of the militant society in which the story took place. This made for powerful thoughts and ideas. It is emotional and sometimes just downright heartbreaking.The narrator is good, but I felt his voice and language a bit forced at times. I also think that for me, an audio book was the way to go for Fahrenheit 451. I'm not sure I would have been able to get out of it what I did had I been reading it myself.I can't say I enjoyed this book, but I'm glad I gave it a try. I find myself thinking about that alternate world, a world without books because different ideas are dangerous, because different views lead to trouble. Burn out anything that is politically incorrect or the least bit offensive and soon you have a sterile setting. In this world, only being entertained and pursuing pleasures are encouraged. The pursuit of philosophy will just make people unhappy because they will see how unfair life is.I like the character Clarissa, the young girl who had her mind and her eyes open. She is innocent and represents that in the way she asks questions and daydreams and wonders. I thought the wife Millie interesting because although it is apparent that she is unhappy, that she is aware something is wrong with this existence, she shuts it away and pretends everything is fine.I liked afterward by Bradbury who talks of editing and likens it to the reasons given in his book. He quotes \\"There is more than one way to burn a book.\\" He also wrote a play re-visiting the characters of F-451 and said the one who revealed the most is Baty, the Fire Chief. Baty, it turns out, in this play has thousands of books. BUT, he never reads them. The law states you cannot read them, but it doesn't state you cannot have them. He diabolically lets them die because they are never read.This wasn't the easiest book to get through for me, but it is an important one that everybody, especially book lovers, should give a try."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I've known the title for a while and with the recent death of the author decided to finally read the book; very glad I did. \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" explores a society without books - hard for me to imagine so I'm grateful that Bradbury did. On display is a war torn society where massive wall sized televisions take the place of reading and in-depth human engagement. A society populated with a disempowered citizenry, some unwilling to think for themselves, others unable not to. For me, the book is, at its core, a tale of resistance; demonstrated by Montag's instinctive urges to find out more about the history of book burning and the subsequent actions he undertakes to change things. If resistance is at the core, a collective unconsciousness and apathy are the rings that contain it. Throughout the novel Bradbury contends that the state of affairs is not something that was forced upon the people by a Big Brother apparatus; the people simply allowed it happen. They didn't put up much of a fight at all, being too distracted by the pursuit of happiness to realize the erosion of freedom. Collective memory and its importance in sustaining a viable future plays a large role in the novel and reinforces the notion that what we don't remember we're bound to repeat.\\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is a superb read; its classic status solid. I'm not sure if it remains on many high schools' reading lists but this is one that stands the test of time.

I love to read but I find I often hated the books selected by schools for children to read. Considering how dull most of the literature is that children are made to read in high school it tends to make me wonder how I, and others, maintain our love of literature.But Ray Bradbury's world and his writing style kept me hooked and made me a fan over fifteen years ago and I am still a fan of his work now. I am saddened that he is gone now but his writing will love on forever as he was our generation's H. G.

In a day when all houses are fire proof one must take different measures if they wish to get rid of things that the government bans. He and the fire department are in charge of making sure everyone follows the rules. This means no books, and those who have books must be punished. Guy Montag enjoys starting fires to burn the houses with books. He enjoys the heat, the smell of kerosine. He does not question the reason why he must burn the books he just does it, until he meets a 17 year old girl who moves in next door to him and a professor who no longer teaches but hides in fear like everyone else. The girl is different and she makes him think about the world around him and how it got to be the way it is.I really enjoyed listening to this the descriptions were amazing. There is nothing like a good book burning when described with such beauty. This is the first Ray Bradbury book I have heard/read. I have to admit I'm surprised I didn't find him sooner. Guy Montag is an interesting man who starts out just like everyone else in the book he doesn't think for himself. He doesn't love. He doesn't feel anything. The world Bradbury creates is so like our own yet so different. I wonder if we are moving towards a world like the one in Fahrenheit 451 or if books will survive in this area of immediate pleasure. The characters in here were vibrant and full of life until the very end. The mechanical hound with eight legs is such a strange hound we wonder how it can be a hound. The fire engine named after the mythical salamander that breathed fire is such an interesting image. I don't imagine wheels but legs that crawl down the roads to start the next fire and then back to the station.

Whether you hated it or loved it when you read it in high school, or even if you didn't read it in high school, it is an outstanding story and Bradbury's writing is as smooth and clean as always."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This slim little novella is a rollicking story about Guy Montag, a \\"firefighter\\" of the future who loves his job. His job is not to put out fires, but to set them. Montag and his comrades burn books for a living. It doesn't matter what type of books, they have all been targeted for incineration. Apparently, in the America of Guy's time, the people, and especially the government, have decided that books are a bad deal. Books make people think and agonize over choices, which is a bad thing. The real goal of society should be happiness for everyone. Since no one can be happy if they are always worrying about things they read, the solution is clear. Unfortunately, many people seem to have a problem with this, at least on a subconscious level. Suicides in Guy's world are sky high, so high that they have special teams of medics go around and suck pills and other nasty poisons out of the people who have decided they don't want to live anymore. The government does try to placate the masses through mind numbing television and radio shows (see Guy's wife, Mildred). People that refuse to go along with the program are sent away, or worse. Guy wakes up when he meets a young neighbor who turns him on to the way of experiencing life. Guy eventually rebels and ends up as part of a group who memorize books to preserve them for future generations.I'm leaving out lots of details to the book with this description. After all, I don't want to spoil the whole thing for you. What seems to be more important about this book is its value to today's world. Although written years ago, some of Bradbury's details are amazingly prescient. The omnipresence of television and other means of electronic control certainly ring true today. Also, the censoring of books continues unabated even now, with every type of group clamoring for some type of control over what the rest of us read. Certainly, burning books of every sort couldn't be far away. Since most people read nothing but pap these days anyway, I can imagine Plato and Milton going up in flames soon enough. Who wants to read that boring stuff when you can watch TV or go to a movie? Soon after this comes what Bradbury refers to as, \\"the tyranny of the masses.\\" If enough people don't want to do something, you better jump on the bandwagon too. Try going to work and speaking out against multiculturalism and see what happens. Throw out your TV set and tell people about doing so. You'll be branded a freak and avoided like the plague. People are cattle, plain and simple. Bradbury does seem to have some hope for our sorry condition, as can be seen at the end of the book. However, getting to that state will take some time, I'm afraid."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"What would society be like if books were banned and burned?

I liked Bradbury's style, this book was a pleasure to read and will be a treasure to share with others. After reading this, don't forget the lessons within. Books are vital, but as an avid reader you know that already. The key is to share the message with others.

His novel, Fahrenheit 451, is far and away the most original book this reviewer has ever read, not to mention one of the best written.Bradbury has a unique style which allows the reader to picture the story in their mind in the style of a David Fincher movie. Chuck Palahnuk, author of Fight Club, shares this same quality.The most striking aspect of Fahrenheit 451 is by far its plot: firefighters who burn houses, rather than put out the fires. (...) the novel itself becomes hard to put down. As the reader follows the movements and thoughts of Guy Montag, rogue firefighter who dares to read books, making him a hypocrite. Montag's progression from book burner to advocater of reading, to fugitive on the run from a world who decides that he has learned too much is as strange as it is heroic.Bradbury's unique take on the future is common only with the views of George Orwell, author of 1984. In both of these novels, the government decides that it has had enough of the uniqueness that makes America so great, so \\"Big Brother\\" must eliminate. Despite this similarity, Fahrenheit manages to distance itself with the use of censorship. Censorship as it is is out of control in the United States, and Bradbury's tale is hopefully not prophetic. Overall, few books are as captivating and original as Ray Bradbury's beautiful Fahrenheit 451."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I hate science fiction books.So why am I giving this book 5 stars?

The thoughts that Bradbury puts into his character's minds are so beautiful, sharp, and alive. I guess I like this book because even though it is supposively sci-fi, it's REAL too.

The book may start out slow in the beginning but as the story starts to unfold it becomes fast paced and fun to read. It has its &quot;whats going to happen next&quot; moments. Its about a Fireman named Guy Montag. He isnt the normal fireman. Now fireman are used to start fires.

Let your kid pick their own freetime reading book. They wont enjoy a book if their parents try to force them into reading it. I'm a kid so I would know, and please, dont try to argue.

Guy Montag a fireman, and the story's protagonist, enjoys coming home every night form the firehouse waiting for a call, playing poker and telling crude jokes to his companions (who all looked exactly like him). He also enjoys the destruction and burning of the books and he is constantly bathed in a perfume of kerosene. Coming home form work he would often feel as if someone had been on this one particular corner, waiting for him, but he never stopped and looked around. He was like all the other folks, in that he would just keep going ahead to where he was going, not looking at what he was walking past. Except one night he stopped and met a girl who taught him of the past where folks were allowed to think and to read and to have original ideas for themselves, and the ability to write them down and share them with others. As the story progresses we go deeper into the world of Guy Montag, meeting his drug-abusing wife and her \\"family\\" on the telescreens. We discover the ways that the society works, about how people are impersonal, not knowing their own neighbors, and how the television thinks for everyone so that they don't have to. This book parallels other books depicting futures where it is near impossible to be a free-thinking individual, such as 1984 and brave new world. Also it resembles present day America, even more so now then when it was originally written. Ray Bradbury's easy to read, yet descriptive text makes the story easy to read and hard to put down. The plot thickens, twists and sickens with every page. It is a warning that everyone, especially now in a world that grows more and more like Mr. Montag's, should heed to."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read this book in two days, and was focused throughout, inhaling Bradburys words and letting the book have its effect on my mind.What the book is missing in a THICK plot it gains in its writing style. Bradbury is simply a literary genius, and post-modern Marxist environments are his playground. The way that Bradbury depicts the forest which Montag enters after leaving the river is extremely surreal, if not surrealism in its nature.What I mean by &quot;What the book is missing in a THICK plot,&quot; is that Bradbury could have developed the story in a more progressive fashion, rather than leaving out some important aspects of Montag's world. The overall politics of the time in which this is supposed to take place are not even present in the novel. The way in which the society went from not being interested in books, to burning them also seems to be under-expressed.Criticizing an artist is something that I have a hard time doing, for when a writer writes, he writes, and that is all. Bradbury wrote, and this book is him, with its perceived flaws and all, I think that it is a masterpiece in a poetic sense, not in the sense that it has become a staple of highschool literature.I will put it this way, if you like the colorful environments of Allen Ginsbergs poetry, then you will surely enjoy at least the aesthetic qualities of Fahrenheit 451."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Only Bradbury's prose, terrifying and lovely, could bring this story to its rightful place as a literary masterpiece. His narrative of Dystopian society, distressing in its reality, reflects not only the lunatic consumerism of Western nations but the fallacy of freedom in a democracy. The hero, Guy Montag, wanders from uneasy fireman to eventual pariah; the discovery of something larger than himself, the wisdom of centuries contained within the very books he doused with flame, ignites his drive to discover that the world has far more to offer than bread and circuses. Moving like a ghost through his own home, ignored by a self-focused wife addicted to narcotics and electronic stimulus, Montag is painfully aware of the void between himself and the masses. This loss of intimacy, both within one's personal life and again in that most intimate of contact -- reading another's thoughts from an open book -- is the harbinger of man's fall from enlightenment. The world of Guy Montag does not begin upon opening this dark wonder, and there is no prophecy in its pages. The story is alive, here, now, and has been since the onslaught of corporate propaganda and our apathetic acceptance of plastic culture. Bradbury's subject is not that we are advancing into intellectual oblivion; it is, instead, that mankind is complacent enough to let it happen."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; describes a society where knowledge is controlled by book-burning 'firemen'. This government-implemented censorship starts as 'political correctness' -- upset people deface controversial books. Then government decides to pacify society by simplifying education and eliminating books. Noncontroversial interactive televised plays replace books as entertainment, neighbors inform on neighbors possessing books, and firemen incinerate houses containing books.Guy Montag, a fireman, meets a young woman who chides him for living but not experiencing life. Guy examines his life. His relationship with his wife Mildred is remote and cold -- they have nothing in common. (Mildred spends *all* of her time in the 'living room', a room with an interactive television screen covering each of three walls. Mildred sleeps in a separate bed with 'seashell' radio earpieces in her ears.) During one firecall Guy observes a homeowner herself light the firemen's kerosene and then perish in the flames -- Guy cannot understand the woman's protest. And upon reflection Guy cannot understand why books must be burnt. His attitude alienates his fellow firemen, who threaten and then arrest him. Guy escapes and seeks refuge in the countryside.&quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; somewhat resembles Aldous Huxley's &quot;Brave New World&quot; and George Orwell's &quot;1984&quot;. &quot;Brave New World&quot; uses eugenic control and the drug 'soma' to pacify society. &quot;1984&quot; uses ever-present surveillance, propaganda and torture to pacify society. &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; simplifies education and bans books (i.e., eliminates controversial thinking and discussion), substitutes interactive television (e.g., video games and the Internet), and portrays neighbors as informants to be avoided -- everyone is isolated in their home. The &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; societal portrayal seems less sinister, but it is easier to implement and therefore more dangerous.There *are* many similarities between &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; society and today's United States urban society. And &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; is a beautifully-written book suitable to read aloud. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is one of the most famous works of science fiction, and with \\"Brave New World\\" and \\"1984\\" represents one of the most memorable and haunting dystopias. In a future world, books are banned and firemen actually set fires instead of extinguishing them. The state exercises a form of social control through controlling what sort of information people have access to. It turns out that not all books are banned, only those that we would today consider \\"great works\\" - Plato, Shakespeare, The Bible, Darwin, etc. For me one of the biggest surprises about Fahrenheit 451 was the rationale that was offered for the burning of those books. In a nutshell, they offended politically correct sensibilities and the authorities felt that they would undermine the social cohesion. This expunging of the classics from the culture has an uncanny resonance with the attempts over past few decades to expunge them from the undergraduate liberal arts curriculum. And rationale is also similar: these books are not \\"diverse\\" enough and may offend the sensibilities of an ever-increasing list of \\"minorities.\\" It is hard not to wonder if a milder, softer version of dystopian future that Bradbury was worried about in the early 1950s has not in fact arrived.Bradbury's writing and ideas are somewhere between those of George Orwell and Philip K. Dick. His style is very engaging, and even poetic. His writing is at its best when one of his characters engages in a prolonged monolog. However, the plot development could use some improvement. There is very little in terms of transition from one scene to the next, and most scenes are overly compressed. It is very hard to follow the plot developments at times. Nonetheless, Bradbury is a wonderful stylist and unlike much of science fiction this book is a pleasure to read on a purely literally level as well as for its sweeping ideas.As a last note, I found it incredibly ironic that I read this book on Kindle. Based on this alone I am fairly optimistic that reading and great books will not only survive but in fact thrive well into the 21st century."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"***This review may contain spoilers**Readers (including myself initially) have praised Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 (hereafter F451) as an uncannily prophetic depiction of our current society and its alarming (no pun intended) future. Of course it is; all futuristic novels ultimately are. With only the present as a frame of reference, science fiction writers almost always illustrate a future stunningly similar to what they are living in now, except for a few described technological, social, or legal \\"advances\\" purportedly made to keep society \\"happy\\". Bradbury is no exception. In his future, books are illegal, banned, and burned because they \\"confuse\\" people and make people \\"unhappy\\". However, F451 is not a simplistic treatise on how getting everyone to read again will automatically improve society. Professor Faber says as much to fireman-turned-protestor Guy Montag. In its way, F451 argues that creating a perfect personal utopia is an unrealistic and actually deleterious societal goal. Instead, I believe F451 argues that a continuous evolutionary improvement of society truly matters, and that can only occur with the perpetuation of thoughts and ideas.In Guy Montag's society, people seek blissfull. sedentary, entertainment as life's goal. Thinking, as exemplified through book readiing, threatens that goal. So firemen like Montag actually START fires at bibliophiles' residences to stop those purveyors of literary thought. But not everyone has been lulled into hedonistic trances, like Guy's \\"media zombie\\" wife Mildred. Clarisse McClellan wasn't. Neither was Professor Faber. Both iconoclasts help develop Guy's own latent dissatisfaction with society's anti-intellectualism and keep ideas alive. His opponents are technology itself (symbolized by the Mechanical Hound) and society itself (as embodied - a bit artificially in my opinion, but still effectively, by Captain Beatty, Guy's firehouse chief). Dangerous and seductive as these enemies are, somehow Guy resists their tempting entreaties to forget this snobbish foolishness and preserve the stable status quo, and remain a subversive protestor.Guy escapes the sterile but deadly city and barely escapes annihilation as war presumably wipes out mankind. In the country, he encounters a group of displaced intellectuals and artisans led by Granger. It is Granger that explains that despite the inevitable destruction of a society that refused to develop any further, it is up to individuals to think, discuss, and plan to keep society going and evolving. He alludes to the myth of the phoenix that burns itself up every 500 years but resurrects itself from the ashes a little wiser. Furthermore, Granger explains the difficult, counterintuitive requirement that conveyers of ideas - books and men - are not really important. Books and men can be burnt, but not ideas. Men must become ambulatory books so that they can pass the information on to a new generation. Fireproof ideas must go on.Personally, F451 is an affirmation of the indispensability of liberal arts. Many have often denounced liberal arts as impractical, unproductive, and unrewarding. F451 demonstrates that is certainly not the case, even through the dichotomy of fire. Fire ignorantly left unchecked symbolizes extinction. Fire carefully banked up, fed, and distributed properly (as the mythological Titan Prometheus found) symbolizes knowledge that keeps society alive and growing."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Received as a gift, the 50th anniversary edition has some very interesting extras including an afterword from Bradbury, a coda with additional comments from him, and a Q&A; with Del Rey. Ray Bradbury is definitely one of the sci-fi masters from the 50s, and his interviews 50 years after the book is written demonstrate how much he believes that original works reflect the timeframe and mindset in which it was written - and more importantly that they should not be tweaked or edited to reflect changing values and mores.I was amazed at how prophetic his novel is, for it is clear that for many readers nowadays, a graphic novel is the only form of \\"reading\\" they have time for. He has his own version of bluetooth, interactive videos, how consuming TV has become, the short attention span of the public looking for instant gratification, and the ability of the press to provide their version of the \\"truth\\".I think that reading this book again some 20 years after originally reading it has made this book even more memorable than when I was a teenager!

In this case, lack of tolerance for differing voices led to no voices at all--democracy has eaten itself by misunderstanding itself."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is a marvelous example of cautionary literature, exploring a future that was possible in 1953 and that while not yet realized, has only grown more possible with the passage of time. The advent of incredible technology and the resulting loss of attention span, individualism, and creativity is the most frightening aspect of the book not only because it corresponds to modern life, but because it results in self-censorship out of insecurity and fear. There are many more themes and motifs packed in this novel--some subtle and frightening, others obvious but thought-provoking--all of which are communicated masterfully by Bradbury's prose and characterization.Bradbury packs a great deal of meaning into a relatively short book, and he explores many nuances of humanity from human nature itself to technology to knowledge to conformity. These themes are all interwoven such that they lose none of their potency; they coexist perfectly and build upon one another to form a haunting picture of humanity. Throughout the novel this occurs with the principal character, Guy Montag, serving as the \\"normal\\" human viewpoint, and his interactions showing how human nature conflicts with technology, conformity, and itself. As the novel progresses we see numerous aspects of human nature arise within this character: blind contentment, conformity, curiosity, rage, frustration, self-preservation, a desire to rebel, peace, realization, and introspection to name a few.The most prominent element of the novel, quite predictably, is fire; it is the focal point of the novel and the rope which ties all of the threads of theme and motif together. We are introduced to the story with a conflagration that enthralls Montag, then still a loyal fireman. Bradbury goes to great length to describe the beauty of fire's destructive power, in the literal sense of the bright, unpredictable flames and metaphorically with its ability to change whatever it touches. As we progress through the novel fire takes on a more malevolent character, stifling creativity and thought and destroying anything potentially offensive or differentiating by sending countless tomes filled with fantasy and philosophy to oblivion. Fire then turns upon its previous masters, burning the fire chief Beatty to death, destroying one of the nightmarish mechanical hounds, and blasting a city off the map. As the novel concludes the wandering scholars note that fire will cleanse the filth it created, and open the way for the return of critical thought and individualism.Structurally and stylistically the novel performs as wonderfully as it does thematically. Bradbury divided the novel into only three chapters, but each one is, as a result, more thematically consistent and the titles more representative of their content. \\"The Hearth and the Salamander\\" covers Montag's career, home life, and how his confrontation with Clarisse drastically changed both, \\"The Sieve and the Sand\\" shows how reading without thinking is akin to trying to hold and in a sieve, and \\"Burning Bright\\" likens humanity to a phoenix: we burn bright and quick, but are always reborn from the ashes. Each segment also corresponds to a different stage in Montag's development, with the first being his initial disbelief and curiosity, the second being anger and frustration, and the third being pity and realization. The style is fairly uniform throughout the novel, conveying a sense of futility and hopelessness until the final pages of the book, where it is noted that after the cleansing fire of war humanity has another chance to try and do things right.Fahrenheit 451 is undoubtedly a classic and Ray Bradbury a master of the written word and science fiction. His ingenuity in crafting a dystopian future and his ever present and painfully truthful themes keep the reader enthralled, and the style forces the reader to feel the weight of censorship and ignorance. In short, Fahrenheit 451 is a book that every person should read, not only for its merits as a novel, but for its applicability in our modern age of instant gratification.-Alicia, Dante, Kevin, Lucas, Sara"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is the temperature where paper combusts and is the perfect name for this classic tale where firemen don't put out fires but they set them! Guy Montag is such a fireman. In a world where book are banned to the point of burning all of them and people are fed what to believe through government controlled videos, we find all sorts of parallels to our current lives.Montag, the main focus of the story, meets a neighbor who has him questioning all he believes and yes, he finally steals a book from one of his burning gigs. It is the turning point in his life. (Reminds me of a cop who told me he read Lord of the Rings 'cuz all the hippies he busted had a copy.) Montag then reads some poetry to his wife's friends and she promptly turns him in! His subsequent race for freedom is quite revealing.I read this book more than 40 years ago, when it was not yet a classic. I found the book a little confusing as Bradbury can be at times, but a quick read with some outstanding images that still haunt me today. My terror as a young, voracious reader at the thought of no more books ever was overwhelming. The thought that the government would kill someone innocent just so the public would know it was impossible to run was stunning. But that wall size television? Boy do I want it, only I want it in the form of a computer.I give this book thumbs up for images. While the story may move a little slow in the beginning and may be a bit confusing, the overall book reads quickly. The writing is good and the characters are well done. This may not be a book to give to teenagers, but anyone with more experience in the world will find the book fascinating, not just for the story but for the foretelling of so much from the distant 1950's when it was first written."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"There really is not need to review this book as everyone pretty much knows what its about and there are so many other reviews. The reason I don't love this book is that really its more of an idea book. I mean its a book you read and think you're a bit smarter for reading it. And on many levels that would be enough because most books have nothing to offer. Only thing is, this book isn't so much fun to read. Its more of a book that should have just been a short story."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a book written years ago, but one which still resonates today. Have you ever wondered what life would be like without books? Or with the distribution of power blown out of proportion by the few people who can control the words? This idea is one that Ray Bradbury explores in his science fiction story. Taking place in a future where books are banned, this book is written from the perspective of a fireman whose job is to burn books whenever they are reported, along with any uncooperative book owners. The fireman, Guy Montag is eventually confronted with the insanity of his society when he meets a teenage girl who vividly describes a time when people could read freely, and were unafraid of their own thoughts. When Montag then comes into contact with a professor, planning for a future where books would be allowed once again, Montag realizes and harnesses his desire to live in this future.Beatty, the fire chief, had just finished bombarding Montag with quotes from various books and poems that were unknown to the rest of the firemen. Montag's feelings are unsettled after this incident, \\"Montag's head whirled sickeningly. He felt beaten unmercifully on brow, eyes, nose, lips, chin, on shoulders, on upflailing arms. He wanted to yell, \\"No! Shut up, you're confusing things, stop it!\\" Beatty's graceful fingers thrust out to seize his wrist\\" (107). This quote demonstrates one major theme of the book - the power of words. Beatty, unlike the firemen of lower rank, has had the privilege to read many books containing knowledge -- and therefore power -- because of Beatty's ability to take the words out of context and make them support his own ideas. This theme also illustrates a tactic many leaders use to control and rule their followers - keeping the knowledge for themselves so that the followers are not think too much for themselves and possibly rebel.I connected with this book on several levels, including the plot and the deeper messages contained in the story. Bradbury's choice to use Montag -- the book burner -- as the protagonist helps the reader understand the step-by-step transformation from mindless compliance with authority to independent thought and finally to a proactive decision that his society needed change. At first, I was surprised and even a little disbelieving at the ignorance of the citizens in the town; but as the book progressed I became more captivated by the methods of the selfish and controlling leaders. In this way, Fahrenheit 451 reminds me of Animal Farm by George Orwell. In both books, the leaders have been granted surprising power by their submissive followers, a power that comes mainly from words. Both books also raise questions about how tyrannical leaders control their followers, as well as why and how followers might allow themselves to be controlled by these rulers. On a more simple level, Fahrenheit 451 is also a compelling story with strong characters and plot. In particular, Bradbury affected me with sensitive descriptions of Montag, including the relationship with his wife. This relationship was an effective method of personalizing Montage and giving dimension to his transformation from blind follower to a potential activist. Over the course of the book, we get to see just how much Montag has changed or perhaps we learn how different husband and wife always were.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed Animal Farm by George Orwell or The Book Thief by Markus Zusak because of the authors' similar abilities to blend powerful ideas, and set these themes inside strong plots."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Upon reading this book, it occurred to me just how much it gets quoted. The reasons for all the quoting is because of its continued relevance in spite of its age.The novel depicts a future filled with censorship and the \\"media\\" telling everyone what to worry about- and the worries which have absolutely no consequence. Sound familiar? A little too familiar. I dare say that we seem to be heading towards an age where ignorance is not merely bliss but that knowledge is loudly discouraged. I can only hope I'm wrong.A great dystopian and a much deserved classic."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In the world presented by Mr. Bradbury, books are illegal and all books here are from older times, people now hide and hoard them, and if someone is caught with books, their house is set on fire by firemen - the very same people that once prevented fires instead of starting them. Spare time is spent watching TV instead of reading, and the TVs are huge, taking up an entire wall. Some people try to have a TV room (TVs on all walls) for total immersion, which is what the main character's wife wants even though they cannot afford it all. Rather eye-opening and a appropriate commentary on books vs TV."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I absolutly hated this book, It not only bored me but it aggervated me to the fullest.

Nonetheless, the author, Ray Bradbury, received from President George, and Laura, Bush, the National Medal of Arts. This was on November 17, 2004, as the attack on \\"scientism\\" was getting into high gear, and the USA Patriot Act allowed the government to compel librarians to release their patrons' borrowing records.The work was originally published in the second issue of Galaxy Science Fiction magazine. In an interview on the DVD, available separately, Bradbury claims that Fahrenheit 451 was his only work of science fiction. The central character, Guy Montag, is a \\"fireman.\\" In this disturbing vision of the future, firemen burn books. Books are all but banned by the government because they have \\"conflicting ideas\\" in them. Those ideas can make people feel bad. It is the government's job to keep people happy, with drugs, television, and other entertainment. Does anyone still remember the term \\"Happy Talk News? Let's keep it positive.The novel plays on the concerns of the time when it was written. Censorship and suppression of thought, mainly through intimidation, was being exercised in the United States. The intimidation was being done by radio and newspaper columnists, who supported McCarthy, who were as rude and ruthless as, say, Bill O'Reilly, on Fox News. The book burnings by Nazis, which started in Germany in 1933 and continued until the end of World War II, were still in living memory. And the world was still reeling from the horrible pictures of the explosions of nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as implications of the mass production of nuclear weapons.When the novel was released in book form, the publisher released a censored version that eliminated the words \\"hell\\" and \\"damn\\" for sales to schools. When Bradbury found out about it, he wrote an epilogue describing the censorship and his thoughts on \\"well-meaning\\" revisionism. The epilogue was published in some later editions.And I am sure that somewhere in Kansas, or Ohio, there is a school board that will not allow the novel in the library because of \\"those words.\\"Like Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451, describes a hedonist world, where the people need not think. I'll have my Valium now. And I have cable, so there must be something to watch. Maybe a rerun of Jerry Springer."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Having read this novel a few years ago when I was younger, I was hoping now that I would have developed an appreciation for this futuristic experience in words, but I did not. I shall reference specific aspects for my review and explain why this science fiction story still does not appeal to my personal reading preferences.The overall plot includes a fireman named Guy Montag who burns books because they are considered evil now since they make people think and question. The people in this weird society do not read books or think independently. They all watch an overabundance of television on wall size sets and listen to \\"Seashell Radio\\" sets attached to their ears. Montag enlists the help of a retired English professor, Faber, to help him understand the value of books, and why they are in a world with no reminders of history.The \\"normal\\" character in the novel is Clarisse McClellan. If it is assumed that Guy Montag is the protagonist, she is the antithesis of anyone he has met before. She talks with him about the world's beauty and meaning topics which make her an outcast from this society. She makes him curious about the contents of the books he burns. Guy's wife, Mildred, is obsessed with the interactive television programs. She is a shell of a human being without substance whose \\"family\\" attachment is in a soap opera she watches constantly. She is a morbid, complex person who eventually betrays him. The antagonist in this novel seems to be society in general, but also Montag's boss, Captain Beatty. He calls books \\"treacherous weapons,\\" but he clearly uses his knowledge from reading to manipulate Montag without feelings or pity.Guy Montag is a fireman, who burns books and starts fires, rather than put them out, a far stretch of my imagination. After his encounter with Clarisse, he begins to question his empty life, his profession and society. In his intense and reckless pursuit to envision his life and direction, he often blunders and is easily swayed and manipulated by others. The violence and killings throughout the story were not to my liking and interest. The use of the Mechanical Hounds seemed silly and not necessary. In the end, when he joins the \\"Book People,\\" a final war begins, with bombs falling upon the city. This seems to me to be a great start for another novel, one that would appeal to my reading taste."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Written by Ray Bradbury, Fahrenheit 451 is about a fireman whose job is not to put out fires, but to start fires. Guy Montag was a fireman and he enjoyed setting books, and the houses where the books were hidden, on fire. He never questioned the law that said that books were illegal; he just excepted it. It was not until Montag met a young girl who told him about a time when books were legal and people enjoyed reading them that he began to wonder how the world came to be the way that it was. He wondered why people were afraid of books, and he also wondered why some people risk the chance of having their house burnt down in order to own a book. He wanted to learn why the world was the way that it was. He then met a retired professor that helped him to learn and to understand what society used to be like and what the future was going to be like. After hearing this, Montag knew what he had to do, but he was not exactly sure of how he was going to do it.One night walking home from work, Montag met a young girl, Clarisse. This chance encounter with this girl is one of the most significant moments of the book when the idea of the world being different in the past occurred to Montag for the first time. \\"They walked still farther and the girl said, \`Is it true that long ago firemen put fires out instead of going to start them?'\`No. Houses have always been fireproof, take my word for it.'\`Strange. I heard once that a long time ago houses used to burn by accident and they needed firemen to stop the flames.'\\" After this conversation, Montag begins to think. He begins to wonder if this girl who he just met is telling the truth and if he can believe her. This moment stages the rest of the entire novel, and Montag continually comes back to his conversations with Clarisse, like this one, that made him look at society and the past differently.Bradbury's unique ability to create worlds, address important universal themes, and evoke an emotional response in his readers makes him one of the best science fiction writers of our time. For Bradbury each sentence is an important building block that supports his creation without extraneous words and unnecessary frills. For example, note how completely Bradbury conveys the character's mood to the reader with his tight prose in the following quote: \\"I'm numb, he thought. When did the numbness really begin, in my face? In my body? The night I kicked the pill bottle in the dark, like kicking a buried mine.\\" (p. 77)In particular, I recommend Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 which explores the theme of censorship, a topic no less important today than it was in 1953 when the book was first published. Although the setting is ambiguous, one can easily understand that Bradbury is making a statement about the perils we face, if we let ourselves be thoughtlessly censored. If you were at all interested in understanding human nature, political propaganda, or the human thirst for knowledge, I would recommend you read Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I really enjoyed this book because of all the suspense it has to offer and just the fictitious setting in the near future. Montag, the main character in this book is a firefighter, but he is not your average firefighter. Firemen now start fires instead of putting them out; and they fuel the fires by burning books.This book has a very futuristic setting to it. People watch television on screens that are as big as the walls because books have been outlawed because the higher authorities were becoming offended by what was said in them. Therefore, soon it was impossible to write something without offending a person, which made literature dull and all the same. The world is going through very harsh times, there have already been a couple of wars since 1990.Montag is fed up with life until he runs into an open minded younger girl named Clarisse. She is different from most people at the time with a passion for nature and a love for other people. After Clarisse dies, Montag begins to turn to books for answers as to why they are being burned. Montags firechief Beatty finds out and gives Montag 24 hours to read as much as he wants. Montag will later find out that his wife betrays him because she is disgusted that he is reading and leaves him. Beatty orders Montag to burn his own house then places Montag under arrest only before Montag turns and burns Beatty alive.Montag then has to escape the law from a mechanical hound that is out to get him. In the end, Montag joins up with a group of \\"book people\\" that have memorized great literary pieces and are basically outlaws on the run. He stays with them and helps to rebuild society.When i got done reading this book i was very surprised to think that this is the way society is slowly becoming. Many more things are being censored now for fear of being chastized then in previous times. Kids nowadays are also much lazier and much less reading is being done by newer generations. This book, although fictitious, still shows what a world without books could do to a society."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"throughout the novel, you are exposed to many different thingS comparing to our world to this books words. the main character Guy is a firemen and his job in this world is to burn books that they find among the people.

There are factors that leading to the general lack of interest in reading and factors that make people actively hostile toward books.

I enjoyed reading this book because of all the fury and held in rage I have consumed over the years from reading [bad] books. I also enjoy burning misc. things. This was one of the better books I have been forced to read in school. I do not read much and when I must do book reports it makes school worse and worse but this book was not so bad. I do not usually get assigned good reading books as assignments. Reading is good for you. Stay in school. Read this book. I do suggest this book, however, to read this book even if not assigned. It will keep you wondering what will happen next. Keeping me on the edge of my seat is a good combination for a book when mixed with only 180 pages. This is a good book to read if you like to read AND if you hate reading and need a book report because of how short it is. I have given this book 4 stars for a good plot and it's worth reading. Writing 250 words is usually hard but when you write on constantly about nonsense it becomes easier. If you are being forced to read this book, do not fret, read it. It's not so bad.

The problem is that there s always some one or people with a little bit of curiosity to find out what is out there beyond their whereabouts and what is in the outside world. In this town the fireman are paid to burn books and this keeps everyone the same, happy, and not wanting/wishing to leave their perfect town and go search new surroundings.I think that this was a great book to read. It kept me on the edge and scared for what was going to happen next for the main character. Like when Montag's boss came to his house while he was reading a book and he hid the book but while he was talking to his boss, his wife was cleaning and almost found the book. I got really scared for him but I could help but think it was really strange that the firemen burned books to shelter the people. But what they don't know can't hurt them. Right?I think that Fahrenheit 451 is a book mostly for the teenage mind because littler kids wouldn't understand why the people had to be blinded from the outside world and such. This would be very interesting to read for the more mature age in high school. It would go over a lot better in their minds."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I just read &quot;Farenheit 451&quot; for the first time recently, and found many of the observations about censorship quite relevant. However, as a science fiction story, what may have been riveting in the early 1950s seems a bit tame by today's standards. Particularly interesting is Bradbury's vision of the evolution of television, which of course was still in its infancy at the time he wrote the story. The idea of a room in which the visual image surrounds you on all sides sounds a projection screen TV owner's fantasy. Bradbury's vision of a totalitarian society is as scary as anything out of &quot;1984,&quot; but ultimately Bradley was mistaken in believing that television could pacify the masses for totalitarianism. In fact, instant communications has made a totalitarian government, which relies on total control of information, less likely. The book is brief, checking in at a quickly read 160 pages.

He becomes a fugitive and this is where the action begins. He ends up being chased by mechanical dog's and hellicopters and gets in fights with flamethrowers.

Bradbury uses Fahrenheit 451 as a call for us to stop trying to get rid of things that don't cause immediate gratification and realize that emotions are an important part of who we are as humans."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book starts of kind of dull. We are introduced to a fireman named Guy Montag a fireman that sets fires not one that puts them out. His wife Milly more in love with T.V family the Montag Montag meats a young spirited girl named clarrisa who is in love with the world. The book goes on saying how books are important and you lose interst fast."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I think that this book is a very interesting book because it has some very interesting characters. For instance Mildred, I think that she is a very brainwashed characte. My favorite part in this book would have to be when Montag is outrunning society. I like it because it shows in great detail what Guy is feeling, and seeing."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have never been too enthralled into science fiction to truly appreciate its genius and creative content. But with Fahrenheit 451, I somewhat admire the genre to some degree. More than anything of course, i admire the novel, which is truly a work of genius and creativity. It took me less than 3 or 4 hours to read it because it was that good! While reading it you can't help but feel a sense of so much irony because of the haunting aspect of a society and of a world where books are burned into ashes. But it's also enlightening that yet, in that world, people like the inspiring Clarisse McClellan, Professor Faber, the \\"Book People\\", Granger and other hopeful outcasts of society, as well as our hero, Guy Montag, can still have that hope and ambition to still keep that curiosity and passion for learning, not only from books, but from life in general. Reading this book overwhelmed me with all those allussions to Shakespeare, Plato, Plato's Republic, Einstein, etc., which embodied the foundation of our conscience in the history of world literature. This book is a quick read, and also an insightful book into a world that has to some extent become our modern society. You can have many twists to looking at this novel yourself. At the end, it's so worth reading the WHOLE thing, and seeing it in different views to make you appreciate more in the power of literature."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The message of this book is that you always need books, no matter if you have internet, TV or whatever, you always will need a book, this message is written in a book of almost 200 pages, so if someone that doesn't like to read reads this book that person will never read again no matter the message, this book goes out of the story so many times that you almost forget that story, maybe the only book who needs to be burnt is this one."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"when i read Farenheit 451, my first impression was that this book is so screwed up. i mean like who would want to not read a book. thats just so wrong. the one thing i did like about the book was Guy's wife, Mildred. i liked her alot because she said that the t.v was her family. she was a little crazy though. i also liked the part where she called the firemen and told them that Guy had books. then she walked out on him. i also liked the mechanical dog. that was something very original. i gave the book 2 stars because i really thought that it was a waste of time to read it. but you know, that is only my impression of the book.Writen By:Jessica C."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I didn't really care for this book. Fahrenheit 451 is not far-fetched though. I think some of the material mentioned in this book really could happen in the future if we let it. This is a fairly good book overall, but I'm rating it a 2 out of 5 stars because I was just confused. I am a freshmen in high school and my whole Literature Pre-AP class had to read Fahrenheit 451 for an assignment. Now I know what you're probably thinking, well of course it's going to be confusing for a freshmen. But, I beg to differ. This book is written good I suppose, but the story jumps around too much and certain parts come up and it is just plain confusing (i.e. Dentham's Dentifrice). Well that is about all I have to say about this novel. I'm sure if I read it over again I would enjoy it more. But I don't think this book would be much more than 2 or 3 stars."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book talks about a fireman and his group starting fires and burning books. They were trying to get rid of the past, they did not want to leave a trace of what happened before, they believed that the characters in the books never existed.

This book takes place sometime in the future. It is a story is about a fireman, he is not a fireman that you and I think about; instead of putting fires out he starts them. He is a book burner. Because in the society that he lives in books are outlawed and are to be burnt. There were four main characters in this story. The most important was Guy Montag. He was a tall black haired man that questions society and himself. He is a fireman that burns books for a living. He makes a lot of changes throughout the book buy the end of the book he is a wanted man. The next character was Clarisse McClellan she is a young girl that is not like everyone else. She is a free thinker she helped Montag get started on his journey. Montag's boss is very important in the book. His name is Captain Beatty. He is a fat black haired man. He seems grumpy and he enjoys burning books. Towards the end of the book he is murdered. Professor Faber is an old professor that helps Motag learn about society and how it used to be. He is weak and cannot act out what he wants to , so he and Montag act as a team. Mildred Montag is Montag's wife. She is the perfect example of the rest of society. She believes that books are horrible and have nothing to offer. All she cares about is her family that was on T.V. and not much of anything else, just like the society she lived in.While reading this book I could relate to a couple of the characters. For example, Guy Montag questions his job and what he wants to do with his life. I have done this. So I quit my job and made the decision to go back to school. Another character is Clarisse she is outgoing and enjoys to be outside. I also enjoy going outside and I am always ready to try new things.I liked this book very much. It kept me interested the whole time. My favorite part is when Montag burns the other firemen and starts the chase to the river because it made me want find out if he was going to get caught. My least favorite part is when his wife called the fire alarm on him for hiding books in their house. As a result, Montag is forced to burn his own house.I would recommend this book to anyone that likes books about the future and what it holds for us. If you are young or old you will enjoy this book. It is a fast paced book with many exciting parts that will keep you reading and guessing the all the way to the end. If you have free time or need to do a book report go out and get a copy of Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"this is a good book. buy it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is about a man Guy, Montag who questions why he is a fireman that burns books instead of reading them. The firemen of our society put out fires and help people, but the firemen of their society are futurist cops who burn books. The main character in the book is Montag Guy who is works for the \\"fire department\\". Montag meets a women named Clarisse McClellan who changes his mind about what he does as a fireman. Montag runs into many problems after this, when he decides to change his mind to not burn books. Captain Beatty is Montag's boss of the fire department, who eventually finds out that Montag is hiding something. Montag's behavior creates problems for Montag that put his life at risk.Montag is my favorite character in the book because he is an exciting person that does a lot of interesting things. You don't know what Montag will do next while he is on the run from the law.I compare my self to Montag because I remember when I was told what to do all the time. Just like Montag was told what to do by his society. Montag did not know that burning books is wrong because he had grown up in world that told him to it. Now that I am 18 years of age my parents can't tell me what to do anymore. It's like I am responsible more now than ever. I can start my life and do what ever I like. Montag is trying to fight for his freedom by getting out of his society so he can start a brand new society which is just and fair.This is a great science fiction book that will keep you guessing all the way through the book. My favorite part in the book is when Montag is forced to burn down his own house while Captain Beatty is waiting for him outside. After that he is arrested by Beatty. Instead of giving up, he turns the flame thrower on Captain Beatty and burns Beatty to death. I loved this part because the hand exactly symbolize what Montag's hands are doing to Captain Beatty-like they have a mind of their own. If I could change something in the novel it would be that Bradbury had more of the young women, Clarisse McClellan, because Montag talked to her a lot in the beginning of the book. I would have liked to see if there would be more of Montag and her interacting.I would recommend this book to people who like science fiction. I would also recommend this book to anyone who likes to read. This book really does get your imagination going; I give this book two thumbs up."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Not being a avid science fiction reader, I was not as fond of this book as many of my peers were. I thought this book seemed a little to &quot;far out&quot; compared to what I am used to in a book. Although I found this book somewhat akward, I do still find it an alright book and well written, that is why this book is awarded three stars."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is an interesting book to read because it is set in an alternate reality that broke off just after Ray Bradbury wrote the book [This comment might be hard to understand if you don't know a bit about alternate realities and other alternates] The book is set in a alternate future that the government doesn't like books because every book makes someone feel bad. Firefighters in this alternate future created by Ray Bradbury start fires using books to feed the flame that they cherish. The reasons that books were turned to ashes were that people didn't like some books because they were opposing their beliefs and religions. Also books were also most likely burned because some of them gave revolutionary ideas. Fahrenheit 451 is a little hard to read because Ray Bradbury replaces some words with others. The replaced words make it hard to read quickly sort of like reading American writing with Japanese characters names inserted in instead of the American names. This book is best read by people who like reading quickly and can read Japanese fan fics for anime with the Japanese names instead of the American names. The words are not very advanced for vocab so that part of the book is really easy to read. For me this book was easy to read so I think that you should be at least 11 before you read this book because of the style of writing."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The message in the book is similar to that in \\"1984\\" and in the writings of Ayn Rand. At times the message seemed to be so \\"in your face\\" and I'm certain that Mr. Bradbury would have been more subtle had he written it 10 or 15 years later."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury is typically a novelist you read as a child or an adolescent, much like Isaac Asimov or Arthur C. Clarke. For whatever reason, I never read Bradbury as a young man (other than a tiny handful of shorter pieces), and I've only recently decided to correct that omission. I thought I would begin with FAHRENHEIT 451, which is easily Bradbury's most famous work.Needless to say, this dystopian novel is quite impressive, and not just on the literary merits. What impressed me most was Bradbury's scalding critique of modern-day society, with its ever-shortening attention spans and its addiction to a media that is both ever-present and dumbed-down.FAHRENHEIT 451 was written way back in 1953, but it holds up beautifully. Many of its lessons are directly applicable to our multimedia age. Contrary to popular perception, this is a not a novel about state censorship, as much as it is a novel about how people willingly give up the power to think and reason for themselves. The books in FAHRENHEIT 451 are burned because the people demand it -- their increasingly rigid and shallow minds (both liberal and conservative) feel threatened by the ideas the books contain.FAHRENHEIT 451 is a short novel, one that lacks the literary style of a Margaret Atwood or even an Aldous Huxley. But it conveys its message quite powerfully, and it also success very well as a work of suspense. Not only is this book thought provoking, but it's exciting to read.It's rare when a \\"classic\\" novel exceeds my expectations, but FAHRENHEIT 451 by Bradbury accomplishes that feat. Based on my success with this book, I plan to read more of his work very soon."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This was one of my favorite books in high school, and reading it again had a certain charm, but my issue with it can be summed up in a small quote from an interview included in the final pages.\\"DEL RAY: In the introduction to the recently published Bradbury: An Illustrated Life\\", a wonderful book which I have spent hours immersed in--RAY BRADBURY: Isn't that an incredible book?\\"I had the same issue with Brave New World. Even though these science fiction romps are interesting and at times exciting, the authors are so in love with themselves and their prophetic ideas, it hurts; sometimes it even cramps the writing. The ham-fisted emotions of Guy Montag are bizarre and nonsensical to say the least--the other characters suffer a similar sort of cartoonishness.I do see why it's such a great book for high schoolers though."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I purchased this book for my teenaged son to do an English class book report.

Mr. Bradbury's voice is gruff and adds to the theme of the story, but also distracts. that is the only reason I did not give it a full 5 stars."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book Fahrenheit 451 takes a look into a futuristic where all books are banned, and simple things, such as being a pedestrian can get you arrested. The book was written around the end of World War II, and was probably influenced by Nazi Germany because of their effort to censor everything. The main character is named Guy Montag, who is a firefighter. He is not a typical firefighter that we would think of though, his job is burn books. His life changes one day after having a conversation with his neighbor, Clarisse McClellan, who asks him if he is happy or not. After this conversation he ends up on a wild journey that then leads him to fight to save the one thing that he used to destroy.This book has stood the test of time and is a true classic. It has been referenced to in many other books, TV shows, and movies since its publication in 1953. Ray Bradbury does an amazing job of writing the novel, with numerous twists and turns. It had me on the edge of my seat while reading the book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Of course this book is written about the obvious theme, censorship, and many in this day smugly state how well it applies to the current administration. But by digging deeper, you also find a personal struggle within Guy Montag, who transforms from the book burner to reader. By using such an everyman character as Montag (even the name Guy suggests the usual Joe), Bradbury avoids browbeating the reader with his ideals (in spite of the image of fire), and gently helps the reader understand the beauty of the written word. This does in fact contrast with an image of big government controlling lives. It is personal, not necessarily political."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury's novel tells of the future. Not of the \\"future\\" more commonly seen in science fiction movies, but more of a society in the future. The main character of the book is Guy Montag, a fireman for the city. The firemen during this time do not have the same job as firemen today. These firemen burn books. They start fires instead of extinguishing them. In this society, books are illegal because people do not want to debate topics or feel what a character is feeling in a book. The primary form of entertainment for the society is large televisions called parlors. Some people, like Montag's wife Mildred, depend upon these TV's and the \\"relatives\\" on the programs for emotions. Montag and the other firemen's job is to ensure that everyone is \\"free\\" from feelings.Guy Montag is a very dynamic character. At the beginning of the novel he accepts his society and his job, until one very influential character, Clarisse McClellan, crosses his path one night on his walk home from work. Until her disappearance, Clarisse shows Montag everything there is to enjoy outside of what society says you should enjoy. At the end of their first walk, Clarisse asks Guy, \\"Are you happy?\\" Guy thinks and realizes that he is not. Guy is not the only person that realizes that they are unhappy. When he returns home he finds his wife to have committed suicide. He calls in an emergency and two handymen come with small machines and heal Mildred. The men say that these cases of attempted suicide are so common that the doctors don't even bother to handle these cases anymore. This shows what how miserable everyone is in this society. Another influential part of Montag's realization in the flaws of his civilization is when he burns a lady that refuses to leave her books. Montag tries to figure out why someone would sacrifice their life for a book. He decides to investigate how a book could cause someone to give up their life. He obtains a book and is able to hide from the fire chief, Captain Beatty. Montag starts to read one of the books that he has acquired, but is unable to understand it. He seeks the help of a retired English professor, Faber. Montag and Faber agree to try and save society by destroying the firemen. Montag eventually joins a group of rebels against the unhappy society, but before they have a chance to act on the city, a bomb is dropped on the city. This gives Montag and his group a chance to rebuild the once damaged society."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"it's just amazing.aside from that, i have a leather bound edition signed by ray bradbury himself, seeing as how he's my good friend's godfather.and yeah.it's one of the greatest science fiction novels ever written-truly a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Thise book is very interstive and creative.

How could you not understand it? It was written in easy-to-understand language! How could you think it sucked? It combined thoughtful themes with a racy narrative.

It mentioned about this fireman, Guy Montag, who meets a girl but then she vanishes. And in this day of age, their tv parlour, is his wife's family. I was pretty interested in the book and bought it soon after.A week after, and ive completed the short novel based on three short stories. I really liked it a lot, and there are lots of things which, even though this was written in 1953, that are similar to whats going on these days. There was one paragraph, where Montag says about America attacking countries for no reason. Now what does that remind you of? The whole book is Montag journey in discovering what books really are, how much of an inpact they have on people, and the truth.Overall, i would recommend this book. Its a very deep book, that makes you think about whats going on these days."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"1984 and Fahrenheit 451 are 2 books I've been wanting to read for a long time. The ideas behind them certainly interest me, and I've heard them hailed many times as masterpieces. I'm currently reading 1984 right now, and I can tell you right from the beginning that it's a better choice.That isn't to say, of course, that Fahrenheit 451 is a bad book. Far from it, the characters are, for the most part, well developed, and the idea behind the book is an interesting one. Ray Bradbury's idea of a censored future where war is a constant, yet supressed, issue is interesting, yet borrows heavily from 1984.My two major problems with the book, though, are the character interactions and the ending.Perhaps it's just Ray Bradbury's way of character development, but by the way the characters talk you would think they were all deeply mentally disturbed. They talk for pages and pages, constantly changing the subjects on a whim. It gives you the idea of a future where people never dwell too long on anything, but it also makes the book uninteresting. Oftentimes you can't tell the distinction between a character's ramblings in their own mind and a character's actions. I had to double-take a couple times just to make sure something really happened and the character wasn't just thinking about it.My second problem is the ending. It almost seems like Bradbury ran out of steam and couldn't think of anything else to put in the book, so he decided to nuke the city. Yes, it was a suprising ending and an interesting way to conclude the book, but it seemed like a rushed afterthought. Bradbury could have done so much with the characters after Montag left the city, but he decided to end it right there.If you're interested in this kind of book, I'd suggest it. It kept me captivated at times, even if in the end it was less than what it was made out to me. If you have to choose between 1984 and 451, go for 1984. If you can pick up both, do so."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I first read this book in my L.A. class at school. This book has many meanings tied into it. Fahrenheit 451 is different then what I usally read. This book has so many hidden detals in it. In this book I can acutally see our world now ending up like the world in this book. The author of this book was brillant to make up a world like this. The main character Montag was great I could realt to him and put myself in his shoes that's what I like so much about this book. If I didn't read this book in class I probably would never read it.Hi Ms. O!!!!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, takes place in a futuristic society where reading books, or the written word, is against the law and if you get caught all of your belongings, house and all, get burned to the ground.Even though this book is completely unrealistic to our society and has firefighters burning down homes instead of saving them, it offers an insight to what live would really be like if there was no written word and if technology ruled our lives.Guy Montag, the main character and our look into the firefighting world, is a man content with his life and never thought of the right and wrong of his job until one day when everything goes wrong and he feels that his freedom is being oppressed.This novel contains some action and it better reading for an older reading audience but will be liked for years to come."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"What if the Nazis had won WWII? Would the world change for the better, or worse? Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury deals with a society controlled to the point where firefighters and firemen are used to start fires in the middle of the night. Animals are no longer living, but programmed machines, and thinking out of the ordinary is considered blasphemous. This is the exact type of lifestyle the Nazis would have enforced. Guy Montag, a fireman, questions these ethics after a book burning at an old woman's house goes terribly wrong. This incident inspires Guy to question his type of life and the government's thinking. As society and the fire chief catch on to Guy's unorthodox behavior, Guy finds himself a target by society and the hunt for his life begins.The setting of this book is very difficult to follow. Ray Bradbury does a poor job of showing or even telling where the story takes place, and what the date is. Because of this, you find yourself wondering throughout the piece about simple things like where Guy is and the city he lives in. However, this sketchy plot gives you the sense that the city could actually be anywhere, which seems to be the goal of Ray Bradbury. When he first reveals to you that the city in which Guy lives is called City, it makes you wonder where in fact this story takes place. You do get clues about the type of lifestyle people live, like TV's in every household that are the size of whole walls, and the mechanical pets that are in each household. When reading this book I found myself picturing where I thought Guy was. So this was an effective way of writing to me. When Ray Bradbury describes Guy's wife driving on an isolated road in a forest, running over small mechanical animals at will, you know that the area must be in an area that has a temperate climate like Europe.I believe that a major fault in the book would be the main character Guy Montag. Guy pretty much has two personalities: the one where he doesn't think for himself and the one where he does. His ideas and attitudes change quickly in the beginning and then they stay the same again for the majority of the book. However, the supporting characters were developed quite well and I especially like the fire chief. As Guy's main antagonist, the fire chief played a pivotal part in the transformation of Guy.The plot on the other hand is done quite well. The first half of the book slowly sets the tone, and introduces and develops the characters. As soon as you switch over to the second half of the book, you are just blown away. The second half deals with Guy's struggles in his quest to find the truth and flee from the hell in which he lives.It is very simple to tell when the book is in each of the action stages and when the conflicts change. The books builds up so well to the climax that you can't wait to turn the page to see what happens next. The climax keeps you glued to the book and never gives you a chance to take a break.The theme and topic are very unique and are what keep you interested. I couldn't put down the book because I just wanted to see how a society so influenced by specific rules would turn out in the end. I recommend this book to readers who enjoy science fiction books and suspense novels. This is one of Ray Bradbury's best pieces and I think everyone will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If you have ever heard the saying \\"Don't judge a book by its cover\\", you'll notice how Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is a perfect example of that. Since I was assigned this book to read, I didn't get that enthusiastic with it at first, especially with that title. I thought it was going to be a book were I had to struggle to keep myself awake to read it. After reading the first 4 or 5 pages though, I was proven totally wrong. I became engulfed in this book and couldn't stop reading it. The story felt so real that I could picture it happening in our society without a doubt in my head.I enjoyed reading about how Guy Montag's character unfolded throughout the story and how he realized that just because something was the law didn't mean that it was exactly right. It is good how he followed his beliefs and didn't let anyone tell him that he was wrong. A downside to this book though is that my favorite character, Clarisse, was run over by a car. I believe that Bradbury just added that part to just take her away. I believe if Clarisse would have lived, she would have been at Montag's side and the overall story could have been so much better.Also, I believe that Bradbury could have changed the ending a little. That was the least exciting point of the book. The jets flying by overhead and the city being destroyed was very exciting, but after that, the overall excitement of the book just died off. I am not going to be stereotypical and say that all of Bradbury's books have a dull ending (because I haven't read any other one), but I will say that he should have fixed this one up a little.All in all, Bradbury has written a good book. Not perfect, but good. I think that this is a book that few should be without reading because it can actually knock some sense into them to not be fools and stand up for what they believe in. The book portrays a world that could possibly be our own in a few years. The fate of this world though, will rest upon our own hands."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book takes place in a futuristic society (around 2500 probably). It was written in 1950 and many of the predictions Bradbury made back then are happening right now. It really is scary when you think about it.Guy Montag isn't a regular fireman. His job isn't to put fires out but to burn houses with books in them. In Bradbury's futuristic society books are illegal. People who read them are called crazy and usually put in an asylum. Montag really loves his job and has fun doing it, until the day that he meets a girl named Clarisse. Clarisse isn't like other people - she likes to smell flowers, to climb trees, and to talk and think, which isn't something most other people care about. In this society, people watch their TVs, go to work, and sleep. No one talks, no one thinks...Clarisse starts Montag thinking, &quot;What do books say? Why were they banned?&quot;. I can't say much about the plot because I'd be giving away a lot of interesting things about the book but I can say, you won't be disappointed. The book is guaranteed to make you think, and keep you up all night until you finish it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a book is filled with action and suspense. If you like a book that has many twists and turns, then you'll enjoy this book by Ray Bradberry. He tried to write about what he thought would be the worst future, with no books. They would set books onfire, because to read and poses a book is unlawful. The people believed that books made people upset, think up different ideas, and unequal. The firefighters we know now would set things on fire, not put out the fire like they do now. This book is fairly easy to understand, middle schoollers should be able to understand the vocabulary."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book, Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, is a perfect example of a science fiction book. This book is about the life of a fire fighter named Guy Montag who lives in a futuristic city where books are banned. The job of fire fighters in his view of the future are to set books and the houses they are hiding in on fire. The reasoning for this is that books are said to be evil and contain many different thoughts and emotions that are considered \\"dangerous\\" if people are exposed to them. This book pretty difficult to read based on its challenging vocabulary and its confusing situations. I would recommend this book to people no younger than 7th grade based on the content of the book, and I would recommend it to people with a strong interest in science fiction and futuristic books."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Not being a passionate Science Fiction reader, I did not enjoy Bradbury's writing ideas and form. I found this book to be a very slow read, not moving very fast. Some of Bradbury's ideas did not seem to fit into the story. I found this story to be too far into the future to relate to. I found the action of burning books to be very unreal in any society. I have read some other stories from Bradbury and part of one of his other books, Dandelion Wine, and Fahrenheit 451 did not match up to some of Bradbury's other works."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Despite not being that familiar with Sci-Fi literature, I am learning to love it. In this book, Bradbury creates a powerful, disturbing imagery to ilustrate his distopia, which has bone-chilling similarities with our days. A must-read, even for those who are not Sci-Fi lovers. Why didn't I five-stared? Well, I didn't like the style so much, it could be more concise. Someone said that writing is the art of eliminating words, rather than adding them."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Great book that may be more relevant today than when the author wrote it. I cancelled my cable TV while reading the book, which has saved me money and provided more time to spend with my Kindle :)"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Let me preface this review with the statement that I was supposed to have read this book years ago, when I was still an English Major and for some reason or not I never got to it. I now understand why it is considered a must read and classic. Its a great book with such insight to our culture that I now regret greatly not reading it sooner."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I've read this book twice and it's a true classic. Of course, if you believe the world of \\"WALL-E\\", then some day we'll have all our reading done for us aloud by a computer."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I got this book to read as a part od the Nerdfighter summer book club, and I am so glad that I bought it. This book is amazing. It is incredible to think that this book was written over 50 years ago and Ray Bradbury pretty much predicted the decrease in book sales and increase in television viewers. This book is awesome and one of the best books I have ever read. It has completely changed the way that I read books and has increased my appreciation for the written word. I highly recommend this book to every single person who is able to read honestly."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I recently decided to go back and read some of the books that I was forced to read back in high school. I was not the avid reader back then that I am today (sixteen years later) so I wanted to compare what I thought of them then to now. I decided to start with Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 because it's a relatively short read and because I remembered it being one of the books that I actually enjoyed in high school.I thought I remembered the book being a warning about government power and censorship and while those are certainly addressed at some level in the book, after reading it again now I realize that this book is equally about the dangers of mindless entertainment and about allowing ourselves to forget what it's like to think for ourselves. I couldn't help but laugh as I read the interactions between Montag and his wife. While she's hopelessly lost in her shows, I kept picturing her watching \\"Teen Mom\\" and \\"The Kardashians\\".There were some exchanges that got to be a little difficult to get through while Guy argued with himself. The dialogue got choppy and hard to follow. Aside from that, the book stands up remarkably well even after six or seven decades. The last few pages of dialogue between Montag and Granger are both meaningful and beautifully written. I hope this book continues to be required reading for kids in school. It's teaches a valuable lesson....one that we need to be reminded of. Kudos to Mr. Bradbury."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Item was exactly as described and was shipped very quickly. We're very happy to add this book to our collection."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is an amazing book. I decided to read it when I found out that Mr. Bradbury had passed away.Even though it's supposed to be fiction, it seems way too familiar, since unfortunately there are so many people who prefer wasting their lives doing unimportant things rather than spending their time reading.I highly reccomend it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is as timely as it ever was. Even though it was written in the 50s, Bradbury nails modern day technological advances including MP3 players and big-screen 3-D TV. Books are outlawed - but the masses have stopped reading them anyway. Gripping and viable!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, the author creates the setting of a future in which books are illegal. In fact, if someone is found with a book in their possession, the fire department will burn their \\"fireproof\\" house down. The story is told from a man named Guy Montag's perspective. Montag works for the fire department, meaning he burns books for a living. In his world, people are expected to deal with their problems by watching television or driving 100 mph while hitting everything that gets in their way or putting \\"shells\\" in their ears to drown out their thoughts; people are not expected to think in his world.However, Montag begins to question the world he lives in after he meets a rather peculiar young girl named Clarisse. She is different than the rest of the people around her: she spends most of her time just sitting on the porch and thinking about the world around her. This book by Bradbury is very well-written and is a quick read. It is especially great if you are someone who enjoys books that make you think, like fitting all the pieces together at the end.Bradbury does an excellent job of predicting the future, being that the book was written in the 1950's. Obviously the future has not gone to extremes like in Bradbury's book, but he does accurately predict that people will put \\"shells\\" in their ears to drown out the world (like iPods), the numerous TV's in every household, and taking sleeping pills every night because life is easier that way. It is a little bit hard to understand what is happening at times, just because Bradbury leaves it up to the readers to interpret what is happening. Overall, Fahrenheit 451 is an excellent book, and I would recommend it for higher-level readers."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"esta novela de corte futurista, nos muestra un futuro dominado por la cultura de la mass media controlada por un gobierno central que prohibe e inhibe lo mejor de cada ser humano, el derecho de discernir, de pensar, de estar en desacuerdo, de estar tristes al compas de una novela, a quedarnos boquiabiertos con un tratado de filosofia.en la sociedad que describe Bradbury, los bomberos se dedican a apagar la sed de curiosidad de los seres inquisitivos, se dedican a quemar libros para que la gente no pueda tener acceso a la informacion y que jamas salgan de su pobreza mental y de su atraso, pues quien controla la informacion, controla al pueblo. es una obra excelente de lo que tal vez podria ser en un futuro no muy distante.LUIS MENDEZ luismendez@codetel.net.do"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Art imitating life? One need only contemplate the depths of political correctness to see the coming new order. Utopian societies are hellish and brutally banal at the same time. Like Jerry Furland's terrifying novel &quot;Transfer - the end of the beginning&quot;, Bradbury's &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; delivers a message and a vision of the future that is bleakly horrifying. You will devour both of these fine novels in a sitting. Guaranteed."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I thought that story of farhrenheit 451 was a very good book but yet it was very confusing in some parts. The plot behind the book is very simple to me but the hole basic story is kinda wierd, maybe because its written in such a theretical that sometimes I just get lost. Anyway the story is about a fireman named Guy Montag who burns books in the future. throuhout the story he is incounterd with a little girl who challenges him to free himself and to feel his emotions and to do what he feels is right but he is also incounterd by his commanding officer that believes burning books and killing the people who have them is the right thing to do in the society that they live in today. Although Montag follows the wishes of his commanding officer he decides to do away with being a fireman and to do what is right and educate his society on books but his wife Mildred turns Montag in because she is scared of what the fireman will do to her if she is caught with the books in her house. After Montags house is burnt to the ground he decides to run and hide from the police until he meets up with the book people. When he meets up with the book people he tells them that he used to be a fireman and that he has changed and now the police and the fireman are after him. At the end the city gets bombed and Guy meets back up with Mildred and him and the book people decide to build and miror factory so the can look at themselfs to see who they realy are inside."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Well i thought that the book was very interesting. Some parts were a little confusing that's all. I really liked when Mildred would talk to the television as her own family. I wish that Clarisse and Montag would of gotten together."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I think Fahrenheit 451 is a great book to read. In this book it talks of a futuristic society. In this society people are not allowed to read or own books. The novel tells us that books kept getting smaller and smaller until there were no books and nobody read. Even in today's society we can see this happening. Novels replaced by Cliff notes, cliff notes replaced by summaries only a paragraph long, and even these summaries are being replaced by movies, which you don't even have to read. Tolerance of books is diminishing in our society. People no longer wish to read books we sit in front of the TV and even our interactions with other people is hindered by this. I think this book is an excellent book to read. It changes how you see things. The book is written in a way that you can understand the confusion and anger the main character (Montag) is feeling. I read this book for my 6th period English class at East High School."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I think Fahrenheit 451 is a great book to read.

I liked this book because it was full of suspense and al ways keep me thinking about what would happen next.It also illustrated what the world could be like in the future if we were not allowed to think for ourselves and learn by reading books. In this world it was as if there was so much technology that people didn't have to think for themselves. I enjoyed reading this book very much."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book that we read in class was really good. It was really interesting how the book was written. Having it placed in the future was really cool and it was a different than other books that I have read. Ray Bradbury seemed to have a really creative imagination. I really liked the plot and the setting of the book. It (like I stated before) was different. I liked the way the author used the different characters to support the one main charater, Montag in his troubles in his own life. I would be interseted in reading more books by him in the future."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I really enjoyed Fahrenheit 451, it was a very entertaining book. I hope many of these concepts never come true though. Occurances such as burning books, no speed limit would cause the world to be very crazy. There was never dull point in this book. I found these concepts very thought prevoking and interesting. This book explains what it would be like living in this type of surreal world.The idea of having no pedistrians allowed would would also be very strange. All in all, it was a great book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I thought this novel was great. Bradbury's descriptions of the characters of his novel helped the reader to understand what they had to do with this novel. This story is great for anyone who likes fictional storys. In this book which is based on the future describes life as being happy 24 hours a day. The world it takes place in is a place where fireman start fires they don't put them out. Also speeding in legal but having or reading a book is illegal and the price you pay for having one is that the fireman burn your house down and you just might be injected with a four inch needle by thier mechanical hound. If you like suspence and wierd but good ending to a novel i would suggest you read this novel."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A truly excellent book that spans the generations since it's 1953 debut. This book is along the same lines as Brave New World and 1984 in the sense that it creates a futuristic society (not unlike our own in many ways) in which control has shifted toward an entity other than the will of the people. A certain amount of propaganda and coersion, mainly propogated through television, has transformed the populace into a sick and backwards culture without substance. All the wonderful knowledge found in literature has been abandoned, and burned, while the people have become so unaware that they don't even know that the ashes they are choking on are the ashes of books that used to live on their shelves. Essentially, the ashes of value, and morality. One of the things I liked best about the book was that it highlights the control people have over their life in reguards to books. You always have the power of choice, whether it be in the subject matter of what you read, or the choice of chosing not to read at all. You can put down a book whenever you wish, but in contrast, the television has control over what you see, and what your exposed to. So, kill your TV, and read this book. It is a great story reminiscent of some of our past, and possibly of things to come. It is also very well written."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is the number one banned book in the world. I, personally, thought it was great!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"After scanning all recommendations, I finally decided to buy Fahrenheit 451 because it appears on every list. I had pleasure in reading it, but was a little disappointed.Then again, maybe it's because the book is overrated that it failed to fulfill my expectations. Fahrenheit 451 presents vivid ideas (in vivid words too) but it is, I believe, NOT intellectually challenging nor thought-provoking enough for people seeking for heavy reading."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The irony of this book always slayed me. Here is a book of a future where books are like drugs: outlawed, sold on the black market, and if there's a &quot;library,&quot; firemen destroy it. And the added bonus is that the main character, a loyal fireman, has a library! The irony that gets me is that this book is about banning books, yet it is a banned book, so nobody read it! (Ha ha, just kidding folks!)"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"When i first found this book in my eighth grade social studies classroom, the catchy title and the mysterious message lulled me. Beforehand i had never read Bradbury, or had been interested in him at all. The book changed everything for me. This insane landscape of mindlessness and of throwing away free thought enchanted me mentally and i was hooked. Mr. Bradbury is one of the greatest liberal thinkers in the world. Reading 451 can break the silly chains of political bias, and start you thinking for a change about how much freedom you need and how much you should use it. The ignorance and greed in us today echoes the insane eletric city of the firemen, and we mustnt shut our minds off to the world of literature and creativity if we ever wish to truly think about life."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book Fahrenheit 451 is a great book to read. It is about a futuristic world that we all fear. This is a where freedom of speech and thought are completely taken away. Guy Montag is a fireman but instead of putting fires out they set things on fire. The things that they set on fire are books and and the houses that hold the books. Later in the story they talk about Guy Montag meeting this girl named Clarisse. They engage in deep conversation and he soon learn to like the small things in life. After he met her he realizes how dull and boring his family really is. In the end of the story he escapes from the city after killing the fire-cheif and taking a couple of books with him. Guy Montag has the ability to like his job without knowing what he is actually doing to the society. He went to work and liked to watch the book get consumed by the flames. I would recommend this book to other readers. I think the book was interesting and very challenging. The book was fun to read and that is why I would recommend this book to other readers."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Did you notice that nowadays writers and filmmakers tend to make no difference between Horror and Science-Fiction? ... Real Science-Fiction plays not only in the future but in a society very different from ours and with people who have habits and a mentality which also are different from ours. Fahrenheit 451 is a very good example of that. Fahrenheit 451 is the temperature that makes books burn and this is the problem we are dealing with (and no longer in the far future I'm afraid). Guy Montag is the hero of the novel. He's a fireman who burns books that are in people's houses, usually because someone denounced them at the police. It's forbidden to read books because they make you think and therefore make you unhappy. (Clothes have only zippers and no buttons; buttons take to much time so you start thinking and once again this makes you unhappy.) But Montag is a lonely person who has no contact with his wife; she only watches TV from dawn till dusk. The irony is that all the measures, which are taken by the government to protect people from being unhappy only, make them more unhappy than before. As the story unfolds, Guy Montag starts wondering what books are all about and he starts meeting people who read books (without notifying his superiors). The novel ends in a peculiar way.I said in the beginning that the problem is maybe no longer in the far future: a psychologist I know once said that all books ought to have a happy ending. I never asked her what would become of the books that don't have a happy ending because I'm afraid what she might answer."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"he stopped worshipping fire and treated it like the enemy it was when it came to books, except when it came it beatty, whom he turned into a marshmallow. then he met the others who were doing their best to keep the words alive to pass along to the next generation... don't be put off by the fact that it's sci-fi. i love reading stuff that no one thinks i would read. it's not &quot; war and peace &quot; ( 165 pages ) you can read it in a day. and the message will stay with you for life...don't make any more excuses...."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury's classic &quot;Farenheit 451&quot; seems to become more true all the time (although it was not intended as a prediction) for example, one of the characters mentions students shooting eachother as if it was an everyday occurence.Beyond that, the plot of &quot;Farenheit 451&quot; is intriguing, poignant, and fun to read.Anyone who has not yet read this classic should pick it up."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In this book, the author shows what can happen when books are taken away, it is based in a time when origial thought is frowned upon and even at times dispised. It shows what could very easily happen whith the way extra reading is frowned upon and those who do it are considerd &quot;nerds&quot;.

Even though I was much younger than I am now when I finished it (I'm 20), I was still able to realize that the future Ray Bradbury portrays in this wonderful work of fiction is entirely possible. I absolutely love to read, a bibliophile if you will, and when I first realized that the world in this book takes pride in BURNING them AND the people who read them I remember thinking, \\"God help us\\". What made me say that is the realization that many of my fellow class mates all throughout school (K-12) did NOT like to read one bit but they did like to burn and destroy things. Society, in the story, values everything that destroys knowledge and wisdom so that those in charge are able to stay in power and keep everyone under there thumb. Turning people into mindless sheep. Many of the technological \\"advances\\" (I consider them more of a step back then a step forward) include only a few hours of school with nothing actually learned, destruction parks where people can go smash and destroy everything there, insanely fast cars, and (in my opinion the worst one) the ENTIRE room dedicated to television. This book is an extremely accurate portrayal of where American society is headed if we do not do something to stop this trend. We must value knowledge and wisdom above all else because those two things are what primarily separate us from all other animals.

And if you're reading this, don't say, &quot;What censorship?&quot; because you know what I'm talking about, banning books from schools, not allowiing certain things to be spoken on television, and now maybe even the internet at the rate of how things are going! Sometimes, you need to say things to get your point across, whether that's a weakness or a strength of yours. For me, it's a weakness, and I'm sorry for that, but I don't need censorship to ruin it. I loved this book, not nearly as much as I loved 1984, but it has proved itself worthy just the same."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The novel is a mind worker"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I am impressed, stunned, and fearful. The implications of this book are staggering. A society where pleasure and mindless entertainment are preferable to thinking and knowledge.... a country where the government entertains itself with wars... a world in which the children kill each other every day and take pleasure in destruction... does this sound familiar? This book is a shocking reminder of the road our civilization is currently going down. Will the next generation go to school to learn more about sports and television? Will all books ever be outlawed because ideas frighten people? This book makes you wake up and take a look around... I personally don't like what I see."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I had to read this book for my H.S. freshmen english class and enjoyed it more than I thought I would. Bradbury uses a lot of good symbolism in connection with the theme of the novel. I realized that understanding these symbols and reading more into the novel is a necessity for a full understanding of the text and Bradbury's message. On the first quiz my teacher gave me, I got a 70%, but after reading more deeply into the novel (and taking some marginal notes to study from), I received a 100% on the next quiz. Unfortunately, when you look at our society today with all the ignorance, technological advancements, and anti-intellectual behavior practiced by many, you realize that it may end up a dystopia just like the F-451 society in the near future."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is an amazing novel, from start to finish. I could hardly put it dwon, and the message alone that it sent across is frightening in it's implications. This book told us how much we should value life and learning.

We must forgive them, they are in their teens and were forced to read it for school. Its only natural, in these circunstances, not identify with Montag and his passion for literature.Fahrenheit 451 is not difficult or boring. But it isnt a normal SF book (not that I have anything against the genre). Bradbury's books tend to have more to do with Lewis Carrol than Issac Asimov. To me it is really a tale that deals with the significance of books in life and society. But like the every great book, its real meaning will be different depending on the reader or the moment it was read.Its a book to stir you. The first time I read it, I got interested in philosophy and thought deeply about my own existence.For those who read it and didnt like it... try again next year!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I picked up an old paperback copy of this book at a flea market 8 years ago. I couldn't put it down. It's a quick and enjoyable read. Bradbury doesn't hit you with the message until he's ready. He prepares you for it with the main body of the story, and, in the last few pages he provides a biblical quote, from revelations, regarding what books are really for. The quote describes the tree of life and says &quot;And the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.&quot; Quite a slam dunk ending that you won't get unless you're ready for it. True literature, he is saying, is to serve a higher consciousness and heal our world. And the tree of life is books, and the leaves on the tree are the pages in those books. This book changed the way I saw and understood things. It's amazing how one book can awaken your vision, and, in turn, awaken your understanding."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is one of the greatest books ever written. Bradbury is a master of the written word. He is the &quot;Air Jordan&quot; of the adjective. Fahrenheit 451 is a stab at political correctness. The premise of the novel is that if we try to dispose of &quot;incorrect&quot; thoughts, we may be forced to eradicate ALL thought."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I was amazed at the incredible imagery and poetic use of extremely choice adjectives and adverbs. The main impression I have is how immediate every single sentence felt; each felt totally alive and pulsating with life. To some, this style may seem to err on the side of melodrama, but he can easily be forgiven. I tend to forgive a bit of self-indulgence when dealing with such a fine writer. Those who call it boring and predictable, without knowing how to savor imagery and elaboration, are contributing to the very cause Bradbury is pointing at - a society craving instant gratification and lacking the capacity for self-reflection. It's a fantastic read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Reading all these reviews it seems as though many people, and I dont mean to offend anyone, have become too preoccupied with the need for every book that is part of the sci-fi genre to adhere to some sort of science base and to have a plot that could conceivably happen. Literature and sci-fi in particular should be the exploration of ideas, encouraging some form of though amongst its readers. The situation create in the novel is perhaps not plausible, but it is merely an exagerrated form of our world today and what it may become more like. To think it ever could become so bare is indeed unlikely, but the need to be aware of the trend is there, hence the book is there.The plot too may be lacking, and I sometimes found the writers prose clunky and disjointed. This can be explained by the short period of time in which the book was written and the fact that in general it is written as such to convey the turmoil the central charcter is feeling when his entire world suddenly seems to lack any meaning or purpose.I would recommend this bok to anyone who can be bothered to think about a book as they read it. It is not the easily accesible thrillers that fill the bestseller lists, John Grisham et al, but it is abook that is both chilling in its prediction and thought provoking.The only criticism would be that the story may have worked better as a short-story and Ray Bradbury's proseis better suited to the shorter form.ps Anyone who found the book boring and the setting devoid of life and colour. Could that not have been deliberate. What if the world was really like that.

There's just something about Mr. Bradbury's writing style that makes his books hard to read. It's the language that confuses me. This book could have been good if the language had more clarity.

The technology used in the the book is amazing, considering that Bradbury wrote it in 1953. Yet I wonder why he didn't use computers in the story. . . If anyone has any ideas, please e-mail me. Anyway, at first I hated the fact that nothing had a definite conclusion. Also, you never know if the &quot;book people's&quot; goal was successful. What happens? Even before the book begins, there are several questions that remain unanswered.

I find truly disturbing the sheer number of young people who have sent in reviews describing the book as &quot;boring, unfulfilling, poorly written, confusing&quot;, etc. Of all the &quot;dystopian&quot; books in the lexicon, I find this work to be the most straightforward and unambiguous(sp?). Judging from some of the vitriolic reaction above, it seems Bradbury's predictions are well on their way to coming true. The fact that so many find the book &quot;confusing&quot;, points out the failure of an American education system that emphasizes self-esteem over actual achievement, learning by rote as opposed to the actual accumulation of knowledge, and crowd control over teacher-student interaction. The book is challenging, but hardly the murky horror described by so many above. To close with a Bradbury quote &quot;If my jawbreaker sentences shatter the teeth of the weak minded(small liberty with text), let them eat stale cake dunked in weak tea of their own ungodly manufacture&quot;.

But now after having read it I see the importance of it. It forces the reader to look at the effect that technology has on our lives and what direction this increasing technolgy could lead us. The plot is interesting and mind opening. The story would have had a stronger impact had Bradbury left the main character, Guy Montag, mentally stable at the end of the novel. I felt,as the reader, that his craziness led to a unreliablity in his character and his actions. This unreliablity in his character left the novel with a weak ending, instead of a strong one."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"According to the beliefs of some citizens who have posted their comments on this site, Fahrenheit 451 is about books. It seems like it is, but in its true form, the story about something deeper than books.The story is brilliant because it perfectly describes how willing people are to give up knowledge for something that is faster, easier. It also brings up the topic of control through the media. The government and media focus on happy, cheerful things (such as chasing Montag), rather than the war about to begin. This makes an excellent point about how we as a species are too willing to turn a blind eye to our problems, and allow someone else to fix them. This book does a fine job at shining new light on the saying &quot;Ignorance is bliss.&quot;This is a masterpiece of our time, and I suggest getting it from your public library, if you decide not to buy it. Either way, read it. Its got some insight that is very thought provoking~"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Wouldn't life be nice if we didn't have books? As a person who doesn't enjoy reading, this particular book caught my interest. Guy Montag, the main character of the story, is a book burner. In the society he lives in, the knowledge and ideas one gets from books is believed to be bad. As a fireman, Montag has the job of starting the fires rather than stopping them. This book forces you to think about what society would be like without books. Think of all the knowledge, ideas and pleasure they bring.Fahrenheit 451 makes you realize how much books really do contribute to everyday life. I would recommend this book to all who enjoy a good story and especially to those who don't appreciate reading. Maybe life with books isn't so bad after all."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, is set in a terrifying world of the future. Books are not allowed. Firemen burn them and the homes of those who own them. The main character, Guy Montag, is one of these firemen. The joy of his life is setting books on fire until his loony 17-year-old neighbor suggests that maybe books are good things. She tells him of a time in the past when people read and were not punished for it. This gives Guy an unstoppable urge to see what's in one of those books. He reads one, and now he can't stop.While this was a great book with a very scary plot, I do have one complaint: Bradbury will often list completely random things for no apparent reason. They make no sense and make me wonder why they were included in the book. Other than that, the writing is wonderful. Bradbury's descriptions create vivid, sometimes spooky images of his characters and places such as the terrifying electronic hound. There's lots of great action and strange developments.Fahrenheit 451 is a wonderful work that I would recommend to just about anyone. It would be a great way to pass an afternoon. It's a very quick read that you could finish within a few hours. The writing, while confusing at times, is still very interesting. You are quickly brought into the story. Once again, this is a great book for all ages and an interesting view of the future from the past.-Fitzgerald FlabbermonkeyP.S. I'm actually over 12"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"At first I was roped into the idea of a book about book burning by fellow classmates that said it was a \\"cool\\" thing to read about. Then, later on I became enamored by this compelling story of the way others can affect the minds of the ignorant.The book begins with a section Bradbury entitles, \\"The Hearth and the Salamander.\\" The hearth being a symbol of the home and where the fire is kept/made in the home, the salamander being a symbol of fire immortality. The animal is believed by ancient cultures to be fire resistant. It can be burned and walk out without a mark made. This makes sense for Bradbury to use considering his whole book is shaped on the idea that the new futuristic firemen are unscarred by flames and find a great pleasure in creating them. So in turn the firemen of the story sport salamander logos on the arm of their uniforms. I loved this sort of symbolizing and the way Bradbury ties these facts into the rest of his story makes it a worthwhile reading. Throughout the rest of the book he takes the main character Guy Montag through a whirlwind of emotion and self exploration. After meeting a young girl by the name of Clarisse McClellan who is a self proclaimed individual Guy begins to view his life as he knows it in a different light. Clarisse is even seeing a psychologist for her \\"tendencies\\" as prescribed by society's fear of her lack of uniformity. She is a strong willed character that can open the eyes of any reader. I fell in love with her for her uniqueness as she reminded me somewhat of myself.The new future is a scary place as described by Bradbury. It makes the present and our issues with race and diversity a walk in the park as compared to society in the future. Close-mindedness sets in and people begin to close down and build walls around the passions of simple life. He shows here a real look into a frightening possibility of the way technology could affect every one of us. The idea of burning-books to me symbolizes the way media latched onto the artist and freethinker in all of us. It takes away from the beauty of really capturing a scene in a book that in some cases someone might never see in real life and it injects the fear that you might be blamed for this \\"instant gratification\\" that the book gives to you.I really loved the book and the way it took Montag on a journey to overpower his dedication to the claws of society and see past it's chains. He overcomes his enslavement to his boss and coworkers and begins to follow the path of the McClellans. With a little extra help from a friend he met beforehand Guy attacks the futuristic views and creates a full on war for freedom. Through fighting, and murders Montag ends his journies with the people he belongs with. He stumbles a bit along the way but ultimately ends with happiness in his heart.Anyone looking for a real eye-opener would enjoy this awesome fiction piece. It'll make you feel really lucky for the freedoms you have today, and look at the book you're holding in your hand in a whole new light. Aspects of family, and how cold family can be will shock you. Pick up Fahrenheit 451 you won\`t be disappointed."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Farenheit 451 is the epidomy of Ray Bradbury books. This sci-fi book is a great description of a futuristic society. Guy Montag is your average guy, with an common job, he's a fireman. Though, in his society, books are banned and the fireman's job is to burn them. He lived a normal life, or so it was called, until a young lady opened his eyes to the past. In a desperate attempt to know more, he finds a professor. He finds then who he truly is and follows his destiny.Ray Bradbury is one of the best sci-fi authors, in my opinion. In this book he created a futuristic society down to its individual laws and customs. His descriptions of the flames are as if they are alive like you and I. In my own mind I could see the flames burning as if they were right in front of me. His descriptions of society are a great way to show how nave humans can be.Though I had some trouble understanding this book, it's plot was very drawn out and not always clear. Overall, I enjoyed this book over &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot;, because at least this one had a single plot line and easily understandable themes. It is a must-read book for those of you who like sci-fi books that can change course in the blink of an eye."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury is an amazing story about a man named Guy Montag, living in a dystopia. In this crazy world, books are not allowed, and instead of having firemen stop fires, they make them. Guy is a fireman who loves to burn books. But one day he meets a young 17 year old who seems insane. But after many long conversations, he realizes the horror of burning someone else's work of art, and his/her ideas. He then sets out on a mission to get the books back to the people. But all the while, Bradbury is able to weave amazing, but confusing, passages into his story. His crazy use of metaphors and his symbolism makes it hard to understand, but after reading it again, it creates images in your mind. This is the kind of book that you discuss with your friends. The complex theme and plot makes it a great read. Although this book may not be suitable for young children, this is a great story for people from 8th grade up. Fahrenheit 451 is an unique book, and is defiantly one of Ray Bradbury's finest works."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is a meaningful tale ofthe consequences of removing opinion, choice, andconflict from our world.

However, I was confused bythe loaded metaphors and symbolism. Some createdvivid pictures, but others did not make any sense.

Ray Bradbury's use of similes and metaphors really related to what he was trying to explain. The fascinating circumstances about Farenheit 451 is very weird and exciting at the same time. The fact that Bradbury has taken the present time, when he wrote the book, and changed the roles of the people and firemen to which he believes the future will be like is so engaging. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I would have most likely never read Fahrenhiet 451 on my own accord. But I am glad that we had to read this book. Ray Bradbury's idea of the future is totally different than people in the 1950s would have likely imagined it to be. Even now the book holds the same sort of problem to us as it did back when it was published. I can see our country heading down the same path as the country in the book did.Bradbury's use of metaphors, similes, and other &quot;smilely face tricks&quot; are very well written. For example, instead of using the word &quot;hose&quot;, Bradbury described the hose as a great black python. I liked this book very much.~*sHoUtZ tO mIsS. o AnD tHe ReSt Of ThE cLaSs Of 2004*~"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Through all of the metaphors, complications, and similies, Fahrenheit 451 is an excellent book to read. Ray Bradbury made this book very interesting especially with his similies and metaphors. In order to get anything out of this book the reader really had to read closely to enderstand what Bradbury was trying to communicate to the reader. Also, the reader had to use their common sence to understand the story, because it is very different from our world today. The scary part of the story, was how it was written fifty years ago, but the reader can see how the society of today is becoming more and more like the book.Amagine a world were reading certain books ment that you were breaking the law, with possible punishment of death. This was the world Guy Montag lives in. He was a fireman that started fires. In the story's day and age this was a common job. Houses that contained books were houses that needed to be burnt down. Montage enjoyed his job because he did what he was told, and never had to think outside of the box. However, his thinking began when he met a girl, named Clarisse, who made him think outside of the box with three words. She asked Montag,&quot;Are you happy?&quot; To learn more about what happens to Montag because of those three words, you will have to read the book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book should be on everyones bookshelves and should be required reading for every middle school student. Instead we force rot our children's brains with Harry Potter nonsense along with other books of fluff and non substance. Farenheit 451 might be science fiction but I believe it to also be an insight into things to come.It is hard for me to imagine that someone with a phd supposedly would give this book a 1 for review, but at least even that sheds a bit of hope on our civilization. At least for the time being we can all still have our differences. I do question though if it was actually read instead of some form of protest over a required reading.This is a well thought out short book (approximately 180 pages), no sex scenes, a few curse words (the typical) and even the violent scenes do not dwell on the blood and gut portions of death, therefore making this an acceptable book for any level of reading. I my opinion this should probably be the first science fiction book anyone picks up to read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"When my youngest son read Bradbury's classic Fahrenheit 451 for his honors English class, he was amazed that I had never read it - so much so that he went out and purchased a copy for me. It's easy to see why this book has become standard reading in High Schools and Universities. Bradbury is obviously an accomplished writer, and he focuses on the timeless topics of freedom of information, government control and war. Written nearly 55 years ago, he could have never realized how close to the mark he was going to hit regarding the central role virtual relationships would play in our world today. A quick and worthy read that you need to squeeze into your schedule."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I can't believe that some people could read this book and not understand why it is important. This book is a classic for a reason. Underneath the dystopian surface are truths- and frightening resemblances to our own society. When I read this for the first time, I was shocked and pleased to hear that there is someone else who thinks like me. Thank you, Mr. Bradbury, for turning a critical eye on your future, peices of our present (the books is frighteningly prophetic) and writing your anthem for all of us who choose to think and not just follow."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In Fahrenheit 451, Ray Bradbury wrote an absolute classic on the subject of human freedom and censorship. The outstanding characteristic of this little book (I was done in 2 days) is that it does not rely on an opposive state (as does 1984), but rather on a society that chooses to distance itself from books.The basic irony in the story is that, after houses were made fireproof sometime in the future, there was no more job for the firemen. As society sought to occupy such spare capacity, it chose to eliminate books, as they constituted a hazard. To me, the most outstading part of the book is Bradbury's description of how man turned away from knowledge, starting with minorities feeling oppressed by those who \\"knew more\\". In order to achieve happiness, society had to eliminate the feeling of inferiority some people had, and such inferiority was largely linked to books.The most interesting point, however, is that this book was not rendered false by time; the future depicted is quite similar to one we see today in the world and in the U.S. We have people who are not knowledgeable about an ongoing war, despite being aware of it; there are people outside the country who hate us, but we don't really know why (remind you of anything?); there is a growing sense that we are not free to express our views in fear of offending someone; and lastly, TV and instant gratification is suplanting the need to know and deeply understand the world and who we are.In the book, it took a young girl and an old professor to awaken our hero, Guy Montag. Though we are not yet burning books, it seems like the general direction was correct. I highly recommend this book; to me, the best test is the fact that, after reading it, I really wished I had written it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I'm not going to waste a lot of time describing _Fahrenheit 451_. There's over 1,000 reviews on Amazon alone. I'm sure most people know that it tells of a dystopian future in which books have been banned, and how firemen are employed to start fires instead of fighting them. Even some of those who have not read the book have at least that superficial idea.What makes _Fahrenheit 451_ so nightmarish is how this society came to be. This was not the result of a totalitarian dictator or government, it was the will of the people. Somewhere along the way, people tired of being challenged, both intellectually and morally, by books. Bland, inoffensive, and mind-numbing forms of recreation dominated the cultural landscape. Commentators on the ailments of the human condition became enemies of the state, while the true disease itself went unchecked. There are quite a few out there who think something like this can't happen in these \\"enlightened\\" times.It's already happening. The cirriculum throughout the American school system is being dumbed down far below the capabilities of the average student. Public libraries are being underfunded, and in many cases, closed down completely. Authors and intellectuals are given far less reverence than celebrities who hold on to their fame through idiotic publicity stunts rather than through talent and hard work.So, I might not have told you anything you don't know already. I won't be offended if you choose to brush off everything I mentioned previous to the point I'm about to make. Read _Fahrenheit 451_. Take a good look at the cultural and intellectual climate of society today. Ask yourself if this is what you want our future to be.Me neither."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Amazon.com recommended Fahrenheit 451 to my list a long time ago and I just now got around to reading it, somewhat skeptical at first because the description on the back of the book seemed, at best, cheesy. The publisher might want to rethink the blurb. But, I read it anyway, and am thoroughly impressed not only with the style of writing, but also with the complexity of the situation presented. In a novel where books are banned because they cause too much 'free thinking' and 'confusion' for those who fail to understand them or don't want to read them, there are a lot of fairly frightening similarities to the way society is progressing today. Granted, I don't believe we will ever burn all the books of the world, but it is a cruel reminder how many people are ignorant to the importance of books, whether fiction or non-fiction. It also reminded me how much I enjoy cracking open a new book with its characteristic smell and feel, and how much I, as a reader, would miss that privilege."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is very hmm how can I say this? Well, there are acutally no words at all to describe the great masterpiece that Mr.Bradubry conjured up over 50 years ago.

The kids of today are ALREADY turning into the Mildreds and Firemen of tommorow! They are putting this book down because THEY are the firemen and Mildreds of today.....This book shows a prfound truth in today's culture and generation, our generation. Mr.Bradbury has showed us a future, no not a future, but of a PRESENT to us that if we stand around idly this future will occur. Remember Faber'sline......&quot;I saw the way things were going, a long time back. I said nothing. I'm one of the innocents who could have spoken up and out when no one would listen to the 'guilty,' but i did not speak and thus became guilty myself.&quot; I believe this is one of the most moving and truthful and insightful lines in this book, for it shows what will happen in our tommorow.This is a plea for help, if anyone is reading this, do all you can to proclaim this book to the masses. If we do not spread this around, we will crumble. All of the freethinkers and people that think &quot;Outside the box&quot; will be crushed by the fiery hand and ax of tommorow's society. We are a dying race, the rebels, the freethinkers, all of us. Do not give in. If they burn our houses, burn with them. Do not cave in to pop-culture's ideals and guildlines we must follow. Is America truly &quot;A land of the Free?&quot; I think not. We are slowly simmering in this melting pot and we will slowly begin to melt away....For example, the other day at lunch, my friend and i were talking, and i asked him,&quot;Josh, if a new machine was invented would you ask, 'How it works?' or, 'What's its purpose'. He replied 'How?'. I asked him a myriad of questions like this and i realized what our world is coming to. Yes, like Josh, all of the smart ones of the world are becoming mechanical, ruled under the constraints of society, sub-conciously. All of our intellects are starting to perish. Our smarts will be used for inventing Seashell radio's and TV walls and the Robot Dogs of the future. No more will we be appreciated for our philosophies, thoughts, our ideas, insights; No, but we will be appreciated for how happy we can make the masses and how happy we are will be our number one priority. Please, if you have children, please please do not let them be swayed by commercial jingles or catch phrases or tunes. I am a kid, only one kid, but if this message gets accross to another, i will have succeeded in spreading this message of a scary new world. I believe this new world is an apocalypse to freethinkers, and we must unite before anything happens, we must not sit idly, as Faber's costly mistaken took its toll. Mr.Bradbury's best book ever, a must read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It's hard to describe what a powerful charge this slender little book carries. You read it and wonder how Bradbury was able to make a prediction so spot-on accurate way back in the 1950s when he wrote this. There are scenes and lines that are etched in my mind permanently: the Mechanical Hound and its procaine snout; Mildred crying when Montag reads &quot;Dover Beach&quot; to her but not understanding why; Beatty's chilly monologues on sedating the masses by stuffing them with useless facts; 17-year-old Clarisse tasting the rain on her tongue. I once read a book on meditation that described ideas as having sound, structure and weight. The ideas in Farenheit 451 seem to have those properties, so vividly does Bradbury present them."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I'll admit it, in the interest of full disclosure: I don't like Ray Bradbury. Not so much his work, but him. His quasi-luddite persona that distrusts ATMs but dreams of flying cars, his palpable (and occasionally justified) pretentiousness that allowed him to transcend pulp sci-fi in the 50s while still pandering to that crowd. That out of the way...Fahrenheit 451 is an excellent book for a high school sophomore/junior about the dangers of anti-intellectualism and censorship. It is a bracing look at what such policy might lead to. It's fairly well-reasoned and it remains gripping throughout. On the other hand, however, it lacks the sort of over-arching philosophy that can be found in other dystopias. Although it's a great way to get into the subgenre, it's by no means the only or best word upon the subject. It happens to be oversimplified and narrow in focus.It is also, though, excessively didactic. There's very little nuance here, and it's none too subtle about getting across its message. It doesn't quite match up to 1984 and Brave New World, both of which ponder higher philosophical questions and give us plausible scenarios in which the human spirit is broken. In fact, 1984 is now only really significant in its portrait of humanity, since the state it depicts is no longer achievable (I guess Orwell never thought that it would be companies and individuals and not the government who would develop computer technology). Brave New World is the most prophetic of all, largely because it depicts the final showdown of the human spirit and the wheels of society not as a bang, but a whimper, with people so preoccupied with sex and drugs that they just push out thoughts when they come.In fact, Fahrenheit 451 is not all that prophetic. As a warning sign, sure, it retains currency, but it was written before the sexual revolution and the civil rights movement, in Eisenhower's America, where paranoia over Red invasion and Soviet spies like the Rosenbergs and Alger Hiss made such private invasion seem inevitable in the name of preserving liberty. In fact, restrictions on expression have been almost infinitely eased since 1954. The Supreme Court under Earl Warren began to strike down state obscenity laws prohibiting mostly porn, but also avant-garde films, to the point now where they're all gone. I'm not about to argue that the arts now are more vital and important than they ever have been, but it helps when the most popular show on TV is The Sopranos when it used to be All in the Family. Now, much more than ever, we live in a society where the minority is free to say what they wish, thanks to the Internet, the great equalizer. That these voices don't all make it into the mainstream is the fault of the media corporations and the anti-intellectual public, not moral queasiness by the majority. In fact, looking at the 50's, with the Hollywood Ten who went to prison for refusing to answer questions about Communists, where being a Communist and speaking out against the government (in some circumstances) were crimes, and Joe McCarthy decrying such people as Arthur Miller and Defense Secretary George C. Marshall as Communists, it is difficult to argue that censorship has worsened. In every measureable respect, things have gotten much better. That's not to say that tomorrow it might go the other way, but it hasn't and it probably won't.In spite of the recent Ray Bradbury renaissance, we need to put all of his work into context. The outwardly-happy-inwardly-freaked-out 1950s led to many great artistic works, like On The Waterfront and film noir, as well as great popular works, like The Twilight Zone, all of which had underneath them the peculiar paranoia of the time. Fahrenheit 451 is no different, and I would implore you to read it and take this into account. It is highly readable, but let's be honest about its impact and accuracy as prediction."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"As a young writer, Bradbury bubbles with ideas in \\"Fahrenheit 451\\", and the end result is a nice little novel about the evils of censorship and government control. The protagonist, a book-burner named Guy Montang, turns a complete 180 during the beginning of the novel, falling into the lure of freethinking in a world of blarring propaganda and social norms, of repressed emotions and the fast-paced, dangerous city lifestyle.The book has faults. The actual writing is spotty at times, and the extremely circumstantial plot does not complement the thought-provoking concept presented in F451. This is not written as well as, say, Orwell's 1984, and likewise it is not as powerful or as captivating. Though the two books cannot be fairly compared, it proves as an example that the book is lacking something, that sustenance of style that makes a great book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It'd been a couple decades since I last read this book when I picked it up again recently. It has held up well over this time span. This is a fable, a warning of an era where free thought is squashed.The world of Farenheit 451 is an unpleasant place. Although nominally a democracy, the people elect only who they are told to; war is a constant threat and the general populace is kept in a state of blissful ignorance. The only books that remain are dry manuals and rulebooks.Guy Montag, the principal character, slowly becomes aware that there is more to existence than the narrow life that he has lived. As he awakens to this new world, other cracks in the old regime become evident, most obviously with the number of suicides that are taking place. Even if this dictatorship is weakening, it is far from dead, and as Guy begins to explore the world of books and free thought, he puts his life in danger.Although written in the 1950s when television was just beginning, this novel seems to predict an era when TV has essentially replaced reading; fortunately, despite the dominance of television in today's world, books are far from out of fashion. Although not an altogether happy novel, this book is generally optimistic in that it shows how difficult it is to truly contain the human spirit. If it is not 100% realistic, it need not be; as stated before, this is a fable, and a classic in not only science fiction, but literature in general."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It's hard to believe this little book by the famed Ray Bradbury has been around for about fifty years. I remember kids talking about this book just a few years ago when I was in high school and remember thinking it was some great new work of sci-fi. With all the changes in our society and culture the past few years (from the Internet to digital television), FAHRENHEIT 451 is more significant today than it was forty years ago.The plot of the story is simple. Guy Montag is a fireman. However, in the future, instead of putting out fires, fireman start them. Guy burns books and he enjoys doing it. Books are illegal to own and most people spend their free time (and they have lots of it) driving their cars (at speeds of over 120 mph) or listening to the wall-sized televisions that have become their family. One day Guy meets a strange girl who sets a fancy to his heart. His meeting with her allows him to open up and begin to see the truth.The story is simple, but it is what the story says about our society that is so significant. We are told by the story's antagonist that things changed because the country became divided by factions of every sort and people no longer cared about the knowledge books contained. Reading forces people to think and thinking is bad because it forces you to consider others and when you only care about yourself, how can you think about someone else? In our modern American society where many people label themselves with as many hypens as possible, where lives are literally being played out on television, and where violence is becoming more and more the norm; the issues raised in FAHRENHEIT 451 need to be discussed more than ever."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In Fahrenheit 451, Ray Bradbury's frightening vision of the future, firemen don't put fires out; they start them to burn books. In Bradbury's fictional world, it is better not to know or find out anything because if you know too much, you could be in danger. This book is closely related to the book 1984 by George Orwell because you can be put to death for simple things like writing in a diary. In Fahrenheit 451, you can have your house burned down and go to jail for the rest of your life if you are caught with books because reading for pleasure is against the law. The main character, Guy Montag, is a fireman who burns books for a living. He sees his wife sit at home everday with the \\"family\\" who is actually just a television that surrounds the walls, when he starts to question his life. Why are books burned? Why are they so destructive to society? He makes the decision to change his life, risk everything he's worked for and discover what it is that books contain. Montag starts secretly hiding books in his house and reading them at any opportunity he gets. He learns that there is a whole world inside of books that he never knew existed. He tries to tell his wife about this and how books are so important but instead of agreeing, she turns him in to the police. After this incident, Montag's house is burned down and he is confronted by the police chief, Captain Beatty, and has to decide what he is going to do. Although this book was published back in 1953, the idea of firemen getting paid for burning books seems very real. These ideas make you think that maybe someday this could happen. Fahrenheit 451 is a book for ages 13 and up. The incredible descriptions of books burning,along with houses and the mechanical dog are very realistic. I thought this book was good because of the descriptions, you felt like a part of the book and it made you want to keep reading. I would recommene this book to any and everyone."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This wonderfully written science Fiction book is a thought provoking and has two very good qualities. First of all, with Fahrenheit 451 you must read between the lines to find out what Bradbury is really saying. Not only is Bradbury writing a wonderfully twisted novel, but, to me, he is also saying that people are afraid of new or interesting ideas and, since books are full of them, these people will burn the books to put an end to ideas that may cause trouble for \\"society.\\" Of course, as with all of Bradbury's books, it is open to interpretation because of its weird and different look at life and some of life's hard facts. Bradbury's characters have been created with a depth that creates a realistic quality. This depth makes you want to know them, yet, in a way, you feel that you already do. We follow Guy Montag through his insanity knowing he is not insane, it's the rest of his world that is nuts. We grieve when his friend Clarisse McClellan dies because she is more in touch with reality than anyone else is. In all, this great book wraps you up in its story of everyday life in the future, with all its twists and turns. In other words, don't burn this one."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Depending on who you are, there are different messages provided in this book. To a reader in the 50's, this book may just seem like a chilling, futuristic novel. More can be seen by the modern reader because the actual science fiction portion of the book is less distracting. All of the devices described in the book we either already have, or now know are impossible to create within this new century. For example, the interactive &quot;family&quot; Millie was so involved in could be around any day now to consume our loved ones. The mechanical hound, on the other hand, won't be. When the creativity and dazzling ideas of the &quot;future&quot; are lost, the morals and messages become more defined. Bradbury was probably more accurate than he would have ever thought, as we move towards a more lazy America. Some of these messages seem more religious then anything else. They inspire to take advantage of the moment, and be thankful for what we have been provided. No matter how advanced we become, nothing will replace picnics and family values. Although these things have deteriorated over time thanks to technology, they should always be practiced if only for tradition"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Firemen no longer save lives. Instead they burn books and the people who harbor them. Censorship is the way of life in the science fiction world of Fahrenheit 451. Conforming with government, destroying individuality, and asking no questions are the rules of Guy Montag's world. Set in the twenty-first century, Ray Bradbury's novel tells the tale of the fireman who begins to question the rights and wrongs of his life. In this world books promote thinking and wondering and acting. Compliance is necessary for the government to ignore its people and watch over its \\"thirty-second\\" wars. The government wants assimilation and ignorance of differences. So modern technology produces television that is interactive and family rooms are replaced with television parlors - four walls of larger than life TV screens. The firemen hunt out owners of books and burn them, their homes and their books to the ground. \\"It was a pleasure to burn,\\" is the opening line of the story. In the beginning burning books is a source of joy, an excitement programmed into Montag by his world. Then he meets a girl whose family raised her with an encouragement of challenging what she is told. Montag is amazed, almost scared of the idea of questioning life. She begins to question him too. \\"'Do you ever read any of the books you burn?' \`Is it true that long ago firemen put out fires instead of going to start them?' and the worst of all, \`Are you happy?'\\" And there begins Montag's conflict with the government and with himself. When he reads a line of a book he realizes that there is no turning back. He can't be who he was before. And maybe he doesn't want to be. The book is set up as a narrative of one man's experience in trying to rebel against a world that has almost complete control. It is written partly as a typical novel and partly as a sequence of Montag's thoughts. The plot is hard to follow in places and often confusing but the idea behind the story is important enough to make reading the book worthwhile. Bradbury attempts to warn us of what the future may hold that we might prevent the beginning of a world of tyranny. He tells us to remember and cherish the attributes that make us who we are. He teaches us to be an individual and challenge the world around us. Although I did not enjoy the novel, because of the confusion, its message is very important if I want a world where what I think and say is important. A world in where I am a person with rights and opinions that are as valued as any other person's. I do want that world."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It is a crime that the literary world views SF as nothing more than a second class citizen. This book is, without a doubt, one of the greatest works of fiction of the 20th Century. Because, however, it is also a classic of SF it is not considered to be noteworthy in that regard. Bradbury's prose can be compared to a surrealist painting. While the plot may seem straight forward, there is so much else to be seen and to know within the story. Definately, this is a book that any self respecting SF fan should be able to say that they have read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book can be summed up in one word: Magnanimous, in other words: Great! Everyone needs to read this novel, it's an essay about war, *censorship*, love, and philosophy. It will test your mind with tribunal, dysitopic, epic thoughts that will not leave you for your entire life. Now, I will address different readers to how they will like the book. For the devoted sci-fi fan (who for some reason hasn't read this book...): This book contains scenes which are inummerable and subjective to your thoughts, images which are astounding considering the day in age written. Mechanical hounds, massive bombers, wall size televisions, nuclear war, all of it is contained here.For the Owellian/Huxley dystopian fan: This book contains issues of censorhip that these days are beginning to ring true. Poems are regarded as sad thoughts that make people angry. Your spirit will be lifted as the protaganist, Guy Montag, views a woman commit suicide after seeing her books burn. You get to feel for the characters and their actions, and you will love the ending.For the cheap sci-fi fan who just wants wanton acion and adventure: Sorry pal, don't look to this book for action. There is some, but not too much, however, go ahead and do yourself a favor, read the book.For the non sci-fi reader: I don't know how you came across this book, probably through recommendation or assignent. However daftly you view this spectacular book, be prepared to enjoy it. This is a book that will stay in your mind.To anyone: Take heed this book, times might become too true for comfort someday...."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"When in 8th grade I had to read this for school, the first thought that came to mind was &quot;Oh boy, another dull, uninteresting novel to add on to all the rest.&quot; Little did I know that Farenheit 451 would come to become one of my favorite books ever. I didn't even need a teacher to tell me what Bradbury was trying to say. That is the strength of his message. When we finished discussing the book in class, I even went out and bought it. Not only is this book exciting, but it is thought provoking as well. If I had my way, I would have this novel, 1984 by Orwell, and Brave New World by Huxley stressed in school far more than the meaningless stories that children have to read. A better understanding of these novels could change the world."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is perhaps among the greatest books on censorship ever written. At times, it may seem heavyhanded in its approach, and the action, as some reviewers have pointed out may seem a little farfetched. Indeed, who can imagine firemen dousing homes in kerosene and setting them ablaze? But this is not where the value of the book lies. Its value lies in the warning about the type of society we may become, and perhaps already have. A society where serious thought, questioning, and insight are little valued for fear of causing societal unhappiness and where people coast along in life fed by a constant stream of meaningless and useless information via television, unchallenged in their concepts of life by thoughts that may trouble them.We have now in our society a movement - political correctness - that is dominant on college campuses, a movement that seeks as its ultimate goal the suppression of any thought or idea that may in the least be offensive to another individual or group. In Fahrenheit 451 Fire Captain Beatty explains how Bradbury's society of the future came to burn books. Minorities of every stripe complained about how they were portrayed in this book or that book, tearing out page by page those sections that were offensive until the day when the &quot;libraries were shut and minds closed forever.&quot;There are further fewer active readers in American society today than 50 years ago. The great majority of Americans now have their worldview filtered to them through television, and children are raised on the offerings of mass entertainment from Disney and MTV. It is entertaining sometimes, but it is not the stuff of life. Fahrenheit 451 is indeed a prescient and frightening warning."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"They say that this will be made into another movie by Mel Gibson. It has all ready been made into an indifferent film by Francois Truffaut. In the end, this is one novel that deserves to stay a novel. It will always remain because it tapped into powerful metaphors - firemen STARTING fires instead of putting them out, a society ruled by interactive TV (or is it really?), banned books, and books as human beings. If we ever do reach a state where books have to live in people's heads, this will be one of them."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Farenhiet 451 is an excellent book.

He also meets Faber, a professor, who tells him about a future where people can read books and think for themselves. Then, Guy Montag finnaly realizes what he has to do. It's a great book but it's not for people who like books where everything turns out happy and they live happily ever after."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book is in its own way very ironic. It tells the story of a world where the written word is banned and firemen burn books. The story talks of censorship when the book itself is censored in many countries including in some parts of America. The story itself comes from the authors own point of view. He claimed that as he was growing up he saw Hitler burn books and thought it was one of the most criminal acts he had ever scene. I wouldn't recomend this book to any who do not like to read, but if you are an intellectual reader then this is the book for you. It brings to life real issues that affect the society today and can open your eyes to things you have never noticed."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 in my mind is a very well-written book by Ray Bradbury.

This man goes out on midnight, runs and watches pages become inflamed in fire.

I read an article that said much of the band Radiohead's artwork was inspired by this book; as well as some of their little scribbles and a Tee- Shirt.Now I have always respected Radiohead as smart dudes, and have found the image of book burnings full of symbolism. Thus, I gave it a read, and low and behold what do I find? A beast of a book.All the other reviews pretty much get it right, but I didnt like how one reviewer slammed the idea of how easily the main character was converted. After all, the people who did so read books did they not? How could he debate with so little knowledge. Also look at people in our world who are converted from other religions. It usually doesnt take much. Some things just FEEL right after you hear it out loud.All in all, I do not consider this science fiction, but more of a political or social commentary.Interesting, Thought provoking, and entertaining; while maintaining a beatiful simplicity that lets the reader think and imagine."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is about a middle aged man named Guy Montag. Guy is a fireman but, instead of putting out fires he starts them. Since all the houses have been fire proofed years ago there was nothing left for firemen to do so they started burning books.

It was suspensfull and full of detailed descriptions about everything ranging form the color of the sky to the warmth of the burnig pages of the books. Infact I thought that sometimes there was a little too much description, but that was just me. I really liked the plot. THe idea was really good.

In this frightening world Ray Bradbury created, books are not allowed and people are encouraged to escape into fantasy television shows that encourage shallow thinking. Guy Montag, a fireman who burns books, begins to question his reality and sets out on a journey in pursuit of freedom and truth.

Fahrenheit 451 is frightening in the fact that the events laid out are plausible; it's completely accessible to a variety of readers.

Ray Bradbury was a science fiction writer but managed to elevate this novel to the most important rungs of the literary community, something not many SF authors do. There's a reason for that vacuum- typically SF writing is dry, much like 451. It's a good novel, but I don't think it added much to realm of science fiction as it did to the literary community.Science fiction novels from the 50s and 60s have a distinct feel and flow to them and Fahrenheit 451 is no exception. Like many of the other novels of the era, 451 was based on a short story written and was later lengthened to a novel. The basis is simple: books are illegal and must be burnt. That makes a tidy short story. But stretching a simple idea like that into a full length novel loses an ethereal something (the spirit? the essence? the soul?) from its inception. This occurs in many Poul Anderson novels, as well as John Brunner, James Blish and others from the same era.That ethereal something lost changes the feel and flow of a normally placid plot... much like in 451 where the onset of the protagonist's change of heart is sudden and undeveloped. The direction of change is clear and predictable. Perhaps 451 is the waving flag of examples of censorship, but its undeveloped underpinnings starve it of greater breadth."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have read this book more than once, when I first read it I had to for school but really enjoyed it.

They know only things, not the meaning of things. People are made equal, being snatched from the cradle and pounded into submission. They function with automatic reflexes. They have no time to think, no education and no responsibilities (and consequences). They have to forget the rest of the world. All books have to be burned. All memories of former times have to be destroyed.\`Intellectual' is a swear world. Those who resist (the \`antisocials') are killed.But, there are still dens of resistance of older people who escaped the brainwashing.Their message is \`stop making the goddamn funeral pyres.

Even from the start it is made apparent that Montag had a discomfort about his job. His new neighbor Clarisse McClellan helps to make his realize this and that reading and learning is not bad. His boss, the Fire Chief doubts his dedication to this job as is he. In a world where knowledge is strictly prohibited, Montag discovers the importance of literature.

A short while into the story it becomes apparent that Montag already has a certain unease about his job, when he meets a new neighbor of his, Clarisse McClellan, who makes him realize the discomfort he's been feeling. He and the other people around him, including his boss, the Fire Chief, become doubtful of his devotion to his job. This book follows Montag on his journey as he discovers the impotance of literature in a world where knowledge is strictly prohibited.The characters are for the most part non-charismatic and without enthusiasm, with the exception of Clarisse who, having served her purpose, dies within the first few pages. It's a shame, but it is balanced out by the introduction of an old professor named Faber. Both these characters act as guides for Montag as he becomes self-aware and abandons his ignorance.This is the first book in a long time that has made me really think, about what the book means, about what the future will look like, about a life without books. It is an extraordinary piece of writing about a repressive society caught up in its own rules and ideas. Reading through it and hearing as the Chief describes to Montag the history, the process of how slowly, books went from being solely for intellectuals, to being superfluous and completely replaced by television, and finally to being illegal, hits very close to home. While the situations in this books are very extreme, it brings out ideas of this two-dimensional world that doesn't seem so far away."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Farenheit 451 was overall a good book. It did have some strong points as well as its weak points as well. The characters in the novel I thought were very well developed and gave enough detail to make you get a picture in your mind about what he/she looked like. The character that I thought was the best developed out of them all was Guy Montag. He was described physically but also mentally so you could really understand what he was thinking in certain cituations, like how he goes against his heritage of a fireman and decides to start reading books. Guy was a fireman, and firemen in these times burned books. The book says \\" First Fireman: Benjamin Franklin\\" (64)I also like the technology of the novel. The technology was very relavent to what is reaslistic. The ear peaces that they wore to listen to the radio could become very popular in the near future. When Clarisse McClellan said \\"...did you know that once billboards were only twenty feet long? But cars started rushing by so quickly they had to stretch the advertising out so it would last\\" (39). This shows what society was and that technology got so fast that they had to change billboards.The setting of the novel was developed well also. The setting was in a futuristic city, which seemed very high paced, like I would envision most large cities to become in the future.I did not like the fact that people did not have there own feelings about things. They never came up with there own ideas and just seemed to go through everyday monotonously. I do not agree that this is what the future holds and that people pride themselves on having there own ideas.I also disagreed with that nobody likes books and doesn't read them anymore. I feel that it was not a good idea to say that nobody reads and most of the people don't mind that. I would think that if people enjoyed reading like the group led by Granger, there would be violent revolts. When Mildred says \\"...Why should I read? What for...\\" (101). It shows that people had no desire to read or what reading had in store for them.Overall the book was very good and I suggest that you should read it if you are in the mood for an action novel."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is a important and influential book. When written in 1953 he didn't know he was going to predict today's society. Guy Montag, the protagonist, loved his work as a firefighter. He seemed to liked nothing better than to start a fire on a pile of books and watch the pages burn. Until, one day he meets his new neighbor Clarisse, a young girl to whom is educated about the world. They began talking and she asked Montag &quot;Are you happy?&quot;. After returning home from meeting his new neighbor he looks at his wife, in bed and listening to \\"little seashells\\" in her ears which entertains her mind during the night, The author says \\"he wore his happiness like a mask and the girl had run off across the lawn with the mask and there was no way of going to knock on her door and ask for it back.\\" he realizes that indeed he isn't happy. Montag realizes his wife has tried to overdose on sleeping pill and she is taking to the hospital and revived. To much for Montag to handle , he becomes observant . Montag and Clarisse begin meeting up everyday and walking to the subway together and sharing and talking about each other. When Clarisse one day disappears, Montag starts hiding books in his home. His wife Mildred does not agree and she turns him in. Forcing Montag to set fire to his own house. When Montag knew he was caught by his boss Captain Beatty he threw fire on them and fled to avoid arrest, Montag now a delinquent joined a group of scholars whom were outlawed because they kept the contents of books in their heads. I liked this novel because it is very honest, it shows how the society does not always change for the people, but the people can change for the society. You will never see a time or a place where everyone agrees with the same thing and this novel is a great interpretation of a two sided belief ( books vs. no books). The novel shows what censorship can do to a society, and the importance of free speech. People must learn to accept different views, whether they agree totally with them or not."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Living in philadelphia could not have been any more boring or easy.

No one thinks about their job, no one thinks about their rights, no one thinks about their families, and no one thinks about their education. Imagine, there were no worries in the world. Does this appeal to you? Fahrenheit 451 is a novel about a man coming to know the destructive society he is living in. His culture is such that if you own a book, you are burnt along with the book. For people who read are corrupted, their minds have been filled with silly ideas and shouldn't be able to spread them to others. People aren't educated well, and have no opinion. This leads people into a culture where thought is prohibited. He meets a girl who opens up his eyes into &quot;a past where people [were] not afraid&quot;(on the back of the Book). The story outlines the struggle that came with his recognition and and a changed, happier Montag. I loved the book, and think it taught many lessons. Although the world Montag lives in is not alike to ours in that our society prohibits us to think, I would still say that we are on our way to it. This book should be read by our entire populous.

Amazing lesson."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is quite simply an amazing book. Ray Bradbury draws a picture of a futuristic society in which books are banned-all books. Then he uses creative, real-like characters to present it to you. Each and every character has his or her own uniqueness. The opening line-\\"It was a pleasure to burn\\" is a perfect way to start off a book about burning books. I especially enjoyed the character Clarisse McClellan. It was she who introduced Montag to a different kind of world; one in which he could look at everything with more then just his eyes. The part of the book in which Clarisse was letting raindrops fall into her mouth was quite amusing. When Clarisse and Montag part, Montag tilted his head backward and let the raindrops fall in his mouth. I really think the character Clarisse was a great addition to the novel. It helps the readers feel the words of the book all the way up to the surprising ending. The overall quality of this book is great. I would recommend this book to almost anyone. I do, however, think if you are not at all into futuristic, fictional books then this is not the one for you. I would give this novel four out of five stars."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's 'Fahreneheit 451' is a classic that almost everyone should read before they get out of high school or college.

In a world where the government is afraid that people will learn (from books)and rebel, firemen no longer are called to the scene to put out fires, but to start them. In this warp society, burning books is a swift, fast way to take out all education, and people who strive for it. Guy Montag, a fireman, meets a young girl who tells him about a past where things were totally different, and once more sparks his intrest in books he had before. In this book, Bradbury tells us about censorship. It gets the reader thinking is it good or bad? Could Bradbury be forshadowing what our lives will soon become? Overall, this book was good. It got me to think about how our life would be like if I was in the book.

This girl changes Montag's life and helps him notice that he not really happy. This setting is in the future when books are banned both to read and to have possession of. Montag had a job as a firefighter, but he was not assigned to stop fires from spreading. Instead hid job was to burn books and the houses in which they were hidden. Whenever Montag was at work, he always felt wrong when he was burning books. This change occurred after he met Clarisse. She helped him notice that books were a good thing. But one day at work Montag was faced with choice to either burn a book, or to keep the book and read it. I won't tell you what happens next because that would ruin the book.I liked a lot of things about this book, but the thing that enjoyed most was the amount of description and detail. When you read the book you could just picture yourself as the main character and see clearly in full detail you surroundings. Most authors lack this amount of imagination. Second I like the pace at which this book flows. It wasn't too fast or too slow. It would first fully explain one part of the story before it moved on to another part. I also liked the way he wrote this book. It was in such a way that you just had to keep reading until you finished the whole book. Third, I liked the vocabulary that Bradbury used. The words he used made his book sound professional, but the words were not so complex that you can't understand them. The vocabulary also helps in the descriptions that Bradbury made.I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who has a ninth grade reading level or higher. I think it is the type of book that anyone who reads would enjoy reading this book. People who enjoy science -fiction would like this book even better. I say this is a must read book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451-ReviewFahrenheit 451 is a since fiction book set in the future about a fireman named Guy Montage. Only Guy doesn't put out fires like firemen today, he starts them instead. The point of these fires is to burn books, because his society has decided that books do more harm then good. After seeing the look on people's faces after their books were burned Guy becomes interested in books and wonders why people seem to care so much about them. He starts to read books and eventually gives up his old lifestyle.Overall, I thought that Fahrenheit-451 was an interesting and exciting book. It was a little slow and hard to understand at first but eventually it started to pick up and became hard to put down. I can't say much for the setting or the character development but the book was worth reading just for it's phenomenal theme. Near the end the suspense started to pour in and it does keep you on the edge of you seat but immediately after that it slows down. I myself did think that this was an all right book. If you like science fiction and enjoy creative and important themes then Fahrenheit 451 is an excellent choice.

Most people say that this book is about cesorship. But if you dive behind the printed text, you will see the true meaning behind this book. Bradbury satirizes [in this book] what our society is slowly becomig through our own intellectualism(s). And that has been my thesis statement for the three papers I have written on this book: &quot;This book satyrizes what modern society is slowly becomming; as such then we can conclude that [through the socratic definition of justice] that our world is slowly becomming unjust. All in all this is the best book I have ever read. It will enlighten a true reader. Please, for the sake of all great literature, please read this book. I am a highschool freshmen, and I found it exciting enough to do a fifty two page paper on. Please, give Bradbury a chance.

Bradbury seemed to hold on to my attention through the whole book. I think that, after reading this book, everyone will have a new perspective on our current society. From reading about Montag's quest to find out the truth behind the illegal books and the weird laws of his generation's government, it taught me to appreciate what I have now, and to pray that our world will never come to the point where they want to ban books all together from their love to new technology and a faster, better, easier way of life. Reading this great piece of work makes you, just as Montag, question.... are these people really happy?!? You learn throughout the book that it is important be able to think on your own, rather than being a mindless person just sitting as a statue { :) trick} in front a TV, watching what the government wants you to watch, not what you want to watch.

He writes about the future, but his thoughts are centered around the present.Guy Montag was a fireman, not fighter. His job was to seek out books, and burn them. But his whole life changed when he met Clarisse. With three words, Guys life was turned upside down &quot;Are You Happy?&quot; Is he happy or has he been forced to be &quot;happy?&quot; Through the book, Guy sees the horrors of his life, and the lives of others. Everyone is oblivious to the torture they are experiencing. Guy wants out but society won't let him go. Guy has books, a fireman has books, books.

It was weird how some of the things Ray Bradbury thought the future would be like fifty years ago, are what is going on now.

I loved the metaphors, similies, and symbolism throughout the book (although at first I had no idea what the guy was talking about haha). That was one of my favorite things about it. I also liked the plot of this story. At first, I thought, &quot;This is so weird, who would think of a future with no books and firemen starting fires instead of extinguishing them?&quot; But as the book progressed, I started to realize that this could actually be possible in reality in the future. Right now, most of us would go and reach for the remote instead of a book. Yea, don't try to hide it, you know it's true. Anyways, if this habit of ours soon becomes like a big thing, Ray Bradbury's idea of a book-burning future wouldn't be too out there, if ya know what I mean.I reccomend this book to 7th-8th graders and above, since there are many similies, metaphors, symbolism, etc. in this book(as stated before) that younger readers wouldn't understand. At first it's hard to understand for anyone, including myself, but if you're daring enough to try it out, this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I am sad to say I had not read this book till age 27.

The premise of the story is about a fireman who knows nothing else but his job and what life is like now, until he meets a young \\"strange\\" girl who discusses actual real life with him. After that, Montag starts to wonder things outside the realm of what he always knew and starts to question his job and the purpose of burning books. He ends up rebelling and fighting for the cause.If you liked 1984, this book is similar is some aspects (to me at least).

The story follows Guy, who is a firemen, as his new neighbor gets him to open his eyes to the world around him. The plot is enough to keep any reader chugging along, but the main hook to this book is Ray Bradbury's disturbing vision of the future. You can form your own opinions on if its an accurate vision, but whether you think it is going to happen or it is just a load of crap, it should defineatly get you to think about the world around you.

He likes his job well enough until he meets an odd 17-year-old girl named Clarisse who lives in his neighborhood. She talks about all sorts of things that Guy has never considered and he starts to think about his life and the world he lives in. Thinking is not encouraged in this future world and the entire culture seems to revolve around sensory bombardment, mindless entertainment, and a mindless apathy about anything in the real world.This book is a classic largely due to the theme of censorship and free thought. The story is more powerful because it makes it clear that book burning and censorship from the government came well after most people had already turned away from books. It started with one group being offended by one thing, another group offended by something else, until no one wanted to bother with books or anything that challenged them. As many have pointed out, our culture has actually moved closer to the world that Bradbury portrayed and that is a bit scary.The weakness of Fahrenheit 451 is the writing itself as much of the prose reads like bad poetry. It's obvious that the author was attempting to use language to evoke images and feelings, he just wasn't quite up to the challenge of doing it well. It's also quite preachy at times. I found myself skimming through whole pages after a while and even though this is a very short book, it felt like a long read.Those who have never read this book should probably do so at least once. It does discuss important issues and is probably even more timely today than it was when it was written.

What are you doing now?One big rift between the book and the movie [Fahrenheit 451 (1966) -- Oscar Werner, Julie Christie] is that in the movie the \\"written word\\" was completely removed (even from the credits); where as in the book the state was against was literature and not technical writing.Books are just symbols of ideas that could have been on the screen also. There is deference between training and education. Among other reasons the book was a symbol of one mans superiority over another in a world of equals.Fahrenheit 451"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This was the first serious book I read as a teenager and it changed my life forever. I had no idea up till then how one human being could be so perceptive about what was going on around him and be able to describe it is such beauutiful prose as that used by Ray Bradbury. It made me seek out other books to where now at the age of 54, I have a substantial library. I hope this book never goes out of print, although I'm sure there's no fear of that in the near future."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read the book Fahrenheit 451 as a group in my English class. I thought it was a good book to read as a group because one could get lost easily.Fahrenheit 451 had a good sequence that made the reader want to continue. The events that took place were very interesting and in a strange society. The setting was in a way a futuristic city. The houses were fireproof. The cars were traveling at fast speeds. The people were controlled by a law that stated that people are not allowed to read books.There are a few important characters in Fahrenheit 451. Montag is the main character who is a middle aged man, and works as a fireman. Mildred is Montag's wife who afraid to break a law. Clarisse is Montag's neighbor who is very intelligent and has good points. Beatty is the captain of the fire station. Faber is a very smart person who helps Montag on understanding his reading.I picked this book up because the events didn't stop. At the beginning Montag, who is the main character, talks to a girl named Clarisse. Clarisse seems intelligent, and asks Montag if he is happy. In this society they don't read books; instead they burn them. Montag is a fireman, so he burns books. After that he started to question everything in the society. Things like his job, and why they burn books instead of reading them. He sneaks a couple of books and reads them with out anyone knowing. Then he explains it to his wife who then gets scared and calls the firemen to have his books burned. Montag gets in trouble and has to hide fast. His friend Faber, who is really intelligent, helps him out.I liked couple of parts of the book.\\" They would have killed me, thought Montag, swaying, the air still torn and stirring about him in dust, touching his bruised cheek.\\"(128) In this society people drive really fast. The minimum speed limit is around 55 miles per hour. And lots of people are careless. In this case Montag almost gets killed by a group of twelve and sixteen year olds. \\"The Hound leapt up into the air with a rhythm and a sense of timing that was incredibly beautiful. Its needle shot out. It was suspended for a moment in their gaze, as if to give the vast audience time to appreciate everything, the raw look of the victim's face, the empty street, the steel animal a bullet nosing target.\\"(149) This is when the police are trying to catch Montag. Just to make the society feel safe they make it look like they caught Montag but instead it was some random person in an alley.This society that Montag lives in is much different from today. The book seems to be in the future because they have fireproof houses. The one thing that I can connect the book to is the movie V for Vendetta. Both of them take place in a society where it is run so that something is missing from the society. In both the movie and the book there is a person who stands up for a right. My group also talked about the movie Equilibrium being very similar to Fahrenheit 451.I would recommend this book to young adults. The reading level according to me is average. It is also easy to get lost in the book because it switches back and forth on a topic. There are also many metaphors. \\"Come on now, we're going to go build a mirror factory first and put out nothing but mirrors for the next year and take a long look in them,\\"(164) is an example that is used in the text.Overall I liked the book. It was not the best book that I have read. I would recommend this book to people who enjoy reading fiction, adventure, and a little bid of action."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a great book, it was interesting, and is a good for a thoughtful reader. It's a quick read, and I'm busy so it was nice to have an interesting story with some depth. Sometimes I get too busy and it's hard when I'm reading a long book and try to come back to it from a prolonged absence. 451 is around 165 pages, with really no slow tedious parts, which helps keep you on track.The gist of the book is a futuristic society/science fiction. Formerly a banned book, it suggests patterns of human behavior that very well may be the result of the changing patterns of society today. The main character, Guy Montag, is a fireman, however it is his job to burn books, and the houses that they are in. The question of what is in the books he is burning perplexes him, and it pushes him to the extreme. According to the author, Ray Bradbury, this book is just set in the future, no specific time frame, however in this futuristic world, knowledge is considered dangerous.One thing I would like to mention again is the pattern of society and social interaction. There are very little social interactions between people; they don't talk just to talk. There is very little regard for human life, and they speak of death and especially suicide as if it was as common as waking up in the morning. \\"The Family\\" entrances people for hours, and TV is now the size of the entire wall, and is nothing more but shapeless programs of color and video clips no longer than 10 seconds. Wages are much less than in today's world, for Guy Montag, $6,000.00 is his income for an entire year, and he would be considered middle to upper class.Personally, I don't think I would buy this book. Its not something that I would want to read again, however I got a lot out of it, and it gave me a lot to think about. It is a book that everyone should read, however I think borrowing it from the library is a better decision. There are a few confusing parts, and it takes a little time to understand a few things, but overall it all comes together in the end, and really is a good book and gets you thinking."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This was a great book because it shows they world where you can not think on your own and decide on your own. Life would be different if there were no book and where the government thinks for you."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In the book Fahrenheit 451 the main characters name is Guy Montag. Guy is a fireman that burns books and sets houses on fire instead of the normal fireman that puts out the flames. During the course of the book Montag goes through many different phases. The most important phase is where he starts wondering about books. Since all his life he has been taught that books are bad and only to burn them, he is curious what books are about. During the time that he is going through his mysterious phases he meets a girl named Clarisse McClellan, who opens her eyes to the emptiness of his life. Montag met this girl one night when he was taking a walk at about midnight. Montag also meets a very important character named Faber. Faber is an old English professor that likes books and knows a lot about them. Over the story Montag has Faber set him up with a retired publisher, to help publish books. At the time that Montag is trying to publish books the fireman are chasing him, because his wife turned him in.Guy Montag is a fireman who suddenly realizes the emptiness of his life and starts to search for meaning in the books he is supposed to be burning. He quickly forms unusually strong bonds with anyone who seems to have true friendship with him. His biggest regret in life is not having a better relationship with his wife. And because he didn't have a very good relationship with his wife that is why she turned him in to the fireman and got there house burned.The way that Ray Bradbury makes this book seem is incredible. He has a special talent that lets him really involve and capture the reader's attention. while I read this book I felt as if I was a silent observer that stood next to Guy Montag every where he went. I loved this book, and would definitely recommend this book to anybody who loves a great adventure and thrill."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I think that Ray Bradbury did a fantastic job on this book. The detail and the wording was unlike anything I've read before. There were some phrases that were hard to follow, but most of them were amazing detail with some extravagant crosses nightmarish. I've read one other poem of Ray Bradbury's and that too was very nightmarish. Both though were incredible pieces of writing.The basic plot is that is the world is in a futuristic state where the cars go over 100's of mph, about everything is electronic, there are TV programs that you play a character in a soap, and firemen don't put out fires. Yes, that is right firemen don't put out fires they start them, and they start them by igniting books. The only way to describe what having books in the book is like if someone in our society was to murder someone. In the book if you have a book it is considered a felony and firemen come and burn books. Not only do they burn the books the person who is caught with them are sent to jail. The reason these books are being burnt is because they figure that the root cause of anger and prejudice so if there was a book that was controversial then bam it's gone, and eventually all the books were ruled against. Guy Montag a normal man for his job skin slightly burnt with black smudges, fairly large, with the fireman look. He had never questioned his jobs or what he was supposed to do. Until one day when he meets Clarisse McClellan a seventeen-year old girl; who tells him about what United States was before, and what the job of firemen were before the book burning era. Montag's life takes a dramatic change from the point when Clarisse enters. Clarisse talks about living a life and looking around and smelling flowers and opening you mouth and catching raindrops in your mouth. Montag first thought Clarisse was absurd and crazy to do all these things because doing these things were no accustom to this generation, it was fun to be with the \\"family\\" this family isn't the traditional family it's a soap opera where the person plays a part in it. Montag learns the truth of what firemen use to do before the book burning age. Montag thinks it's total nonsense but soon learns better. Clarisse disappears one day, and Montag can't find out why she is gone then his wife tells him that last week she had died, and her family had left. Montag then remembers the only other person he had ever met that was like Clarisse was Faber. Faber is a retired professor; there is no need for professors because there are no books. Faber is willing to help Montag, because Montag is the only one who recognizes that there is a problem, and the only one who wants to make a difference. Montag takes what Faber has called alternate brain and puts it in his ear and can hear Faber's voice. Montag headed to the station, Montag had just settled in when they got a call that would change his life forever.This was on of the most amazing books that I've ever read and all of the twists and great action kept me reading until the very end. I think it would be very interesting if someone would write a sequel to Fahrenheit 451 after the big ending it leaves some space to make a sequel."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The story of Fahrenheit 451 is a complicated one that tries to explain the future in an odd way that is not often expressed. It brings you into the warped mind of a fireman, who burns books rather than puts fires out. This book proves to be very novel and is interesting at times, but at other points it just seems boring and outright ridiculous. When I read this novel it made me think of what the present day government might do behind our backs to censor certain materials, but the novel can be so confusing that it is hard to find the relationship. Despite these setbacks, it shows how a few wrong moves and decisions by humans today can end up in grave results in the future.In this story, the main character Montag begins to run into people that alter his mind and make him think about the ethics of his job, which of course is burning books. Montag used to live his life smelling of kerosene, ravaging people's houses, and setting books aflame, but he wants to know why he is doing these deeds in the first place. It is sort of difficult to see how books could be so horrible that they should be banned and burned. You learn later in the story, if you can read inbetween the lines of difficult language, that the government has put a ban on all books to prevent them from corrupting the minds of the people living at the time. Montag learns this and begins to live two lives; one as a fireman, and the other as a madman hiding books in the vents of his house. While this is happening a war is going on that is so hard to understand and so irrelevant that it should just be ignored. The book continues to become more confusing, and the end is just unimaginable and pointless.If you love books that are outdated and totally science fiction, then this is the novel for you. It is a great piece of work that was new and exciting when it was written, but to most people today it would just seem odd and nauseating at times. It is totally unbelievable, and it was difficult for me to sit down and read this story because it was so complex and involved. It takes a person with an extremely vivid imagination to read this novel. It was meant to show how people can not let the government get out of control because they will eventually corrupt and control the minds of every last person on the planet, but this point is lost somewhere amongst the many plots and twists. It tends to be very odd take on the subject, and I would not really recommend using your time to check it out."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I am a student at a high school and I finished reading &quot;Farenheit 451&quot; in a week and a half. I was very much impressed by the story and how it gets better after the introduction I thought it would be boring book about a firemen but it's a story that takes turns all around. The characters are all taken very much into mind. He gives them all unique personalities, although it's a short story, each chapter is like a bio on one of the many characters."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a very good story about a struggling public servant who is deeply confused by the twisted world that surrounds him. As a fireman in this backwards society, he is expected to burn books and the houses that contain them, but can no longer bring himself to do it as he once did. Books are outlawed and burned because they are the source of much confusion and varying points of view. The government could not bear it any longer, so it opted to simply destroy the books. Firemen are now employed to start fires instead of stopping them. The main character is Guy Montag, along with his wife Mildred and Fire Captain Beatty. Montag tries very hard to beat the system by hiding and reading books, but cannot contain his frustration. He is found out and flees to save his life.Guy Montag is my favorite character in this book. He goes through many changes and has quite an adventure. In the end, in order to escape and be free, he has to defeat his boss and kill the deadly Mechanical Hound, which is a machine used to track down fugitives.Fahrenheit 451 is also a story about the contradictory principle of censorship. Ray Bradbury shows what the effects of censorship are mental unrest and dissatisfaction with the quality of life. He writes about it hoping to get the attention and open the reader's eyes to face this evident threat that is in fact a reality.I can, in some way, relate to Montag. He was different from most people and managed to beat the system in the end. Although I have never killed any one or burned down houses like he did, but I do share the same spirit of dissatisfaction with the rules of society. There are many things wrong with this world that I am not happy with. Much of my unhappiness is towards hypocrisy. For example, how can the government mandate that an 18 year old male go and die for the US, yet he cannot be declared financially independent until he is 24? Or how can this same 18 year old male cast a vote to put a man into office and elect a president, but he cannot have a drop of alcohol until he is 21? Like Montag, I also struggle with society's rules and points of view. We may differ in cause, but the spirit is the same.I enjoyed reading this book. Mr. Bradbury knows how to tell a good story. I especially liked the climax, which was, of course, the best part of the book. The only thing that I do not like, perhaps due to my impatience, are the long and wordy monologues. But then again, these are essential to the storyline of the book. This is how Bradbury is able to explain confusing parts in the story. He uses them as a movie would use flashbacks. If it were up to me, I would just put a little more action in these parts.Of course, as would almost all readers of this story, I highly recommend this book. Students from grade level 9 and up will be able to truly appreciate it. Perhaps the misfits and outcasts in this society will enjoy it more, but in all, this is a good book for every one. Fahrenheit 451 will fit well in any literary collection, be it political or sci-fi or both."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"What can I say that has not already been said.

It makes you wonder if a future in which books are burned and readers are chased like criminals is indeed so impossible or fantastic. This is in fact one of those books with &quot;plenty of ideas per square inch,&quot; so much so, one could be discussing it for days, and indeed using more than the 1,000 words you are allowed to use here: the character of Beatty, who sincerely believes that books make you unhappy (and of course, he is right), but at the same time he's aware of the fact that books also give you power; the dislike of controversy and all things &quot;difficult;&quot; the hate directed against outstanding people; the watering down of art and literature through political correctness; the brainwashed TV people who think themselves happy but are in fact dissatisfied and violent...I find this book very moving and not &quot;confusing&quot; at all. In fact it is written in a very clean and economic style, with all that purple prose that ruins so many other books by Bradbury kept to the minimum. If you liked this book, check out the movie by Franois Truffault. If you missed Clarisse in the book, you will be glad to know that Truffault thought the same and her role in the movie is much more developed."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book just plain doesn't make sense and it doesn't apply to younger people. Even though many schools have made this book a standard for 9th and 10th graders to read, many of us just don't understand and get lost. We understand about censorship and all that other stuff, but why are you telling us? We are the ones that want to make everything more open. You make us read this book, like we are the ones trying to close everything up and prevent us from reading anything. I think the congress men and all adults should read this. Not kids. I personally think that teachers and educators could have picked a better book for us students to read. But that is my opinion, and suprisely many fellow students agree with me."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In the year 1953 Ray Bradbury wrote a book about something that, I think, could very well happen in the year 2000 and the years thereafter. The whole book, &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;, is about the banning of books. This issue has gotten worse over the years and if it continues maybe firemen will indeed be paid to burn our books.In &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; Guy Montag, the main character, is a fireman who realizes people should have the right to read books. He realizes that books mean a lot to the people who own them and after years of never thinking twice about burning a house down he watches a woman burn herself with her house because she wanted to die right along with her books. Guy comes up with a plan to get revenge on other firemen in an effort to stop book banning.At some points of the book Ray Bradbury's writing was a bit confusing. He brought up different characters and stories out of the blue and I really had to think to figure out how those events pertained to the main story.&quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; was the second science fiction book I've read by Ray Bradbury. I also read &quot;October County&quot;, a book of short stories. I do have to say that that book was also confusing, but was good because of the author's great description of places and people.&quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; is good if you like to think while you read.

Clarisse is a free thinking spirit, who surprises him with her genuine curiosity about life, she questions things instead of just accepting blind answers. She and Montag become friends and she talks to him about the past, when firefighters actually fought fires instead of burning books.When Montag goes home that night, he finds his wife, Mildred, has overdosed on sleeping pills. He calls the medics and Mildred is saved. But Montag begins to begins to question his own way of life and his happiness.One night while on call, Montag arrives at a womans house to burn her books. The woman refuses to leave, and instead dies that night in her burning home. Montag is greatly distressed over this and begins to have second thoughts about his way of life. While he was at the womans home, he grabbed a book to sneak out with him. It turns out Montag has been collecting and hiding books in his house for some time. He tells his wife this and shows her his collection, but she is so brainwashed that she doesn't care about the books and wants him to burn them too. So he decides to look up a retired English professor who he knows has books stashed in his house, a man named Faber. He hopes Faber can answer some of his questions.I read Farenheit 451 without knowing anything about it, I just knew that Ray Bradbury wrote it and that it is considered a modern classic. So when I went to my local library and stumbled upon this book, I grabbed it off the shelf and figured i'd give it a go. I am so glad I did, it is a great read. I was hooked from page one. The storyline was really good, I found it to be creepy the way society was brainwashed and how they lived in an oppressed world without books. I liked Montag very much. It's almost like he was sleeping all that time, then finally woke up and snapped out of it.Mildred creeped me out, especially the way she spoke, it was very disjointed, she makes offhand remarks, almost like she's drugged.I think most off all, I enjoyed this one so much because I like books that are about books."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 written in the 1950's describes a future to which we still may be on our way.

One of those amazing stories that you see reflected in so many other stories today. My only complaint is that the writing style to me felt like I was reading one long runon sentence. Amazing read none the less. :)"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read this directly after1984, and thus Bradbury's vision of the future seemed positively quaint by comparison. Later, I learned that crafting an unimaginable dystopia was not Bradbury's intent: instead of offering a forecast of runaway state power, Bradbury's book was about the corrupting influence of television and its deleterious affects on the population's literacy. The fire chief actually explains this to the protagonist, but I took it not as exposition (as it was intended), but as a red herring... I guess I was giving Bradbury too much credit. The book is not about censorship at all; not about the horrors of the omnipotent state, even as most readers interpret it as such.In this way, Fahrenheit 451 can be viewed as a failure: the message the author intended to convey is not appreciated by the bulk of the book's audience. But that is not to say the book is no good. It is an insightful and entertaining read; stylistically superb, exceedingly well written, with plenty of memorable characters and potent imagery. But the actual theme is less poignant than the one imagined by most readers, which is why I think it failed to really satisfy me as a profound piece of literature."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"While a good read with strong themes, I struggle to grasp why this book is considered such a \\"classic\\" by so many. I'll admit - I am no one to judge what a \\"classic\\" is, but it would be nice if someone could explain it to me - as there are other books out there that drive at similar points but are considered far less noteworthy.That being said, there were some strong themes running through this book that seem very prophetic - the book was written in the 1950s, and I caught myself more than once drawing on Bradbury's \\"exaggerations\\" (at the time) to current society. Such as the mass media (or propaganda) and mind control - crippling people's ability to think for themselves - and in fact doing the \\"thinking\\" for them. This is a central theme and one of the reasons behind the burning of books - as books make you think and loosen one's ability to control. And similarly, the (television) media's creation of short attention spans (immediately looking for the climax of a story - otherwise attention drifts) - creating a society that shallowly drifts from one climax to another, without every really grabbing a hold of anything. Senses have been dulled to the point where no one actually sees anything - to the point that it's suggested that society wouldn't know what grass or flowers were - only if you showed them a green blur would the recognize grass (as they are so busy driving fast to get to their next \\"climax\\" they don't see anything else). Both of these create a mindless society that lacks anything beneath the surface. Bradbury displays the deterioration this causes with the Mildred character - Montag's numb wife whose only satisfaction is her television \\"family\\", and who presents a shallow faade of happiness - but who in reality is miserable (poignantly displayed when she attempts to kill herself towards the beginning of the novel). I think she represents society in general - what Montag is \\"supposed\\" to be but is breaking free from.Although interpreted to be exaggerations at the time - one can link these ideas to current society (in the 2000s). The ever shrinking attention span as technology develops new and newer media outlets (television, video games, Internet, iPods - all moving us further away from books). The mindless shows and distractions we watch to help us escape from our own lives (I don't mean to sound like I'm on a high horse here - I do the same thing); the mind control of masses by spin networks and political twisting. One reviewer mentioned the absurdity of intellectuals being banished to the far forest outside the city (in the book) - but what angle do you think \\"political strategists\\" are playing when they label President Obama an elitist, or rave about the liberal academia? The tension between knowledge and ignorance was one of the main reasons for the banishment of books in the book. I'm not suggesting that book burning is around the corner - only that the seeds that seem to have created Bradbury's fictional society are the same seeds that are present today.Overall - as mentioned a good book - and one that continues to grow on me (perhaps it is a classic after all?)."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Excellent Service!

Houses have become completely fireproof (and no-one seems to own cats, or trees for that matter.) Indeed the new role of the fireman is to ensure that fires happen, fuelled by books, writing and probably artwork if there was any left in this future.Enter Montag, a dedicated fireman who finds himself curious as to why people keep defying the law and owning books. Given this is a dystopian novel imagine you can tell where this leads.While shortish (the novella was orignially 25,000 words, before various magazines including Playboy asked for a longer work) Bradbury was a lot to say about the future of Western society. The scariest part for me was the fact people had all but become reality TV zombies, considering the people of the 'walls' to be their family's. A trend which I can see happening entirely naturally without any tyrannical political force.In summary, Fahrenheit 451 won't take up much of your time, but is worth more than the time you will spend on it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury crafts a dark future that strikes at humanity's desire to destroy the mirror that reflects our short comings.In an age where books seem to be losing popularity, this novel reminds the readers the importance of the written word and the necessity to preserve our history, lest we be doomed to repeat it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Must read if you are a slacker like me and didn't read all the books you should have when you were in high school :D"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I loved this book in high school and now that I'm reading it ten years later the messages are even more relevant and insightful."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read this book last year for school.

If you're looking for an intriguing and intelligent book, this one is for you."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I am teaching \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" as the example of a dsytopian novel in my Science Fiction class, although it is certainly one of the most atypical of that particular type of narrative discourse. Compared to such heavy weight examples as George Orwell's \\"1984,\\" Aldous Huxley's \\"Brave New World,\\" Yevgeny Zamiatin's \\"We,\\" Ray Bradbury's imaginative meditation on censorship seems like light reading. But the delicious irony of a world in which firemen start fires remains postent and the idea of people memorizing books so they will be preserved for future generations is compelling. Of course, there have been more documented cases of \\"book burning,\\" albeit in less literal forms, since \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" was first published in 1953, so an argument can be made that while all the public debate was over how close we were the Orwellian future envisioned in \\"1984,\\" it is Bradbury's little parable that may well be more realistic (especially in terms of the effects of television).The novel is based on a short story, \\"The Fireman,\\" that Bradbury published in \\"Galaxy Science Fiction\\" in 1951 and then expanded into \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" two years later. However, those who have studied Bradbury's writings caw trace key elements back to a 1948 story \\"Pillar of Fire\\" and the \\"Usher II\\" story from his 1950 work \\"The Martian Chronicles.\\" Beyond that, there is the historical record of the Nazis burning books in 1933. The story is of a future world in which everyone understands that books are for burning, along with the houses in which they were hidden. Guy Montage is a fireman who has been happy in his work for ten years, but suddenly finds himself asking questions when he meets a teenage girl and an old professor.\\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is not only about censorship, but also about the inherent tension in advanced societies between knowledge and ignorance. Reading this novel again I am reminded about Pat Paulsen's editorial on the old \\"Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\\" (a series well acquainted with the perils of censorship) about how we might enjoy freedom of speech in this country but we do not enjoy freedom of hearing because \\"there is always the danger of something being said.\\" Censorship, in practical terms, is the effort of those who do not want others to hear what they find offensive, for whatever reasons, basically because it leads to people thinking thoughts they do not want them to be thinking. Through the rambling diatribes of Captain Beatty, Bradbury makes this point quite clear to his readers.Even though this is essentially a novella, Bradbury's work retains the charm of a short story. The recurring use of animal imagery throughout the story, the use of the mythic ideas of the salamander and the phoenix, make \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" more poetic than any other dystopian work. Even if it is predominantly a one note argument regarding censorship, it is impossible to deny that Bradbury makes a clear and convincing case for his position. Besides, there is something to be said for any work that insures that beyond the point at which water freezes the only other recognizable number on the Fahrenheit scale is the point at which book paper starts to burn."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I never attended an American highschool so this hasn't been part of my mandatory reading. I heard much about it though and finally decided to pick up a copy in the bookstore the other day. I loved the story and prose. I wish the book had been longer with more details about the world the story takes place in. Bradbury leaves many facets of daily life untouched, that I would have liked to hear about. Alas, this is not a descriptive science fiction novel though, but a rather philosophical approach, that leaves more to imagination than other authors do.One complaint I have with this edition is, that the main character's name (Montag) was misspelled as \\"Montage\\" in at least one occurence. While this is no big deal, it really bothers me, especially when the book isn't brand new but has been read and reviewed millions of times."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"+++++(Note: this review is for the book \\"Fahrenheit 451: The 50th Anniversary Edition\\" published by Del Rey in 2003.)This particular book has five sections:(1) The actual novel by Ray Bradbury that was first published in 1953 (165 pages).(2) An \\"Afterward\\" written by the author in 1982 (7 pages).(3) A \\"Coda\\" (a section that reinforces the novel's conclusion) written by the author in 1979 (5 pages).(4) An interview with the author in 2003 entitled \\"A Conversation with Ray Bradbury\\" (11 pages).(5) \\"About the Author\\" or a brief biography of Ray Bradbury, born 1920 (1 page).This novel is a dystopian science fiction novel. (A \\"dystopia\\" is any society considered to be undesirable; the opposite of a utopia.) It is set in a world where books are banned and burned and, as well, where critical thought is discouraged. The novel's title refers to the ignition temperature of paper. (The ignition temperature is the temperature at which something catches fire and burns on its own.) For paper, this temperature is 451 degrees Fahrenheit (or 233 degrees Celsius).What's eerie about this novel is that, even though it was written more than fifty years ago, it seems to be predicting what is beginning in our society.The novel itself is divided into three parts. (There are no chapters.) These parts are entitled:(1) The Hearth and Salamander(2) The Sieve and the Sand(3) Burning BrightThere are only five major characters in this novel:(1) Guy Montag: is the protagonist of the story. He is a \\"fireman\\" (or more precisely a book burner) who realizes that the world is wasting away because people live only to be entertained. Montag eventually begins collecting books by stealing them instead of burning them.(2) Mildred Montag: Guy's wife whose only purpose in life is watching television. She is very unhappy (but doesn't realize it).(3) Clarisse: the unusual girl who lives next door to Guy. She refuses the entertainment of society and is a free thinker who enjoys the outdoors and family conversations. She informs Montag that there's more to life than burning books and watching television.(4) Captain Beatty: the fire chief for whom Montag works. He is the villain of the novel.(5) Faber: a retired English professor. When Montag needs help understanding what he reads in his stolen books, he turns to this professor.There are a few minor characters in the novel. The most significant are a small group of \\"outlaws.\\" Their crime: being scholars who read books in the past.This novel might be considered a social commentary that predicts what may happen in the future. Some themes that run through it are as follows:(1) the use of fear to control(2) the dangers of indifference(3) the dangers of censorship(4) the importance of free speech(5) the importance of the individual.The afterword is interesting and is where Bradbury talks about his love of books and writers. As well, he revisits some of the main characters in this novel.The coda explains how some publishers have tried to censor some aspects of this novel. This got Bradbury very angry and he states, \\"There is more than one way to burn a book. And the world is full of people running about with lit matches.\\"In the interview with Bradbury, many intriguing things are discussed. I found Bradbury's critique of the 1966 movie based on this novel interesting. I learned that a new movie based on this novel will be coming out soon. I also admire Bradbury even more when he states, \\"Reading is the center of our lives. The library is our brain. Without the library, you have no civilization.\\"Finally, the cover of this book is of special significance. It is the original cover of the 1953 hardcover book showing a person covered in printed paper with books (presumably that he's/she's read) at his/her feet. The person and the books are shown set ablaze.In conclusion, this is a short, fascinating book that really makes you think about the future of society!!(Originally published 1953; this particular book published 2003; 3 parts; main narrative of 165 pages; afterword; coda; interview with author)+++++"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"First off, I would like to tell you why I picked this book. I picked it because I like books that have the future in it. When I first looked at the headings for this book, I was really undecided, but when I went to amazon.com I fould out that this book took place in the future with the firefighter and his troubles. I thought, &quot;Well Hey&quot;. Maybe I would actually be able to raed the book and see things differently and my thought was right. It was a book about a firefighter named Montag, who instead of putting fires out, he sets them. When I first found out I thought to myself, &quot;well thats pointless, why would you set a fire and just let it burn like nothing happened?&quot; But after I read on through the pages I found out that they dont just burn houses for no reason, they burn them because of books. If there are books in the house and they get a call, they will go and start the house on fire. One night Montag was setting a fire and an old lady was sitting there saying something. Montag tried to get the lady out of the house, but she wouldn't go. That made Montag thing, and me also, &quot;why would you want to die in a fire?&quot; Montag grabeed a book, hid it under his arm, and left. After that fire, Montag went home to his wife Mildred. (Theres something weird in the book, the walls are TVs and the TV characters on shows are &quot;the Relatives&quot;). When Montag got home, he hid the book under his pillow and he barely slept that night, and when he woke up in the morning, his wife Mildred was watching TV, or should I say talking to the relatives, and he told mildred he wasnt feeling well, and if the cheif comes and asks for him to tell him that he wasn't feeling well and would go to work. Mildred thought that it was unusual because Montag is never sick. Montag asked mildred to get him some advil and turn down the relatives. Mildred refused because she didnt believe Montag at all. the door monitor went off and it was the cheif, Montag told mildred to tell the chief &quot;I dont know, I dont want to talk about anything&quot; Mildred of course let him in and the chief had a clue that Montag had a book and that's why he didnt feel good. So the chief played it off the way I pictured it, was like this, &quot;I know that the fire last night wasnt' so pleasant, but when people have books and they know it is against the law, but on the other hand if the fireman had the book for more than 24 hours, then we would have to burn his house&quot;. That made Montag kind of scared, after the chief left, he said I must tell you something Mildred, after he went and pulled 8 books from the light fixture in the hall, mildred didn't know what to do and went ballistic. But then she sat down to read a book or two thinking it would help, all of a sudden tthe phone rang and she answered. it was her friend and she told Montag she was going out with her friend and Montag ws shocked. But then Montag remembered, &quot;I remember a guy a long time ago I was sitting in the park, he would carry a bible around, and he told me that if i ever needed help to call me and he handed me a card.&quot; Montag went dashing around the house finding the card. He finally found it and he called him, and his name was Faber.For the rest of the story you must read the book. it is actually kind of interesting if you think about it. Maybe 60 years from now, maybe firefighters will acttually start fires instead of putting them out! As for me, the book was an okay book. I have read better but it was interesting."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Guy Montag is a fireman. His job description differs from the job of firemen of our society. Guy's job is to burn books and the houses of those who conceal them. Guy stumbles upon a woman unlike any other he has met before. Her name is Clarisse. She is very different than anybody else from this society. Guy takes long walks with her and listens to her as much as possible. This is the beginning of Guy's rebel against society.One night, Guy responds to a call about a woman concealing books. They find them and Guy happens to pick one up and hide it in his jacket. The woman is so in love with her books that she burns herself with them. Guy wonders why she had done that and why people have such a passion for books. He seeks these answers and reveals 24 books he had stolen. He sought an old acquaintance named Faber to help him understand them.Faber read him the books he presented and explained the logic behind them while Montag thought up a way to beat the system of the firemen. His plan is working when books are reported at his house and he is forced to burn his house himself. He is so enraged that he burns the fire chief and races off for the country.In this rural area he meets a group of men full of knowledge. They talk for a long time until they decide to move. They are walking when jets fly overhead and drop bombs on the city in view many miles away. The city collapses and Guy is speechless while thinking about all of the lost lives. He also sees this as a new beginning; a chance to show the flaws of an uneducated society."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Guy Montag is a firefighter who burns things. Specifically books, and the houses they are found in. He lives in a state where books, and possesion of them, is illegal. Guy enjoys his job until the day he meets Clarisse McClellan.Clarisse makes Guy doubt his motives and he soon becomes daring enough to break the law and read a book. He finds he loves litereature, he keeps steals books from the houses he's burning and reads them at home. He finally goes as far as to skip work one day, and his Fire Department Captain, Captain Beatty, shows up at his home. He tells Montag that it's normal for a Fireman to go through such doubts at a stage in his life. Then proceeds to go through a long monologue as to the history of banning books. According to him, special interest groups objected to books that criticized, belittled, or undermined their causes. For this reason, books became more and more neutral in order to avoid offending anyone. However, this still wasn't enough. So society agreed to outlaw books.Montag is not convinced and begins to plot with a professor he had previously met named Faber. They plan on planting books in the houses of Firemen as a way of discrediting the profession and destroying the governments unit for censorship. However, thing go when the alarm sounds at the firestation and Montag goes to the last house he'll burn in is career, his house.Unlike its fellow dystopia-themed predecessor, 1984, much of Fahrenheit 451's depiction of modern society came true almost prophetically. Although not outlawed, literature now holds a narrow audience. And the brainwashing televisions Ray Bradbury depicts aren't far off of today's one-eyed-boxes.Ray Bradbury's adjectival descriptions in this book are strong, even at times; on occasion, one could even say they became monotonous. However, the books never crawls forward for to long; the progress, although not quick, still moves fast enough to keep the reader's attention.Overall a strong novel censorship. Although not perfectI would recommend Fahrenheit 451 to any reader interested in either mere science-fiction, or one actually interested in a political criticism of censorship. Both will find their time well spent, the latter will definitely get more out of it, as for the previous. . .Maybe you would enjoy Star Wars??"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is simply the tale of a fireman, Guy Montag, whose job it is to burn books. Life for Guy is a routine--the same lifeless relationship with his wife, the same job day in and out, the same shallow fullfillment of time.There must be something else.The humanity in Guy is writhing and struggling, but Guy knows not what he lacks. Montag is forced to choose between what he knows is right and what he feels.And the consequences make all the difference.In this novel, Ray Bradbury, in this novel of a futuristic world eerily similar to our own, critiques censorship and the education in America. Bradbury holds up a mirror to our ordinary lives, and for just 200 some odd pages, shows us how much better life truly can be.An excellent short read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I love this book!

Firefighters started fires to get rid of books instead of getting fires out. This book was confusing at parts but it wasn't to bad.

Not only was the story outstanding, but the way in which it was written was phenominal. Ray Bradbury's Far451 depicts a society where books are illeagal, and fire men are for burning any books found are burned. Guy Montag, the main charachter is a fire man, reads a book. He learns to love books, and is not afraid to do what he belives. Everyone else does what they are supposed to : watch T.V. and other forms of entertainment that require little, or no intellect whatsoever.(that is just the very beginning) This novel is very close to real life, and is the most acurate prediction of where our society is headed (Not literaly!, just the conformity, and the censorship) There is more to conformity than what appears to be, as Ray demonstrates. It also eliminates love in some ways, and &quot;life&quot;.

A book that can be referred to by one name by a couple of generations. If your going to start with Bradbury (May he Rest in Peace hopefully in Green Town Illinois) this is the place: Fahrenheit 451 (the temperature at which paper ignites--\\"It was a pleasure to burn.\\").Fahrenheit has been called dystopian, a clssification that can be applied I suppose, but in reality Bradbury is just extending trends he saw back in the late \`50s and early \`6os. The book is a story of what we ultimately would do to ourselves, so it's not so shocking in the plugged in soceity that we have become with our reality televisiohn, our big screan T.V.s and our playtime phones, and of course, this web of disinformation and nonsense that I am using. Sometimes I wonder if CEOs didn't just read Bradbury's nightmare and say, \\"hey, here's the way we can turn everyone into mindless, easily manipulated, slugs. It's more terrifying than 1984 with all the overtones of Stalanism and what you want to call the psycho patyhology of the Nazis, because the tyrrany in Fahrenheit is self inflicted and quite normal in a wayThe coversion of Montague the fireman and the main character, is Bradbury's optimism coming through and is the character hook that drags the reader through the tale. At least there are people who just keep the faith of intelligence and inspiration, the book people who are a threat to the dystopian society just by quietly reading and remembering.If you start here with Fahrenheit the _Martian Chronicles_ should come next, because even though its science is now quaint, there is a moral tale in that episodic compilation and one begins to see Bradbury's syle emerge. Just as with Wells in _War of the Worlds_ the message is more powerful than the factual underpinings. That's why calling anything \\"High Teck SciFi\\" just means tha it's up to date with the science of the moment and the we can ask with the Martian in one of the episodes \\"whose to say I'm not the future and your the past.\\" Who knows? long after we are all gone where may be goldened eyed Martians, living in chess piece cities beside wine dark canals.We see no one of Bardbury's ilke until we go back to the 19th century. In _Dandelion Wine_, that golden elixer, and _Something Wicked this Way Comes_, both of which can hardly be called SciFi, we see that sytyle mature into the trope of the remembered past.But to go down that road it is best to start at Fahrenheit."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"bought this for a siblings course requirement. does what it needs too. this was a good purchase at a reasonable price."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If you are looking for a book that will make you think, then this is the book for you.

A good example is when he returns to the firehouse the night his wife turns him in. they get a call and it turns out to be his own house. It was obvious from the beginning that they would be ending up at his house (I thought), but to describe it Bradbury writes: &quot;Why,&quot; said Montag slowly,&quot;we've stopped in front of *my* house&quot;.

Finished it in a mere one sitting. Bradbury's use of language is emphatic and fluent and he brings his message across in a unique way.

It made me think of what life would be like without books, cause that's basically what Ray Bradbury is trying to portray. Sure, some people say it is far fetched, but you never know what things are going to be like in the future. I would have given this book a 5 Star Rating, however, the thing I didn't like about it was that it was very confusing. It kept switching from one thing to another.

It begins in an unknown city somewhere in America in years and decades directly after the McCarthy era levels of censorship. Media has become the center of American culture, and many people's parlor walls are covered with giant, super-enhanced HDTVs, lowering their level of interaction with each other to almost nothing in respect to both its quantity and its quality. The main character, Guy Montag, is a fireman, but he has never actually put out a fire in his life (at least not intentionally). All houses have been permanently fireproofed with plastic sheaths for nearly 50 years, and the jobs of firemen have been changed from protecting the public from fire to \\"protecting\\" the public with fire. As reality TV, comedy shows and pulp fiction/romance novels became more and more popular, non-fiction and the classics were read less and less until, as Captain Beatty, the fire captain and primary personified villain of the novel, says, \\"(Most people's) sole knowledge of Hamlet was a one-page digest in a book that claimed: 'now at least you can read all the classics; keep up with your neighbors.'\\" As public interest in books, newspapers, and other sources of information waned, the school system and general level of education grew less and less complex/competent, until eventually the government took advantage of the situation and began cutting off all books which \\"offended\\" any minority, no matter how small, proclaiming equal treatment for all and the evils of literature loudly. In order to enforce this ban which the people had so perfectly brought down upon themselves, the government changed the fire department into its secret police, stating that they were protecting the public from the \\"harm\\" of these books while truly cutting them off from the only source of knowledge able to save them from the impending but largely ignored or unconcerning massive international atomic war. As Guy races against time, the odds, and the power of the government and its incredibly seductive mass media, he attempts to break through to someone, trying to find some way to destroy the killer system before it's too late. Can he destroy the system with the help of an old retired English professor named Faber? Or will Captain Beatty and the government's deadly Mechanical Hound catch up with him first? The playing out and ultimate conclusion of this conflict is an incredibly deep and powerful reflection on our American culture today, and on our seemingly insatiable desire for pleasure and entertainment without having to do any more work or self-education/learning in order to get it than we see as being absolutely necessary. Written in McCarthy era America before the dawn of the television, the rise of televised NFL and ESPN, and the surrealistic and ever growing worlds of video games, movies and the Internet, Fahrenheit 451 predicts with eerie accuracy directions in our culture which 50 years ago would have been regarded as impossible science fiction dystopia, but now are considered an ever growing part of normal daily life. As the quality of our public school system continues to decline, and fast cars, pornography, and having fun with friends quickly become more important than keeping on top of government, state, or even local affairs for the vast majority of the American population, one might stop to wonder between one's job and the entertainments we all seem to live for and rush home to every night why we're doing anything like this-what is it we really value in life? In Montag's world, the sources for those values have been taken away, sacrificed to the peoples' ever-growing and insatiable desire for pleasure. Will--or could--our civilization go the same way, walking blindly to the very edge of a worldwide atomic war? Judge for yourself after reading America's fate in the incredible future-predicting novel Fahrenheit 451."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"By Brian WalshThis book is set in the future. A future where the idiot reigns supreme. A future where TVs are full, 4-wall rooms, and the characters on it are called a family. A future where all learning and real thought is illegal. A future where books are illegal, and the fire brigade has been changed into a book-burning brigade. A future where the government strives to make everyone happy. A future that, thankfully, will never exist.The government abolishes anything controversial, to keep the masses happy. This includes religion, the arts, and all forms op open thought. No-one has a vent for the soul, and they become mindless mush-people. All they do in life is get up, go to work, press buttons, come home, go into the TV-room, eat, and fall asleep.To please everyone, books have been abolished, to eradicate controversy. However, the populace still kept books they liked and read them. To enforce the law, the government called book-readers insane andTurned the (obsolete) fire brigade into enforcers of this law.The main character in this book is a fireman called Guy Montag. His wife is a typical person of his time. However, he is starting to talk to a young girl, his next-door neighbour, who obviously reads books. He becomes a little confused, and starts reading books himself. His workmates start getting suspicious, and it's only a matter of time before they find out his hobby. What happens? Read the book yourself!This is a good futuristic fantasy, focusing on the pessimistic side of society, and thinking what would it be like if this were society. Ray Bradbury is a great writer, and this book, despite its faults, is a great read for anyone who is ready to read it. My rating: 4 stars (out of 5)."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"From the temperature at which books burn, Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 illustrates a frightening idea of the future, a future where firemen do not put out fires but start them. Guy Montag, a book-burning fireman, obtains a job to achieve the society's highest objective, happiness. In Montag's world, trivial information (as from television) is good, and knowledge and ideas are bad. Guy was once happy when he burnt books in the fireproof houses, but this happiness becomes questionable when he meets the new 17-year-old neighbor girl, Clarisse, who is thrilled by the ideas from books and the world around her. Before he met Clarisse (who told him about the past when people were not afraid and firemen prevented fires) Guy never questioned anything. While Guy experiences a faith crisis, his wife spends all day in front of the television wall, with her television \\"family.\\" When Clarisse disappears mysteriously, Guy becomes motivated and starts to hide books. Eventually, Mildred, Guy's wife turns him in and he must either flee or become arrested.Fahrenheit 451 is a novel with many alarming resemblances to our current world. This story talks about how books are unnecessary. To keep people happy, society only lets people remember insignificant information, mainly from television. Some people will receive ideas from books, while others may not. Therefore, books imply that people could be discriminated against, and discrimination would defeat the purpose true happiness. This is similar to what our world, where young people are more interested in television than reading.Books give people knowledge and the freedom to perceive differences. This novel taught me a lot about the importance of reading for everyone. At the end of the novel, homeless people realize how important books are and that authors spent their lives, writing their thoughts and expressions, which would eventually be forgotten in the fires. Authors write their stories to have the reader relate to the characters and plot. These wanderers memorized books to convey their knowledge to the next generation. I would recommend this novel to everyone, especially people who do not like to read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury makes it look effortless. The story reads so fast it is as if the author wrote it in one sitting with no revisions. This book is the perfect quick read for those on-the-go folks who have little time for leisure reading. And when you are finished, you will uncover another reason the book is so short."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I admit it was strange reading at first and a slightly different writing style that I am used to...but considering this book was written 1953....AMAZING! A book definitely before its time and can be truly applied and understood today. This is something I would definitely want my children to read!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I love the science fiction genre of books. This one tops my list of sci-fi stories.I first heard of Ray Bradbury in sixth grade with a short story called \\"All Summer in a Day\\". I loved the story so I looked for other books by him. I found this one in a bookstore and even though the price was high I bought it.It was worth it. I finished it in a matter of hours, as it was well-written with a very interesting plot. Having that special Bradbury touch was a great bonus."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This timeless classic speaks to what can happen as life continues to speed out of control. Censorship runs rapid as people seek to become more efficient. The phrase \\"take time to smell the roses\\" has been obliterated as these people would only recognize a rose as a colored blur as they speed through their lives. It is a story of one man, full of hope, listening to his heart as he figures out that there is a sense of purpose for all of us. Originally published in 1950 under the title \\"The Fireman,\\" this story has stood the test of time."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I cannot stress enough how this work is a priceless asset to our social community. Along with helping our society to protect our right of free press it continues to alert many of us to the necessity of books. Sure, with free press we also got some filth floating around, yet you're free to not read those, as you are absolutely free to read this and the many others of invaluable worth. We are humans, we are not perfect and we may have already taken turns we could have avoided. (Like maybe way back when, we should have chosen the steam car option instead of the gas one. Think about it, take the same years of innovation that we invested in the gas car and, well, by now we would have gotten that steamer to go pretty fast too.) But here we are and it's best to continue with our best foot forward. Books like this one, like 1984 and like Utopian Reality are not only entertaining, but also very instrumental in helping us decide the best foot to step out on. It's a comfort to know authors like Bradbury, took that difficult trip to examine the future and then presented it to us, so we can simply make the decision; well this is a road we don't want to take. Without the commotion and concern created from Fahrenheit 451, where do you think we would be right now? Well a good chance is, you wouldn't be reading this at this exact moment cause books that question our societies future would have been banned."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ok. I read Fahrenheit 451, and I have to say that I should have read it earlier. The story encased in this bound grouping of parchment is a warning to the societies of today against censorship and ignorance, which I really enjoyed.The book takes place somewhere in the 21st Century, and revolves around a man named Guy Montag, who is a fireman, but not of the conventional sense. The government of the story's time is one of ignorance and arrogance. It boasts several nuclear wars and a ban against books, which is where the firemen come into play; whereupon books are found, the firemen appear soon afterwards.The entire line of events surrounding Guy and his job is very interesting and thought-provoking, lined with intellectual discussions concerning firemen, the ban, and the emotional detachment to most other people that is sported by the entire population of the country.The conclusion of this book is surprising, and highlights a miniscule but hardy population of intellectuals living outside the public eye, just waiting for the opportunity to bloom in a society wiped clean by their own conceit and cruelty. Plus, it's nice to think that, even in a world full of lies and spite, intelligence and compassion can still survive, even if it's only in a brilliant literary work.At around 179 pages long, Fahrenheit 451 is a fairly easy read, as well as a powerful one. I was able to finish it up on a ferry ride to Victoria, and then still had time to sit around and chew on pocky for the rest of the trip. You should read this book, it's very good."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In my opinion Ray Bradbury has written some of the best Science Fiction of the age. His use of language is versatile and poetic, his stories are intriguing and intelligent, and this one is no exception.Like all the best science fiction writers, Bradbury is not just talking about the future. His book is a message for today. It is an error to think that Bradbury is talking here about censorship and control in the manner of, say, 1984. In fact Bradbury is more concerned with a hedonistic society with an increasingly short attention span as we are spoon fed what we need to know through sound bites and adverts.Bradbury is making a case for the reading of books to enhance critical thinking, and to allow us to understand the bigger picture. He was worried about how television was eroding the reading of literature - and he was rightly worried.This book is a powerful statement, and a good read. Classic Ray Bradbury."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is a quick read, but nonetheless powerful. Montag's world mirrors our own in many ways. The parlor walls=LCD TV's. The seashell radios=constantly being preoccupied with our iPods/cell phones. Even the dog, man's 'best friend' is replaced by a mechanical hound. In Montag's world, people have become mechanized and conditioned to become mindless, selfish consumers of entertainment to the point of losing their humanity. Montag's got an itch to scratch, and it's interesting to note that he had already begun his journey out of the cave well before he met Clarisse McLellan as the book begins, so when did the initial spark actually happen? He relates his story of how he met the man in the park (Faber), so Clarisse was really just a catalyst in his transformation. Many themes are explored in this book: censorship, individuality, literacy, illiteracy, suicide, man vs. society and many more. This was required reading while I was in high school, a time when cell phones were much less ubiquitous and iPods non-existent. At the time, I understood the story, and we analyzed the book in class perfunctorily, but re-reading the book myself through the years, I've come to appreciate its themes and relevance. I smile every time I see it in Barnes & Noble at the summer reading table, along with the other classics. I'm jealous of whomever is reading it for the first time because I'll never again get to experience that genuine shock when that salamander stops at Montag's own home. It would be a shame if Fahrenheit 451 wasn't required reading in high school these days."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I mainly bought this book to read it in a plane (a 14 hours trip, and for some reason, I rarely sleep in an airplane). However, I couldn't sleep that day not because I usually don't sleep in airplanes, but because this book was THAT good. It's surprising how close to reality the narrative is. For today, people worship their TV's and laptops. The book is well written; the author utilized metaphors, similes and other writing techniques to create the dark, desperate atmosphere of the unnamed city and its people.I really enjoyed reading this book. If you want a dark, short, great novel, this is the perfect choice. However, be warned, the extensive use of similes and metaphors might confuse you (I had to re-read several paragraphs due to their complex structure.)"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have heard that some people refuse to read books which have not been around for at least 30 years, having proven their ability to stand the test of time. In reading Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury* I came to understand this reasoning. I read the 50th anniversary edition and as I delved into it, I found myself shocked to have never read this igniting book before. It has been said that books are so patient they will at times wait centuries for the right reader to come along and bring them to life once again.\\"Cram them full of noncombustable data, chock them so damned full of \`facts' they feel stuffed, but absolutely \`brilliant' with information. Then they will feel they're thinking, they'll get a sense of motion without moving. And then they'll be happy...\\"Books such as Into the Shallows: What the Internet is Doing to Our Brains and Fahrenheit 451 though they were written years apart are trying to raise awareness that we are losing something. We hear everywhere about how education is going downhill, literacy at an all time low. These are all red flags to show the dangerous path our culture is headed down. We must listen! It's time to wakeup as individuals, and not settle for the status quo, there is such a richness we are missing in the power of reading, because we feast on momentary delights.Fahrenheit 451 is a book for book lovers, educators, and parents. Each of us has the power to influence someone in our lives and one of the most important areas which we must encourage others in is literacy. Today we live in a culture which is being robbed of literacy and creativity by lulling simplistic entertainment and never ending noise coming through such mindnumbing channels as TV, social media, gaming, internet surfing, etc. \\"Then- motion pictures in the early twentieth century. Radio. Television. Things began to have mass...And because they had mass, they became simpler.\\"Oh, I am not pointing any fingers at anyone but myself, lately I have seen that if I do not intentionally guard my life and invest it wisely, I look back to realize that it has slipped through my fingers like water yet produced no nothing lasting.\\"This age thinks better of a gilded fool than a threadbare saint in wisdom's school.\\" - Thomas DekkerSo be revolutionary, unique, eccentric, radical, unsatisfied and pick up a book! Because your thirst will drive you to wells more deep than what you have experienced. Allow reading to take you on a journey of awakening, it may give you a glimpse of the something more you have been longing for.* I definitely recommend the 50th Anniversary version, because for those who love to know the story behind the story there is an afterward written by Bradbury, as well as an interview and some other goodies."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have read Fahrenheit 451 several times, and it is one of my favorite novels. Its censorship themes seem just as relevant today as they did in the 1950s. In Fahrenheit 451, some books deemed illegal, and firemen are responsible for tracking down and burning every last copy.The U.S. government's efforts to stop Wikileaks reminded me of Bradbury's firemen. Federal agencies went through extreme measures to attempt to stop or slow the release of classified documents. I was also reminded of Fahrenheit 451 when the Pentagon arranged to buy every copy of Army Reserve Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer's memoir \\"Operation Dark Heart\\" before they could reach the shelves.I would like to ask Bradbury, do you think current censorship policies are on the verge of reaching Fahrenheit 451 levels?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Because of the current usage of terms taken from classic dystopian novels - Big Brother, Fahrenheit 9/11, etc - I had stayed away from such novels. I wasn't interested in what I thought would be whiny books about the government and the authority.Thank God, I was wrong.*Fahrenheit 451* is a true masterpiece. Known as science-fiction, it's much more, because the world Bradbury depicts shares some striking similarities with ours, and, considering the time Bradbury wrote it, one can only bow to his sense of foresight.*fahrenheit 451* is somewhere between *1984* and *Brave New World*. It combines elements from both dystopias and does something very clever with it. Instead of having a dystopia imposed from the top down, Bradbury creates a more subtle world with shades of grey. The result is a much more believable universe, which we can already recognise in our very own, current world. And that's the freaky part.The writing per se is rich, poetic, never pointless, always efficient. Everything counts, not one page for nothing. It has all the elements of a good short story - which it started as - combined with the dimensions of a novel. It's still a relatively short novel, at 200 pages or so, but that doesn't matter one bit. Bradbury's prose is terrific.I can only recommend this novel to anyone. Whether you're into sci-fi or not seems beside the point with this book; if you like sci-fi, for all the good reasons, then you should love it, and if you don't care about sci-fi, you should still love it. It may even make you appreciate sci-fi if you never did before.This novel is deep, well-crafted, and philosophical. It's one of those books you feel has truly given you something valuable."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Imagine living in a world in which you are so disconnected from other people that you spend your waking hours in your parlor surrounded on all sides by your TV \\"family\\". You sleep at night with ear buds whispering sweet nothings in your ear. There's a war going on and world-wide economic problems, but you don't notice. In fact, you don't want to notice because that would upset you. You don't read books because that might upset you too. You don't talk to people or even think because that too might upset you. So you spend your time amidst the flashing lights in your parlor or speeding 100 miles an hour down the road - anything that distracts you from anything upsetting.This is the world Guy Montag lives in, is part of and actively enforces. He is a \\"fireman\\" - one who starts fires rather than putting them out. When the alarm goes off, he races to the scene and glories in the smell of kerosene and the power of his igniter. He is merely protecting people from danger - the danger of books. He feels triumphant as he watches them flutter like dying birds amidst the flames. Life is good. He is happy.Or is he? The first clue is that Montag seems to be the only one who doesn't like the Mechanical Hound so much. But his \\"happiness\\" really starts to unravel when he meets Clarisse McClellan, a girl who's \\"seventeen and crazy\\". She does really odd things like take walks, look at the stars, talk to people. She asks Montag if it's true that firemen used to put out fires? Nah, couldn't be.Montag is irritated and infuriated by her, but still drawn to her, awakened by her. Then one day she's gone and Montag's world is never the same. He's haunted by a fire in which a woman was burned - chose to burn herself - along with her books. He secretly steals a book from the fire. Actually, his hands have been doing that all along, but he's never let his mind know it. Montag becomes drawn to - obsessed by - books. He tries to share them with his wife, Mildred, but the more he reaches out, the more she retreats to the parlor \\"family\\" to soothe her distress. He's going to ruin her happiness. Montag secretly turns to the one person left who might help him - or at least hear him. A old professor he met once, actually talked to.Of course, nothing that Montag does is actually secret. His Fire Chief, Beatty, knows the anguish Montag is going through. He tries to explain it all to Montag. How books cause insecurity and conflict. How they conflict with each other and are, ultimately, empty. How people are better off - happier - without them. How the people themselves wanted the books banned and burned. Beatty tries to teach Montag a lesson and then give him the opportunity to return to the fold. But the fabric is already rent, and things unravel as they inevitably must.This book is remarkably prescient for having been written in 1953. Not only does Bradbury accurately predict the invention of large-screen TVs that can be hung on a wall and personalized entertainment systems that can be plugged directly into one's ears, but he predicted much of the dystopian society we now live in. Wars, famine and economic crises are erupting all over the world, but we're more concerned about our \\"family\\" - Lindsay Lohan, Britney Spears, the Palins, among others. People are going hungry, but all is right with the world so long as we can have our SUVs and iPhones.\\"Fahrenheit 451\\" isn't so much about government censorship. Sure, the Firemen operate under the auspices of the government, but it's a democratic government. The government operates on behalf of the people. It is the people who have demanded the suppression of knowledge because it is messy, unsettling and \\"unhappy\\". The people don't want to be roused from their pleasurable bubble of overstimulation. True thought and relatedness - and the pauses and silences necessary for them - are far more threatening than being \\"comforted\\" (controlled) by a benign authoritarian government.Nevertheless, \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" optimistically predicts a world in which, if enough people can hold on to enough shreds of the knowledge contained in books and passed down generation to generation, eventually the cycle of destroying knowledge as threatening will cease. Wisdom will eventually permeate enough of the world to be able to withstand the destructive forces of fear and ignorance. I'd like to share Bradbury's optimism, but I'm not sure I can. Within my lifetime I've seen education devalued and ignorance celebrated. Wisdom may win out in the end, but I fear our civilization will face the same end as Montag's before that happens.But aw, heck, let's talk about something important. When does the next \\"Dancing with the Stars\\" begin?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Very well-written science fiction from 1950. Despite being written before the explosion of modern technology, Bradbury's book-burning story makes many timeless observations about censorship and the suppression of original thought and personal interaction.Bradbury's seashells as earbuds and the parlors with surrounding interactive screens are hardly a stretch to imagine if you have ever competed with an iPod or a flat screen for another person's attention.SPOILER ALERTDespite many hopeless characters and some violent destruction, the ending is optimistic as Montag and his hideout professors devise a way to preserve the classics."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is the second time I've read this book, and it's even more engaging than I remember.

I will plan to read more Bradbury in the future."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Burn it! \\"Any problem that you have can be burned away!\\" These were the lies that Guy Montag had been told ever since he came out of high school to be a fireman. But, these fireman are differerent than the fireman of today, they burn books and the houses they are found in.Guy's life was virtually the same old routine: stay at the fire house, alarm goes off, drive out to burn the place to the ground, go home and rest, do it again tomorrow. That is until he meets this 17 year old girl, Clarisse, who teaches him of a life outside of the rut. A life besides burning everything that you are called to burn. A time where books are not burned, but cherished. This lesson sends Montag into a spiraling argument inside of himself. The more that he meets with Clarisse, a side of him shows that he didn't even know existed, and Guy begins to grow curious about what books are really like to read.I love this masterful creation by Bradbury. The beginning is very slow and confusing to understand but the ending keeps you waiting for more. This book is perfectly written as to set you up with background information and then pour on the action towards the end. I highly recommend this book for higher level readers looking for an intellegent thrill ride."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I started reading Fahrenheit 451 for a summer reading assignment.

This story takes place in the United States in the distant future on the brink of another war. The main character of this story is named Guy Montag. Montag is a third generation fireman, which means that instead of trying to put out fires, his job is to start them. Books have been outlawed and anyone in possession of one can be punished by law. The fireman's job is to go around and respond to calls about reported book sightings and burn them. Due to the lack of books, the entire nation has turned completely to television and radio. Montag had been completely happy with his life until he met Clarisse McClellan, a peculiar seven-teen year old girl. Clarisse opens Montag eyes to the beauty of the simple things in life such as nature. Clarisse asked Montag the question, \\"are you happy?\\" This caused Montag to realize that he was not at all happy or satisfied with his life. Clarisse was killed by a speeding car soon after. Montag's problems increase when his wife, Mildred Montag, attempts to kill herself with sleeping pills, and when Montag was attempting to persuade an old lady to leave the house that they were going to burn, the lady started herself on fire and burned alive. Montag begins to try and turn to books for answers, but is unable to make sense of them. For this reason he turns to Faber, an English professor who, Mildred knows, has a strong passion for his books. Mildred decides to plant books in the houses of fellow firemen so to discredit the reputation of the profession. Later at work Mildred receives a call, which is made from his house. His wife had betrayed him and his boss, Captain Beatty, forced him to burn down his house. After he did this, Mildred was going to be arrested, so instead of going quietly he turned on his boss with his flamethrower and burnt him alive. After knocking out the rest of the police force that was present and destroying the mechanical hound Mildred had to run. Faber told him how to evade the new mechanical hound and that he should follow the railroad tracks until he finds the hobo intellectuals. Mildred successfully reaches the intellectuals and meets their leader Granger. Granger explains that the intellectuals are a group of book lovers that are all over the country and they hope to help mankind with their knowledge in the aftermath of the war. Shortly after enemy fighters flew in and dropped their bombs and nearly incinerated the entire city. One particular thing that I appreciated was the comment that Granger made about human kind where he compares human kind to a phoenix, and says that they keep rising up from their own ashes. Overall, I felt that this was a fairly good book. It definitely has some action pact scenes, but what I also enjoyed was that the whole idea that TV, radio, computers, and other forms of media are in a way taking control of our lives. This argument can be made now days, even though not to that extreme. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in science fiction books."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If you are a high-school student, this would be a stunner, but to anyone with a little more life experience and a shred of political awareness, the book comes across as dated, patronizing and condescending."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a great book to read but deadly to listen to on the CD. Ray Bradbury reads in expressionless monotony. I tried to listen to the first CD five times and finally gave up. Stick with the book where you can supply your own voices."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Watch tv, sheeple.In the future, books are banned, and drugs and the good old electronic screen are used to keep the population docile and uninformed. Firemen don't put out fires here, they burn books when they are found, in a big macho showy way. One such bloke begins to have doubts about his occupation and society, and breaks away."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I am frustrated by the sloppiness of this book. From what I understand, Bradbury sat in a library and wrote it in a few weeks, and it shows. Montag is introduced as a man happy in his job. The meeting with Clarisse blows his mind! But then Bradbury throws in numerous details indicating that his dissatisfaction has been mounting for some time. Although Montag is purportedly of a divided mind, the development of his character is very abrupt and unconvincing. But why develop what is essentially a mouthpiece for your own ranting? Blech. Bradbury's ideas have come to fruition in our time, but, ironically, his own work is not literature at all. I do not understand why this work is lauded as a classic."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is pretty good, except it is definitely very advanced.

I dont know how you could enjoy this book. People just talk to talk in this book. Its about a guy named montage that is a firefighter. He burns things instaed of putting fires out. He meets a wierdo girl who talks nonsense, this guy starts to think what hes doing starts reading books and gets caught. He then has to burn his books. He doesnt want to go to jail so he Runs away."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I struggled through this book. If I hadn't had to read it for school, I would have dropped it immediately.

This is a horrible book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Hey A reader from MISSOURI, I hear you. This book makes no sense what so ever and i had to read it for school. I have no idesa just how in the world a book this horrible could have stayed around for 40 years!!! I have talked to everyone I know and they all read the first 5 pages and immeadiatly hated it. THey rented the movie and watched some of it so they won't have to read it, and it was verbatum, and guess what...it was even worse than the book! I do reccomend this book to all of you...well only if you want to find out how terrible books can get or you want to find out what type of flammable liquid burns better on books!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This small book starts off nicely with a \\"Fireman\\" name Montag walking down the street. This takes place in the future where books are banned, and fireman set fires to houses with books. It's a world where the government controls everything, and people are content watching television. As Montag walks he encounters a strange girl. A inquisitive teenager who tends to slowly open Montag's eyes to the life that himself and the government has tried to prevent him from seeing.However, the book goes downhill from there. We later learn that the girl died, maybe or maybe not by the government. Then all forms of subtlety are thrown out the window. Montag burns a lady and her house down, but only after picking up a few books. He starts a conversation with a former literature professor, who discusses how the government and people disengaged themselves from the world of literature, and how to change their thinking. The worst part was when his fire chief enters his house and gives the typical bad guy expose to the good guy on what the government is trying to do. This dialogue is extremely forced and contrived and quickly bores the reader along while taking away much of the imagination of the what and why.He later kills that fireman and goes on the run after his house burns down, only to be left in a the countryside as a survivor, and tries to resurrect the world of books and open thinking. This again overtly ties into an over the top message on the good of literature and open-mindedness.For those who value subtlety and imagination, this book is not for you. While I respect and admire Bradbury's plot and perspective, it could have been done in a much more presentable, believable, thought provoking, and by far more engaging way."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read the book Fahrenheit 451 for English class and was not impressed with the way the story was written. In general, the book is about censorship. It is the story of a society where books are outlawed because the lead to conflicting points of view, offend minorities, and cause confusion. Firefighters have the job of finding 'criminals' who are hiding books in thier homes and burn the books.I found this book to be boring and unexciting. There was very little description and this led me to be confused about several parts of the book. A few of the repeated aspects of the story were never fully described which led me to be unsure of what exactly they were. For example, the seashell radio that Montag's wife Mildred uses. A little more description would have made me understand more clearly, what it did and said. I was also confused about what the 'family' was that Mildred and her friends were constantly watching on the wall. These details of the story made me lose interest in the book. I also think that the reason for banning books was not made extremely clear. More solid reasons should have been given, other than the vague explanations.Another fact that I found annoying was that houses were fireproofed in this society. That is why firemen as we know them were not needed any longer. Therefore, it seems to me that the firemen in the book should not have been able to burn the houses of the people hiding books.The most exciting and best part of the book came at the end when Montag had escaped from his old world and was living with intellectuals away from civilization. Montag and his new friends survive an attack during a war and set out to rebuild the world. Although this book ended better than it began, I do not recommend it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"this is very dissapointing, cause after all i heard about the book i thought it suppose to be a masterpiece, but after reading it i discoverd that the writing is very poor, the story is bery weak, and the plot is dull.i think the book lost most of it's taste - a similat book like 1984 is more prefferd to read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The novel 'Fahrenheit 451\` written by Ray Bradbury and published in 1953 takes place in a futuristic dystopian society. The totalitarian state forbids books and most of the people don't question it or offer no resistance. Guy Montag, the main character of the novel, is one of the firemen, who have the assignment to burn books. Until he witnesses, that an old woman wants to die with her books, Guy Montag doesn't question any orders and even likes his job, but after that experience he begins to think about the meaning and power of literature/books and history.The novel 'Fahrenheit 451\` shows, what kind of terrible things censorship can do to a society and the importance of free speech. We need to think for ourselves and never accept everything. The author maybe wanted to express a warning through this novel about a society we might have to live in some day. I think this novel is suitable for school reading, because it includes important topics which can be discussed well in class with a teacher, although I didn't really enjoy reading it. It's not a book I would like to read in my freetime, but in class there might be interesting topics to think and discuss about."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury has set forth some interesting ideas and prophecies in this book but as far as entertaining and suspensful goes I would give it about an &quot;F&quot; grade. It squeeks two stars."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have infinite patience when I am personally pretentious, self-absorbed, and dull. I don't have the same patience when I read books that are that way, though.The story is about a futuristic world where knowledge, thought, and argument have been banished in favor of momentary happiness, thrill, and pleasure. The protagonist, Guy Montag, is a fireman. In the future, instead of fighting fires, they are in charge of lighting them. They are the front line defense for society against the societal decay caused by books, so their job is to go around burning down the houses of those who own and read books. Montag, at some point, realizes the importance of books and instantly becomes an enemy of the state, a target of the same department that he worked for.One problem with this book is in the fact that Bradbury can't create a realistic world in which these events could become a reality. Granted, he was writing 50 years ago, so he wouldn't have had knowledge of the type of entertainment which exists today, but all he seems able to conjure up is the concept of immediate, personalized entertainment as if that is the only type of entertainment that would remain. He creates a world (or just a city, because this type of environment only seems to exist in the city) where people are zombies sitting in their homes surrounded by television screens that are running all the time telling the people what they should think and feel. Conceptually he wasn't wrong, it's just his clumsy handling of the telling. He can't create a solid series of steps that lead from the present day to that future (though he tries). He can't recreate the sort of television show that these people would watch, and he can't explain clearly why anyone would want to watch it.Beyond the setting, the characters themselves are one-dimensional. They are all archetypes, and none have the spark of life which would make them interesting. Clarisse, the dangerous intellectual adolescent; Montag, the newborn Man whose eyes have recently been open; Faber, the reluctant wise man; Beatty, the hardened symbol of the State, who is a very capable parry to the thrusts of Faber; none of the characters have any depth whatsoever.The writing itself was a pain to read. Bradbury can't seem to figure out which word he needs to use, so he opens a thesaurus and dumps as many words as he can onto the page. In addition, he wanders off on tangents without bringing those tangents back to the main storyline. Furthermore, his dire need to make his point (a panoply of ideas is good, not bad) by either having the characters themselves soliloquize it, or by doing it himself in wandering, dull monologues. This is the sort of self-absorption I allude to in the title to this review.To drive home the fact that Bradbury thinks he's God's gift to knowledge, the afterword and coda and interview with the author leave nothing to the imagination. According to Bradbury himself, he's got tons of ideas of how to make the story better. None of those ideas have to do with improving the writing, just making each character's monologue longer. He claims to refrain from adding those updates to this edition of the book (50th anniversary edition) because he feels the original text, as the author wrote it, is pristine and perfect. His contempt for editors is plainly spelled out at various places in the tacked-on content.I really can't recommend this book to anyone who has already graduated from high school. The story is poor. The writing is poor. The author's point is all it's got of value, and even that is nothing special. It may be helpful to know the character of Guy Montag in case it ever comes up in conversation, but other than that, I can't think of any reason to spend time with this book. 2 stars"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I had to read this book for school. I know it has been marked a classic, but i found it incredably boring and a overdone. I thought it was overrated. I can read trashy entertaining books, but i also read classics. I only like to read the trash, or the entertainment when i know its trash or entertainment. I found the characters in the book shallow (Like Clarisse) and under developed. It was too bland and meaningless for what people make of it. And the phoenix metaphor at the end? That was a chiche. I wouldn't say this is a bad book, i mean its fairly well written, but i found 1984, which had a similar cautionary note to it and was also a Dystopian novel much more meaningful."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I can see why so many people like the works of Ray Bradbury. He is a very effective story teller, he has a particular talent for building vivid imagery with few words (his \\"less is more\\" style is DEFINITELY a winner) and he is able to take very important, very relevent modern themes and inject them into his stories. In this story, we see how Bradbury has taken aim at the world of electronic media as an advancement that very well may, over time, become the downfall of mankind.So why did I only give him three stars? Two reasons: (1) While Bradbury is long on imagery, in this book he's short on character development. It works well with the protagonist's wife because Bradbury created her to be shallow and indifferent, but what about the young neighbor girl who was so intriguing and just disappeared one day, with no explanation at all? As for the protagonist and his \\"boss,\\" their characters weren't developed to the point where I cared for them either way. In order for a novel-length story to be a good one, you have to have at least one character that you identify with or get emotionally attached to, and that doesn't happen here. (2) As in \\"The Martian Chronicles,\\" Bradbury puts his dystopian society to an end by dropping the big bomb on it, leaving the small band of survivors to go on to -- what? Sorry; end of story.

It was terribly disappointing--lots of hype over a cheesy science-fiction novel. There are two major problems with it. One is poor language usage--lousy descriptive word choices, lousy metaphors and similes that make inappropriate comparisons--and two, not enough attention paid to societal problems that give rise to things like book burning in the first place: the threat of the individual to the group; government control over the sheep-like masses; the modern epidemic of people's lack of interest in anything intellectual; the timeless epidemic of a fear of anything that goes against group mentality or upsets the status quo, and so on. Bradbury touches on some of these issues, but leaves them largely undeveloped."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a futuristic novel that depicts a haunting totalitarian society that practices censorship and destroys individual thought. The book follows fireman Guy Montag, whose job it is to start fires to burn homes with books rather than put out fires. After Montag has conversations with an old English professor and a young girl named Clarisse who both have the rare gift of being able to think for themselves, Montag begins to question his life. He realizes that there is something missing and that he is greatly unhappy, and he feels that whatever he is missing can be found in the books. In a since, he is write. Montag begins to realize the importance of ideas and things such as books, and decides to try to change the ways of his society.Bradbury clearly paints a terrorizing image in the reader's mind of this all-powerful, brain-washing society. Through his strong use of metaphors, the reader is able to better understand the complex feelings and emotions of the characters that would otherwise be difficult to describe. The division of the book helps the reader watch the main character, Montag, progress and develop. The first part focuses on his realization that he is empty and lacking something, and he starts to realize just what he's missing. In the second part, he discovers the importance of the books(ideas) and why he and society are empty without them. The third part focuses on his attempt to create change.Fahrenheit 451 is a well-written, thought-provoking novel that gives society a warning about censorship and losing individual thought that should not be ingonored."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Mr. Bradbury's prophetic work has come to pass in the politically correct world of thought controlled by political expediency and special interests.Enter a day when words and thoughts that might offend are banned. If ignorance is bliss we should never be happier. Few books of fiction speak so clearly to our political and social climate of today. Would somebody please memorize this book? It too may be banned one day."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This somber book, with its theme of government-encouraged anti-intellectualism, was written during an age when \\"eggheads\\" were suspected of being subversive somehow, maybe even godless commies. This distrust of intelligence and non-conformity is taken to the extreme by Bradbury, with stark and memorable results. By discouraging education and all forms of intelligent discourse, the future government is able to control the population not merely by force or threats, but by providing an endless flow of mindless entertainment, which (nearly) everyone happily accepts. Like sheep before the slaughter, the placated citizenry of Fahrenheit 451 simply doesn't know any better than to believe what the government pronounces at face value. This perverse form of \\"mind control\\"- enforced by keeping minds happily engaged in only the most trivial of pursuits- works only too well, since it is far easier to remain ignorant than struggle to form an opposing opinion that might require courage to express. And by burning the last remaining learning tools that threaten its empire- books- the government tries to erase the possibility that anyone could stir an uprising based on ancient philosophical principles such as democracy, liberty, and self-determination.Ignorance becomes not only bliss, but a frightening way of life.Bradbury is one of the original \\"Golden Age\\" science fiction writers, and that shows in this book. There's the element of the fantastic in the everyday gadgets here, more speculation and wonder that science. For this reason, it doesn't quite have the realistic edge that most mainstream fiction has, although the philosophical themes in the book elevate it to mainstream status.

Tolkein. (And yes, i understand, you can't compare the two) Fahrenheit 451 is filled to the brim with metaphors and things that seem so outlandish, that they fit with the whole aura of the novel. Now, even though, it is a very small novel, it packs a very lasting punch.According to the world(it might be our world in the future) that Bradbury created, the U.S. and possibly everyone else, hes become so automated that the people had no use for knowledge anymore! Thus, books were for burning. Thus, the title Fahrenheit 451 (the degree that paper burns). Also, the reason that books were burnt was that there were conflicting ideas in them.Ray Bradbury has created this horribly believable and yet extremely frightening FUTURE for the United States, in my opinion! Also, ity deals very slightly with the effects of war, and the fact that ALL other countries hate the U.S. in the story.

The very beginning of the book requires patience. It takes some time to understand what is occuring. The book is absolutely worth the time and effort.

The story from Bradbury's imagination causes the reader to think... Why are books so important? Why is censorship dangerous? Why is the individual more important than the society? Why are mindless activities (such as television overdose) harmful and unprofitable? The author writes of treasures that our society takes for granted, and shows how these riches should be guarded and appreciated- not ignored.In the 50th anniversary edition of the book, the author writes an afterword about the different ways that books are \`burned' today. This censorship is not as evident as the censorship depicted in the story of Montag, but it is still happening. Bradbury suggests that political correctness has served as a censor to art. Authors and readers alike are afraid of offending someone, therefore art has been reduced to little more than People magazines and reality TV shows. Bradbury writes that it is difficult for \\"any author who dares to speak above a whisper or write above a nursery rhyme.\\" Also included at the end of the book is an interview with Ray Bradbury. This is an excellent 10-pages of interaction with the author.Will censorship ever get as radical as what happened to Montag? I doubt it. But the story is fun, and the reader should put the book down with a new respect for thinking, learning and freedom."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book Fahrenheit 451 written by Ray Bradbury was in the Science Fiction section and was located in the future. Guy Montag was a fireman, but in the future they do not put out fires, they they start them. Guy is trying to figure out his hard and confusing life in the future. When he meets a girl named Clarisse McClellan who changes everything and gives him a new point of view of the world.What I like most about this book was the setting and the time, the future makes you wonder about what you're living in now and what might happen in the future. What I didn't like about the book was that it was a little hard and confusing at times for my age reading.My favorite charater in this book was Clarisse McCellan because she has such a different mind than everyone else and sees things in different perspectives. A paragraph that meant something to me was on page 37 and said \\"Books bombarded his shoulders, his arms, his upturned face. A book lit, almost obediently, like a white pigeon, in his hands, wings fluttering. In the dim light, a page flung open and it was like a snow feather, the words delicately painted thereon.\\" It meant something to me beacause all of these books around him makes him wonder about his job, life, and Clarisse and what she had said.I would tell someone about this book that it is great but to read it at a good reading level. So it's not too hard or confusing to read. The only question I have after reading this is, in some ways is Beatty the villan of Station 451? My strongest reason for recommending this book is that it describes each pararaph beautifully and has a great plot."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I became interested in Ray Bradbury and his works ever since my freshman English teacher assigned me to read \\"The Sound of Summer running\\". Bradbury's usage of imagery allowed me to really get into his other short stories. I immediately had an interest for the book as soon as I read the first page; the way Ray Bradbury created a visual image in my mind lead me to continue reading to the very end.Fahrenheit 451 is about Guy Montag, a fireman in a futuristic world where he and his fellow firemen start fires, rather than put them out; however his whole way of thinking is put into question after meeting a strange girl who lives on his block. Ray Bradbury creates a situation where the main character (Montag), after discovering the knowledge books bring, has a desire to be heard with his ideas expressed. \\"I just want someone to hear what I have to say. And maybe if I talk long enough, it'll make sense\\" (81). Guy Montag can be described as a person who relies on others for support and direction. Guys' new way of thinking is challenged by the fire chief, Beatty, who tries to return Guy back to ignorance like the rest of the world, trying to convince Montag to burn his books. \\"Its real beauty is that it destroys responsibility and consequences\\" (115). After a long internal struggle within his own mind Montag comes to a decision that ultimately changes him. No longer does he rely on others and follow what they say, Guy Montags' knew found knowledge gives him an independent growth. \\"I don't want to change sides and just be told what to do. There's no reason to change if I do that\\" (93).I agree with other costumer review when they write things like \\"wonderful and still relevant\\", \\"wonderful book\\", and \\"short classic\\". The book in itself is a very interesting view on society and it is truly a short but still entertaining book. Touching on many key issues in our own society while putting them in a creative twist I can understand why many people gave this book such a high rating.In conclusion this book was fascinating with great characters and an even greater storyline. Though many people may not like this story, I found it to have an excellent plot and I felt Bradbury put amazing imagery within the text. I recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of Ray Bradbury and even if you're not a fan I would still highly recommend this book to someone who wants an exciting and interesting novel to read.TJHS 12th grade student"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have long been a fan of the 1965 film \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" which is based on this 1953 Ray Bradbury novel. The two are only somewhat similar which makes reading the novel and seeing the film well worth your while. This novel paints a dystopian view of the future...a society where books are banned because of the way they make people feel. Bradbury imagines a world where people are drawn to video images on the screen (how hauntingly predictable!) and a government which has strangled creativity and original thinking. Guy Montag, a fireman, is a government \\"agent\\" whose job requires him to destroy by fire books wherever they can be found. He meets a young woman and is suddenly challenged by feelings he has long since suppressed. He begins to read some of the books seized and this sets him on a collision course with the government and his superiors. This is compelling reading and I think the reader will be satisfied with the resolution both on the film and in the novel...they are somewhat different. This gets my highest recommendation!Fahrenheit 451: A Novel"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"American writers are knows for their ability to write short but brilliant literature, and this gem is no exception. Even today Bradbury's writing still has bite, and the themes are still relevant."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"\\"What do we want in this country, above all? People want to be happy, isn't that right?\\"Guy Montag is a fireman in an American city of the future. However, with all of the buildings fireproofed, Guy spends his time burning the one thing that cannot be allowed in society - books. He enjoys his work, the purification of civilization by fire, but something is missing. When he meets a new neighbor girl, Clarisse, he realizes that it's something that has been done away with - the idea of thought.Clarisse opens Montag's world to the fact that society as he knows it is useless. Citizens walk around numb, feeling and thinking nothing, over-stimulated and constantly seeking pleasure and happiness. There is no sadness, no discomfort of thought, no desire to be a better person. Ideas and thoughts have gone away with the books who carried their message, and silence has been replaced by constant noise and activity.It is this new-found knowledge that changes Montag's life. No longer content to simply exist, he begins stealing books from the homes he burns to see what all the fuss is about. And by gaining this illicit knowledge, he begins to make changes that will impact not only him but those around him.I must confess that I picked up \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" with no clue as to what it was about. Throughout, I was shocked at how much of the horror in the book has come to pass. Though it was written less than 60 years ago, our world has come to resemble the society in the book in many ways. We've started to absolve ourselves of all responsibility in life, and we will do nearly anything for pleasure. Though I enjoyed it at first read, I know it's one I'll have to dive into again and again to truly appreciate."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book was a real pleasue to read. With laws passed to limit rights, this novel certainly challenges the censorship that today's governments enforce. I would recommend this book to anybody, whether you know anything about the topic at hand or not."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451Ray Bradbury's novel, \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is a fascinating depiction of a world where books are banned and burned. It is a frightening vision of a fascist, future America where dissent and independent thought is discouraged. Supposedly, books conjure up to many feelings and questions; people are better off in ignorant bliss. Reading books is illegal. People are absorbed by huge televisions displaying mindless programming. Written in 1960, the novel is set around our time. In our alternate history, people stopped reading books, and humanities courses in college lost interest and were dropped. Society became ever more automic and fast-paced. War is ever-prevalent, as fighter jets are constantly heard, screeching across the sky. It is a picture of a society in decline.Our protagonist Guy Montag is a fireman whose job it is to seek out and destroy books. Houses are all made of brick now, so they can't burn. He meets a lovely, young lady who asks him questions and gets his mind thinking. In secret, he begins to keep and read some of the books and discovers a new world. He also meets an old man who used to be a humanities professor; he shows Montag his library and helps him to see things in a new light.This is an amazing classic novel. Its implications for our society are profound. People should slow down, stop being brainwashed by television, and open their mind to the world of books. This novel is intelligent, extremely well-written, and a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I'm not sure how I managed to gain a degree in English and never read this book. While watching Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, I was overcome with a desire to read the book when the Nazis were burning books. For years, whenever my college Christian group discussed book burning, I would accuse them of being Nazi Germany or mention this book under my breath. And, of course, I had never read it. However, after reading it, I was more right than I ever could have known . . .When I started this book, I fully expected some elaborate government coup to permanently do away with books as a way of citizen control. But I did not expect it to have originated with the people! In a society where people are focused on instant gratification and personal equality (similar to Harrison Bergeron), books are thrown by the wayside. Condensed down to small encyclopedia references, people can no longer need a college education to be up on the latest work of literature, like Shakespeare. However, seeing the pointlessness in that, books, which are about people who aren't even real, were replaced by \\"real\\" people in wall TVs.However, after the people decided to do away with books, the government saw a toehold and used it for their advantage. Reading the book really made me think more about what we put importance on. Look at all of the game shows on TV, the bigger and better entertainment systems we want, etc. We stopped asking why.Even though she did not have much time in the book, I loved Clarisse! She was a simple, beautiful, and delightful character! Just her presence and her refusal to accept life the way she was told made a huge difference in Montag's life. Her love to just talk and ask questions was pivotal in his development as a character.This book is really hard to explain. Bradbury dares his audience to think about things, talk, and not take everything at face value. This was an amazing book, and I challenge people to read it and not come away changed."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Best book about political correctness run amok ever written.It's short and sweet, and makes you think, if you are capable of thinking."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"What can one say about this sci-fi classic? Bradbury's writing is powerful and at times nerve wracking as he takes us through fireman Montag's conversion from a book burning drone to one who wants to read and preserve them. Through his almost stream of consciousness writing, his edgy use of adverbs which create powerful images, Bradbury builds the suspense and action at a breakneck speed. Bradbury is prophetic in characterizing how modern technology can turn humans into mindless, manipulated morons. The TV screens surrounding the typical home in the novel are eerily familiar to the way reality shows today envelop the minds of their viewers, making them obsess on meaningless and mindless things like which rich wife yelled at whom, while those in power create and manipulte the world for us for their own ends."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Even though this book was written 60 years ago it's amazing how much it still applies to today. In Montag's world books were not only banned but destroyed, burned to ashes along with the house they were held in and in many cases the people who hid them. The government says that books are silly and the words meaningless yet destroys them all proving that someone in authority firmly believes that a book is a dangerous thing. Which is actually what happens. Montag meets a girl who society deems 'crazy' and she puts a little thought in his head. Next thing he knows he is questioning why. Why he is a fireman. Why the books are so dangerous. Why Why Why. Questions that to maintain peace and balance should not be asked.Overall I found that I enjoyed this book despite it being totally different from what I am used to reading even though many times I had to read a paragraph over again because I missed some thing that ended up being important. I found Montag's discovery of himself and nature a bit hard to follow. His journey to discovery read a lot like descent into madness which I thought was hard at times to follow. I did like that this book was thought provoking and I plan to follow up with searching for some discussion web pages to see other people's interpretations. A book you definitely need to read at least once in your lifetime."},{"Title":"Marriage Works: Before You Say \\"I Do\\"","review":"Dads, Moms, Uncles, Aunts, and friends no longer need to talk themselves blue in the face warning their loved ones that their dreams of wedded bliss will soon become nighmares.

By taking the time early in the relationship to find out where your fiance or beloved is coming from it makes working out problems later much easier.

Both have \\"issues\\" with their current boyfriends and I could tell that some of the simple questions about possible future in laws and family upbringing of their potential spouses have given them pause. In the days when parents or match makers took on the role of \\"matching\\" partners for life, the kinds of questions this book makes one think about would have been asked and answered long before any commission was paid to the marriage broker.

During his tenure there he lectured extensivley on his wartime experiences which included first hand knowledge of the maneuver battles that had characterized the war against Russia and the earley stages of the war in the west. These lectures and two contemporaneously written articles on the U.S. Army and the Army of the Weimar Republic have been compiled into a remarkably provocative little book that should interest scholars and warriors alike.It is not surprising that many readers have likened &quot;Battle Leadership&quot; to Rommel's &quot;Infantry Attacks&quot;. Both books are exceptionly well written documents built on the experience of company grade German officers and designed to pass on lessons learned in blood. However, &quot;Battle Leadership&quot; differs from &quot;Attacks&quot; in its short proscriptive style. Where Rommel gives us a narrative of his war experience, Von Schell has highlighted five specific lessons each of which is explained in a short discussion of an actual combat experience:1. The effect of tempo on military planning after hostilities commence.2. The inaccuracy of nearly all intellegence at the commencement of hostilities.3. The use of the attack in gaining timely and accurate intelligence.4. The virtues and uses of veteran troops.5. The cultivation of bravery by personal example.For the most part Von Schell is restating-- albeit in his particularly lucid and accessible style-- truisms with which any well read militarist is familiar. However, in his analysis of two of these points he strikes out on somewhat novel ground.Von Schell's discussion of tempo and its effect on combat planning answeres a problem that has nettled young subalterns for decades; what is the point of writing long operations orders in peace if they will seldom if ever be used in the heat of battle? Von Schell suggests that the value of such orders lies as much in shaping the young officers mind as in providing him with a tool for combat:All armies of the world learn, in peace time,how to write beautifully constructed orders.I believe that it is correct to learn to thinkof everything and to forget nothing, butwe must never lose sight of the fact that,in a war of movement, our orders will bebrief and simple. PG 63-64Perhaps Von Schell's greatest piece of wisdom regards the collection of tactical intelligence. Noting that the only valuable intelligence is timely intelligence and linking this idea with the absolute requirment of keeping up the tempo of the offensive, the author writes, &quot;The best reconnaissance will always be the attack.&quot;If &quot;Battle Leadership&quot; has any weaknesses they can be easily seen and understood if we remind ourselves of the authors perspective. Von Schell's almost obsessive interest in the value and uses of combat hardened veterens-- while of little value to untried junior officers in command of equally untried troops-- is quite understandable when we recall that he was one of a generation of German soldiers who had survived three years of the most intense conflict in human history. Likwise, the authors preference for poor tactical security and dispersion measures can be overlooked if we recall that Von Schell learned his trade at a time when military thinkers were just beginning to develop dispersion and security as an answer to the machinegun and long range artillery fires.Indeed, it is in takeing a measure of the authors perspective that we begin to see the true importance of &quot;Battle Leadership&quot;. More than a handbook of infantry tactics, &quot;Battle Leadership&quot; is a remarkably personal and unintentional account of how the German experiance of the First World War forged the Wehrmacht of the Second"},{"Title":"Battle leadership;: Some personal experiences of a junior officer of the German Army with observations on battle tactics and the psychological reactions of troops in campaign,","review":"First of all if you are looking for this book contrary to what the used book sellers are telling you THIS BOOK IS NOT RARE OR HARD TO FIND!

While Bruce Moody's book cannot speak for all street beggars, it does provide a thoughtful and penetrating glimpse into the hidden world of the down and out. In reading this account, one must perforce give up the well-worn cliches and stereotypes about those inhabiting this netherworld. Moody's tale is one of raw adversity, yes, but also one of redemption.

It is impossible, because you now know that the next beggar you pass just might be another Bruce Moody. Bruce Moody breaks all the steretypes. This is perhaps the most honest book I've ever read, and Moody's willingness to share with readers his inner process is extraordinary. Most people would find the mere act of standing on a street corner begging for work or money utterly embarrassing, and indeed, Moody himself struggles mightily with shame. But Moody courageously shares everything: not just the doing of it, but his self-condemnation, his stereotyping judgments of passersby (who will give? who won't give?), his struggles with guilt, fear, rage -- all the demons. Rarely does one encounter such an act of generosity as this book represents, when an author shares so intimately with readers. Because of Bruce Moody's generosity and his willingness to put truth before ego, I am able to learn something rich and rare about the human condition, and about myself -- because I am that same human being and I have my own roadsides. Although I have never literally had to beg on a roadside, I found myself irresistably identifying with Moody in his self-discoveries: I, too, am prejudiced; I, too, try to control the people, places and things around me; I, too, have moments when I am merciless with myself and with others; I, too, desire God; I, too, wonder about the source and meaning of blessing.But most of all, I am glad I read this book for the hope it gives. If I am ever faced with a desperate situation, Bruce Moody will be there in the back of my mind, coaching. I read this book with a chilly spine, I'll tell you, for the prospect of losing your home and going begging is terrifying. But at the same time I read with a sense of adventure, wonder, and even joy. Joy? Yes, joy. That's where Bruce Moody ultimately takes his readers, straight into the realm of joy, right there in the most unexpected of places, along the roadside. To me, that's the greatest message of the book. It's the treasure buried in the field, and thank you Bruce for digging it up and sharing it with all of us.

It makes no difference whether you've agonized over the plight of beggars, as I have, or criticized them for being too picky in their job searches, as I also have. You will find Moody's experiences and soul searching powerful and interesting on several levels.Moody's memoir takes us into the mind and experiences of an honest senior citizen begging for work to stay afloat. His experience is not the result of a contrived, self-imposed literary or journalistic assignment but instead comes from his struggle to survive and keep his home. Political and intellectual motives can drive authors to concoct or artificially partake of experiences inorder to make points or satisfy intellectual curiosity, but such works lack the deep, poetic soul searching and humor of Moody's work.His memoir contains much more than temporal descriptions of financial and employment predicaments. It reveals Moody's deepest thoughts of optimism, self-doubt, prejudice, humility, spirituality, pride, desire, honesty, discipline and survival. It stays away from politicizing and intellectualizing the problems of homelessness and poverty in America, and instead focuses on people in their essence in face-to-face encounters. He doesn't confine his spiritual thoughts to an abstract world but lets them stand and sit freely with him by the roadside. People frequently surprised Moody while he begged, and me, too, as I read the book.Moody's writing style reflects the openness and honesty of his accounts. He is not constrained by rules of grammar. His writing is more akin to poetry and therefore better conveys his thoughts and emotions than prosaic, proper English. He knows what he's doing, though, and I'm not the only one who thinks so: in his memoir we learn The New Yorker and other prestigious magazines published other works of his years before his financial plight. We also learn about his great love of acting and his successful pursuit of work in theater and film.This memoir shows its author to be highly principled and disciplined. He strives to stick to his self-promises, such as writing about people who helped him while he begged. My only criticism is small and is related to this honoring: the last fourth of the book inspired me less and seemed a little bit like some sort of acknowledgement roll call, though not actually becoming perfunctory. But Moody promised he would acknowledge these people, and he does. I enthusiastically recommend &quot;Will Work for Food or $.&quot; Everyone should read it and every home library should have it. There is no other book quite like it."},{"Title":"Will Work for Food or $: A Memoir from the Roadside","review":"At the age of 60, Yale educated Bruce Moody was fired from his job in the Bay area and could not get another. As homelessness loomed, he took what he perceived as the only way out: he became a beggar. In the year he spent standing on the off-ramp of a major highway with a sign reading,&quot;Will Work for Food or $&quot; and blessing the cars as they passed, the task he had set himself, Moody had plenty of time to contemplate the most unlovely contents of his own mind. He confronted shame and regret and opinion-making and grandiosity and all the rest of the baggage with which we are all saddled. Again and again, he encountered bliss. People, he reports, treated him impeccably--and this includes the people, very few, who insulted,or bullied him. Moody ceased being a victim and became something else entirely, a wide-awake human being. This book is remarkable not only as the account of an eccentric and dignified spiritual journey but also as a masterpiece of elegant prose."},{"Title":"Will Work for Food or $: A Memoir from the Roadside","review":"At the age of 60, Bruce Moody found out the hard way that education from Yale and Columbia, published writing credits, a strong acting resume and years of work in the business world (as a contract employee) could not protect him from economic downturn. His struggle to keep a roof over his head, pay his bills, continue to develop and maintain his self-respect, and cope with his sister's serious illness, without burdening his family financially, is a story as suspenseful as anything by Ken Follett. Of interest to anyone, especially persons involved with human growth, spirituality, the arts, and any of us who've ever whizzed by those guys with the placards at freeway offramps, is this memoir. It details how, with fear and trepidation, Bruce Moody decided to trust his wellbeing to the kindness of strangers and stand by the roadside with the proverbial sign: &quot;Will work for food or $&quot;. His expectations and prejudices are shattered as he finds that his life is being supported by people he does not know and, in many cases, will never know. How he handles, with grace and spiritual insight, this radical shift in his living patterns, until he can locate steady work, is a fascinating and thought-provoking memoir. Highly recommended and quite unexpected."},{"Title":"Will Work for Food or $: A Memoir from the Roadside","review":"The devotion to detail, the honesty, the dignity, the humanity, the willingness to put a personal philosophy to the test-all these qualities come up roses in this book.On both levels, the level of person and the level of writer, the author seized the authentic moment of his reality and recognized the power that flows from his being able to totally accept and acknowledge himself, where he's at, and once able to do that with surprise, openness, a lack of bitterness, and an absorption in the moment, he's on your way."},{"Title":"Will Work for Food or $: A Memoir from the Roadside","review":"Ever wondered about those rumpled creatures scrambling for quarters at the side of the road, staring you down as you nervously wait for the light to change? This guy, down on his luck, not only took on the habitus of a scrounger but wrote a book about it. A prize winner at that. Congratulations to him for his forthright look at life at the side of the road. Readers will find humor, insight, and a refreshing bravado in this account of his time shoving plastic foam coffee cups under motorists' noses. The occasional lapses into self conscious lapidarian prose more suitable for headstones than curbstones can be forgiven. You won't be able to stop turning the pages."},{"Title":"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre Companion","review":"As far as I know, &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Companion&quot; is the only book entirely devoted to the legendary &quot;TCM&quot; series. That alone makes it an irresistible purchase to any hardcore fan of the original film. And those fans won't be entirely disappointed, since this book contains brand-new exclusive interviews with many cast and crew members, plus lots of photographs (all reproduced in B&amp;W) and dozens of trivial tidbits. Those of you who are diehard &quot;Chainsaw&quot; fanatics -- and you know who you are -- go ahead and buy it. It's not expensive, and you will learn a thing or two about the films.However, judged strictly as a book, &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Companion&quot; is merely adequate. Stefan Jaworzyn has done his homework, but he doesn't distinguish himself here as much of a writer or critic, and he doesn't bring any particular insight or wit to the subject matter. Jaworzyn's book is largely told in the oral history style, using long quotes from interview subjects and letting them tell the story in their own words. The &quot;oral history&quot; approach has become a cliche in books of this nature and seems a bit lazy at times, but perhaps it's for the best that it's recycled (once again) here. When Jaworzyn takes over the narration, the book seems a bit flat and lifeless. The author's worst tendency is to make bold generalizations without backing them up with evidence or explanations. For example, he says that &quot;Psycho&quot; is the most overrated film of the last 50 years and then doesn't explain WHY he thinks so. Similarly, he declares &quot;Motel Hell&quot; to be &quot;terrible&quot; without any explanation whatsoever and casually dismisses &quot;Deranged&quot; as &quot;obvious&quot; exploitation but doesn't explain why.Frankly, a good deal of this book is padding. There's a whole chapter, for example, devoted solely to quotes from various reviews of the first &quot;TCM&quot; film. While it's good for a few chuckles, it hardly merits the space it takes up. Similarly, the chapter devoted to the real Ed Gein is a space-waster: a Cliff's Notes summation of information readily available on the Internet or in dozens of books. Depending upon your degree of interest in the &quot;TCM&quot; sequels, nearly half the book could be considered padding. The author is highly democratic in giving roughly equal coverage to all the films in the series. It's possible that fans of the original film would be tempted to merely skim through those chapters.I hope that this book is considered a mere first step in documenting the entire &quot;Chainsaw&quot; films and doesn't end up being considered the &quot;last word&quot; on the series. It's a worthwhile read, and I'm glad it exists, but I couldn't help but feel a bit disappointed. Luckily, &quot;TCM&quot; fans have a variety of ways to gain real knowledge and insight into the film. First, the commentary track on the &quot;TCM&quot; DVD (by Tobe Hooper, Daniel Pearl, and Gunnar Hansen) is excellent. Second, there are numerous fine websites devoted to the series (several of which are mentioned in this book). And third, serious students of all things &quot;Chainsaw&quot; are advised to go to their local libraries and scour through anthologies of film writing and books about the history of horror movies. You'll find that numerous thought-provoking essays on &quot;TCM&quot; have appeared over the years, from surprisingly high-minded sources. Too bad that no one has ever thought to compile these essays into one big book."},{"Title":"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre Companion","review":"Gathered in this book are the behind the scenes stories from those that were there of the making of one of the horror genre's truly legendary films and its sequels (with a passing, and mostly negative, mentioning of the 2003 remake). Author Stefan Jaworzyn lets the participants speak for themselves in almost uncommented upon interview clippings (he does step in clarify some details or to just share his unneeded opinion). The result is a far clearer glimpse at director Tobe Hooper (who gets a chapter of his own) and the trendsetting thriller he directed back in 1973. Hooper (who appears via interview clippings from other sources) comes across as an extremely talented man hampered with bad business skills and even worse luck in choosing who he does business with. Those he worked with mostly come across as an intelligent bunch of plain old folks completely caught off guard by the powerful little movie they worked on. The first TCM had a notoriously bad shoot and what happened afterward (in terms of the shafting by the film industry received by all) was a sad foreshadowing of what was to befall Tobe Hooper over the next thirty years. History more or less repeated itself with each sequel, though only the Tobe Hooper directed one receives truly in depth treatment. The chapter on Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3 is tantamount to Cliff Notes and largely repeats the information from the DVD extras with nothing added. Kim Henkel's The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (or TCM: The Next Generation, depending on which video you get) is slightly more in depth, but the 'discussion' of the (at the time of writing) remake is two pages of psychic arm chair criticism that, in light of the film's box office success, seems overly harsh and a tad immature. Nonetheless, everything that is Saw is revealed, discussed, and shared and no fan of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and/or its sequels and remake will want to be without it. Highly recommended to those who proclaim the Saw as part of their family."},{"Title":"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre Companion","review":"I'm a huge fan of both the film and the author (check out his music!) but was pretty disappointed by this book. While Jaworzyn's choice of quotes (it's told 'oral histroy' style a la Please Kill Me, etc) certainly gives insight into things such as the process of making the film and the now legennadry financial fallout that followed, very little is told about the characters or the script. The detailed descriptions of what exactly went into filming border on the academic and may bore the bejeezus out of anyone who doesn't already have a background in filmmaking. There is very little information on the writing process - maybe it's just me, but I would have preferred to hear who inspired the Hitchhiker character, for instance, than read pages about foreign licensing and shady deals."},{"Title":"Michelin Quebec Regional Atlas & Travel Guide (Michelin Regional Atlas & Travel Guide Quebec)","review":"Don't be tempted by the apparently convenient small size of this road atlas (it would fit in a #10 envelope.) The trade-off is that the maps are just too small to read if you're over 40, and insufficiently detailed no matter what your age. Also because of the small page sizes, the maps are chopped up incoherently and it takes a lot of \\"random access memory\\" in your head to line up each map up with the next, which may or may not be adjacent, in the book. As a result, the Michelin Quebec Atlas and Travel Guide is not good either for details or the big picture.Save your money and stop off at the first Walmart you see upon arrival in Quebec and get yourself a human-sized road atlas.

Truly! The first fifty or so pages felt interminable, but once past that point the book becomes a veritable page turner.Eliot crafts a fascinating, first-rate historical fiction plot based in Florence, Italy, from the death of Lorenzo de' Medici (in 1492), through the time of Savonarola's influence, and culminating in an epilogue placed in 1509. In the midst of this tumultuous social situation is placed our heroine, Romola. The daughter of a scholar, Romola herself is very well educated for a woman of her time. This novel follows Romola through six complex post-de'Medici years of Florentine politics, further inflamed by the preachings of Savonarola, a Dominican friar. As the plot swells in complexity, the gentle woman transitions from being her father's daughter, to her husband's wife, to a woman meeting life head on with a dignity of her own merit. Possessed of a fast moving, labyrinthine plot, this novel, despite its length of just over 600 pages, keeps up a taut pace until the very end.As might be expected in a novel named after a character, this one, despite the enticing plot, is very rooted in its performers. Romola is a central figure, but by no means the only one. Eliot pulls some of her players direct from the history books and some from her imagination, but each and every one of them feels so genuine that it is difficult to know which really lived and breathed and which only ever lived within her pages. This is the type of book that has you googling purely imaginative personages-because they are portrayed with such authenticity.Florence of the late fifteenth century is very well depicted: the pageantry of her holidays (including a fantastic description of Savonarola's Bonfire of the Vanities); the dress, habits, and occupations of her various classes; and the architectural details of her stone edifices. As you wander the streets with the novel's inhabitants you are drawn into her neighborhoods, with their chaos, aromas, and idiosyncrasies.So why a relatively low three star rating? Because the prose is so dense that it left me wallowing somewhere between philosophy text and nineteenth century history tome. For some reason, I had to work exceptionally hard to remain focused on reading the words themselves and concentrate with that little bit of extra grey matter to wrap my mind around what exactly was being expressed. Was it worth it? Well, yes, as my clear admiration for the book's merits shows; however, I can not say that I \\"really liked\\" (four stars) or \\"loved\\" (five stars) a book which required so much effort. So, three stars, a simple \\"liked\\" verdict, it is for this work. This is definitely not a book for someone unused to literature of the Victorian era, as, in my opinion, this novel is some of the least accessible writing from that time frame."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"In my opinion, this is a must-read for anyone who has ever been to Florence. I read it while there for three months on a study abroad program and loved it. If I had never been there or had no knowledge of the history of the city, the novel wouldn't have been as interesting. It is hard to believe that it was written in the 19th century and not during the renaissance as an eye witness account. Elliot's knowledege of Florentine history and her use of real historical characters in the text is amazing. The story starts off very slow at first but then sucks you in. It seems to keep getting more and more dramatic and then concludes with a very satisfying ending."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"&#34;Romola&#34; is a good novel by a great and supremely intelligent novelist. The Renaissance Italy background is fascinating. Though not Eliot's greatest novel - that would be &#34;Middlemarch&#34; - &#34;Romola&#34; is extremely rewarding."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"Romola was engrossing and, of course, very well-written. I'm even inspired to find out more about a historical period that's not really one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"Romola was published in \\"The Cornhill\\" magazine in 14 parts from July 1862 to August 1863. It is George Eliot's foray into the realm of historical fiction made popular by the earlier novels of Sir Walter Scott. Eliot is a great English novelists known for such classics as Adam Bede; The Mill on the Floss; Felix Holt; Middlemarch (her masterpiece), Scenes of Clerical Life and Daniel Deronda. Romala is the only novel she wrote not set in the British Isles. It is her least popular and known work though she considered it her favorite. The book is lengthy and intricate in its recounting of the life of the title heroine Romola in fifteenth century Florence. The major players are:Romola Bardi: She is the idealistic daughter of a blind scholar Bardo de Bardi. She falls in love with the young and amoral Tito Melema a Greek who has arrived in Florence. Tito is the assistant to Bardo in the latter's classical studies. Tito sells the precious classical library of Bardo. Tito's selfish character is revealed to Romola who leaves Florence for a short time in utter despair. Savanarola persuades her to return to the city.Tito also betrays Bernado del Nero one of five men executed by the government. Bernado is the godfather of Romola and dies before her eyes in a gruesome beheading. Romola learns that Tito was instrumental in the arrest and death of del Nero. Romola becomes a supporter of Savanrola as she ministers to the poor. She also learns of his adultery.Tito Melema: Handsome husband of Romola who has a second family with the poor girl Tess. (she has two children by Tito). Tito is a schemer and adulterer who is ambitious for fame and fortune. He has stolen money and abandoned to slavery his stepfather Baldassarri. Baldassarri tracks down Tito with murder in his heart. Baldassari reveals the deep and sinful past of Tito to Romola.I do not agree that the characters in this novel are flat. Villains like Tito and Baldassarri are well drawn as is Romala. Eliot was the first great psychological novelist in English influencing such writers as Henry James.Savanorola is the real life religious reformer who seeks to clean up decadent Florence. He is famous for the bonfire of vanities in which Florentines threw away many luxury items in an effort to become more faithful to God. The reformer was burned at the stake in 1498.The City of Florence is a character during these turbulent times. Pietro de Medic the ruler of Florence has died and the French army under Charles VIII has become an occupying power. The League of Venice declares war on the French and Florentines. Hunger and plague run rampant through the streets of Florence on the Arno River. The political machinations are hard to follow. Machiavelli the real life author of \\"The Prince\\": appears in the book.The novel concludes with the death of Savanarola and Tito. Romola has taken Tessa and her two children under her wing. Romola, like George Eliot, is a kind woman who learns the secret to life is helping others as a good samaritan. She has emerged from her personal tragedies to become a wonderful woman. The Penguin edition contains a definition of many Italian words and phrases used in Romola, textual emendations made to the manuscript and an incisive and helpful introduction. Penguins are the best paperbacks for classics!George Eliot and her lover George Henry Lewes did a great deal of on site research in Florence; read deeply in the politics of the Renaissance era and put that knowledge to work in Romola. The book is a classic which tells a fascinating story. Like all of George Eliot's works it is a gem in the literary crown of the author. Romola is hard reading but the story is compellinig and it is worth your time and effort."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"Romola is constantly called Eliot's weakest novel, with even serious critics reluctant to praise it. However, it was seen in the 19th century as Eliot's masterpiece. Some of the blame for the novel going out of fashion must rest with F.R. Leavis who said that &quot;few will want to read Romola a second time, and few can ever have got through it once without some groans.&quot; If Leavis, viewed as one of the great literary minds, thinks this, then more average readers like us are bound to be put off.True, the start of Romola is bogged down in detail, but it is introduced by a wonderful, stirring and majestic 'Proem' which sees the Angel of the Dawn sweeping across the Earth and loftily states how humanity is the same now as it was when Romola is set. After this, the notes are best ignored - consult them separately, and concentrate on getting into the book. It is a stirring and sometimes hard read, and moves one with awe at what Eliot has created - you really feel you are experiencing Florence in the 15th century. There is one scene that stands out for me - the haunting and almost surreal episode where Romola drifts by boat to an apparent coastal haven. Images of peace and life are reversed disturbingly.So ignore Leavis and the dissenters. If you've read another Eliot, you'll like it. If you haven't, maybe start with something else, but come back, for it's a rewarding read"},{"Title":"Romola","review":"George Eliot spent two years preparing &quot;Romola&quot;, and the result is a rich, densely detailed &quot;Tale of the Renaissance&quot;. Never a facile writer, here she is concerned with one of the most intellectually challenging (not to mention politically complicated) periods in history; and she paints the panoply and power struggles as a background for the personal tragedy which is the novel's crux. While not an &quot;easy read&quot; in the Sir Walter Scott sense, &quot;Romola&quot; presents in sumptous detail the banquets, the festivities, and the famous bonfire of vanities that one associates with late 15th Century Florence.But from a purely literary viewpoint, the most important thing about the book is its delineation of Tito Melema, the young man who in the opening chapters is the story's hero, but slowly, irrevocably becomes its villain. Neither Sir Walter nor Charles Dickens has psychological insight (in the modern sense) as sharp as George Eliot's, and this study of a fictional character's downfall is one of the most stunning depictions of corruption in English literature. That he is the husband of the heroine, a sensitive, finely sensual woman, makes the tragedy all the more poignant. Scenes involving historical characters (including Savonarola and Machiavelli) tend to be a little stiff in costume movie style. Oh, and because the story takes place in the 1490's, one must imagine the Piazza della Signoria without Michelangelo and Cellini. This must really have frustrated a connoisseur like George Eliot."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"Given the majority of Eliot readers begin with Middlemarch, I found myself in the unique position of not only beginning with Romola, but also on a subject that I find most interesting. That of Renaissance Italy. Beginning at the death of the great Lorenzo di Medici in '92 I read this great novel twice. Once quickly as any other Twenty-First century paperback; the second, slowly, with more respect for the intellectual scope within the pages.After the first attempt I was mildly disappointed. I came away with no true sense of the whole that is fifteenth century Florence and a bewilderment at the inconsistent central characterisation of Tito Melema and his golden-haired wife, Romola. The supporting actors were brilliant, from Fra Girolama's fantatical Catholicism to Bratti's salesmanship. But I was left disappointed, believing in the superficality of Tito, the maddening naivety of Tessa, and the almost puritanical martyrdom of Romola.So I re-read it. Slowly.It is now extremely clear why this great work of english literature is, as Eliot herself puts it, a \\"book of mine which I more thoroughly feel that I swear by every sentence as having been written with my best blood\\".Each scene is mesmerically depicted, the infintesimal attention to details and Eliot's total control of her subject matter shines through.Renaissance Florence wasn't so well depicted by its contemporaries.From Tito's waking at the Loggia de' Cerchi to his final fall at the Ponte Vecchio his character moves through a full range as you would expect from a man in his early twenties. His child-like mesmerism coupled with his Greek tutorage gives rise to a cherubic man whom Florence loves. His fatal flaw is his desire for love and a single terrible lie he gives that, like Murphy's Law, evolves into a a stigma that alters his very persona. What is all the more damaging is that you truly believe he is unaware of the pain he causes. He is truly egocentric, in an almost blameless way. For Romola, you cold argue the opposite. Indeed she is potentially more culpable. Her fierce intellectualism is offset by a descent into a world of religious supersition, a world where religion is used as a political tool. Throughout she has the knowledge of where her actions will take her and a terrible sense of duty and restrains her. From the beginning, with the story we hear so often of Tito's escape from drowning, to his final near drowning at the hands of the mob, to his strangulation by his father there is a certain bitter justice until all that he leaves is his proud and world-scarred wife Romola and the innocence that he preserved with Tessa. Tito's move from innocent 'hero' to startled villain is an excerise in human failings. Yet it is not a sufficient single human tragedy, as Eliot says, \\"Florence was busy with greater affairs, and the preparation of a deeper tragedy\\".In many respects \`Romola' is Eliot's King Lear. The parallels are many, including Baldessare's depiction. There is no Edgar, nor Edmund but the Fool is here in many guises. In taking one of Shakespeare's finest themes, Eliot has given true life to fifteenth century Florence and it is, perhaps, best encapsulated by Romola's final statement to Tessa's son, Lillo:\\"There was a man to whom I was very near... who made almost everyone fond of him, for he ws young, and clever, and beautiful...I believe, when I first knew him, he never thought of anything cruel or base. But because he tried to slip away from everything that was unpleasant, and cared for nothing else so much as his own safety, he came at last to commit some of the basest deeds - such as make men infamous.\\"So, Eliot's \`Romola'. Read it, delight in it because it truly is, as the author can rightly claim, one of the finest works in english literature."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"Yes, it bristles with Glossaries and Appendices and Notes like so much barbed wire. (And if you actually read the Penguin editor's introduction, it's a sure thing you'll never read the novel: she makes it sound like about as much fun as chewing rocks.) But don't let all that deter you. You may have some rough going at the beginning, mostly because Latin and Greek scholarship is so important to the plot. Use the notes and they'll enhance your enjoyment of the story, but ignore them and you're still in for a thrilling tale gorgeously told. Tito Melema is one of the great characters in fiction, and he's someone we all know: a thoroughly despicable human being who has no idea he's anything but a nice guy. Eliot has wrought a dreamy and hair-raising hybrid of fiction and history, infused with her own astonishing insight and complicated sympathy and delivered in her matchless prose. I loved this book."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"Romola was a difficult book to read. If I did not happen to be on a business trip that left me long hours on seemingly endless international flights, I doubt if I would have had the perseverance to stick with it. In writing this book, Eliot spent six months in exhaustive research on fifteenth century Florence, and she is going to give it all to you whether you like it or not. This made it difficult to enjoy because I was constantly going to the back of the book get the translation of Italian and Latin phrases, reference to obscure historical characters, and other minutia which would only be clear to someone with a doctorate in Italian history. I was frustrated by this throughout the book. Having said that, the book is worth the wade! As always Eliot's writing is a pure joy to read. Some of her description is so beautiful that I have to step back in wonder that someone can create narrative so rich and inviting. Her characters are complex, intriguing and well developed. First, Tito was the most original antihero I have run across in years: a man who avoids unpleasantness and discomfort to the point that he betrays anyone he has ever loved while intending only to take the easy way in all his dealings. Romola is a women deeply learned, but raised only by her aging father and the classics, is unprepared for what the fates have brought her: love, duplicity, and purpose. And lastly, Savonarola, Tito's opposite: a religious visionary who strives to lead Florence to a new order, and is willing to give up church, state---anything but his place in the order, to see his prophecy fulfilled. This is Eliot's favorite book. I can see why."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"Funny how Eliot's least-loved novel today was the author's personal favorite and her best seller during her lifetime. How did it slide into relative obscurity? Partly because Eliot's acknowleged forte is her depiction of rural life in Victorian England, whereas this novel is set in a large Italian city (Florence) during the Renasaissance. Also, the novel does bog down a bit in its own scholarliness, as nearly every reviewer has mentioned. Still, the innumerable references to prominent Florentines can be glossed over without losing much. As for the urban setting, Eliot's Florence is every bit as vivid as Dickens' London, or Dostoevsky's St. Petersburg. And, of course, every page is filled with Eliot's trademark wisdom.For anyone who cares about great books, all seven of Eliot's novels are absolutely mandatory. So, by all means start with \\"Adam Bede\\" or \\"Middlemarch\\", but don't neglect \\"Romola.\\"A word about the Konneman edition: I love the compact format (It fits easily into a briefcase or purse), the lovely cover art and the high-quality cloth binding. Be advised, however, that it is loaded with typos, some of them hilarious. It's still a good buy, however."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"When one starts reading a Victorian novelist, one prepares before hand to face a certain amount of wooden, heavy-handed moralizing, as every great narrative of the epoch is fraught with the opposition between the calls of pleasure and the calls of duty, between seeking for one's private advantage and sticking to one's role, with the writer making the latter to win overwhelming. This novel is no different, in that it's the dutiful Romola that has the upper hand over her nice and debauched husband Tito Melena in the end. However, the novel being set in late Renaissance Italy- a country with which George Eliot had an enduring love affair - it captures the atmosphere of the time and place in such a beautiful way that this enormous, throughly reserched historical novel has such a flowing, luxurious style that takes an almost liquid quality, like a fresh, transparent scream flowing along a summer Mediterranean landscape. Also, in the person of Savonarola, Eliot menaged to introduce the figure of the idealist turned evil through his attachment to his call. In short: a gorgeous novel. Loved it!"},{"Title":"Romola","review":"I loved this book! Set in fifteenth century Florence, Romola explores the deep recesses of the soul. Renaissance Italy with its political/religious conflicts, intellectual, pursuits, artistry and pageantry are all beautifully protrayed throughout Eliot's magnificent love story. Deceit, greed and selfishness are artfully displayed against the purity of a nobel soul which knows no compromise. Romola, the book's main character is a study in virtue, while Tito her husband has but the veneer of goodness. Tito falls forever because of one lie. This is a book to read slowly and savor."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"A book with unforgettable characters - in Tito who demonstrates the degeneration of the soul in the pursuit of money and an ideal character in Romola who personifies duty. This book characterizes George Eliot's concept of truth. Truth according to her is not only what is real, but also, what should be. Another character who fascinates is Savonarola - we see him as a human being, with strengths and weaknesses. And Eliot teaches us to be like Romola - to appreciate the good in a human being instead of damming him completely. Along with true to life characters, ideal characters,historical characters, also a superb depiction of rennaisance Italy. Whatever critics say about 'Romola' being the least readable of all Eliot's books, it remains her most idealistic work which makes one feel deeply, and want to emulate the good. Hence, a great classic which is enjoyable and which sets you thinking about your own inadequacies."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"Romola is a dense, compelling historical novel by the master of English fiction, George Eliot. Although this book is a bit slow going at first, the true-to-life characters and the towering themes make the reader's efforts more than worthwhile. Like the great film &quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman,&quot; this novel deals with love, betrayal, parenthood, revenge, greed, spirituality, religion, and deceit, in ways that seem remarkably modern. I read it three times!"},{"Title":"Second Greatest Commandment","review":"It is a Sunday School book, pg 14, designed to be used to teach adults how to be sensitive to and caring for their neighbors, thus illustrating the \\"bear one another's burdens, and thus fulfill the Law of Christ\\" Gal 6:2, quoted at the end of the preface. It is not a difficult read but is meant to encourage and patiently teach adults without using unusually theological terms or trying to motivate by making people feel guilty. But rather it's motivation is low keyed, explain to people what is consistent with their understanding of the Bible and the Christian life and lead them from there.-------------Part 1: Caring because God cared.Chapter 1: Does anyone really care?\\"not just advice, but genuine caring that cost them time effort and money.\\" pg 19\\"If love is real, it will be expressed.

The problem will be to get enough copies of such an now older book. It is not about the details of running such a ministry as much as the right individual motivations. It seems to approach the issues in a mature and Christian way, making good points and speaking truthfulness in love."},{"Title":"A Companion to Study Virgil (The Classical Tradition: Volume 151) (Mnemosyne, Bibliotheca Classica Batava)","review":"A useful guide to the whole of Virgil's corpus, but it is painful to read. In the second sentence of the Introduction, for example, we are told that \\"G. and Aen. in particular have become ... battlefields.\\" Of course the author means the Georgics and the Aeneid, but the Short Title list appears AFTER the Introduction. For the sake of the reader, should not the FIRST use of a title be the \\"long\\" one?Consider also the prose-style. Although it is not impenetrable, one wonders whether its worth the effort getting into:\\"The question can perhaps be answered better at the end of the poem, but it may prove helpful to air it at the outset, in as much as the poet seems, if (conventional or traditional) critics have read the text's explicit rhetoric in lines (say) 1-296 with some degree of insight and understanding, to have been exceptionally generous with his indications of the levels at which he proposes to write and the manner in which he wishes -- or so it would appear -- to be understood.\\"The next sentence is worse still: \\"If that remark is in itself now, in some eyes, a critical fallacy, then I can only say that here I am writing about what I (and the scholars I cite) have seen and heard in the prooemium.\\""},{"Title":"A Companion to Study Virgil (The Classical Tradition: Volume 151) (Mnemosyne, Bibliotheca Classica Batava)","review":"This book may be of value to someone who really knows Virgil and Virgilian scholarship, but Horsfall's style is so idiosyncratic, and his approach so random, that students and other intermediate readers are best warned off. Ideas are presented, or hinted at, in sentences or sentence fragments overflowing with parentheses, exclamation points, question marks, footnotes, and cross-references. The text is poorly edited and in places doesn't make any sense at all. Overall, one gets the impression that Horsfall (who wrote most of the book, and translated two chapters from Italian into his own idiom) is a brilliant scholar who welcomes us into his brain but really can't be bothered tidying up before we come in."},{"Title":"A Companion to Study Virgil (The Classical Tradition: Volume 151) (Mnemosyne, Bibliotheca Classica Batava)","review":"I'll go to the mat for this one. Horsfall writes in an incredibly compressed style, making this book seem like a collection of notecards for a much longer book, but as long as you can parse his style, the material is logically organized and has tons of pointers to more extensive references, often in the footnotes on a sentence-by-sentence basis. Horsfall plows through the Aeneid in one hundred pages, trying to summarize centuries of debates in a handful of sentences. While his approach is quirky, it's also *very* informative. But beginners will find it overwhelming and probably annoying.Why Vergil? A Collection of Interpretationsis recommended as a *much* easier way into Virgil that focuses on the big themes."},{"Title":"BloodRune","review":"BloodRune is written in a unique first-person present-tense that I've never seen in another book. This gives a very interesting perspective on the story itself when told as it's happening by the characters that are there. This book follows characters more than the plot, and that's reflected by a bit of a lack of direction to begin with but is tied together once the plot is worked up to. In much the same light, there's a fair amount of content to begin with that seems pointless at the time, mere plot filler, but much of that is explained once the plot starts to come into play. BloodRune ends with a dramatic twist, leading up to the series that was intended to follow. Unique characters, carefully placed humor, realistic plot development, and a very interesting perspective make this book worth taking a closer look. A free preview of two pages can be found at the publisher's site."},{"Title":"BloodRune","review":"this book is FANTASTIC! i haven't even finished it yet but i'm hooked. the author weaves such an intricate tale, fused with wonderfully descriptive and imaginative characters. this first-time author is sure to be a success in the future. if you haven't picked up your copy of BLOOD RUNE, you should definitely do so today! you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Philosophy of Mind","review":"I have read a lot of books, introductory and advanced, on the philosophy of mind, but I rarely review them. However, this book had some flaws that were just so evident that I felt I had a responsability to comment on them. But of course, I will not just shun the book and leave. Not everything that is flawed is useless. This book, far from being useless, is an adequate introduction to the philosophy of mind. But the author does not have this as his only goal, and also attempts to defend a property dualistic ontology of mind. He is also an emergentist, but here I have few objections. But emergentism itself is not incompatible with materialism, as the author seems to imply sometimes.The book is short, easy to read, and covers the necessary ground for any begginer who wants to learn the generalso of philosophy of mind. There are chapters on the diferent types of dualism, materialism, philosophy of artificial intelligence and on intentionality. The author discusses classic and modern positions in all of these things, and makes it all clear and non-technical. The problem is that everytime he tries to attack some position or other, he simply does not seem to succeed. I mean, even Descartes's substance dualism is defensible form Jacquettes critique! Now to be more specific, I will limit myself to his main argument against materialism, for wich he concludes propery dualism is a better bet at expaining the ontology of mind.The argument is roughly as follows (Pge 20): The mind has intentionallity. The body as such does not. Therefore the mind cannott be fully explained by alluding to purely physical (body) processes. Here the property of being intentional leads one to property dualism, according to Jacquette. Now anyone with any knowledge of philosophy of mind will quickly point out that the 2 premises can be attacked, as can the conclusion even when one accepts the validity of the premises. First, it is not clear why intentionality could not be explained physically. Jacquette begs the question in assuming that this is not possible. John Searle, for example, is a materialist, even though he accepts the importance of intentionality. So to say that the body as such can have no intentionality is begging the same question. And finally, the fact that mind and body might have diferent properties does not necessarily lead one to any kind of dualism, for the differences might be only in virtue of epistemistic access. That is, if one knows something by description instead of by aquaintance, one may believe one of these descriptions has a property that the other does not, even when they refer to the same things.(In fact, this is related to Jacksons knowledge argument, of which Jacquette talks inadequately). To illustrate my points, and to show to what extent Jaquettes discussion is incoherent look at this extract:&quot;conceivably...imput-output simulations of mind, in which physical syntax tokens casually interact with themselves in an apropiate...enviroment, might duplicate the brain's power to produce...intentional thought..&quot; (pge 81).Here the author accepts the posibility that intentionallity might be physically realizable after all! What happened to the intentionality argument?The author gives no reason of why physicalism might be inadequate to explain the mind fully, and offers the worst defence of property dualism I have read yet. Nothing I have said can be taken to imply that physicalism is true, however."},{"Title":"ISO 9000 ABC's: The Small Company Guide to Successful Registration","review":"This is a great book for a small company looking to get ISO 9000 registration.

They are both a demonstration of the range of Joan Vinge's talent and an clear indication of the importance of characterization in her works. All the protaganists in these stories are alienated in some way from their culture and each must resolve their own eccentric problems.The title story involves two individuals, each an outcast in their own society, who learn to fulfill each other's needs; it strongly reminds me of the Gift of the Magi in tone. Voices From the Dust has two scientists who detest each other, but find common ground when an alien presence seizes control of their minds. The Storm King is a tale of emotional growth, as a noble boy learns empathy. The Peddler's Apprentice also has a boy growing both emotionally and intellectually, finally gaining some measure of wisdom. Psiren has Cat coming to grips with his power and guilt. Mother and Child tells of an alien who develops a degree of affection and appreciation for humanity through his contact with a human woman and her child.Each of these stories involves an individual who is in some way almost unique in their society, but these stories have a larger theme of the uniqueness of all persons. They seem to say, forget the averages and concentrate on the distinctly different aspects of each person.The only problem I have with Joan D. Vinge is that she doesn't write enough. Of course, quantity doesn't replace quality. And Vinge exemplifies quality to me. Enjoy!-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"Phoenix In The Ashes.","review":"Phoenix in the Ashes is an amazing collection of Ms. Vinge's short stories. Each story has an afterword written by Ms. Vinge, which gives the reader insight, into what inspired that particular tale, which I found to be a very pleasant experience. This collection is something any fan of Ms. Vinge must get, unfortunately at this time it is out of print. One story in particular flashes back on Cat from the Catspaw, Psion, Dreamfall series, and is set in the time between Psion and Catspaw when our hero is recovering from the mental-psionic breakdown he suffered because of his time spent in the Telhassium mines of the Federation. This interlude in Cat's life is just one of six tales included in this collection. The other five range all the way from a desolate future Earth, where technology is considered to be part of the evil spirits (Phoenix in the Ashes), to a sort of world where humans who can see clearly or even hear are considered &quot;blessed&quot; or &quot;gifted&quot; and has an incredibly suprising plot(Mother and Child). All the stories in this collection have characters of depth and intriguing story lines, in spite of the short length. There is no way to sum up this collection as each story is an individual gem, of a different color and cut set in the ring of adaptation and survival"},{"Title":"Event Planning Made Easy","review":"This is the best event planning book.

Finally, when desparate for a book to read at the last minute for a school book report, I grabbed Dear Mad'm. I was a little disappointed by the first chapter but after that the story blasted off. Who would think a book about an 80 year old woman living in the Siskiyou Mt by the Klamath River could be so exciting? She left the comforts of the city because she was bored. For 80 years old she was very young acting. She moved into a rusty old cabin and the adventures started from there - from how she got food and supplies from a nearby camp, making curtains out of flour sacks dying them yellow and green by soaking them in onion skins and green plant leaves, to planting large patches of wildflowers. But the silliest part was her friendship with two neighbors who she nicknamed 'UpnUp' and 'Dear Sir' and they nicknamed her 'Dear Mad'm.' The most exciting part was when she fought off a cougar that was attacking her dog 'Vicky.' Dear Mad'm shot the cougar in the head with a gun that weighed almost more than she did.

It is a dear book which I will cherish for the rest of my days. Why?- For its beautiful, unassuming observations of life.- For its lovable, old fashioned storytelling colored with a touch of sentimentality.- For its youthful zest and clarity.- For its charming humor and wise candor.- For its intrepid spirit and inspiration.DEAR MAD'M is her name and this is her story - her biographical adventure set in the rugged and remote Siskiyou Mountains of Northern California.The Siskiyou Mountains, the wild Klamath River and the ancient forests of Northern California and Southern Oregon are all very familiar and much loved by me. Once I could call this place my home. But now that I am a retired Bohemian baby-boomer beachnik living on the Gulf Coast of Florida, I couldn't be farther away from the magnificent natural world which Dear Mad'm details so delightfully in this alluring story. Reading it makes my heart ache with longing for all of it again. But reading this book also puts me right back in the middle of that mighty and mystical place once more.Sophisticated, high brow readers might cringe but with suppressed delight as they follow the endearing narrative of Dear Mad'm as she communes with the natural world of the Siskiyous - befriending it, feeding it, nurturing it, embracing it - all with unbridled energy and spirit.Dear Mad'm left a comfortable life in San Francisco, a life of ease animated by a loving family and many dear friends, to spend a year of solitude in a rustic, remote cabin on a gold mining claim she owned in the rugged mountains near the tiny, isolated town of Happy Camp, California. She wanted a year of independence and freedom, an opportunity to live life on her own terms, to grow wild flowers, reflect on nature and find a path closer to God.What makes this book so unique and stand out in this genre of back to nature stories is the fact that Dear Mad'm was 80 years old when she embarked on her singular adventure! Furthermore, on her eighty-first birthday, she decided to live out the rest of her life this way! What an inspiration for we approaching a certain age...and those of us who have already arrived!Dear Mad'm was the nickname of Stella Walthall Patterson who was born October 14, 1866 and lived a vital and full life until December 23, 1956.

It has about 400 great, large, clear, full color, sharp photos, and more than 2,000 values (1996).

Descriptions are very complete and the radios are listed alphabetically by manufacturer, making location and identification easy. Add it to your library and you'll refer to it often."},{"Title":"Collector's Guide to Transistor Radios Identification and Values","review":"One of the &quot;must haves&quot; if you are interested in transistor radios of the fifties and sixties. Hundreds, (thousands?) of listings with photos of some, descriptions of all, and date of manufacture for most. The book also contains estimated value ranges, and useful introductory information."},{"Title":"Technology Integration: Making Critical Choices in a Dynamic World (Management of Innovation and Change)","review":"This book was handed to me by the president of our company about five months ago, with the instructions, &quot;Read this. I think it will change the way we build software.&quot; Turns out he was right.The basic tenet of this book is that, in a rapidly changing and uncertain environment, companies must delay basic technology decisions as long as possible in order to best understand the context in which their product will be used. Changes in context can (i.e., new technologies, changing market requirements, competitive products) can take a product with killer potential and turn it into a market flop within weeks. This applies to manufacturing and system design as well as my industry, software, and was something that we ourselves had experienced.Iansiti's writing style is fairly dry, and the exhaustive statistical analysis of his research can be, well, exhausting. I found myself skimming the middle of almost every chapter while he proved his points, so I could get to the good stuff: the case studies. Iansiti had access to Microsoft, Netscape, and Silicon Graphics, among other notable names, and his studies of successful and unsuccessful approaches to technology integration vividly illustrated the effect that a flexible decision-making process can have on a company's success, both in individual projects and in the market as a whole.I used the basic principles Iansiti put forth and the case studies that he used to support them as a basis for redesigning my company's entire development process. We now have reduced the time-to-market for new features from over six months to less than two, and we are finding that our clients are happier and our products are seeing more success in the market as a result.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is scrambling to keep up with today's rapidly changing high-tech environment. It will make you take a hard look at the way you do business."},{"Title":"Technology Integration: Making Critical Choices in a Dynamic World (Management of Innovation and Change)","review":"This book is great at covering a number of topics:1) An overview of the current state of Research and Development and how it works2) Backing up what it says about R&D; with interviews into some of the big players in the IT industry3) Giving a functional solution to how you should integrate teams and effortsI would say my favorite take away from this book is the separation of knowledge into two types: Domain and Context. I think the book should have elaborated more on this subject.For other readers who have read The Keystone Advantage, this book is written in different style. There are numerous references to regression analysis and altogether has a research feel to it."},{"Title":"Technology Integration: Making Critical Choices in a Dynamic World (Management of Innovation and Change)","review":"This book highlights several key concepts on successful and unsuccessful approaches to integrating product features in the high tech arena. Despite the fact that some of the statistical analysis was over my head, I found the book readable and insightful. The depth of research is impressive. I recommend this book to anyone in the software or hardware industry."},{"Title":"Daughters Of The Sea (Next)","review":"In her late thirties and unhappy, Veronica Legacy decides it is time to pull up anchor, give up on the secure middle class existence she lives and start anew. Accompanied by her twenty years old daughter Simpson, Veronica leaves her spouse to return to the only place she ever felt at home, the farm of beloved septuagenarian Ernestine Trueheart. She doubts her husband will notice that the two women in his life have left him.However, though welcomed by Ernestine, Veronica realizes you can't come home as nothing remains the same. The energetic Ernestine of memory is a slowly dying elderly woman. Still she offers Veronica what she most needs a sense of worth and belonging, but will that prove enough for an adult seeking a haven from the storms of life?This is a terrific slice of life character study that showcases intriguing individuals, especially Veronica, struggling with problems that have thrown them into a depression yet come out fighting for what they believe in. Veronica is the center of this interesting tale, but the support cast mainly Ernestine and Simpson make her a fully developed protagonist. Fans will appreciate this fine often witty but always profound look at middle age crisis.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Daughters Of The Sea (Next)","review":"Enjoyed her style.

It is not one of my favorites, but it fills in some of the story line. I will be rereading the book. I have all of the Floating Outfit series and am in the process of reading them in order instead of how I purchase them."},{"Title":"One is one","review":"This was read to me by both my 5th and 6th grade teachers and after the second time thru this misunderstood boy's trials and triumphs, I took my life-savings at the time (around $4) and bought the hardback for myself. Now, 35yrs later,a lifetime of reading (to excess) in my wake, I re-read it and still find it one of the best books I've ever known. Well, it's only about the little things in life.....childhood, fathers and sons, courage, death, friends, enemies, God, faith, and finding one's true heart and vocation in a brutal world...that's all. It's about Stephen, a sensitive artistic boy whose noble family think him a coward, who makes his way thru the monasteries, castles and battlefields of England in the Middle Ages,in search of himself. The adventures and vivid characters he encounters thrill and enrich us; the friends who light the way thru Stephen's journey and the tragedies that I wept to read thru led to a gloriously radiant end. The vocabulary may be a bit daunting, so encourage and help any young readers and if your child or class is reading this, act out the fight scene in the tavern. I remember my teacher sobbing thru several chapers, so keep a few Kleenex handy! This story of following your bliss and the authentic life still teaches me lessons I hope to share with the children around me. Bon Appetit!"},{"Title":"One is one","review":"I first read this book at the suggestion of my elementary school librarian who knew me well enough to know that I would love it. I read it again after I had moved on to the high school. (My mother borrowed it for me as she continued to teach at the elementary school.) There came a day when the book was discarded as used. That cost me over twenty years of searching for it and finally locating it through Amazon. The review below speaks for me, too. What a marvelous book!"},{"Title":"One is one","review":"One Is One is a fascinating and moving account, set in the Middle Ages, of a boy who does not fit in with his noble, warlike family and who has to come to terms with his ambition to be respected by his family and with his own gifts."},{"Title":"One is one","review":"This was a beautiful book. I enjoyed reading about his journey. The author did an excellent job researching the time and in particular the ways of mixing plants to make colors for the illuminations."},{"Title":"Baby, Oh Baby! (Time of Your Life)","review":"I am always attracted to colorful covers and this book looked like a comedy. But we all know you can't judge a book by its cover! Although this story had its humorous moments it was a pretty serious read.Jake Chastaine had it all. He was a partner in a prestigious law firm, he had a beautiful wife, home and in-laws who loved him dearly. He had wealth and happiness and he and his wife were about to start a family with the help of a fertility clinic. Then disaster struck and his wife and his parents were killed in an auto accident. Now two years later Jake discovers that his doctor at the fertility clinic used Jake's one and only back up sample to impregnate a single mother. Knowing that a child resulted from this procedure, Jake is determined to find the child and become a part of his/her life.Annie Hollister and her daughter, Madeline, live on a ranch in Lucky, Oklahoma. Annie's life is happy and peaceful until Jake shows up on her doorstep and claims to be her child's father! She knows he is telling the truth because Madeline is a tiny replica of Jake. Will she be forced to share custody with this stranger?This story is a pleasurable read. It is well-written and that alone will hold my attention whatever the genre. Jake and Annie are intelligent characters and work through their problems with that same intelligence. I have a fourteen month old nephew so I know how a child that age should act and the author perfectly portrayed little Madeline. I usually don't read stories with children in the lead roles but I have to admit that this child is so cute and adorable. The secondary characters are Jake's in-laws, Annie's ranch manager and his wife, Annie's lawyer and a dachshund named Hot Dog.There is good interaction between all characters and lots of dialogue. I found it refreshing that the plot wasn't based on some major deceit to be resolved at the end of the story. This story is about everyday, ordinary people trying to rebuild their lives after a tragedy. I think that Ms. Wells' style of writing is similar to that of Barbara Bretton. I also think that this book will be one of this year's sleepers, so buy a copy now before it becomes too hard to find. Enjoy!!"},{"Title":"Baby, Oh Baby! (Time of Your Life)","review":"I wasn't sure if this was a novel I wanted to read or not but after reading brief description of it in &quot;RT&quot; I took a chance and purchased it anyway; I'm so glad I did. In the normal scope of life first comes love, then marriage and then baby. This novel does not fall into the normal scope.Beautiful and eccentric rancher, Annie Hollister decided to leave the high paced life of advertising and return to the ranch her grandparents left her to enjoy a life she loves, fresh air, trees, grass, animals, etc. After returning to the ranch Annie's biological clock is ticking loud and clear but she sees no man she'd want to have a child with so decides to go to a fertility facility and have a child on her own. Annie has a beautiful baby girl, Madeline, by means of artificial insemination believing that the donor signed an agreement stating that he would not be a presence in her or her child's lives. Things don't always work out like we want.Handsome and determined attorney Jake Chastaine discovers he has fathered child (in fact Annie's child) because of an unscrupulous doctor who uses Jake' sperm which Jake and his wife had hoped to use one day but sadly that day never comes as his wife is killed before the deed can be performed.Once Jake finds Annie Hollister and has gotten a look at Madeline who happens to be the spitting image of himself he decides he wants to be a part of this child's life is every sense of word and will do anything to attain that goal even if it means a court battle.Annie's afraid of losing Madeline and initially wants to leave town as she wants no part of Jake but she gets sick and guess who ends up taking care of Madeline, right, Jake and that's when things slowly begin to change to the normal scope. Jake has a tough time dealing with a very active 14-month-old baby who gets into everything a toddler can get into but Jake eventually gets the hang of things. When Annie is released from the hospital she realizes that it might not be so bad having Jake in Madeline's life. The story continues in the normal scope: first comes like, then love, and then marriage but getting there is no easy road for these two very different people but they do say that opposites attract. This is a wonderful novel filled with much humor and love that will leave you feeling wonderful all over. I enjoyed it Baby Oh Baby so very much and you will too."},{"Title":"Baby, Oh Baby! (Time of Your Life)","review":"Thank You Robin Wells. You made me laugh, you made me cry and you made me wish Jake were mine! I really enjoyed this book. (Can you tell?) I loved the 'heart' that managed to shine through each and every character, especially the eccentic and wonderful Annie. Here's a love story that grows from the most bizarre set of extenuating circumstances. Two people who were the unwitting victims of a somewhat crazed fertility doctor who decided to 'play God'. The result? A beautiful baby girl. The characters were vivid and colorful, oh, and by the way, thanks also to Ms. Wells for a dynamite supporting cast ! I loved Susanna and Tom, and was not only rooting for their reconcilliation, but cheering along during Kelly's swimming pool bikini escapade! If your looking for a thoroughly enjoyable read, look no further. This is it!"},{"Title":"Baby, Oh Baby! (Time of Your Life)","review":"Jake's wife, Racheal, has died in a car accident. Before her death, the two of them had been going to a fertilty clinic. When he finds out that his &quot;deposit&quot; has been used, a baby born to someone, he must find them, both...Jake goes to the home of Annie, a rancher, a tea-leaf reader, a mother, but not a wife....At first there is antagonism between Jake and Annie. Eventually, there will be a friendship, a romance. These two characters are opposites--Jake, a &quot;stuffed-shirt&quot; type, and Annie, a &quot;kook&quot;. Somehow, though, you see them working together for Madeline's sake, (Baby), and maybe, each other, too.The cover of this book made me think comedy. Yes, there are funny moments; but, the subject is a serious one. Also, there's a sweet secondary romance, that held my interest.One of the things I liked about this book is the origin of the title. When you read about it, you will understand what I mean. Something I didn't like was a bit of the comedy directed at the villianess. Maybe a bit too &quot;slapstick&quot; for me. However, this book really was a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Baby, Oh Baby! (Time of Your Life)","review":"I'm always on the lookout for a new romance author with a talent for comedy, and I'm adding Robin Wells to my list of favorites. I was casting this in my mind, which is always a good sign. I found the hero, Jake; a widower who discovers that his sperm sample intended for in vitro fertilization with his late wife was put in the sperm bank and ultimately used to impregnate a stranger; to be highly sympathetic. The heroine, Annie - the unwitting sperm donation recipient - was great fun to root for. And their baby, Madeline, was realistically portrayed and the center of most of the hilarious scenes in the book. One in particular stands out in my mind that might give Crusie or Evanovich a run for their money. I'm going to get the author's previous work, 'Prince Charming', and I'm looking forward to seeing what she comes up with next."},{"Title":"Baby, Oh Baby! (Time of Your Life)","review":"Well-developed leads, adorable baby, quirky characters and a sweet secondary romance...what more could one ask for in a good contemporary romance. I read this book in one sitting, it's that good. After a previous marriage that lasted less than a year, Annie went through a series of life changing decisions, partly with the help of her grandfather who speaks to her through billboard ads. Jake, on the other hand, is stuck in a rut after his wife died two years ago. When he began receiving letters from a fertility clinic thanking him for his &quot;contribution&quot; and offering to pay him for more &quot;contributions,&quot; he began to investigate. He found out that his sperm sample, which was actually meant for his wife before she died, had been &quot;deposited&quot; elsewhere, because of an unscrupulous doctor. And so the journey begins, to find a child he never knew he had....and along the way he discovers the child's mother who reads tea leaves, sells paca poop (paca poop comes from alpacas which are like llamas) and paints her toe nails in rainbow order.Baby, Oh, Baby is a lovely tale of finding new love and rediscovering passion. I'd recommend this book to anyone who loves a good contemporary romance - because that's what it is. A very good book. Robin Wells is one to watch."},{"Title":"Baby, Oh Baby! (Time of Your Life)","review":"Another reviewer said it and I couldn't agree more. This book is so well written that there aren't any secondary characters. Every character enriched the whole. These are 'Real People' folks. I couldn't put this book down and read it in one sitting (okay I feel asleep in bed, but that was not by choice). Stop reading the reviews and read the book. It is excellent!Thank you Ms. Wells. I was getting discouraged reading 'new' authors. You have restored my faith.

This book had laughs but was so much more. I loved the relationships between the characters. For a change there was actually a hero and herione who did not make me shake my head in disgust. They acted like real people. The secondary characters, Tom and Susannah were well thought out and very realistic. And you just gotta love Pearl! There were several belly laughs as well, particularly the hospital waiting room scene. I laughed so hard my husband starting looking at me strangely.

(Time of Your Life)","review":"Jake Chastain arrives at a fertility clinic to find out why they keep calling him a donor, when he and his deceased wife Rachel were patients but never got a chance for insemination, as Rachel died in a car accident two years earlier along with his parents. Soon he discovers that the previous clinic owner used his sample for another woman's insemination, and that he might just have a child out there.Annie Hollister would love to have waited for a happy marriage to have a baby, but her biological clock was ticking big time and she was ready for single mom-hood. When the tall, dark and handsome stranger confronts her about her child's parentage, she is a bit freaked out and knows he is the father just by looking at him.Jake's father in law Tom is less than thrilled with this child - he feels it is a slap in Rachel's face, particularly since Jake wants to be a part of Madeline's life. His mother in law Susanna however has found a reprieve from her grief and welcomes Annie and Madeline with open arms, while struggling to keep her withering marriage together as a preening barracuda in a thong has designs on Tom. When Tom crosses over the line with Annie, Jake finds her ready to flee with suitcases in hand - and immediately proposes - stating that they need to make Madeline legitimate. A marriage in name only is fine, but soon the two are crossing the thresholds into each other's rooms, passing into the grey area.While overall this is a humorous read, there are plenty of bittersweet moments that'll bring tears to your eyes as Jake grapples with his need to retain Rachel in his heart, while also making room for Annie and Madeline. Susanna's handling of the harpy is hysterical and welcome comic relief."},{"Title":"Baby, Oh Baby!

Can't wait to read more by Robin Wells"},{"Title":"Baby, Oh Baby! (Time of Your Life)","review":"I won't go into the plot as other reviewers have already given you a rather complete synopsis. After the beginning of the book the character development was weak and disappointing. Annie starts out as a strong, quirky individual by mid-book she's so hung up on Jake that she looses her charm and strength of character. Jake was just too angst ridden for me to enjoy. The secondary characters problems just brought the book down further. That, and that their major maritial problem is resolved by sex in the sauna well, once again a female character \\"melts\\".....pun intended. I guess I had anticipated stronger female and male characters, the ones I get from ... I think Ms Wells shows promise but the next book I'll get from the library."},{"Title":"Baby, Oh Baby! (Time of Your Life)","review":"Jake and Annie are very likeable characters in this book. I have to agree with most of the other reviewers. I also agree that it fizzled out pretty quickly. I read the whole book and enjoyed it to the end, but there were too many things that were just plain unbelievable that Ms Wells tried to weave into the plot. How many women would enter into a marriage believing that the unknown guy only has the best interests of them and the baby at heart? Annie could have really set herself up for an unhappy ending if Jake had turned out to be a self-serving man. I mean, he could have married her and then sued her for all she was worth for custody! Fortunately, the book's planned and no-surprise ending kept things on an even keel for Annie, Madeline and Jake. Maybe I'm too hardened, but this novel didn't even provide halfway believable escapism. Despite all that, Ms Wells delivers fine characterization and shows potential for future endeavors."},{"Title":"Baby, Oh Baby!

Baby, Oh Baby was well written and the scenes paced enough between the hero and heroine and the secondary characters, along with the baby, to keep my attention. It did start out slow, but like any good story it grabbed me enough to want to finish it.I won't go into extensive details about the book, as others have written reviews describing it. But if you enjoy a book that has a touch of comedy but with well written characters with a touch of sensual romance, you will enjoy this one. Don't be put off by the fact that there is a baby in this book. The baby is cute and funny but not overbearing. The author had a surprising ending (for me) as I was not expecting what happened.

The higher you climbed, the deeper you plunged.&quot; This sentiment could describe my reading experiences this year, until Baby, Oh Baby.

Jake's return to the fertility clinic (&quot;The clinic was sterile. Just like the patients who came here.&quot;) made me choke up. Annie's attention to &quot;signs&quot; and intuition was touching, not silly. Her steadfast resolve not to be second place was admirable: &quot;I want a no-holds-barred, not-holding-anything-back, in-it-with-everything-I've-got kind of love.&quot; The ending scene at the courthouse was perfect, and had me singing along...&quot;Baby, oh baby...&quot;"},{"Title":"Baby, Oh Baby!

(Time of Your Life)","review":"Based on a very modern premise (crooked fertility doctor uses sperm Jake and his now-dead wife had left at the clinic, to impregnate Annie, who comes looking for an anonymous donor for insemination), this book also uses the old \\"marriage of convenience\\" angle. Jake and Annie are as different as two people can be. Their conflict is huge: he believes he'll never love another woman like he loved his dead wife, and she has no intention of playing second best again, after having done so in her first marriage. Neither trusts the other and each fears the other will try to take baby Madeline away. Their attraction is undeniable, though. I loved being in each character's point of view. Wells does a great job of making us like and root for her characters, even those in the secondary romance plot. Jake's proposal just capped this story for me - it's the most original I've ever read. I got my awwwwsome ending.This book is a KEEPER."},{"Title":"Baby, Oh Baby! (Time of Your Life)","review":"Not sure how I stumbled onto this book - must have seen it on someone's Listmania list. Anyway, the reviews were positive and the story sounded intriguing and unusual. A man who lost his wife in a car accident discovers two years after her death that the fertility clinic they were using to have a baby had allowed his sperm to be used as a \\"donor\\" for another woman!Attorney Jake Chastaine has not been handling his wife's death well. He's become short-tempered, sarcastic and surly but that just masks the loneliness and sense of loss he feels. Imagine his outrage, not to mention his feeling of being cheated, when he discovers that his sperm was used to impregnate a woman he's never met - resulting in a little girl he never knew existed! Well that's going to change - and soon!Annie Hollister is a single mom (by choice) living a quiet life on her alpaca ranch and reading tea leaves for friends. When a gorgeous man shows up on her doorstep she assumes he's the nephew of friend here for a reading. Boy is she ever wrong. When he tells her that he is the father of baby Madeline, she is shocked to the core and the very real fear of losing her daughter or even having to share her with this stranger looms large and threatening. Their encounter shakes them both, with Jake throwing around threats of legal action and Annie simply panicking and contemplating fleeing the state.Once emotions, distrust and antagonisms lessen, they decide to try to compromise for the baby's sake, and in order to give Madeline an easier start in life (without having to explain her complicated conception all her life) they agree to marry for six months and then divorce. This way Madeline will have a more normal family background. But when feelings develop, what then? Annie feels she can't compete with the seeming perfection of his first wife's memory. While Jake is surprised to find himself attracted to Annie who is so different from practical, logical Rachel - and from himself. This could never work in the long-term - could it?This is the sweet story of quirky, free-spirited Annie and logical, buttoned-down Jake and how surprisingly right they just might be for one another. There's also the poignant secondary story of how Jake's in-laws, Tom and Susanna cope with their marital difficulties stemming from their still raw grief over the loss of their daughter, compounded by the news about baby Madeline and their very different reactions to that news.The author's sense of humor is a bit on the cornball, goofy, hokey side for my taste and at times seems forced (the billboards, the twinkies, his initial, stereotypical incompetence in caring for the baby) and kinda got on my nerves. But I found the story so interesting, and felt invested in the two relationships here - Jake & Annie and Tom & Susanna - that I didn't mind too much. A recommended read."},{"Title":"Baby, Oh Baby!

(Time of Your Life)","review":"Two years ago, Jake Chastaine had it all. A brilliant law career, wealth, and a beautiful wife. Then it all came crashing down when his parents and wife were killed in a car crash. Just as he's starting to move on, he discovers the fertility clinic he and his wife attended used his sample to get another woman pregnant. Anne Hollister enjoys her peaceful life on an Oklahoma ranch with her daughter. Until a stranger shows up claiming to be Madeline's father and wanting to be a part of her life. Can these two work things out for the better of a little girl? And can both move on from their past to love again?This was first published in 2001. Wells got her rights back and republished this story with a few modern corrections and additions. If, like me, you enjoy Wells, this is a must read, even if you read the previous addition.Wells writes with humor and wit, and with such an underlying sadness and reality you just get sucked right in. These two characters were smart and relatable. There was no misunderstanding and they resolved issues like adults. There wasn't a second that went by where I didn't root for them. These two deserved a happy ending. The daughter was adorable, and the secondary characters, Tom and Susannah, added to the story. The setting was detailed and researched. Most notable was this was a very dialog-driven plot that never lagged. Not to be missed."},{"Title":"Baby, Oh Baby! (Time of Your Life)","review":"This is one of Robins best. Starting with a screw-up and ending with a happy ever after, this book was a joy to read."},{"Title":"Baby, Oh Baby! (Time of Your Life)","review":"I am very careful about giving reviews. I won't do it unless I really love a book or hate it. In this case I love it. This is a story of a man in deep mourning for his wife and parents killed together in a car wreck. He and his wife were using a fertility clinic but after her death he forgot he had left a specimen behind. He was notified that his sperm had gotten someone else pregnant. He was outraged because this was a dream of his and his wife. When he meets the mother of the baby he thinks she is a fruitcake. Gradually her warm, loving personality begins its magic on him but he fights it because he is still so much in love with his wife. The book was such a nice surprise because it could have been another in a long line of \\"poor man he can't love again\\" books. Instead you understand why he has difficulty letting go and yet falling in love with his child and in lust with the mother. He fights his attraction to her for a long time. How they resolve this makes wonderful reading. There is another story along with this at how someone in the depths of despair can be vulnerable to a seductive predator and although there was some real sadness to overcome there is also a wonderful \\"gotcha\\". I hope this review will get you to buy this book and read a really good love story."},{"Title":"Baby, Oh Baby! (Time of Your Life)","review":"This is one of those rare romance books that just suck you in from the very beginning. There are actually two romances in one in this book. I actually found the secondary romance as good as the main one and that is not easy to find in a book. Usually you find yourself skipping over the second relationship because the first one is so much better.Actually, I think this book would adapt well as a movie. There were enough humorous parts to rival any of today's romantic comedies.If you haven't read this one, you're missing out. I'd give it 10 stars instead of the 5 allowed."},{"Title":"Baby, Oh Baby! (Time of Your Life)","review":"This book was hard to put down once I started it! It was heartwarming! Great Read!"},{"Title":"Baby, Oh Baby! (Time of Your Life)","review":"I find that GREAT contemporary romance novels are very hard to find. Robin Wells consistently delivers outstanding books and then some!I loved her book Prince Charming, but this one is even better! The cheesy cover does a complete disservice to this book. This story is actually very emotional and multi-layered with deep characters and a completely unique plot.I appreciate this author's humor. Her books contain many \\"laugh out loud\\" moments, which I find very rare. Delivering funny dialogue is a talent and Robin Wells has the gift. The refreshing thing about this book is that it has the perfect blend of humor, emotion, tension, and \\"feel good\\" moments. It also contains a secondary love story that adds to the story and doesn't overshadow it.This is a \\"making of a family\\" story. The kind of story that I like best. It had me glued to the pages and I devoured this book as fast as my eyes could read the words. This was pure reading entertainment and I'm so glad I've found this author who has yet to let me down."},{"Title":"Baby, Oh Baby! (Time of Your Life)","review":"I enjoyed this book. It wasn't a typical romance as it mostly dealt with Jake getting over the death of his first wife. It was also about his inlaws, Tom and Susana dealing with the death of their daughter.I liked Annie, I thought she was cute and smart, but I also felt the author tried too hard to make her a free spirit and at times she came off as a flake. Like her grandfather talking to her through billboards. That was a little much for me.Jake was a little too rigid and obsessed with having everything in order. He didn't seem to grow in this area as so much just decide, OK, things don't need to be orderly once he came to terms with Rachel's passing.I liked Susana, she was one of my favorite characters and I'm glad that she and Tom were given a story.Overall, I thought this was a good book, it was well written, moved quickly and was enjoyable. However, I felt too much time was spent on dealing with everyone's reaction to Rachel's death and how they hadn't come to terms with it over the past year. At times, it felt more like a book on coping than a romance."},{"Title":"Baby, Oh Baby! (Time of Your Life)","review":"This book proves that Robin Wells is getting better and better. Like other novels by the author that I have read, the hero and heroine are yet again all full of heart and energy. I also really enjoy Wells' secondary characters, who are always colorful, to say the least.Like her other novels, Wells' places her characters in extraordinary situations--situations which might have seemed too far-fetched to believe. But as other reviewers have mentioned, her hero and heroine are intelligent and believable, and work through their problems with a perfect blend of humor, pragmatism, and--of course--romance. It's always a little refreshing when an author of a romance novel can convincingly make her characters both passionate and sensible.My only complaint with the novel is Jake's father-in-law. While he certainly has had some heavy issues to deal with, I still found a lot of his actions inexcusable. I think Wells put herself into a tough spot, because she had a lot of redeerming to do in the end for the reader to feel sympathetic to this man. Personally, I wasn't convinced he deserved to be redeemed, but those of you more forgiving might not have as big of a problem with this.I've noticed that the author's writing style has improved also. She likes the metaphor a lot, but it's been toned down since her earlier novels. Also, if you enjoyed this book, I highly recommend \\"Babe Magnet\\" and also \\"Nine-to-Five Bride\\" (A Harlequin that may be hard to spot, but definitely worth the effort--my best flea market find!) They both take place in the author's hometown of New Orleans, which she writes about extremely well. In light of recent events, I reread the novels with a bittersweet feeling, remembering the amazing city along with the author."},{"Title":"Baby, Oh Baby! (Time of Your Life)","review":"I found this book on the recommendation of Amazon readers, and as usual, they were right on target. I really, really enjoyed this book. In fact, I very easily read this book in one sitting.This was a well-written, sometimes funny, sometimes sad, fast-paced contemporary, with very, very real characters. Since my preference is for excellent writing and realistic characters, this book really hit the spot for me.Although I do agree with some previous reviewers that parts of this book were a bit unrealistic, I think that the excellent writing made up for it. (In other words, you can write anything you want as long as you can convince me that it might have happened, and Robin Wells does such a good job that I almost believed it - well - almost.) For instance, Annie is five foot five, 115 pounds, and well endowed? Is that physically possible? Also, in the first few pages of this book, Ms. Wells describes a poor house as having a \\"smell of cabbage\\". I remember reading somewhere that in \\"old\\" England, all the poor houses smelled of cabbage because cabbage was the cheapest food, I don't quite think that would translate well into twentieth century United States.... Also, the mix-up in the baby clinic is a very common plot (I have read at least three other books with this plot), hopefully this is not so common in real life as it is in fiction!!! But I have to admit that Robin Wells did do it the best.What a mix-up! Jake has lost his dearly beloved and very much mourned wife Rachel two years ago, she was on the way to the fertility clinic for a procedure when the accident happened that took her life, and the life of both of her parents. So not only did Jake lose his wife and in-laws in one sweep, he lost the hope of children as well. Jake did not take this loss well.At the start of this story, Jake is on his way to the fertility clinic because he has gotten a notice reminding him to come by to be a donor \\"again\\", Jake has a very uneasy feeling about the \\"again\\" and is determined to find out what exactly is going on... What is going on is that he has a baby, and is the mother.Annie Hollister is living on the ranch she inherited from her grandfather, with her fourteen month old baby. Although she is good with fortunes in the tea leaves, it's a pity she can't read her own, and doesn't know that her life is about to change in a most fundamental way...I have to admit that the reason I gave this book five stars is absolutely because this book fits my personal preferences list so completely. I like a story with more than one plotline, I like a story with a tortured hero, I like a story where the h/h are so obviously really not meant for each at the beginning of the book, I like a story where the hero is a decent guy who tries to do the right thing, but is also a real person, I like a story where the heroine is a strong person on her own, and I especially like a well-written, realistic story. This book checks positive to my entire personal check list, and I loved it.If any of the above are your criteria as well, then you are sure to love this book."},{"Title":"Baby, Oh Baby! (Time of Your Life)","review":"When I saw the cover of this book (which didn't do the contents justice), I expected a frivolous, silly book. I was pleasantly surprised to find a well-written romance about complex characters, with sub-characters who were just as interesting and integral to the plot as the main characters. In some ways, I liked Tom and Susanna's story better than Jane and Annie's. It was so nice to see that, even after 30-plus years of marriage, a husband can find his wife sexy, and can find the strength to resist the temptation to stray. When Jake and Annie's first meeting ended so badly, I was so afraid the would engage in a vicious custody fight that would make any later reconciliation implausible. What was so nice is that Jake and Annie's friends helped them stay level-headed about their predicament, and concentrate on what was best for Madeline. Very well done, and I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Baby, Oh Baby! (Time of Your Life)","review":"Even though this book kept appearing on my recommendation list, I kept putting it off.

Lets speak Greek, worship Greek gods, write in Greek, structure our conquered territory based on Greek ideas and culture, setting up gymnasiums, theater, agoras..etc.. common on people!!! No conquerer has ever conquered a country or territory and then poof in an instant forgot his roots..I once heard someone use Rome as an example regarding its conquering of the ancient Greek city states and adopting Greek culture.Id like to point out that Rome never adopted Greek as its official language. Romans never adopted Greek names ( cicero ceasar aurelias are not greek)and most of all you can clearly see a distinction between Roman literature and Greek..3)Why did Alexander idolize Greek heroes such as Achilles, why did he keep a copy of the Illiad around as if it were his bible written by another Greek Homer..How is Aristotle his tutor Greek and Alexander isnt when they are both Macedonians?4) Why would the ancient Greeks place the home of their gods( Zeus Athena Poseidon etc) on MT OLYMPUS which is located in ancient Macedonia??Does it make sense for a people to place their holy sites in a foreign land???

Even my 9 year old figured out that the song following the child's narrative, was in her words \\"completely random\\".I don't know why the narrative wouldn't have a strong(er) relationship to the song. That aside, the songs chosen are perfect for very young children, under age 10. But there is no way you are going to \\"learn\\" Japanese by listening to this CD.

Frank Kermode provides a fascinating explanation of how the constraints of Victorian society limited the ways in which Trollope could write about &quot;sexual jealousy,&quot; and how a relatively mild (by today's standards) incident (here, calling a woman by her &quot;Christian&quot; (first) name) could be the basis for suspicion of &quot;infidelity.&quot; Kermode also provides an illuminating discussion comparing hero Louis Treveylan's obsession and jealousy with that of Othello. Finally, Kermode relates the novel to others of the period, both those by Trollope and those of his contemporaries.While the focus of the novel is the main character's mental deterioration resulting from his unreasonable jealousy and increasing isolation, both from society and reality, Trollope also provides a cast of interesting women faced with possible marriage partners. At a time when a woman's only &quot;career&quot; opportunity was to make a successful marriage, the women in He Knew He Was Right each react differently to the male &quot;opportunities&quot; that come their way. Kermode notes that Trollope was not a supporter of the rights of women, yet he manages to describe the unreasonable limitations on, and expectations of, women in a sympathetic light.The &quot;main story,&quot; of Trevelyan and his wife, is actually one of the least compelling of the man-woman pairings in the novel. What I mean is that while their story IS compelling, the others are substantially more so. This is a wonderful book. And, personally I'd like to note that I laughed out loud while reading it. This was on a cross-country airplane flight, and I got some strange looks for laughing at what appeared to be a thick &quot;serious&quot; novel."},{"Title":"He Knew He Was Right (Worlds Classics)","review":"In his autobiography, Trollope zips past this story. I couldn't put it down, and read the last 40 moving and exhausting pages aloud to my wife. The Pallisers can get a bit wearying at times, though I love them all. But there is nothing tiresome in here; this book roars with its two intersecting plots and the relatively unique idea of making a sympathetic character, one whom you truly care for and about, a complete, irredeemable fool.Several strong secondary characters, all just a little more complex than they seem, combine with a knock-out plot and vivid main characters, to make this my favorite Trollope novel. The man who will not accept the good around him but prefers to see the bad...? How's that for an eternal theme?"},{"Title":"He Knew He Was Right (Worlds Classics)","review":"This is the most dazzling of the ten Trollope novels I've read. The way the story unfolds is a marvel: a seemingly minor domestic disagreement mushrooms to envelope in-laws, family friends, policemen, lawyers, scrappy whist-playing old ladies in the country, Tuscan villagers, American bluestockings, kidnappers. And we watch a dozen Victorian women -- old, young, married, widowed, wooed and unwooed -- struggle for meaning and happiness in their lives under the impossible social and economic strictures governing their relations with men and each other. All of which is rendered with a light, confident touch free of cant or didacticism, and the interest and energy are sustained from first page to last. I especially loved the Stanbury group. Old Miss Stanbury, with her high principles and her foul mouth, is a wonderful creation.I would say, though, that to call the story a \\"study of sexual jealousy\\" is a bit of a strain. It's about what the title says it's about. It's more a study of male domination gone haywire, and of women's limited, but not negligible, power to resist it. I tend to accept Trollope's own judgment -- that in the character of Louis Trevelyan he failed to accomplish what he set out to do. But he greatly underrated how masterful is what he accomplished instead."},{"Title":"He Knew He Was Right (Worlds Classics)","review":"When most people think of Anthony Trollope they usually think of Glencora and Plantangenant Palliser but Trollope had other stories and this is one of the best. He Knew He Was Right is partially Othello set in Victorian London. Louis is insanely jealous and drives his wife to misery. The lady is innocent but thanks to gossip and a Iago figure Louis can't see reason. That's the main story but since this is Trollope there a host of deligtful side characters all bursting with life and stories of their own. I loved this book."},{"Title":"He Knew He Was Right (Worlds Classics)","review":"In the eyes of Louis Trevelyan, the attention that his wife gives to Colonel Osborne, a friend of her father's, looks like infidelity. The more Louis Trevelyan voices his suspicions and demands obedience, the more his wife stubbornly protests and resents her husband's lack of trust. This is the central conflict on which Trollope builds this novel, the situation that offers so much tension, and the disagreement that takes nearly 1000 pages to resolve.Similarities to Shakespeare's \\"Othello\\" are evident, and acknowledged by Trollope himself. Trollope does not attempt to include an Iago, however; instead he provides a noxious private investigator named Bozzle who is paid by Trevelyan to observe and report instances of the wife's supposed infidelity.Not every page in the book details what Trollope calls Trevelyan's \\"absurd obsession\\". Louis and Emily Trevelyan's marriage is contrasted to many that are in the offing or being proposed or being avoided throughout the narrative. As other reviewers have mentioned, it is a welcome shift in the narrative when the scene changes to Exeter where lives Miss Stanbury, an imperious elderly lady and a hapless young curate whose search for a wife inflames deadly rivalry between two sisters.Unfolding it all is Anthony Trollope, as genial and companionable an author as any from the nineteenth century. Giving every character what we call in Australia a \\"fair go\\", he even works the miracle of making a very minor character one of the most memorable. Priscilla Stanbury, ageing, impoverished and with no prospect of marriage, speaks of her sister's betrothal. \\"To enjoy life as you do is, I suppose, out of the question for me. But I have a satisfaction when I get to the end of the quarter and find that there is not half-a-crown due to any one. Things get dearer and dearer but I have a comfort even in that. I have a feeling that I should like to bring myself to the straw a day.\\" This prospect alludes to the farmer of the fable who reduced the fodder he gave his horse until at last it was surviving on a single straw a day. Then it died.Trollope's novels are wonderfully apt for reading aloud and for dramatizing. A successful TV adaptation of \\"He Knew He Was Right\\", directed by Tom Vaughan, appeared in 2004."},{"Title":"He Knew He Was Right (Worlds Classics)","review":"He Knew He was Right was authored by Anthony Trollope (1815-1882) after he had resigned his high position with the British Post Office. The novel is long but never boring. At the core of the novel is the tragic tale of Louis Trevelyn who wrongly insists his innocent as a dove wife Emily is reputedly carrying on a romantic liason with an old family friend Colonel Osborne.Along with the domestic tragedy of Trevelyns there is areseveral other stories of romance.a. The triangle between Emily's sister Nora and her suitorsMessrs Glascock and Hugh Stanbury.b. The choice Dorothy Stanbury must make between the oily clergyman Mr. Gibson and Mr. Brooke Burgess.c. An affair between Mr. Glascock and the American filly Caroline Spaulding touring Europe-fascinating comments on Anglo-American perceptions of each other's native lands!d. The hilarious tale of the oafish Rev. Gibson and the twosisters from \\"hell\\" Arabella and Camilla French. This guy is torn between two lovers who almost tear him apart in their jealous quest for his timorous soul!Perhaps the most memorable character is old aunt Stanbury who fascinates the reader with her ideas and matchmaking schemes in the West country town of Exeter.Trollope's novel was recently seen on a marvelous BBC production ! I was delighted when my AmaZon delivery arrived per request with a DVD of the series in addition to the novel!As an old English major I regret to say I never heard Trollope discussed! Why not? In my opinion he is in the top tier of Victorian novelists along with the inimitable Charles Dickens;the intellectual genius George Eliot; the Bronte sisters andThackery and Hardy.If you are only familiar with Trollope's Barsetshire andParliamentary novel series then add this winner to your readinglist. This novel is Trollope at the top of his game!"},{"Title":"He Knew He Was Right (Worlds Classics)","review":"For many people, Trollope is a writer to stay away from. They assume he wrote terribly twee novels about vicars and tea cosies (which is half true). But anyone who has read &quot;He Knew Was Right&quot; will know just how progressive and real Trollope is. This incredibly insightful study of a marriage reveals a great deal not only about Victorian society but about the eternal struggles between men and women. It's a mystery to me why this book is not better known."},{"Title":"He Knew He Was Right (Worlds Classics)","review":"Trollope is the ideal Victorian, celebrating the conventional, but with a thoroughly worldly appreciation of the darker side of human psychology that's best kept bottled up. In this novel, he promotes over and over -- with not just one but three admirable ingenues who live happily ever after -- the virtues of romantic marriage, while putting his fourth heroine in a catastrophic union where stubborn self-assertion leads to separation, irrational jealousy, parental kidnaping and tragic dissolution. All unfolds with Trollope's characteristic insightful, gentle and funny writing style. The novel's 822 pages turn as easily as an entertainment, but with enough moral gravitas and incisive description of the world of the 1860's to keep the reader thinking and pondering amidst the pleasure of reading this wonderful novel."},{"Title":"He Knew He Was Right (Worlds Classics)","review":"The main theme of this excellent novel is how the unreasonable jealousy a husband harbors towards his wife causes him to slide into madness. Louis Trevelyan falls in love with and marries Emily Rowley. An old friend of Emily's father, a Colonel Osborne, continues to pay visits to her after Trevelyan has complained and asked her to put a stop to it, which she refuses to do; what irks Trevelyan most is Osborne's insistence on calling his wife by her Christian name. When Emily can't stand her husband's jealous behavior anymore, she takes their small son and leaves him. Trevelyan is convinced his behavior was just and decides to kidnap their son to get him away from Emily. (This scene is the most exciting and dramatic scene in the book.) He goes to Italy with his son, where he goes totally mad. Emily follows, however, and gets him to return to England where he dies.There are many subplots (some critics believed there were too many of them), most of them having to do with various couples on the verge of marrying. Trollope was frequently a champion of his female characters, and that is certainly the case here, especially with regard to Emily. She is somewhat prideful, but that is her only fault. Other woman characters usually have very wise (and unflattering) things to say about men in general.Trollope wrote most of this book while visiting America for the second time, a visit he found much less appealing than his first; many of the American characters such as Jonas Spalding reflect some of Trollope's own displeasures. It's true that Trollope didn't care much for this novel, an opinion few would share with him (he was his own harshest critic). It is actually one of his very best books. His dissection of Trevelyan is brilliant and there's an excitement from the kidnapping of Louis to the end that is greater than in most of his other works. It's an excellent novel."},{"Title":"He Knew He Was Right (Worlds Classics)","review":"This is not one of Trollope's best novels, but it is one of his longest, at 99 chapters and over 800 pages. The subject is marriage and how to spoil it by jealousy and stubbornness and how to use self-fulfilling prophecies destructively.The marriage war is fought in times before level playing fields were introduced. Main heroine Emily Trevelyan is at a serious disadvantage in legal terms. Her husband can legally order her to obey him. Law is of course backed up by scripture. Divorce has only recently been made a legal option. (The book was written in 1867/68.)Rules for courtship among the upper strata of society are very detailed and strict, but not properly codified. Despite the lack of formal definitions, people generally know what is wrong or right, and only very rich or otherwise independent people have the guts to ignore or bypass the rules.Louis Trevelyan is the man of the novel's title, the one who knew he was right. Men are good at knowing they were right. I know what I am talking about. I am right most of the time. It is a heavy burden.Apart from the Trevelyans' conflict, which is at the centre of the plot, we observe several other women's situations. There is Emily's sister Nora, who is somewhat in love with her impecuniary hero Hugh, while a rich man courts her. Her rejection of the rich man has similarities to James' Isabel Archer in Portrait of a Lady.There is Hugh's rich aunt Jemima; she was jilted in youth by a banker, but then made rich by her jilter in his testament. Now, as a rich old maid, she is the terror of the family and the meanest Tory caricature that I have met in Trollope so far. Her mission in life is interference. She wants to link up Hugh's meek sister Dorothy with her favorite clergyman.While the side shows develop in their various ways, the main show goes deeper down the ditch step by step. The main difference to modern times is the concept of \`obedience' in marriage, which one doesn't hear much about nowadays. However it has not vanished entirely, as I know from a few examples. Apart from this aspect of changing times, the mechanisms of matrimonial quarrels as developed here are remarkably fresh."},{"Title":"He Knew He Was Right (Worlds Classics)","review":"A fan once wrote that this was one of her favorite novels and said \\"There is nothing wrong with this book,\\" which I thought a backhanded compliment. After several months, I ordered the book anyway.I enjoyed it immensely. It is a classic of the first degree. Who would have thought Trollope was 'laugh-out-loud' like this? Trollope and George Eliot are to Jane Austen as Dos Passos is to Doctorow: they tells similar stories with much greater texture and commentary - and at greater length. Neither is necessarily better: my wife greatly prefers the rich interior point of view of Austen, while I prefer Trollope and Eliot and Dos Passos. But life is richer for having read them all."},{"Title":"He Knew He Was Right (Worlds Classics)","review":"One of Trollope's most successful later novels, this is a study of marriage and sexual relationships cast against a background of agitation for women's rights. Basically a novel of obsessive jealousy and the disintegration of a marriage. Trite, but with the unusual Trollope signature writing, you won't even notice."},{"Title":"He Knew He Was Right (Worlds Classics)","review":"Wow! This is probably not the typical novel that one would chose to read for their first Trollope novel, but I did. This was an amazing book from start-to-finish. I found myself not being able to put it down and at over 800 pages a true page-turner nonetheless. Trollope was able to profoundly display human emotion and what power it can have on someone's own mental health. It is an amazing, yet tragic example of what the mind can do. It is well worth the read to see how love can truly cause insanity, as the book follows a man throughout his journey into madness. Read it and you won't be disappointed. In fact, you will probably want to read more Trollope novels, as I am doing now. What an amazing writer who certainly seems under appreciated. This novel is a paradigm of what excellent Victorian literature is and is one of my personal favorites."},{"Title":"He Knew He Was Right (Worlds Classics)","review":"A far better book than the BBC movie. i enjoyed it immensely even though it is long.

I was overwhelmed at first by the length but it read easily and was so absorbing !"},{"Title":"He Knew He Was Right (Worlds Classics)","review":"\\"He Knew He Was Right\\" is my first Anthony Trollope novel and my was it a rich and lively read. The main characters are tragically torn apart from a viscous circle of jealousy from the husband, stubbornness from the wife and kidnapping their son from one another over an imagined affair the wife was not having. Considered back then...a cad of a man that was an old friend of a young wife's father made repeated visits and sent personal letters to her, that she felt entitled to because this Col. Osborne had known her since she was a baby. All of this was much to her new husband's dislike. Matters became worse when both husband (Louis) and wife (Emily) had people meddling into their business; some out of concern, others with pure venom. Back in 1860 it was improper in polite society for a man to address a woman by her first name unless he was her husband or immediate family member. It was also scandalous for a single man to call on a married woman for a social visit, especially without her husband being present. Imaginations ran in the gutter and many opted to assume adultery could be the only reason because women were so much weaker than men and could be talked into anything.This hint of impropriety between Emily and Col. Osborne from Louis sets off Emily's temper and stubbornness against him. This only fuels Louis's suspicions and his sexual jealousy that eventually destroys him with madness. Rich in developed characters, sub plots, engaging dialogs and descriptive narration; Trollope can hold a candle next to Dickens. Ah, I felt sorry for Louis Trevelyan. He wasn't asking his wife Emily for anything unreasonable in the beginning.This is a very well written novel and I'm excited to read more of Anthony Trollope. \\"The Way We Live Now\\" and his \\"Barsetshire Novels.\\""},{"Title":"He Knew He Was Right (Worlds Classics)","review":"The book is by Anthony Trollope, not John Sutherland. Brilliant study of pathological jealousy, with many charms besides."},{"Title":"He Knew He Was Right (Worlds Classics)","review":"Anthony Trollope considered He Knew He Was Right not to be a particular success, in fact he considered that he had failed in that he was unable to make a sympathetic central character, that of the increasingly jealous, crazed Louis Trevelyan. It is less a story about sexual jealousy as it is about a certain sort of Victorian idea that a man was owed complete obedience and submission on the part of his wife. Starting from this presupposition, the anti-hero of the novel builds a case against his wife that has far-reaching and disastrous results.All Trollope novels are in a sense about marriages: their common dramatic end is at the wedding altar. He Knew He Was Right is interesting in that its central story is about the collapse of a marriage, and the sub-plots revolve around that drama. As much as I respect Trollope, I think he was wrong about this book. It is extremely engrossing, often very dramatic, even harrowing, and yet much of it is also charming and downright funny. He was such a master of situation and dialog, and this novel was written in the late 1860s when he was at the top of his game. I might not put it among my favorite Trollope books, such as the Barchester series or The Way We Live Now, but you couldn't go wrong here.The Penguin edition has a wonderful introduction and excellent notes."},{"Title":"He Knew He Was Right (Worlds Classics)","review":"I was happily surprised by this book. Given the snyopses, I expected the usual woman-as-victim-of-cruel-husband trope. Instead, the book presented a complex marriage, with both parties at fault; in fact, to me, the wife was in the wrong and was abusing her privileges for at least three quarters of the novel.The secondary and tertiary characters were well drawn, entertaining, and captivating. Trollope managed to convey myriad nuances of the male-female dynamic, avoiding stereotypes and common topicalities of many Victorian novels.Enjoyed this one a lot."},{"Title":"He Knew He Was Right (Worlds Classics)","review":"Admittedly, I've only read THE WAY WE LIVE NOW and HE KNEW HE WAS RIGHT. And although THE WAY WE LIVE NOW might academically speaking, be a tighter, better constructed novel, HE KNEW HE WAS RIGHT is a lot more fun. The beginning (first 100, 200(?) pages) is slow. The whole book hinges on Louis's unfounded jealousy and Emily's unfounded obstinacy. But, once past that, the novel is wonderful. I wanted every character, save Louis, to come to good fortune.In THE WAY WE LIVE NOW most of the characters are pretty despicable -- and intentionally so.Of course in HE KNEW HE WAS RIGHT, you have to be willing to submit to the Victorian novel conceit. But if you enjoy Victorian novels as I do, this is a good one.Again, I have to stress that it's not MIDDLEMARCH, say. But if you're not a critic, but enjoy reading, then get it immediately."},{"Title":"He Knew He Was Right (Worlds Classics)","review":"This story is widely depicted as a story of irrational jealousy and distrust -- that of a married man unreasonably jealous of the attentions of another gentleman's attentions to his wife, and the married man's distrust of his wife's protestations of innocence.It is far more interesting a story if one knows that Trollope, himself, engaged in such a relationship while married, having fallen in love with a woman (considerably his junior)-- a Miss Kate Field, whom he met while visiting his mother. Apparently he visited her in America without his wife, wrote many letters to her, and eventually introduced her to his wife on a subsequent visit.One may speculate, then, that the relationship with Miss Fields, while close, and often written about as one of unconsumated love, may have caused Trollope's own wife to exhibit what he considered to be irrational jealousy and distrust, especially since his marriage vows are said not to have been broken with Miss Fields.It is left, therefore, to the reader, both of his autobiography and of his novels, to determine the more interesting question of whether \\"infidelity\\" can entail attachments of the spirit as well as those of the flesh, and whether this novel is not a reflection of the novelist's own marital difficulties, and, perhaps, of his attempt to rationalize his own behavior."},{"Title":"Natural Theology ; Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity.

Chapter One lays the foundation for Paley's argument for God's creation serving as the source of life and species. He poses two situations: if one stumbles upon a rock and questions its source, \\"it has, perhaps, been there forever\\" seems a rational answer; if one finds a watch laying on the ground, the explanation for the source of the rock seems to fail as an explantion for the source of the watch. The balance of the book is devoted to pointing out the fallacy of assuming that life could emanate from chance happenings. This book is a \\"must read\\" for Creation apologists, and it provides a challenging test to those who would rely on evolution as an explanation of the source of life.

The prose is elegant, the examples and arguments well crafted, the conclusions precisely stated, and all without either the pious condescension or angry threats typical of much religious apologetics. Paley engages the reader with his sympathetic tone, startling analogies, and shining sincerity.The second reason is that this is one of the most influential books ever written.

This particular title saw multiple formats and printings over the years, but as far as I can tell, the table of contents remained consistent. An introduction by Barry Malzberg and a quick intro by Knight lead to 22 short stories from the period 1949 - 1973. Each story has a brief foreword by Knight that provides some informative and/or entertaining background. The stories primarily fit into the Twilight Zone mold of nightmare scenarios or twist endings; in fact, \\"To Serve Man\\" was adapted into one of the more popular episodes of the classic TV series. Included are:Not With a BangTo Serve ManCabin BoyAnaloguesBabel IISpecial DeliveryThing of BeautyAnachronExtemporeBackward, O TimeLast WordMan in The JarThe EnemyEripmavLikely StoryTime EnoughMaryThe HandlerThe Big Pat BoomSemper FiMasksDown ThereKnight had a marked talent for blending science fiction and horror, often with a darkly humorous edge. In that regard, his style has a lot in common with that of fellow Twilight Zone veteran Richard Matheson. But he also wrote novels and some highly-regarded literary criticism, in addition to being an editor. He squeezed a lot of output into his 79 years, and while this collection doesn't give a comprehensive overview of his work, it's a good way to brush up on his style. While the set-up of every story is very well-done, some of them either don't progress very well or end with a \\"thud\\", so they're not all gems - considering Knight was a very outspoken literary critic, I'd be interested in reading some critiques of HIS work.The jacket cover of the Nelson Doubleday hardback from 1976 was illustrated by the great Richard Corben. His interpretation of a scene from \\"To Serve Man\\" owes quite a bit to the Twilight Zone adaptation. Let's just say that the aliens of Knight's story are nothing like the humanoid giants we saw on television, but they are no less bizarre."},{"Title":"Writing Women's Worlds: Bedouin Stories","review":"This book gives intimate details of the events most important to the women involved-- family dynamics, marriage, childbirth, and so forth. Because Ms. Abu-Lughod seems to have become almost a member of the family, the book reads like an insider's rather than outsider's account. It is affectionate without becoming sentimental or lacking in objectivity."},{"Title":"Writing Women's Worlds: Bedouin Stories","review":"In the preface to the new edition, Lila Abu-Lughod confesses that her book failed to reach its public. It was \\"billed as a book about women and an experiment in feminist ethnography\\", and its key messages failed to pass through. In any case, she may have tried to kill too many birds with one stone. As she recalls, \\"in Writing Women's Worlds, I used the narratives, arguments, and everyday lives of some individual families living on Egypt's northwest coast to try to do three things: to confront my discipline of anthropology with the ways it has tended to typify cultural groups, to challenge public discourse about women of the Muslim Middle East, and to show Western feminists that defining patriarchy is not at all a simple matter.\\"The three imagined audiences implied in that statement--fellow anthropologists, writers about women in the Middle East, and Western feminists--broadly belong to the same group: academics, to use a shorthand. It is this targeted public that the book failed to reach, eliciting few reviews and even less scholarly debate. So the author feels compelled, in the new preface written \\"for the twenty-first century\\", to restate and to clarify her key messages.She thinks that what Writing Women's Worlds has to offer has become all the more urgent in the new context within which these intended audiences might now read a book like this. Anthropologists should discard the concept of culture as they did with the notion of race because \\"the concept lends itself to usages so apparently corrupting of the anthropological ones as the pernicious theses of Samuel Huntington's clash of civilizations\\". In light of the heightened obsession with the \\"oppressed Muslim woman\\", in the name of which wars are wielded as in Afghanistan, she feels it is her duty to give voice to some of these Muslim women, and to illustrate \\"what Islam means in one particular place at one particular time\\". Although sympathetic to the feminist cause, she refuses to attribute to the women in her book forms of consciousness or politics that are not part of their experience, and she thinks that their stories of family, honor, piety and modesty, can \\"complicate\\" some widely held views and \\"talk back\\" to feminists and their agenda.So in Lila Abu-Lughod's view, shared by the editors of the University of California Press, her book deserves a second chance. The spirits of the times, which highlight the urgency of the message, are also more auspicious to its reception. The novel style, which the author labels \\"narrative ethnography\\", has since then become more common in anthropology. Other scholars, such asSaba MahmoodorLara Deeb, have written books about the islamic revival that also \\"talk back\\" to the feminist agenda, which too often conflates description and prescription. And Abu-Lughod's thinking has also evolved, allowing her to be more explicit and specific about arguments that were only hinted at and suggested in her original narrative.But books, once published, have a life of their own, and they sometimes reach unintended publics or are put to uses the author did not think about. In her new preface, Lila Abu-Lughod tells of the many e-mails she received from readers, mostly students, who wanted to know what happened to the individuals they had come to know through the book. These readers were not primarily interested by discussions about feminism, ethnographic writing, or the concept of culture. They read the book as they would have a fiction or a documentary, and they were eager to learn what happened \\"in real life\\". This tendency is sometimes seen by some writers as problematic, because of the need to protect the private life of people who confided to the ethnographer from voyeurism.In a way, the author had already anticipated that concern. She notes that \\"in a sad way the women whose stories I retell here are not the audience of this book\\"; and yet she is preoccupied with the reception of her writings in Egypt and in the local community depicted in the book. She worries that she has \\"made public the narratives that women told only to specific others and has made permanent what was meant to be fleeting\\". She notes that \\"In an age when the boundaries of \\"culture\\" have become difficult to keep in place, when books travel, and when global politics appear increasingly uncertain, we have to anticipate the uncomfortable irony that our most enlightened endeavors might not be received as such by the subjects of our writings\\". And indeed in the preface written in 2007, she records a meeting with a young woman related to her host family who was studying sociology in Alexandria University and who grilled her with questions and comments."},{"Title":"Writing Women's Worlds: Bedouin Stories","review":"A very insightful look into a world that many of us would never otherwise venture into.

I now see that Mazur is simply horrible at logically conveying her very complicated literary opinions. She also just might be too smart for her own good, but she should still be able to make a coherent point. Mazur continually runs the reader in circles with her overly complicated sentence structures and writing style, and worse, she never really makes concrete conclusions to follow her already incomplete theses.Here is an appropriate analogy to put Krystyna Mazur in a nutshell: She is like that kid that sits in the front row of class, thinks he's super smart...and so he talks a lot. The first few days you listen to him, because it sounds somewhat good and seems to know what he's talking about. But then the more you listen, the more it becomes apparent that even though he has a seemingly impressive vocabulary, he never actually says anything meaningful. Then you begin to wonder if he is even using these words you've never heard correctly. Eventually it gets to the point where every time that kid speaks in class, I roll my eyes and try not to groan out loud.Hope this helps."},{"Title":"INFRARED DETECTORS & SYSTEMS","review":"I quite like this book.For example, it has a very nice discussion of radiometry.

It is sensitive and detailed in its description of the highs and lows of growing up. The underlying theme of this book ( and many others by Lynne Reid Banks ) is that of conflict and reconciliation. In Kate's life these are between parents and children, brothers and sisters, the upper, middle and lower classes, Jews and Non-Jews, Kate and her friends, teachers and relations, and the strong conflict between men and women.For me a defining moment in the book takes place on a family outing to the British Museum where Mr Dunhill finds Kate and her mother discussing Kate's new boyfriend. He rolls his eyes dramatically (well, he is an actor ) and calls upon Heaven to witness that women have no earthly right to claim equality with men when they cannot keep their minds off sex even when surrounded by the greatest works of civilisation.( And you'll have to read the book to find out Mrs Dunhill's clever retort ! )As we experience the full richness of emotion with Kate, the reader sees that this is an accurate and lovely portrait of teenage life, especially for anyone nostalgic for the 1970's.I strongly recommend this book and any other by Lynne Reid Banks , particularly The L-Shaped Room"},{"Title":"The Sperm Engine","review":"Ah - The Sperm Engine - Stephen Greco's debut success! This nasty little treasure, is a compilation of erotic journal entries, short fiction and narrative essays, with enough dirt for your inner voyeur to feast upon for weeks. After all, what else do you do with your inner voyeur? Offer to play a game of catch?Greco certainly is an acquired taste for those who prefer the memoir/essayist, David Sedaris. But for those for decide to take the risk, they will find that Greco is as witty and creative, if not a lot more risque. Alas, one shoud not catagorize this as plain erotica, though many of the chapters contain greatly detailed sex acts and thoughts. Greco tends to tell a greater story using erotica as a mere literary tool to help push his story along. His first chapter, gives an intense testimony to meeting his partner in the cruising grounds of a Brooklyn park and is handled very bluntly, where the reader mouth will drop open in pure shock and amusement. However other chapters confess darker tones, such as a story devoted to a character's last act of intimacy with his dying lover in a hospital bed. Greco explores more of the human frailty and conflict through sexuality. Not only does he share some of his most intimate secrets, but some of his wizdom as well.Of course, memoir and fiction certainly do interwine within this book and it can be difficult to distinguish which stories are fiction and which are not. One particular fiction piece, \\"Men and their Issues\\", follows the storyline of about 15-20 different characters over the course of one evening - some of the characters being humurously created and others more tragic.The \\"Sperm Engine\\" is a truely excellent read, blending in dramatic memoir, humour and erotica together. This may not be a book to read through in one sitting, but perhaps to be savored over several nights and reads."},{"Title":"The Sperm Engine","review":"I never thought I would get addicted to this book in the way that I did. As a hetero female, I assumed I wasn't the target audience. And I'm not. But that's besides the point. The stories are so engaging, so honest and funny that they transcend gay porn or erotic fiction. They're fascinating stories--a truly spectacular entree into the world of the penis."},{"Title":"The Sperm Engine","review":"I'm sure the 'Did you find this review helpful?' patrol will vote me off the island, but this is absolutely the WORST collection of erotica I've ever read... and I've read (er um) lots.Look elsewhere... this one's a snooze."},{"Title":"The Sperm Engine","review":"This book is so boring that doctors should recommend it to those with insomnia because it'll put you right to sleep. Billed as an erotic book of essays, it did not succeed with its task.The author seems to dwell in his promiscuity, but bores us with stories about his furniture and odd stains on his upholstery instead of telling us how those stains got there.In another essay he tells of his dying lover in the hospital and the last time they performed together, then, at the funeral, his lover's nurse comes to tell him that he was &quot;with&quot; the lover several times--and the author thought that was comforting. Yet there were no details of any of these couplings.There is a point when trying to write erotica intelligently, which I am all for, that the writer inadvertantly eradicates all hints of passion and heat. The author completely leaves his readers cold and unmoved and still not in the mood, which is unfortunate. This book could have been very steamy and still maintained its dignity had the writer moved into the scenes and relived the physicality of his sessions. But no, we are to read about distant memories that have no feeling or touch attached.Instead of this book being labeled and marketed as erotica, it should have been listed as autobiographic...and if these are the highlights of a life, I feel sorry for the subject--how can one lead a life so boring?"},{"Title":"Butterick's 1892 Metropolitan Fashions","review":"If you enjoy costume and accuracy this is a catalog with a snap shot in time.

This is a book published only last month (Oct. 2005). One of its most outstanding features for someone seriously considering relocation to La Belle France is what appears to be very recent and deailed information (in both Euros and dollars) calculated per square meter for the most part but it has tables for converting to feet) of what it takes to buy or rent in 5 different areas of France that are most popular with foreigners who have been coming to France to live in recent years in large numbers: Paris and its surroundings (Ile-de-France), Normandy and Brittany, Burgundy and the Rhone Valley, the Midi and Languedoc, and (last but not least) Provence and the Cote d'Azur. And he breaks down different towns and cities from the most high priced desirable areas to the least: e.g., in Bordeaux: \\"Away from the river and in less expensive neighborhoods, the price drops. You can find apartments for 800-1800 Euros ($1080-2430) per square meter. etc.)\\" This is really impressively detailed for all the areas he discusses and is highly useful information that might be hard to find anywhere else really. Of course, it will become outdated fast, but for latter 2005, this is great stuff to have.Link gives you some very sensible ideas for planning your fact finding trips, dealing with red tape in France (lots and lots) when you make your move, how to move with kids, pets, the kinds of insurance you need, job hunting, cost of living info, learning French, etc.--in short a very good summary of what it takes to move to this beautiful but (\\"complex--he didn't know about the riots of October and November 2005) from an American who has lived in the country for (I think) 13 years or so. Other books I have looked at of this kind seem to be written primarily for British expats and fairly youthful ones at that, not Americans, whereas as this one seems to be aimed at us Yanks as well (and the author is after all an American) and not just those who are sent by a corporation to work for a year or two. It's also good for somebody traveling to France and wanting some nice descriptive summaries of different regions of the country. The only thing lacking maybe is that it leaves out certain regions (perhaps for reasons of book size?) in the center of the country that might now be the best bargains. And while it does include a few thumbnail profiles of expats who have made the move, I would have welcomed a few more.Anyway, if this book is any indication, anyone considering retirement abroad (like me) would do well to invest in the Living Abroad series. I may buy the Italy volume next!"},{"Title":"Living Abroad in France","review":"I have visited France many times but have never lived there for an extended period of time, but have recently thought about the possibility of relocating there. This book has provided me with a good overview, though probably outdated concerning cost now with the advantage of a stronger dollar. I enjoyed reading about someday being part of the French dedication to living and what would be expected of me as an expat. Concerning some of the red-tape discussed, for anyone seriously considering relocating, it would probably require more comprehensive information than this book offers.

He is truly a noble, gifted, psychological author depicting a by-gone era but including timeless insights about human beings and their general and mental situations in his writings. He is a master of lengthy prose (too lengthy for some!) These Library of America editions of James's writings are wonderful, high-quality, unabridged books with expert editing (notes) at the back of the volume. They have a knack for selecting the best editions of the author's writings where more than one version was published in the author's lifetime. The short stories of this volume are from the mature period but before James' final developed style of fictional writing. There are a large number of stories including many wonderful gems such as &quot;Owen Wingrave,&quot; &quot;The Coxon Fund&quot; and &quot;In the Cage.&quot; To be fair, most of the stories were written quickly for magazines, and a few (&quot;Glasses&quot; comes to mind) just aren't good stories at all, in my opinion. However, most of the stories do succeed quite well. &quot;Owen Wingrave&quot; (criticized by Bernard Shaw as being too deterministic and neglecting free will) is actually a penetrating tale about military culture, military values, and the role of the military in the nineteenth-century world. &quot;The Coxon Fund&quot; is about a brilliant lecturer supported by the fund but whose life and the lives of his supporters are full of pitfalls outside of the Fund's influence. The story shows how the successes and failures of the Fund (and the Lecturer) have subtle and not-so-subtle ramifications for each of the characters. With &quot;In the Cage&quot;, the author steps outside of his accustomed higher-class and higher-educated mix of characters to present the plight of a penetrating lower-class telegram processor and her insights on life and her suitor. I found it a nice rendition of late-nineteenth century London. I encourage readers to explore this and other Library of America editions of James' writings."},{"Title":"Henry James: Complete Stories, 1892-1898 (Library of America)","review":"During the 1890s, Henry James was a proper Englishman with special knowledge about the cousins on the other side of the water. Americans continue to crop up in the stories. So do ghosts. Several among the 21 stories in this volume 4 of LoA's edition of James stories have ghostly elements. HJ generally treads lightly in this field though, there is no cheap horror.'Nona Vincent' is a story about a play and a platonic triangle between the writer, his lead actress, and his benefactress. There is a mild ghost element, or is it a dream? Very much tongue in cheek.At the time of writing this story, HJ was himself trying to set foot on the stage as a playwright. He failed. He was not destined to be a stage star. Several of these stories are stagey.'The Real Thing': a painter tells us of a couple whose mission in life is looking good for photos and paintings. Too bad for the couple that they are not good at it. This story might be considered funny, but HJ doesn't normally do Schadenfreude.'The Private Life'. In a Swiss resort hotel a group of English tourists of the better sort meet 'by accident'. Funny, and a bit ghostly. We have a man who seems to exist in 2 permutations (the brilliant writer and the boring conversationalist) and another one who doesn't seem to exist at all, at times.'Lord Beaupre', a comedy about the marriage hunt. The scheming mother gets upended by her son and daughter.I find that HJ is at times entertaining even when he has nothing to say. One can still focus on the artful mischievous turn of the sentence.'Sir Dominik Ferrand', in the line of the earlier master piece The Aspern Papers, about the privacy rights of dead celebrities. Aspiring young writer buys used desk and finds 27 compromising letters written by a historic person. What to do with the treasure? HJ is a protector of privacy.'Collaboration', 'Owen Wingrave' , and 'The Wheel of Time' became a book together and I have reviewed it separately. An interesting but imperfect threesome.Similarly, 'The Middle Years' was packaged with 'The Death of the Lion', 'The Coxon Fund', and 'The Altar of the Dead' as 'Terminations'. I was less than enchanted with these stories, which are overcrowded and lack pace and simplicity.Then things look up again. The next 4 stories will be packaged together as 'Embarrassments' in 1896. They are fun. 'The Next Time' is a farcical tale around the question whether literary quality requires or maybe even guarantees lack of success. Quote: there are people who can't be vulgar for trying. Clearly about HJ himself.'Glasses' is a portrait of a pretty and naive young woman, a gold-digger.'The Figure in the Carpet' is a hoax of the kind found in the Aspern Papers.'The Way It Came' is a sophisticated and subtle ghost story. Or is it a story of insane jealousy? We will never know.Then comes the ghostly 'Turn of the Screw', a master piece of the genre. I have reviewed it separately.Followed by 'Covering End', a long story, a comedy about the old subject, Brits and Americans. It reads like a stage play and it takes an effort to get into. Machinations about ownership of an old mansion. Not convincing at all, ponderous language not matching the lightweight content.Finally 'In the Cage', another long story, about a woman who works in a telegraph office and who thinks about her customers' lives, based on the cables that cross her desk. Unusual for its working class setting, but not really convincing. Gissing would have done it better.In summary, while there are some pearls in this collection, the overall impression is a little disappointing."},{"Title":"Henry James: Complete Stories, 1892-1898 (Library of America)","review":"Despite the objections that readers may raise as to style (difficult, convoluted) and his sometimes limited subject matter, Henry James remains one of the Great American writers, and also one of the most prolific. The mountain of fiction James created is truly impressive and almost consistently interesting. Library of America has dedicated multiple volumes to James, excluding only (as far as I am aware) his \\"dramatic\\" efforts, which were by and large a failure, if not a disaster. Consistent with its approach, LoA has published all of James's short stories in 5 volumes, organized by date of composition/publication. The present volume covers 1892-98, a fertile period for James's short fiction, encompassing the final years of his theatrical efforts and somewhat before his most difficult final period (i.e, The Golden Bowl, and others). This volume includes a number of stories that should be in ANY compilation of James's stories, including The Turn of the Screw, The Real Thing, The Figure in the Carpet, In the Cage, and others. It also is interesting to note that, at this point in his career, James's stories increasingly were concerned with loss, mortality, and ruminations on the \\"legacy\\" of an artist, for example \\"Greville Fane,\\" \\"The Middle Years,\\" \\"The Death of the Lion,\\" \\"The Alter of the Dead,\\" and \\" The Figure in the Carpet.\\" The volume is done with LoA's usual quality and is certainly a worthy publication. My only reservations are these. First, if you are looking for a volume that includes the \\"best\\" of James's stories, you don't specifically care about this \\"period,\\" and you do not intend to collect or read all 5 LoA volumes of stories amounting to something like 4000 pages, you are probably better off with an anthology that covers all of James's writing career. Second, LoA has consistently followed a philosophy of letting the works speak for themselves, with little (if any) critical commentary or guidance, except for very good chronologies of the authors' lives. I certainly respect and understand this approach, and an interested reader can relatively easily acquire useful criticism or commentary from other sources. However, with James, perhaps more than some other LoA authors, some critical input would be quite valuable. For example, taking only The Turn of the Screw, the various interpretations are diverse and fascinating in their own right: is it a simple (relatively speaking) ghost story? Is the governess mentally unstable and the victim of repressed sexuality? It would go beyond the bounds of the LoA format fully to address these issues, but it might be useful if the volume at least gave the reader a \\"heads up\\" about the various interpretations and their sources.With those small reservations, this is a very good volume and a good place to start if you are deeply interested in James's shorter fiction. If anyone happened to pick up this volume, or read this comment, looking for a thesis or paper topic, for what it is worth, you could do worse than to think about James's short fiction on the artist, mortality and the artist's legacy and take special note of the stories cited above."},{"Title":"Henry James: Complete Stories, 1892-1898 (Library of America)","review":"The short stories of Henry James are a microcosm of his novels: bafflingly complex, syntactically convoluted, and thematically multi-layered. He wrote more than 100 between 1864 and 1910, of which perhaps a few dozen are much read today. Complicating any discussion of his short prose is to define \\"short.\\" Many of his short stories are long enough to qualify as novellas but regardless of the length, any fiction of Henry James promises to take the reader into the world of the microverse, a highly stylized and internalized arena where action counts less than thought and \\"how\\" far more than \\"what.\\" For those who come to his short fiction after having read, say THE GOLDEN BOWL or THE AMBASSADORS, such readers have learned patience, secure in the knowledge that the inner workings of the mind are surely more interesting than the slam-bang world of reality.There are a few themes that James uses often both in his short and long fiction. He likes to place cultured and intelligent protagonists in an alien environment just to watch them squirm on a foreign alter, or what is more sinister, to maintain them in a familiar ground, only to change the laws of physics or rationality--and then watch them squirm. He employs the doppelganger, or double of the protagonist, one who might be his present or future version, or again more sinister, one who might be a spectral reincarnation. Many of James' heroes fear marriage and must battle an encrusted society that demands it. James was also fascinated with innocence, especially in children and child-like adults. In such stories, the world exists only to corrupt such innocence. Finally, James rarely used one theme in isolation. He much preferred to onion his stories with overlapping themes, all of which are centered on James' rich and allusive prose style, allowing him to meld the complexity of content with the complexity of style. I have chosen a few of his short prose fiction as examples of the quintessential Henry James.In \\"The Aspern Papers,\\" James writes of a narrator who must balance the need to obtain art (the papers of the deceased American poet Aspern) while maintaining his ethics while so doing. The narrator travels to Venice for these papers only to discover that their current owners are quite unwilling to give them up. He promises to marry one of them in return for their delivery to him, thinking all the while they are too nave to see through his scheme. In the end, he tries to steal them, only to learn that they have burned them, one page at a time. James' narrator is one of a long series of such who speak of integrity more than show it.In \\"The Jolly Corner,\\" James uses the \\"double\\" of the protagonist to point out how one man's life could have been had things been different. Spencer Brydon, an American expatriate returns to America, only to meet his ghostly alter ego, one who Brydon might have become had he stayed at home. Perhaps James had in mind Lambert Strether of THE AMBASSADORS, who is also the model of what the alter ego might have been: a money-grubbing capitalist with no one to tell him \\"Live!\\"James uses \\"The Pupil\\" to depict the loss of childhood innocence. The caddish and grifting transplanted American Moreen family hires fellow American Pemberton to tutor their son. They refuse to pay him agreed on wages, all the while exhorting him with the nobility of his task. They offer him custody of their son, which he understandably refuses, but the boy is crushed since he favors Pemberton over his parents.Art versus life come into conflict in \\"The Real Thing.\\" The narrator is hired by a couple, punningly named the Monarchs, to paint them as exemplars of the \\"real thing\\" of nobility. It is his realization that the reality of their claim does not allow him to create the illusion of a second-rate knock off. He is unwilling to further society's need to measure a life by glorifying its phony aspect.In these stories and in Henry James' others, he presents the reader with a subjective examination of the inner workings of the mind. For those readers who wish to enter such a microverse, they will find that James' admittedly baffling style will be seen as more as a part of that journey than an impediment."},{"Title":"Henry James: Complete Stories, 1892-1898 (Library of America)","review":"Why is Amazon listing this book, Henry James: Complete Stories 1892-98 as available new?

He keeps a quote from the Shakers on his dresser: &quot;No vice is with us the less ridiculous for being in fashion.&quot; A poet and publisher for fifty years hand-runnin', Williams also occasionally takes to the ramparts of out and out prose to express his disdain and delight with matters of appetite of all kinds: for food, bottled spirits, sexual matters, literature, photographs, &quot;outsider art,&quot; and more. Blackbird Dust collects nearly four dozen of these &quot;knot gardens,&quot; as he calls them, as well as a few of his own photographs. Williams thinks of himself as a curmudgeon, because his opnions are personal, thorny and at times sarcastic. Some of his subjects may seem a bit too personal---the beauty of Welsh in poetic motion, for instance---but Williams' saving grace, his interest snare is just his thorny (at times even towards he admires), personal approach, and the proletariat intellectual oratory it produces. He writes that photographer Clarence John Laughlin, &quot;Baudelaire of the Bayous, had all the credentials to become a triumphant American weird. . . . Eye that meat, Cousin Clarence!&quot; The cover here is by the man I consider our greatest living artist, and I had planned to keep my reading of the contents genteel enough to keep the cover image pristine . . . fat chance!

In these 40 essays, some published for the first time, Williams champions the reader as well as the writer, the artist and the tinkerer, the big idea and the passing fancy.

Sadly, the number of memorials included here (Joel Oppenheimer, James Loughlin, Robert Duncan, among many others) indicates a wealth of talent that is quickly passing; and, as Williams himself notes, the number of \\"85 genuine poetry readers sounds much too high to me.\\" Still he persists, and continues to promote and publish. The wellspring of American creativity is a self-renewing resource, even as JW echoes Walter Lowenfels: \\"One reader is a miracle; two, a mass movement.\\" This book is a welcome and needed collection of Williams's wry commentary."},{"Title":"Murder in Guanajuato: A culinary mystery","review":"I was new to Guanajuato and enjoyed the parts of the book the discuss the city.

Read every word (I think they were words). Much like running a marathon a lot pain was involved along the way.

The end of the novel became my quest, my obsession - just like Ahab's white whale.Can't tell you what \\"Finnegans Wake\\" was about because I can't even pretend that I understood it. For me, \\"Finnegans Wake\\" was more of a one-of-a-kind experience than it was a traditional read. Most of the time I kept thinking what kind of a mind creates this style, this language, this alternate reality? There were times that I thought I almost grasp something but that something quickly evaporated much like a phantom or a hallucination. Though I didn't understand it I can't say that \\"Finnegans Wake\\" is without merit. It has endured too long and has sparked too much debate to be rendered insignificant.

Some people started reading it not knowing what it was and they will continue reading it because this is the book that never ends...&quot; (based on the song the never ends)If you are a person who like to read the ending first please do with this book. Read the ending or at least the last sentence. The book opens with the last half of the sentence that closes the book. Just as I jokingly changed the song lyrics from song to book, this book does not really end. It is a cycle that repeats and does not really have a begin point. Open the book any where at begin.Since it is a book that does not end, I have read the pages twice through, but truely I have never finished reading it.The book has a flow which as printed text stays the same but each reading through is different. It is a simple plot as given in the summeries, but also one of great complex. It is a book to be spoken, not one to read in silence. The way to read this work is to simply hear it. If you do not understand, simply keep listening. As a child I was told, if you do not know a word look it up. In this book, skip the looking up and keep the flow alive. At some point you will enter the flow of the words.The book remind me of the Lord of the Rings. Both authors create an multilayered and deep reality. Both authors like to play with language. LORTR is adventure styled after the sagas of spoken by the winter fires old and creates a myth saga in a dream like world. FW is styled to be spoken by a winter fire and interweaves myth with the conscious and the unconscious struggles of modern life in a dreamlike world. The LORTR is easy to follow, but the reminding ends for FW is not easy to follow. Yet how can flowing struggle of conscious and unconscious be easy to follow?It can be said half joking &quot;that reading FW is like the withdrawl off Paxel or any of its class of drug. You risk part of your sanity as you struggle with the conscious and unconscious flow of life.&quot;"},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"Let me preface this review with a disclaimer: Contrary to what some other negative reviewers of Finnegans Wake have done, I make no apologies to those who enjoyed the book for my ensuing critique thereof. I ask for the merit of this review not to be judged by my opinion of the book, but rather by the validity of my case, and its potential helpfulness to those who are interested in reading the book. Without further ado:A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man was my entry point to James Joyce's oeuvre, and it was a brilliant one. As an aspiring writer, I identified every step of the way with Stephen Dedalus' maturation, both as a person and as an author. Joyce's unforgiving treatment of his alter-ego's (i.e., Stephen's) flaws was refreshing, as far too many writers of autobiographical novels (I'm looking at you, Charles Dickens) present overly heroic versions of themselves as protagonists. I then moved on to Ulysses, which proved to be a serious test of endurance and willpower. What I understood of the book I enjoyed; what I didn't understand of it ensured I'd enjoy it even more the second, third, fourth, and who knows how many more times around.Then came Finnegans Wake--I skipped Dubliners at the time, for some odd reason. To call it a \\"disappointment\\" would be like calling Bernie Madoff \\"dishonest\\": bluntly put, it was the most regrettable experience of my reading \\"career\\". I wanted to like the Wake--I swear, I really did. I wanted to brag about how I'd finished the book reputed as the most difficult ever written, and, to boot, ENJOYED it. But it was not to be. I did all I could, short of using a reader's guide, which would have felt like cheating (plus, I'm of the opinion that a book that doesn't make sense without a companion guide doesn't warrant the effort of reading it with one). I read the whole thing aloud to myself, to make sure I'd catch as many of the subtle phonetic easter-eggs Joyce crammed into the work as I could. I spent as many as five minutes on single pages, trying to make sense of it. I noticed textual in-jokes here and there, and paused in self-congratulation at being able to decode them. But all to no avail. The best part of reading the book was when I finished it.I've heard all the arguments in favor of the book's merit. I've known people who profess to have enjoyed Finnegans Wake. I've heard what Harold Bloom's said about it. But it doesn't matter to me. The fact is, if nobody had told me that James Joyce wrote this book, I'd have scoffed at it and never given it a second thought--and quite frankly, I doubt this book would have ever been published in the first place if it hadn't been penned by one of the world's foremost writers. I was able to discern who the characters of the book were--HCE, ALP, et al.--and there were some portions of the book that seemed like vestiges of logic in a massive sea of insanity. I know how much work Joyce put into Finnegans Wake; I know how many people have praised it; I know that every bizarrely construed non-word and multilingual pun was carefully crafted and is not the gibberish it appears to be. But the fact is, this book made for a largely joyless reading experience, and thus I have no choice but to give it 1 star.I won't deny that this book is the work of a genius--sadly, I'm convinced it's that particular genius' weakest effort. Only one person in the world knows all the secrets of the book, and that person, unluckily, died two years after he finished writing it. Perhaps if I knew the intended meaning underlying every single quirk of this book, I'd like it--I guess that's why Joyce considered Finnegans Wake to be his masterpiece, after all."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"Joyce was quite understandably frustrated when his magnum opus, \\"Ulysses,\\" did not immediately receive the critical attention he felt it warranted upon its publication in 1922.Thus it was that the artist, while composing his next work, \\"Finnegan's Wake,\\" got into the habit of periodically banging his head against the typewriter keys, a poignant expression, obviously, of the searing torment boiling within him.Happily for us, the result of these repeated cranial collisions can be viewed in the contents of this volume."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"Okay, folks, this is how you \\"read\\" Finnegans Wake. First, you read Shakespeare, preferably Hamlet, start with Cliff's Notes. Then you read the encyclopedia blurb on Vico, the author. Then you read everything you can find on Finnegans Wake in your local half-price book store, and maybe two or three current books on Finnegans Wake from Amazon or one of the big box stores. Then read Joseph Campbell's books on James Joyce and Finnegans Wake. Finally read Harold Bloom's Western Canon. Once you have read those books -- then place Finnegans Wake by your bedside and read a bit every night. Don't start at the beginning. Start anywhere. Harold Bloom will guide you. But read a paragraph or two each session, and then spend about an hour trying to sort out the puns, the historical references, the inside jokes, the psycho-social-sexual history of Joyce, and you will never tire of picking up the Wake again. And that's it. They should never assign Finnegans Wake to high school students. I agree with earlier reviewer: Finnegans Wake is for those who have tired of reading novels. But once you \\"read\\" Finnegans Wake you will go back to \\"classic\\" novels and read them with more enjoyment. [Update: having just completed the biography of Lucia Joyce (his daughter) by Carol Loeb Shloss confirms my impression of \\"Finnegans Wake.\\" As Ms Shloss states, \\"FW\\" may be the most remarkable book every written. But I wonder if \\"Ulysses\\" isn't the better of the two with regard to character development, etc?]"},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"This work is Joyce's finale. It is the logical extension of processes within his work from the earliest writing through Dubliners the Portrait, through Ulysses, and at last 'Finnegan's Wake'. He invents a language of his own , a language of all languages, and expects Mankind to spend ' all the years of the nights' reading it. Aside from his courage, and conviction his great arrogance and literary power this work is the proof of the artist going to the end of what he is with all that he has.And this said in praise- the truth , the basic truth of the unreadibility of the work, of its being rescued for readers by certain lyrical passages, the opening and ending most notably, leaves the work as a secondary one in the Joyce canon. Joyce is Joyce because of Ulysses. Finnegans Wake is the curiosity of his middle old age. The truth is too that the fundamental efforts to make all of history myth, and to find in repetition the answer to our meaning is mistaken historically . And the other great failing is in the punning language itself, the proof positive that in trying to mix up everything into one , one arrives primarily at confusion.Finnegan 's Wake thus stands more as kind of chapter in the literary biography of Joyce than as a literary work of value in itself.

For me, I knew I couldn't look back, and Joyce has been a blessed thorn in my side for 20 years. Good gosh, what would I do without this man James Joyce, the last heavyweight in the pantheon of godlike writers. ADDENDUM: I just celebrated my 30-year anniversary of my first read of \\"Finnegans Wake.\\" I wish I were younger; so, I'd have more time to spend with it. To the Wake's admirers: are we all a bunch of freaks? Or are we just really turned on by words in general. To the haters: everything in the Wake is there for a purpose, and yes, has meaning. Joyce was the most disciplined writer of all time. And please, folks, he didn't write it to tick you off. Really. (And the edition pictured is NOT the one to purchase; you must buy the edition incorporating all of the author's corrections. Viking Press, I think.) The last italicized word in the Wake is \\"Flood.\\" Just threw that out there. Homer? Took the epic as far as it could go. Shakespeare? The most eloquent writer ever. Joyce?

Up front they tell you that the text of the book is taken from the first edition published in May of 1939. This is true, but it doesn't tell the whole story, and most people have no idea what it really means.Finnegans Wake was originally published in 1939. The first edition was replete with errors and typos -- thousands of them. James Joyce spent the last two years of his life (he died in 1941) going through the text correcting the mistakes. An errata list comprising many single-spaced pages was printed in the back of the second edition, and the third edition had all of Joyce's corrections incorporated into the text. So the third edition is the definitive one.But Penguin is reprinting the first edition. Get it? The text you'll be reading will have all of the typos that Joyce spent two years correcting -- uncorrected.Viking does have the third edition of Finnegans Wake in print. It's smaller, with smaller type and not nearly as pretty a cover, but it's the text that Joyce approved. I would get that one (it has a white cover with a green stripe going across the middle of it), and leave this edition alone."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"&quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; is a novel for people who are tired of reading novels. The chapter summaries in the table of contents, and not the body of the novel itself, give evidence of a plot, which concerns the dream-consciousness of a man whose initials H.C.E. recur as an acronym at various points in the text and whose wife Anna Livia Plurabelle, sons Shem (the Penman) and Shaun (the Postman), and daughter Issy figure prominently among many other exotic and unexpected characters. However, the presentation is so nebulous and abstract that the novel resembles nothing else in literature, although the style looks deceptively easy to imitate.Upon first looking at the pages of &quot;Finnegans Wake,&quot; one inevitably must wonder what it's supposed to be. My explanation of it is an extension of my theory about &quot;Ulysses,&quot; which is that &quot;Ulysses&quot; was Joyce's effort to write a novel that used every single existing word in the English language, or at least as many as he could. (Among its 400,000 words, &quot;Ulysses&quot; certainly has a much broader lexicon than any other novel of comparable length.) Having exhausted all the possibilities of English in &quot;Ulysses,&quot; he had only one recourse for his next project, which was to create an entirely new language as a pastiche of all the existing ones; the result is &quot;Finnegans Wake.&quot;The language in &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; is a continuum of puns, portmanteaus, disfigured words, anagrams, and rare scraps of straightforward prose. What Joyce does is exploit the way words look and sound in order to associate them with remote, unrelated ideas. For example, his phrase &quot;Olives, beets, kimmells, dollies&quot; may sound familiar to those who happen to know that the first four letters of the Hebrew alphabet are aleph, bet, gimel, daled. &quot;Psing a psalm of psexpeans, apocryphul of rhyme&quot; recalls a nursery rhyme that may reside quietly in your most dormant memory cells, while &quot;Where it is nobler in the main to supper than the boys and errors of outrager's virtue&quot; sounds like a drunk auditioning for the role of Hamlet. Imaginary adjectives that pertain to letters of the English alphabet are employed to describe Dublin as a city &quot;with a deltic origin and a nuinous end.&quot; &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; is the ultimate in esoterica, and what you get out of it depends largely on your store of knowledge, so that upon completion, with a mutual wink at Joyce, you congratulate yourself for being so clever.The text is supposed to reflect a dream or a dreamlike state, an imperfect rendering of hazily remembered pictures and thoughts, but it also evokes the multivocal babble one might hear in a crowded Irish pub, multiple rolling streams of lilting brogue-laden speech combining into a sort of rhythmic cacophony, a variegated procession of verbal images ranging from the mundane to the fantastical. It cannot be read in any conventional manner of reading prose; each sentence has a melody, and the words must be vocalized in the mind to hear the verbal music. It can be maddening if you try to make meaning of it all, but if you're familiar with Joyce's past work, you've already risked your sanity adequately to make it through &quot;Finnegans Wake.&quot;"},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"To answer a few points made by other reviewers:1) Yes, some people have finished this book. I have, and so have several people I know.2) Some people enjoy this book. (see above).3) It isn't just self-indulgence by academics. For example: a Professor of English Literature at Oxford University has said that it's not worth reading. Lots of academics have. These are people who 'know everything' for a job. Can you imagine how much FW annoys them?4) It's hard. Yes, that's right, hard. But hard can be fun. Just like sex. (FW does take longer though).5) The reason why lovers of Joyce sound so passionate about it is that they genuinely feel that way. For real. Imagine you'd fallen in love and noone around you had a clue what it felt like. You'd want to shake them and tell them.6) It makes sense. To fully understand it (if that's possible) would take generations of study. But i) If you're reading for pleasure, not ego kicks, surely how much you get out matters more than what proportion of the book's meaning you can lay claim to, ii) like life, reading FW is made up of lots of small pleasures and ii) Lighten up!! It's funny! Anyway, when was the last time you 'fully' understood a book?It's easy to see why the great majority of people would decide that they had other priorities. I respect that opinion. But please don't fling insults at a book that some of us love. Yes, love. Reading FW was a high-point of my life. Emotion and excitement: anger, frustration, joy, humour, delight, even boredom. Deep relationships are difficult. They hurt. And they make us more alive."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"Call me crazy, but I almost never stop reading a book I started. Sometimes I'm sorry I didn't give it up at first, but other times (e.g., &quot;Moby Dick&quot;) I'm not.It took me five years to read finnegan's wake, on and off. It is probably the hardest book to read in the English language (I won't go into Joyce's use of German, French, Latin, Hebrew, etc.)But why is it worth it? What makes Finnegan's wake different from utter nonsense? A LOT. Many readers complain that they can only understand two or three points every page. True for me as well. But when I checked, the obscure points of the seemingly meaningless sentences *always* had some deeper meaning.For example, let us start with the title: &quot;Finnegans wake&quot; (the apostrophe that appears in many editions is a mistake.) There is at least a triple meaning: &quot;Finnegan's wake&quot;, the wake of the mystical hero; &quot;finnegans wake&quot; - the Irish are waking up; and &quot;fin-again wake&quot; - showing the cyclical nature of the dream history of this book.Or take the year, 1132, that appears in the book quite a lot (sometimes in the guise of 566, which is 1132/2). It symbolizes the the circularity of history (11=10+1, starting to count again after reaching 10) and the fall of empires (bodies fall at 32 ft/sec^2).Or take the case of the dreamer's son, who falls from the sky as &quot;a bare godkin&quot;. It is both a description of his condition (a naked son of God) and a pun on Hamlet's &quot;a bare bodkin&quot; (an unsheated dagger.)These are just three examples. But this is where Joyce's genius is - and the enjoyment of the book is. It's just plain fun to figure these things out - and when you *do* figure them out, the real meaning of the text, and the story, begins to show.It's hard work, but it's worth it."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"I've just reached the end ... or is it the beginning? It's taken me six months, with Anthony Burgess' 'Here Comes Everybody' providing a basic and unsatisfactory commentary on this nightmare of a book. I can't really recommend anybody to read this unless you know exactly what you're letting yourself in for ... unlike Ulysses, which I believe everybody should attempt at some point in their lives. So why have I given it 5 stars? Because it simply had to be written.Without the Wake, twentieth century fiction would have been simply an extension of the nineteenth century. This book is what sets us apart. Don't believe the people who tell you it's a joke - a genius like Joyce doesn't spend 15 years, resign himself to penury when a \\"Ulysses Lite\\" could have made him a rich man, and ultimately ruin his eyesight all for nothing more than the literary equivalent of a whoopee cushion. There are deep things here, it's just that they're buried so deep that it's mostly not worth the effort of mining them. But again, I've given it 5 stars because this book is like a nail bomb in a library (shhhhh!) - it destroyed everyone's perception of what could ever constitute literature. If the Wake can be created, anything is possible. The Wake gave the green light to everyone's wildest imaginings and bizarre method of telling it - after all, whatever you write it won't be as difficult or as slow or as mad or as painful as this work.Don't let anybody tell you that there is an easy way into this book. Whichever way you approach it, however many primers and explanations you read, nothing will prepare you for 650 pages of dense dream-imagery written in polyglottal puns through which you grasp at anything that makes the slightest sense (and I mean slightest). The basic story of a publican dreaming over the repercussions of being caught urinating in a public park by two soldiers and then being accused of indecent exposure is by the by and of little import, because it is so thoroughly buried beneath hundreds of layers of Irish, oedipal and religious history, myth and gossip and the minutiae of everyday life transfigured by dream, that it would be easy to miss (and if you did, it wouldn't be a problem anyway - this is hardly narrative-driven). There are moments of comedy, but they're few and far between. The publican becomes the man-myth-mountain Finnegan, who represents Ireland, his forgiving and defending wife becomes Anna Livia Plurabella, the river Liffy and mother nature herself - reading the book is a battle that's impossible to win and you ultimately simply surrender yourself to the flow, the cycle of life which, like water taken from the sea to clouds to rain to rivers to sea to clouds .... takes you from the end to flow back to the beginning without even a full stop to halt things. I wondered whether it would make more sense the second time round, then decided that I didn't really care to find out.So, be glad that you don't have to read this book, but you should all definitely celebrate that it was written."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"I have been reading some of the positive and negative reviews of Finnegans Wake, and decided to post my own thoughts.I think of Finnegans Wake as an experiment. It's really up to the reader to decide whether it is a successful experiment or not.I kind of like it, but it probably wouldn't be a book I would take with me if I was going to be marooned on a desert island and could only take a few books with me. On the other hand, maybe I would, because it is a book that the more time you put into it the more it gives back. So if I was going to be on the island for a LONG time, Finnegans Wake would be a good choice.Some folks have been saying there is no plot or characters. Well, yes there is. The main character is a fellow named Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker, HCE for short. He is a bar-owner in Dublin, Ireland. His wife is Anna Livia Plurabelle, ALP. They have two sons, usually called Shaun and Shem (short for Seamus), and a daughter named Issy. Also at the bar work an old woman named Kate and an old man named Sackerson. Other characters are the customers at the bar and schoolgirls who are friends of Issy.The main plot concerns rumours that circulate about an incident involving HCE. These rumours are very vague, but they usually seem to be accusing HCE of some sort of sexual misbehavior in the park.But Joyce has written the novel so that it can be read on many levels. HCE and his family stand for every human family, and for all of humanity. The rivalry between Shaun and Shem stand for all sorts of struggles between man and his \\"brother man\\". The two of them together come into conflict with HCE in a basic Oedipal struggle. HCE comes to stand for every person accused (rightly or wrongly) of misdoing. The whole thing is structured as a pattern that repeats itself over and over, from generation to generation, in families and whole nations, throughout history. Each generation takes the place of the previous one, and then in turn has its place taken by the next. Joyce symbolizes this by beginning the book with the end of a sentence that begins on the last page, making the whole book a circle with no real beginning or end.In order that the book can exist on so many levels at once, Joyce uses the peculiar Finnegans Wake language. The words of this language are each able to mean two or more things at once. So any given sentence or section will mean one thing on the level of the story of HCE and his family, but will mean all kinds of different things on all the different levels that Finnegans Wake exists on.Looking at just the first sentence:\\"riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodious vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs.\\"So he is saying that he is now circling back from the end of the book back to the beginning.On one level, he is talking about the river Liffey, a river in Dublin which does almost go in a circle, but starts near Howth Castle and runs past a church called Adam and Eve's.He is also talking about the historical theories of Giambattista Vico (hence the word \\"vicus\\") who saw history as going in circular patterns that constantly recurred.And Joyce realizes we could call this a \\"vicious circle\\".When he says \\"Howth Castle and Environs\\" he incorporates the initials of his protagonist HCE, which is where he is going to start. (note that Joyce capitalizes the H, C, and E.)He has also cicled back to the beginning of humanity, with Adam and Eve. (On a certain level, HCE and ALP stand for Adam and Eve. Think of how Adam was thrown out of a garden for committing a sin)And the one sentence, or selected words from the sentence, can mean even more different things. The opening word sounds like the french for \\"Let us dream\\", and Joyce described all of Finnegans Wake as a dream.The point is that this one sentence means all these things, and more, all at the same time. And these are the kind of word-games that Joyce plays with us for 628 pages. It doesn't get any easier, it stays like this for the whole book. To play the game well, you need to try to think the way Joyce did. It often helps to read the words out loud, with an Irish accent (like Joyce had). (Parenthetically, when I personally read a book, or anything else, I can \\"hear\\" the words in my mind. My understanding is that there are at least some people who when they read do not \\"hear\\" the words they are seeing. Finnegans Wake really requires the reader to \\"hear\\" the words, so if you have trouble with this try reading the book out loud.)I guess the problem is that many people find these sorts of word games very difficult. Also, Joyce doesn't tell us the rules of the game. (There is one chapter where it looks like Joyce is about to tell us the rules, but then he doesn't) Many scholars have written excellent books about Finnegans Wake and their personal understanding of the rules of Joyce's game, and also the parts they believe they have \\"solved\\". But with Finnegans Wake, there always seem to be more levels of meaning that can be explored.So if you enjoy these sorts of word games, you will enjoy Finnegans Wake. If you don't, then you won't. And you may not be able to tell the difference between Finnegans Wake and random gibberish, such as a computer generates. But this is not random gibberish, Joyce is really telling the story of humanity through this one Dublin family. If you know how to play the game, you will be able to find the characters and themes. I would recommend that someone coming to the book for the first time should get a hold of one of the books that gives some idea of how to \\"play the game\\".There are a lot of people all over the world who enjoy playing the Finnegans Wake game. But if this is not your thing, that's okay."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"Have I read the Wake? Yes. Did I understand the Wake? No. Was I threatened by my lack of understanding? No. Did I feel intimidated by its author? A little. Did I feel insulted owing to that intimidation? Not at all. Quite the contrary. Does the Wake &quot;make sense?&quot; Of a sort. Does it &quot;mean?&quot; Perhaps, in the sense that a symphony or a cathedral &quot;means.&quot; Was I humbled by it? Certainly. Did I appreciate it? Absolutely. Would I read it again? Yes, I would. Is it the greatest novel every written? Who's to say? Is it the worst? No, decidedly not. What is it then? Words on a page. Sentences. Their syntax. Their rhythm and cadence, euphony and flow. Is it anything more? Doubtless. What is that more? More than I can say."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"James Joyce's last novel, and incidentally the one his wife considered his best, is, as they say, unreadable, in that if you sit down and go through the book from cover to cover (as I have done) you'll only get the vaguest idea of what was going on. So if that's your idea of the all-time downer reading experience then spend your money on something else, because this is one of those books that is liable not only to change the way you look at life, but the way you read and think. Joyce called it a night book - the &quot;action&quot;, such as there is any (and the action comprises pretty much all of human history and civilisation) takes place while the characters (a Dublin pub owner, his wife and family and sundry other unsavoury types) are asleep. But you'd never know that if I hadn't told you, because the language is a punster's dream (literally), a braided and twisted weave of most of the various tongues in the world, based on an idea by the English language, all to be spoken with a fairly strong Irish accent. (Non-Irish people often don't notice this, but the rest of us can hear it.) It's not a book to while away a plane trip. It's a book to spend a few dollars on and then spend the rest of your life dipping in and out of it for profit and pleasure. Some of it is pretty straightforward, such as the visit to the Willingdone museyroom or the episode about the chicken scratching around in the rubbish heap (a lot more gripping than it sounds), while other bits are maddeningly opaque. But if they read novels in heaven they probably read this one. The best way to get the most out of it is to have read every book ever written, but failing that, an open mind, an active imagination, and a sensitivity to the buried layers of meaning in words will get you through. Frank Zappa fans ought to love it; this is conceptual continuity with a vengeance. (Wow. I never thought the day would come when I'd get to review a novel by James Joyce.)"},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"As one of the reviewers noted in his review, I too have given many postive marks to those who have given five-star reviews for this novel; because some reviewers have made very good arguments in defense of this novel. [I never give negative marks on anything, even if I don't like a review, but I do give plenty of positives] Therefore, before you begin to throw the bricks and sling your arrows at me, please let me try and explain why I gave this book such low marks. First of all, I have tried to read--or at least decipher \\"Finnegans Wake\\" on four different occasions. I see from some of the reviews that anyone who attempts to disagree with this novels merits gets pelted with negative marks. For those of you who enjoy this novel, good for you! I do not profess to be as knowledgeable as some of you may be on this books merits. But I DO KNOW WHAT I LIKE! And I did not like this novel.I first tried reading \\"Finnegans Wake\\" when I was in High School [it was not required reading] because I heard so much about it that I wanted to read something challenging. And challenging was an understatement. Realizing I was young, I attempted it much later while in the military. As if military life were not frustrating enough. It was not until I entered college, where I was reguired to read the novel, that I did so with true earnest: Due to the fact that I had to write an essay on the novel. I did receive an A minus on the paper. However, to be honest, this was after profusely littering the paper with as much b***s***, that to me Joyce littered his novel with. My professor must have seen some great merit in this essay---at least I felt so at the time.However, wanting to truly understand the novel, I decided to REALLY try and capture what Joyce was trying to write. This too led to my dislike of the novel. Not so much with the books difficulty [although that was a problem], but with the simple question: Is it really worth reading? My answer? No! For me a novel has to give me that quality of enjoyment that makes the journey a delightful one. It has to capture my soul! This novel never did capture my soul. Give me unabridged editions [the only ones I read] of \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" by Dumas, \\"Les Miserables\\" by Hugo, \\"War and Peace\\" by Tolstoy [once is enough please] and more importantly, my favorite author, Dostoevsky, \\"Notes From the Underground,\\" \\"Crime and Punishment,\\" and \\"The Brothers Karamazov.\\" These novels have given me something back in my life for the efforts that I put into reading them. They were profound and affected me deeply. They ALL gave me something in my life.In conclusion, to those who find this novel worth the high praise it has garnered, I respectfully disagree. There are many great novels from which to choose to spend and evening, afternoon, or morning perusing. And while I do not look negatively on your opinions; if this book gives you enjoyment, then great for you. For me, however, the book gave me nothing. Nor do I wish to spend what little time we are alloted in our short life to spend it on this type of reading. That is my honest opinion. I am sure a 5 star review will give me many positive marks, but that is not why this review exists, or what I am about. This is just my honest opinion.Today I am going to start reading two novels that I have been wanting to read for some time, but have put off until recently. \\"Growth of the Soil\\", by Knut Hamsun, and \\"The Master and Margarita,\\" by Mikhail Bulgakov. I hear they are good novels; and after laboring over \\"Finnegans Wake\\" for too many hours in my life, I will begin to start on that reading list of mine. I'll let you know how these two novels work out. One thing I am pretty sure of, however, is that they will probably not frustrate me as much as \\"Finnegans Wake\\" did; and in fact, no other novel has been more of a disappointment to me than Joyce's so-called masterpiece."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"Imagine you're in a pub in Dublin, and a regular has started talking to you. The combined amount of beer in both of you makes it difficult to understand much of what he's saying, but every once in a while there's a moment of clarity where you get it. You laugh not only at what's said but at yourself for the situation you're in. In the meantime you can only stare gape-mouthed at the beauty of the sounds he makes and in hopes that another moment of clarity is near.It is easy to get frustrated with this book if you can't get comfortable with its style."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"OK, so, yes, some sort of very sophisticated intelligence was involved in this work. No doubt the allusions, multi-lingual puns, and invented words that fill over 600 pages were carefully chosen. But as a whole, or even in small parts, it doesn't make any sense and doesn't yield even to careful analysis and background research.There is no plot, it explains nothing, and it describes nothing coherently. If the goal was to capture the confused, disorganized dream state of a polygot Irish writer then, yes, it's all there on paper. But was an entire book needed for this?The hubris of this undertaking -- and of the literary critics who saved it from obscurity -- can be seen in the condescending introduction to this Penguin edition, where the editor writes:&quot;...any reader can enter Finnegans Wake and find something to absorb him -- as long as he or she doesn't expect to find it all in one place or, complementarily, understand everything else that appears around it. It is even possible to argue, with this same logic, that Finnegans Wake may be more accessible to the common reader that Ulysses -- or, for that matter, War and Peace or Remembrance of Things Past -- since one doesn't have to comprehend it as a totality to profit from it or enjoy it.&quot;In other words, unlike those other books where we read about people, ideas, history, etc. here we can just enjoy the sound and look of random phrases and sentences, the way a baby enjoys pleasant sounding nonsense.The introduction goes on to say, &quot;It can sometimes seem that one is doing well if one makes sense of only a sentence or two on a single page. If, however, one surrenders the need to be master of everything -- or even most things -- in this strange and magnificent book, it will pour forth lots of rewards.&quot;I humbly disagree -- one or two identfiable bits of prose per page is almost by definition an unsatisfactory reading experience. And the estimate of one to sentences per page is high -- after a paragraph or two of incomprehensible invented words, even a few straightforward words or sentences have no context or meaning.I wouldn't discourage people from buying this book, just to see for themselves how weird it is. But I wouldn't say its a good book, anymore than the scholarly yet demented ravings and ramblings of a schizophrenic former PhD student on a streetcorner constitute good oratory. Fascinating, but more worthy of medical and psychiatric scrutiny than literary study."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"Finnegan's Wake is a book apart from others. It does not succeed because of great characterisation, fascinating plot, or for any of the usual criteria with which we generally judge literature. Rather, it succeeds because of the purity of Joyce's vision; this is not a cultural purity -- in fact, it is quite the reverse -- it is instead an artistic one. Comparable to the visual techniques of Tanguy and Kandinsky, or to the musical techniques of LaMonte Young, it functions way beyond the dynamics of conventional art. It is, to grant it proper appreciation, impenetrable through normal eyes; hence, the polarisation of the reviews on this page.Here, finally, is what Joyce was building to over the course of his writing (following 'A Portrait...' and 'Ulysses'). He reached a point of transcendence, where he was no longer constrained by, among other things, conventional grammar, or the use of a single language at a time. Where everyday language is clumsy compared to, say, musical expression, the voice of 'Finnegan's Wake' is liquid -- and this is something that no other writer achieved to the same degree.It is infinitely subtle, each word functioning as its own microcosm, but also operating as part of the grand design of the book. Particularly, this characterises the eloquent divergence of the 'final' pages. The book is concise: it is perfect. It is, in this sense, a 'pure' work of art, something to be studied and admired for its ingenious beauty, rather than read casually on the toilet.And, sixty years later, mankind has yet to fashion a more coherent and complete literary vision."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"Into the gobbledeegook go slipper the whipper and the trimtrammaduhdeedo, believing the glubbledubble spewed forth by a madman.What do you think, am I a genius or what? Just send me twenty bucks and I'll send you the next 600 pages.Here are three words for Joyce that he should have tried to make sense of: Ther-a-py. The guy mave have been great at one point, but he ended up a nut. And this book proves it. And also, since Joyce was such a worshiper of Aristotle's, he should have watched out for the philosopher's famous warning: &quot;No great soul is exempt from a mixture of madness.&quot; True enough, but it is the conquest of that madness, not the surrender to it, which makes a great soul remain so. Joyce, in pitiful fashion, lost the battle, descending from a once eloquent and insightful wordsmith to a full-blown babbling idiot. It's a shame, really.And to all those stuffy professors who like to belittle the layperson by pretending to understand this book, I offer this lucid reproval: ooglebagoogle you jimmenyjammeroos. Take that, Mr. Wisemen."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"Should you buy James Joyce's Finnegans Wake? Three reasons for getting to yes, she said, yes, yes, yes.1: An incredible value. You probably will be reading it delightedly if it is at all your cuppa, for at least the next forty years and at about $7, that's a bargain. Other books may be one-night gulps; this, like Shakespeare, will be pleasure and a joy as long as you can read. One can hardly better the per-word, per-page, per-year return on a $7 investment.Or at least, so suggests Nobel physicist Murray Gell-Mann, who tells us he named the subatomic entity he discovered as he was \\"again perusing \\"Finnegans Wake\\" and happened on the section which included the poemlet beginning, \\"Three quarks for Muster Mark.\\" Joyce might have been delighted to know that uniquely among subatomic entities, quarks come in flavors: up, down, top, bottom, charmed, and strange.2. Like \\"Ulysses,\\" which it closely resembles, \\"Finnegans Wake\\" is affirmative, gloriously, magnificently, strangely, honorably affirmative. Both books echo enduring, complex mythic figures----the Greek/Homeric Odysseus the man of many guises, the wanderer, and the Irish warrior, Finn McCool, who sleeps beneath a faery hill to waken again in Ireland's time of need. Both deeply reflect cycles: Ulysses, the cycle of a day (June 16th) and Finnegans Wake, night, sleep, the cycles of life itself and of the great rivers of place, space, and time. Both center, more or less, on the consciousness/unconsciousness of a single character---Bloom in Ulysses and Humphrey Chimpdon Earwicker (HCE) in the Wake. Both begin with sexuality (plump stately Buck Mulligan in Ulysses who is buck naked in the first sentence and the great river Liffey flowing past Eve and Adams in the Wake.) And both---oh the joy of reading this aloud, end in long soliloquies by women: Molly Bloom's glorious cascade ending in yes, she said, yes, yes, yes and Anna Livia Pluribell's glorious call to the land, its people, and her spouse--comatose? sleeping?---to arise, awake, renew, begin again, wake again, Finnegan in The Wake.Achieving such affirmation seems an almost unbelievable stance at the end of Joyce's difficult life---almost blind, poor, his daughter insane, 20 years spent in writing the Wake--and it is not an affirmation glibly reached. Night, dreams (whose we don't sknow for sure, perhaps many dreamers), and in that sleep of almost death what dreams may come? One wants to stand to read the last section, like at the Hallelujah chorus.3. The sheer magnificence, creativity, erudition, knowledge of the language; the playfulness like Lewis Carroll unshackled; the flow of thought, ideas, layerings. The flamboyance of langguage, all flags flying, all sails set.If you delight in crossword puzzles, if you like reading Jabberwocky in as many languages as you can, if you think Hofstader's The Eternal Golden Braid a delight, and are not among those to whom A. E.Housman says, Ale, boys, that's the thing to drink for people whom it hurts to think\\"---you will find almost unlimited puzzlement and joy in every page.Take---as an example, even that first reference to Eve and Adams. Well it was an actual pub situated near the ocean end of the Liffey; its' name suggests the Fall of Man with Eve as the instigator who, as Milton writes contributes in the end to our redemption. This first sentence about the river flowing in a commodius viscus around Howth Castle & Environs (it does) suggests too the publican (barkeep) whose initials are named in this first sentence, HCE, and who may represent the legendary Irish policeman, Here Comes Everyone. And the sentence begins in its middle, the start arriving many pages later, at the very end----only it isn't an end, but a cycle, a continuation.Getting if need be to no. There are a few reasons NOT to buy this book. We are--or at least I am--more accustomed to novels telling stories be they happy or sad, complex or simple. This one tells many stories in fragments and complexes interweaving not only the story of the warrior Finn but also the Irish ballad, Finnegan's Wake, in which again in the Fall of Man, the tippling (and tipping) hod-carrier Tim Finnegan tumbles off a ladder, appears dead, is wildlythe waked, and revived when whiskey gets tossed on the apparent corpse. So one can get bored or exhausted by just a sentence. Impatient. One can feel too ignorant to understand even a little since Joyce wanders among Sanskrit, Greek, French, German, Old Icelandic languages as well as local sayings, great and more obscure literature. Enough already, one can feel.None-the-less, if Murray Gell-Mann returns like Finnegans over and over and over, well, perhaps so can we. And have fun-again discovering those three quarks (quarts? seagull cries?) ourselves.Oh: which edition? This one uses the original as published. One of my other copies uses the edition Joyce corrected himself over two years. Both are wonders, but this one is about $30 cheaper at present."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"You will probably consider this novel to be difficult. I agree with anybody who thinks so. It is very difficult. It certainly is hard to grasp, but once you get into it, that is it. James Joyce stretched the language and brought the book to a far higher form of writing that is uncommon around. Uncommon in the sense that you have to get into it to love it. Like Disciples of Fortune, this is a very compelling story with vivid descriptions, a varied and rich setting and peculiar characters. The pacing, characterization and the flow of the story are well observed. Overall, this is a well-crafted story."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time. It takes patience and a great deal of time to work through Joyce's experimental style, but is well worth the effort. \\"[Joyce wrote Finnegans Wake in Paris over a period of seventeen years, and published it in 1939, two years before his death, Finnegans Wake was Joyce's final work. The entire book is written in a largely idiosyncratic language, consisting of a mixture of standard English lexical items and neologistic multilingual puns and portmanteau words, which many critics believe attempts to recreate the experience of sleep and dreams. Owing to the work's expansive linguistic experiments, stream of consciousness writing style, literary allusions, free dream associations, and its abandonment of the conventions of plot and character construction, Finnegans Wake remains largely unread by the general public.]\\"Finnegans Wake inspired me to create a children's book on life, loss, and the space between.

You can't even rightly say what it is about (many will disagree). It is deep to the point of deliberate obtuseness, a work Twenty years in the making that was so mythical that halfway through it Joyce's peers wrote a book about this book, \\"Our Examination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress\\".It can blow you away and bore you. It can make you want to visit Zurich to stop buy his grave and ask the same question Joyce asks on his death bed, \\"Does nobody understand?\\" Most who read this won't. And you know what?

One could theoretically go it alone, or certainly use the many other companion pieces and interpretations that have appeared over the decades, but not only is Campbell's by and large the \\"original\\" Rosetta Stone for this tome, it's also, at least to me, the most intellectually and spiritually fulfilling.Of course, as the saying goes, ask someone to interpret a passage of the Wake and that will tell you a lot about that person. So I don't pretend that Campbell's analysis or my own is correct. Rather, I feel it's a good rebuttal to the cynically prevalent question of \\"Is it worth my time?\\", for which the asker usually has their own answer of \\"No!\\" at the immediate ready.The Wake is Joyce's attempt to put the Universe in print, to squeeze Life, with all its yins and yangs, between two covers. It is an exhaustive and noble effort; \\"ambitious\\" proves too thin a word for the scope of, well, his ambitions. Quite honestly, many elements mesh when viewed through a pantheistic prism. Finnegan's fall from the ladder at the beginning is essentially the fall of Adam, or, rather, to put it more positively, the transformation of the \\"God\\" figure from a high state of paradise to the ruggedness of the physical world (the idea being that, always perfect, God/Cosmos couldn't know perfection until it had experienced the other polarity - one can't know hot without cold, etc.). Soon after, Finnegan is replaced by the character HCE (one meaning of which is \\"Here Comes Everyone\\"), who creates multiple families (just as humans have created multiple societies), and is swept up in violence and scandal.This barely scrapes the surface of the Wake's vastness. It is also drawn from over sixty languages, cycles back on itself much as seasons (and the Universe, as projected by the Big Crunch theory), and some have even spotted patterns of DNA structure in its pages.Just as the world is a three-dimensional Rorscharch test, seen differently by every set of eyes, understood differently by every mind, so too is the Wake a glorious experience in subjectivity.

The most pleasing surprise of FW is that spread out among passages that are difficult and abstruse there are other passages that are surprisingly beautiful in their lyrical quality. When one comes across such passages, we realize that FW is a typological work, a landscape that quickly changes (really a seascape, since the transformations are more like bodies of water flowing into other bodies of water). For the casual reader, not interested in parsing every pun and allusion, this is the best way to approach this novel. Read it and allow yourself to flow with the stream of language. Understand that nothing exists but language here, that the language has no REAL representation, and amazing things being to happen.

Joyce had a flair for foreign languages, regarded Catholicism as \\"a beautiful lie\\", had at his disposal the collective wisdom of East and West, was *extremely* well read, gifted in music, delighted in wordplay, extensively researched the psychology of sleep, and was notoriously autobiographical in his literary productions.Joyce describes a night's dream in both biographical (Freudian) and archetypal (Jungian) terms: Brother against brother conflict, inevitable haunting guilt (\\"this municipal sin business\\"), raging lust percolating through \\"the fury and the mire of human veins\\", chrysalis-like psychological dependence on (temporal and ecclesiastical) authority, ultimate redemption through love, inevitable death. These motifs characterize both human history and tomorrow morning's news. And so, the Wake is *our* dream: Each of us is the poor harried protagonist Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker, subjected to the cold patrician ridicule of the Four Customers and Twelve Jurymen and burdened by guilt and the misplaced faith of our personal and collective innocence.Those with little patience for Joyce's presentation are not willing to reassess what a book should convey or else lack a herculean desire for wordplay. In defence of detractors, knowledge of at least one foreign language probably helps, as does general knowledge of comparative religion and mythology, Vico's historical cycles, Nietzsche's eternal recurrence, alchemy, Biblical tales, children's games, the history of English literature, etc. Perhaps the greatest obstacle to approaching the Wake is that many readers come in bad faith, unwilling to believe that an order is there, hidden in the obscure labyrinth of protean wordplay.If you want to turn the lead of the Wake into gold, then you must be a modern-day alchemist.

With each year, because of the way language changes, FW will become more and more incomprehensible so that there will eventually be more people around who read and understand Old Norse than this novel.

When, for that infinite instant, you connect to the unveiled phallus of divinity and in that harsh omnipotent instant ecstasy become nothing that is nevertheless something. On the graphic stage, the rudimentary marks of letters become the defined ingeniousness of language in cascading momentum to incontrovertible self-expression (another Grail Quest doomed to failure in the physical pursuit).The permutations of word in letter, phrase, and text provide the hit and miss of the Perfect Word (that makes both cosmos and chaos-\`Chaosmos') in embryo. The Perfect Word being ever unspoken (and conversely: ever-spoken-and thus hidden in infinite division) is illiterate because it is both before and after language. Swollen and glowing clandestinely with the enticement (the promise) of the literary, the inner illiterate scythes into sensibility a billion cuts of unexpressible feeling, which are the pangs of death, the noumena of being outside of being. The embryo-illiterate is the anti-saviour (though still Saviour) of sentience, immolating intellect upon the searing combustibility of antithetical mindlessness.So words become emblems (thus amorphic and undefinable, and are shown so through ingenious distortion to dis-acculturate). And metaphors are a joke on reality as a serious world view. Thus the text is a profound banality (as a fem-divine response to the ego-emperor of vain-glory), showing nothing, giving nothing except that which is sublime in the experience of the reading as a vocal phenomenon-a reckless (and thus potentially poignant) abandonment in intonation and rhythm. Thus is the stuff of magic. And so the soul (in its aspect of the nullity of the literate-illiterate combustion) is set free of convention and the stereotypes of communication (and, consequently, monosyllabic being). The words and text fall not then on culturally limited perception but rather on reception-it is what it is, judge not, and transformation-transfiguration through cadent text brings reader to eternal fem-orgasm of the unravelled soul, and thus redemption from the Fall that words as mind-memes concrete us to (ie, harsh homo-divine eroticism)."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"&quot;Out door, keel cooling vorsnevou.&quot; You could add this sentence to this mass of drivel and no one would know it wasn't written by Joyce.

Anyone could have done it."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"I firmly believe that most who have read -- or so they say -- &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; extoll its virtues because, to coin a phrase, its reputation precludes it. I am only aware of one detractor: Vladimir Nabokov, who, while considering &quot;Ulysses&quot; one of the four greatest works of the 20th century (a view which I don't share, incidentally), described labelled &quot;FW&quot; only a blot on his memory. (Note: not offered as a proof.) What is &quot;FW&quot;, what is it really? Ultimately, I declaim it a failure -- not because I don't like it (an understatement!), but a failure on its OWN terms; and these, after all, are the only terms which any given work of art is obligated to fulfill. I offer one example of this failure -- an example which, however, is crucial to the entire structure of the book. &quot;FW&quot; is, within the story (such as it is) of one man, one family, supposed to represent the history of all of humankind. The history, of course, is relatively easy to represent, with its contextual Vico-ian circularity &amp;c.; but the humankind is a foundering point (no pun intended). Joyce portrays this omnium gatherum of humanity through the meduim of what is commonly referred to as &quot;dream consciousness,&quot; the collective unconscious of history, and he exemplifies this through a gallimaufry of languanges: all people, all languages. Fine, makes sense. And it also makes sense that there is a predominant language: English (alright: a very broguish Irish-English), because Finnegan/Humphrey/et al. is/are Irish. But we've glossed over the problem: all people, NOT all languages. Joyce, while being a brilliant linguist, didn't remotely have even snippets -- or even a good percentage -- of all of the languages extant (never mind those of antiquity); and while I'm perfectly willing to accept that NO ONE could have the languages to pull off this idea properly, that does nothing to the fact that Joyce fails to successfully complete his endeavor (on this front). I don't care if Michael Johnson is (currently, at least) the world's fastest 200 meter runner: if he promises a 15-sec. performance and runs it in 19, he's failed to deliver, period! Joyce's idea here IS possible: since there are certainly a finite number of languages, it would be quite possible to represent them all within one book, even if not humanly possible. What Joyce does, though, is make a helluva LOT of languages stand in for ALL languages. Weak, very.There's a lot more wrong with &quot;FW&quot;, too. For example, in a great many of his neojoylogisms, Joyce conveniently ignores the possible readings of his recombinations -- and subsequently asks the reader to do so. Joyce, the control freak, is not in complete control, his words come back to haunt him. (I don't say this is all the time, but . . .)And I haven't even gotten to my tag line: the ultimate one-trick pony. (Okay: a couple of tricks.) &quot;FW&quot; is nothing more than a collection of erstwhile fables and puns, served up with the aforementioned linguistic salad (vide supra for the implicative failures of the latter). There's nothing to probe beneath this rococo surface, only the unscrambling and decoding. Recirculation of history? That can be probed in a paragrpah or two, perhaps a pair of pages. What else? Does Joyce score points of originality? Of course! Ambition? O my! But how long before different manifestations of HCE gets old? Just because Joyce's allegories are bigger must we pretend he came up with the idea? Ad rem ad nauseum.If you love Joyce's writing (and I never much do) here, fine. Perhaps you'll find his puns amusing, his tales compelling. Certainly his workmanship is impressive -- I don't care how short it ultimately measures up. To me, &quot;FW&quot; is a crucible of Joyce's elementary particles, his three flavors of quark -- patience, knowledge, and ego. But I suspect that this book is little above what could be produced by a later series of HAL if you fed it enough information and a rather simple list of specifications. No computer could approach &quot;Lolita&quot;, &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;, or &quot;Arcadia&quot; -- or &quot;Ulysses&quot;, for that matter; but &quot;FW&quot; does so few things (instead simply doing them over and over and over and over (okay, perhaps that's somewhat fitting), changing the players but never the play) that it seems little more than the work of a machine, so contained is the arc of creativity which subsumes the various recombinatives. Madelbrot sets produce something similar, although with infinite (as far as we know) variety. I give it a 6: one above average for all that hard work.

Nevertheless I give James 3 stars for his playfulness, and for showing us emphatically that rules are for fools. For the same playful spirit along with coherence, wisdom and compassion I highly recommend anything by Nobel laureate Jose Saramago, in my humble opinion a superior writer to Joyce and a writer who writes for and plays with all of us. My feeling is that wisdom, compassion, and the abilty to communicate lucidly count for a whole lot more than linguistic gymnastics, ingenious experimentation with the archetypal nature of words and impressive erudition. If there is in fact something of substance in Finnegan it will be found by very few. Try Saramago. (I am the self-appointed minister and creator of the Jose Saramago church of common sense.) With his vast knowledge of mythological tales, I'm sure that James Joyce knew that after the hero goes into the dark forest to search out, and finally attains the boon, he returns with the boon so that the world (or at least the social group) can also enjoy the benefits of that which was won. Although I do believe that Joyce found his way there, upon returning he shared that hard won boon with only a few of his buddies. Fortunately for all of us, there were those who took the boon from James and learned from that which it offered. Was James Joyce a genious? I believe he was.(however) In The Portait and his other writings he states clearly what he considers to be \\"proper art\\" and improper art\\", declaring that \\"Art\\" intended to teach, instruct, guide (didactic), is not \\"proper\\" to what he feels to be \\"ART\\". He pretty much stuck to that. After Dubliners and The Portrait, he didn't teach us anything. Although Ulysses and Finnegan are certainly \\"ingenious\\" creations, They are not Great books.

It is a conscious, personal and adventurous discovery, and it is one that will leave you perplexed and pleased to no end. Give it a shot. And then a dozen more. Give it as many shots as it takes to make Finnegans Wake your favourite book."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"Finnegans Wake (spelled without an apostrophe, and spelled many different ways in the actual text) is one of the most difficult, enigmatic, and comedic novels ever written. An extremist might argue that the novel is gibberish--however the language certainly is real and flowing, albeit heavily peppered with portmanteau and deliberately misspelled words. Even characters' names are spelled inconsistently, such that one may not realize how early the three youngsters, Shem, Shaun, and Isobel, are introduced into the novel until rereading. As the novel intentionally ends on the word, \\"the,\\" one can start to reread the book and discover more of its secrets just with an appreciation of the feel for what Joyce is doing.And just what is Joyce doing? At its most basic level, the book is an attempt to capture an entire night of dreaming with the same feel that a dream actually has, and it succeeds. The book reminds me of a more sophisticated version of what I was doing in seventh grade in response to novels that I found pretentious and enigmatic largely due to my more limited vocabulary and life experience and try to write literature that had that same feel, sounded interesting, but did not necessarily have any real meaning. Here, however, there is more to that in Joyce, who certainly inflects his work full of social commentary and satire, and thus, meaning. The book is predominantly composed of wordplay, and its narrative, if it can be said to have any is structural and slight.My understanding of the book is based on my own perceptions of the actual text combined with the introduction by John Bishop and the outline of chapter contents. The central character is a man named H.C. Earwicker, in the sense that he is the dreamer, but he is not telling us the story, at least not most of the time--he is experiencing it. He has a wife named Anna Livia Plurabelle, and they have the three aforementioned children, young adults now, who are major players in the dreams that follow. It begins with a town and a museum, and we are introduced to many colorful characters who never appear again, but not in the conventional way of a narrator, but rather experientially. Various crimes are committed and suspects nabbed.The book becomes lucid in a Carollian sense more than eighty pages in with the trial and exoneration of the obviously guilty Festy King, followed y his sea passage. There is something about a letter from Anna to H.C.E., but that shifts into a manifesto on writing nominally about The Book of Kells, but more trying to philosophize how one goes about the act of writing..H.C.E. has two sons, Shem and Shaun. Shem is guilty of forgery and all sorts of non-violent crimes. Shaun is the good son and adored by his sister, Isobel. H.C.E. eventually reasserts himself into the story, but while in a drinking bout with his friends, he passes out and we enter into a synapse-firing remembrance of the story of Tristan and Isolde. If you don't know the story, you won't learn it here, since it's mostly follows arguments of a bunch of men in a boat, with references to King Mark and the ill-fated romance, ending in a poem.Shaun and Shem get into a major argument over Shem's ethics, and after example and counterexample, Shem sends Shaun down a river. Eventually he crashes onto a shore and receives a new identity. Nevertheless, he is still able to speak at Isobel's confirmation in the church. She sends Shaun a letter telling of her deep love for him, perhaps not entirely appropriately for siblings, and joins a convent at the age of twenty.Shaun, now called Yawn is pushed into a seance and answers questions as numerous people. Eventually, H.C.E. asserts himself, and he proves to be brash and arrogant, claiming himself as the conqueror of many lands and going into detail about supposedly heroic acts and the building of a new city, as well as his marriage to ALP, which seems to be alternately a courtship and a rape.Nevertheless, after an examination of the greatness of a youth named Kevin, Anna Livia Plurabelle tries to wake H.C.E. This section of the book feels very romanticized. Although it is as opaque as the rest of the novel, it is reminiscent of the common romantic tropes of older couples reminiscing on their courtship and how young they were when they became husband and wife. This, then trails off into the intro, through its ending on the word \\"the,\\" and not because Joyce died or stopped writing--he lived three more years after the book was published to his exact specifications, seemingly misspelled words and all.No book has ever captured what it is really like to dream the way Finnegans Wake does--as interesting as, for example, Neil Gaiman's The Sandman is, it still takes more or less a conventional and relatively rational approach to the most irrational of thoughts and makes too much sense to be the capturing of a dream on paper. Can the book be faulted for its use of clich&eacute;s? It certainly has a lot of them, even if the hybridized words present these tired sayings with multiple meanings of new and old. More unfortunately is its frequent use of the N word in ways that do not appear to be parodistic. He even creates an obvious portmanteau with the word \\"niggardly\\" that doesn't seem to be anything but pure racism, which is kind of disappointing since so many ideas in the book seem so ahead of their time. Moments like this are embarrassing to read. It is often in the danger zone between being puerile and writing about puerility in many of its anatomical references, most of which actually do not appear in the \\"four positions of lovemaking between HCE and ALP\\" section.Overall, the work is best appreciated as a work of art with a comic vision, rather than as a story, or as a series of jokes. Anthony Burgess's comment on the back cover that the work has things to make one laugh aloud on every page is probably true. I laughed aloud at many a page in this book, and I am sure there are many, many jokes in the book that I did not get other than appreciating the entire tapestry. It left me wondering if it is even possible to do anything truly experimental with the written word, or if Joyce completed every possible verbal experiment imaginable with the book. He probably did not, but as much as I would like to write in this vein, it seems that he covered so many as to have made a creative cul-de-sac, in that one is simply doing a take-off on Joyce. Many have said that this is exactly what Samuel Beckett did, although I do not agree. While Joyce influenced Beckett, Beckett's work is pretty standard-lexicon and even a book as difficult as The Unnamable is more of a character study than Finnegans Wake, and thus move in a new direction that is not a dead end, in a spare style of observation rather than the fill-in-the-blanks of the conventional novels that general retell the same stories we already know and feel like clich&eacute;s even if there are not any clich&eacute; phrases as such. This is not your plot-driven page-turner. You will not be compelled to return to it out of interest in where the plot is headed (though you may at some points in the second half, which is a little more accessible than the first, if only because reading the first half makes the second half seem clearer), but to appreciate the artistry, the wordplay, what clever bit is he going to give you next, and what thoughts will it provoke in me. Any book that works in those latter terms is a triumph for the author. It may be a triumph for the reader to get through, but the reward is not in having finished something so difficult. I found myself wanting to read it again immediately upon coming to the final \\"the,\\" and as the clarity of the first several pages improved a great deal, I really had to decide that now is not the time to begin the book again, simply because it is such an insider work that one has to have been exposed to as much literature prior to 1939 as one possibly can to gain more fruit. Not far from the beginning, and not far from the end, are dialogues between characters modeled on Mutt and Jeff--the characters have different names from the end as to the beginning, but with all of Shaun's name changes, one can only assume Joyce wanted us to read these as the same characters--old comic strip characters most people today would be unfamiliar with, and whose names mean something to me only because I have heard of them in reference to the history of comics. Joyce draws from so many disciplines--some portions are enhanced by familiarity with the work of Mozart, for example--that it is clearly a book to return to years later, or else take a shortcut via the many books written about it. The book took me about two months to read at roughly an hour or two per day. I would definitely want to acquire my own copy and go back to it and see how my perceptions have changed now that I have a feel for the work's overall structure, although it would probably years before I reexamine the novel, if it can be called that rather than simply verbal art, musical and poetic, as a whole."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"Possibly the most difficult book in the English language (if that is what it is in) but worth all the trouble in deciphering, which is immensely helped by the Introduction. I recommend also all the other guides to The Wake because, believe me, you will need all the help you can get in getting through this book. Then, read it again; then, read it again. Soon the mesmerizing language of this dreamscape will reveal its many beauties. Well worth any effort."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":".... is definitely an understatement. I thought Nabokov was an intensely self-referential and thoroughly allusive writer. This knocks him out of the park(in those departments, at least).Although I'm sure that John Bishop's statement(in the edition that has the introduction written by him) that, for Arabic and Hungarian readers, there are Hungarian and Arabic puns on every page, is an hyperbole. Most likely Joyce learned about ten to twenty words in most of these languages(most scholars guess 60 to 70 are used at least once), wrote them out phonetically(if they were in a different alphabet) and began puzzling for various contexts to place them in to be the wittiest or most clever(or, some will say, the most profound). I also think that while Joyce said he wrote Ulysses to puzzle scholars, he wrote Finnegan's Wake to fool them. As other reviewers have said he was hardly concerned with the exact replication of words when dictated or transcribed from notes to another draft. His concern (presumably; he may have had none at all) was more on the overall arc of the story(the descent into darkness and the subsequent climbing out of it; that is, if there even is a story)Not that Finnegan's Wake is a genius's(or madman's; or charlatan's...) trifle; he spent 17 years of his life on it, so of course it had atristic and literary value to him. But examining it bit by bit will likely not get you as far to Joyce's intended themes as interpreting larger pieces and whole structural parallels.Of course, there are camps that say the point of Finnegan's Wake was that anything can be interpreted in any way. And I'm inclined to agree with them. But under that, I feel, is a more intentional story of family, history, and... well, other reviews have lists of them. So maybe Joyce's &quot;Take it as you like it&quot; device is a superficial example of what he really did intend for you to walk away with.Anyhow, the first time I read Finnegan's Wake I thought it was actually going to be about a wake... I had read it was about &quot;one night&quot;, and that it was a comedy about a corpse that couldn't stay dead(&lt;-- this actually isn't an interpretation many people walk away with), and so I pictured a Rules of the Game-esque chateau where a patriarch's family had gathered to fight over the will or estate or something. Also, my 7th grade teacher, who first told me about it, had said that she really enjoyed it, and she was (to me) a conservative old lady who devoured all of those &quot;musty&quot; classics like Gone With the Wind and Emma. So I was expecting some... plot. Especially after reading Dubliners, which barely had any run on sentences.Finnegan's Wake is just as easy to dismiss as to enjoy, and I've known people that to some degree do both. But you should really scan through it(or read said introduction by John Bishop, which gives you a very clear idea of how everything goes down) instead of going by what critics, fans, or teachers say, because the traditional reader (or even the most literate one) may loath it."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"One of the most supremely delicate and beautiful works of art to have been created. Ideas flit through the pages, run parallel, interconnect and cross-fertilise, giving birth to a language that resonates with numinal power. Perhaps the only book that to be understood (if such a thing is possible) must be contained within the mind, and not within clumsy ink. This is a book that refuses to prostitute itself, that forces the reader to interact and seduce it. Only then will anything be gained from it. If you want something that carries its justification and spirit within each word and individual letter then read this. And rejoyce. But a word of advice to all those who follow in its Wake. If you truly love it then it will inspire you to create for yourself. And if this is the case, then by all means echo Joyce but do not ever try to be him. For in taking up the pen you must acknowledge that, however beautiful the old artificer's book is, it is not THE book."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"Gentle readers, beware! Finnegan's Wake is the most difficult book I have ever tried to read. Joyce's play with language, plot, and myth make for one of the most difficult readings in the history of literature.On the other hand, I can say (honestly) that the last ten pages of this book are my favorite in all the world of books. After the twentieth reading, or so, they began to make enough sense to my feeble brain for me to fall in love with this truly spectucular work of language."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"Obviously both and Finnegan proves it. Joyce spent seventeen years on this book, which can be properly read and understood by only one person - James Joyce, who passed away in 1941.Now if you'd like to devote yourself - and perhaps your life - to achieving an understanding of Finnegans Wake, you are certainly free to do so. And, having once attempted to achieve such understanding myself, I can assure you that some of your time will be well spent. But the facts are as follows:1. Joyce was fluent in a number of European languages and had a nodding acquaintance with many more.2. From this knowledge he fashioned a special vocabulary of multilingual blends and puns which he used, with ordinary English syntax, to create the solipsistic discourse of Finnegans Wake. It is, in effect, a private language.3. Since most of his vocabulary is drawn from, and puns on, the languages Joyce was familiar with, the only way one can begin to understand what's happening is to be as familiar with them as James Joyce.4. The entire book is said to narrate the mostly incoherent nighttime dream of its antihero, \\"HCE.\\" This was Joyce's way of \\"getting at\\" (whatever that means here) some sort of unconscious European cultural mind - as apprehended and imagined by James Joyce, of course.5. Finnegans Wake is thus basically incomprehensible. The explications in Campbell & Robinson's Skeleton Key, while well informed, are, as the authors admit (though not in these words) the only sense they could make of it with the assistance of a shelf full of reference books. By getting in on the ground floor, C & W effectively dared anyone to disagree. Which would, of course, require another pair of literature Ph.D.'s with another shelf of reference books. There can be more than one interpretation of Finnegans Wake, including a belief in the profitlessness of interpretation.6. Once in a while Joyce can still write a melodious sentence that is close enough to English to carry some meaning. As readers of Dubliners, Portrait of the Artist, and Ulysses are aware, Joyce was at one time a master of poetic English prose. Searching for the poetic moments, and those alone, makes for a pleasant diversion, and will undoubtedly reward the extremely well read and knowledgable.If you're still intrigued, your best bet is to find a copy of the drastically abridged edition with commentary that Anthony Burgess put out forty years ago. Burgess loved Finnegans Wake in the Campbell-Robinson interpretation, and he supplies enough editorial matter to aid you in your innocent quest to believe in Finnegans' greatness. The book may be useful to some as a kind of Rorschach/I Ching for your own creativity: \\"How many puns and themes can *I* find?\\"This book allegedly turned Derrida into a Deconstructionist. I believe it. Students of OCD and associated disorders should take a look at the entire Finagin Fannomenikonn, if you know what I mean."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"Was FINNEGAN'S WAKE written as an experimental novel, or as a literary prose mutation? Not knowing the literary terra incognita ahead, I approached my commitment to the understanding of this book as a trek through a vast poetic jungle, with much hacking through the vines of allusion & wordplay.This is Joyce's \\"night book\\", a prodigious grabbag of allegory, history, literary allusion, and amalgamated word-alchemy. The words are fused & outright disfigured in order to assemble this pastiche, this mulligan stew, of seemingly unrelated ideas; the loops & pivots of the prose weave through many many puns, allusions and strange coinages.Without bothering to find and focus upon a plot, I felt at times I was bodysurfing though some very choppy poetic surf. Of course, there is a vague cyclical storyline in this convoluted book: the tale of HCE & his family life in Dublin etc. For the reader who insists upon a traditional story structure ... well, you can forget about finding much more than vague patterns amidst the seeming absurdities of the text.Joyce incorporated some of the text of FINNEGAN'S WAKE from listening to his schizophrenic daughter Lucia as she slowly lost her sanity. He composed this book as a leap through the subconscious imagination of mankind, with attention to all our collective guilt, conflict, love and fear. This book may be the quantum physics of modern literature ...For me, it took the better part of 5 months to plow though this book. I had just come off a harrowing 3 months of aggressive chemo and major surgery, and was looking for ways to heal up. As strange as it may sound, the unintelligibleness of FINNEGAN'S WAKE helped to restore me back to a healthy life. By the power of poetic prose, my mind was occupied while the rest of me was allowed to heal up. I can say both literally, and figuratively, that James Joyce helped me gain back my life.For a sample reading of this text, I recommend you find James Joyce on Myspace and listen to the clip where he reads the Anna Livia Plurabella chapter of FW; the spoken dream of the collective unconscious, the rhythmic cadence of Joyce's voice, all show the way to the endless cycling of the eternal ...Most highly recommended.ParataxisThe Cloud ReckonerExtracts: A Field Guide for Iconoclasts"},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"Finnegans Wake is the most controversial and experimental of Joyce's works. As far as sheer ingenuity goes, it is one of the greatest novels ever written. Each sentence needs deciphering as he has double-meanings, and multiple languages, in almost every word. I think it would take a true Renaissance Man, skilled in classical and modern languages, with an understanding of Irish history, and a strong grasp of literature, to even have a chance of understanding what is occurring within these pages.I am not such a man.The book scores high on what it is: an experiment in language and literature. It is abysmally unreadable to what I would consider an average reader, however, and in this sense it fails completely as a novel.I forced myself through this book simply because it was the last one I needed to read to finish Modern Library's Top 100 English Language Novels of the Twentieth Century. If it had been the first one I tried, I highly doubt I would have continued reading this book or the others on the list.If you want a challenge, or need to read this for a class or penance for great sins, then proceed.

Sometimes, the pretentious will tell you that you need decades of study before even glancing at the first page of text, or times, it's the assertion that a dry gloss of wounded-hand heroes and other Joseph Campbell-style tropes of myth are the required lens; that the sexuality, humor, and apparent spontaneity are all illusory because this is a serious book. Of course, it is a serious book, because sex, jokes, and the moment are all serious things. Serious enough for great consideration and extended rumination, serious enough to include one truly tragic and one genuinely funny moment per page, at a minimum. But, never so serious the ribald excitement, the childish humor, the elegant puns or pretty wrecks should be locked up and kept from everyone.One strain of Finnegans Wake's story is just that, the locking up for fantastic elements of our everyday wonderful existence, ostensibly because we aren't educated enough, serious enough, or blessed enough to have and appreciate nice things like that, and throwing away the key into a fastrunning stream of rhetoric. But the rest of the Wake is set in opposition to that strain, makes a mockery of those empty stabs at repression, those silly trite bouts of selfish self-congratulatory elitism pretending to be knowing concern. Finnegans Wake has little need to obfuscate for any reason but to entice, as a beautiful scene beyond a parting veil or a what-the-butler-saw peep machine. It makes a burlesque of life, and teases away while giving forth just as that, but it is not malicious in its restraint or its flourishes; it wants us to come along!Foremost, Finnegans Wake is fun and wants us to have fun. Anyone tells you different, is lying or misguided. Lilting leaning longing lunging lusting and lasting, the Wake wants us all along. It wants us to keep up. I say it, because it does escape the commands of authors and the demands of readers. The book lives extant, it reacts to us as we react to it, and its self-reflexive nature allow the read of the book, the text(s) and the gloss(es) to grow and change as we grow and change, as the world, its history present and future change.You understand Finnegans Wake. Go in knowing that and let no one convince you otherwise. What you understand, reading it, may not be what someone else understands, but neither need by incorrect or immature. You understand Finnegans Wake. It may fall on you as a happy wreck's debris hits the street or is sucked out to see, it might rule over you as queenly puns or prestigious parents, but parents are always progeny, too, queens are moved about quite easily when you are playing the right games, salvage has charms to muse as sooth (or something similarly reaching).The book is about a mountain and a river and as anyone who has played king of the mountain or water games knows, if you take the games too seriously, the conquest as more important than the play, you probably end up having a miserable time every moment you aren't on top. Give up the conquest and go for the play! Jump in, splash about, climb to see what you can where you can, and to jump that much further and make that much bigger a splash when down you crash! And ignore anyone who tells you, you can't backstroke along a mountain or climb up water; \\"Any landing you walk away from,\\" they say, \\"is a good one,\\" and that includes the landing at the top of the stairs, the height where you're king of the hill, or the muddle of the river rushes."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"OH MY GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Not as good as sex...depending.

So long as there is any spark of consciousness alive to the soul of the inspired and the beautiful they will find the true depth and the love that is continuously overflowing from every precise and pain-staking sentence left in print by Joyce. There is nothing worse than debunking people on the grounds that they have a &quot;superiority complex&quot; for the complaint lodged returns on itself and is the ultimate height of meaningless ressentiment and banal venality concievable to our generally tawrdy affair of humanity.

Joyce was the world's colossal novelist of some of the greatest verbal, parodistic, historic, metamorphic metaphorical powers with more learning and intellectual ability than any Einstein, Eisenhower, Edison or other. To cite a minor case: Joyce knew all of the Wake word for word, the full Book of Kells history of Ireland, the works of Flaubert, some number of operatic works, and an inexhaustible number of miscellanea. The vicarious thrills of the bourgeois hero-centered novel and attendent intellectual masturbations are met with and answered best by Joyce's book. Finnegans Wake cannot be understood without an extensive study of the literature and history alluded to, if it is to be intelligently understood--but neither can the world. Such is the parable: no free rides, no instant access: your lust for fast gratification with no sacrifice bars you from amounting to more than another nauseous busybody in the roller-coaster shows rolling obtrusively and noisily to oblivion.

Not Everybody. In terms of quantum reality theory and cyborg anthropology, The Wake is structured around a recursive temporal spiral, overlaying an archetypally-driven consciousness matrix.While one could break the book down into a basic linear story, which weaves and meanders through the seven-stage structure, like a river, the reductionism or deconstruction approach is itself vulnerable.While there are many serious threads, FW is also a minefield of literary and linguistic-phonentic puns. I once read a review in which the writer dismissed the word \\"upfellbown\\" as one of Joyce's many nonsense words. Nope. Upfellbown is a phonetic portrayal of the German word apfelbaum, or apple tree, which Joyce had mentioned slightly earlier in the text. Where people often go off the deep end is in attributing undue significance to these individual words.If The Wake is about anything, it is about phenomenology or holism versus reductionism. The significance of the whole versus the sum of the parts. You don't understand The Wake, you experience it. On a vastly simpler level, the superb Bruce Willis movie 12 Monkeys brilliantly captures the beauty of the recursive temporal symmetry that underlies Joyce's re-entrant epic.For those who have never read FW, it is basically about an Irish bricklayer called Tim Finnegan (Finnegans Wake being a traditional song, of sorts) who falls, probably drunkenly, from a ladder. The 'story' that follows is either his Death Dream or Near Death Experience, in which the entireity of Earth's history cycles through his mind. (There has even been debate about the identity of the Dreamer.) Symbolically, Finnegan's fall from the ladder could be representative of the Fall of Lucifer or the Fall of man.The Wake means whatever it means to the individual reader at that point in his or her lifetime. For me, the many references to the Triple Goddess and Masonic ritual leaped out of the text. Yet had I not read so much about these things, the references would mean nothing. Yet, I have probably missed thousands of things that others will see.Quick example... The three main female characters, Kate, Issy (Isis) and ALP form the principle references to the presence of the Great Mother/The Triple Goddess. Both Ulysses and Finnegans Wake are about return. The return to the cosmic womb of the Great Mother. The beginning and the end of Time.Issy is Isis, who is in herself the Mother Goddess. Issy's room is blue with a ceiling of stars - \\"the twinkly way\\". A classic feature of the ceilings of Masonic lodges. Sirius, the Star of Isis is the Blazing Star of freemasonry, whose square and compass logo can be extended out to form a pentagram, depicting the four elements, plus the fifth element - the Creatrix. The third degree ceremony of freemasonry is a symbolic death and rebirth, symbolized by the skull and crossbones - the sign of Osiris risen. The Wake, which itself is about rebirth and resurrection - Finnegan = Finn Again, has many esoteric references, and even obvious ones, such as PHOENIX Park, and the fact that the book is set on March 21st, the Spring or Vernal Equinox - the beginning of the pagan New Year.Aw hell, I'm rambling. That's the trouble with The Wake. It sucks you in. Give it a shot, but don't try to understand it from the outset. Try to just read it all the way through first and then maybe do some dissection. Whereas Ulysses is 24 hours out of Bloom's life, allegorically interwoven with the Ulysses myth (instead of returning to Ithaca, he returns to Number Seven Eccles Street), FW is just too massive to see a linear series of exact correspondences. There's also a great deal of literary chaff. The man had a sense of humour, after all.The bottom line for me, is that The Wake is about the transforming power of the Feminine - like Mary Poppins, like Chocolat, like A Midsummer Night's Dream, like Alice In Wonderland and Through The Looking Glass, like Cities Of The Red Night...Here Comes Everything..."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"O.k. this book is unreadable.

That title is a Joycean pun (it's even \\"bad\\" and ungrammatical in the way of Joyce's puns) and the entire book and its sequel is written in the manner of FINNEGANS WAKE, slightly simplified (fewer foreign words).John Ashbery also writes in a simplified form of FINNEGANS WAKE's style, and some people think he is the greatest living American poet.Thornton Wilder based his 1942 Broadway play THE SKIN OF OUR TEETH on WAKE, and was \\"found out\\" by Joseph Campbell and by Edmund Wilson.There are several other writers who have been influenced by WAKE in this way, including several hit rock lyrics. Lennon's book was not only popular among Beatles fans, it demonstrated to lots of them how Lennon was a very special and intelligent writer -- yet he couldn't have written it without the example of Joyce behind him.All this is no particular reason to think WAKE is good or great. But it did create a new way of writing, and that new way has led to success for other writers beside Joyce. That in itself suggests that WAKE is an important book. It can also be thought of as a \\"failure\\" or a \\"mistake.\\" Even so, with that kind of influence, it would still be important.Of course it didn't spring up out of nowhere: the Humpty Dumpty chapter in THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS covers a lot of its techniques. And there's a lot of writing from the nonsense writers of the nineteenth century that is (deliberately) harder to understand than WAKE, or even impossible to understand, because the authors wanted it that way. Those writings were also popular and influential. Some people enjoy nonsense. And of course language specialists study nonsense, because it shows how complicated language can get and still be interesting (and worth the price of a book) to some people.Joyce was a very thorough comic craftsman and he had a lot of fun with his works. He is not part of a conspiracy and readers like John Lennon liked him from Day One. The negative reviewers on this site honest to goodness don't get it."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"Finnegans wake is a written out dream. It took 17 years to write, it was a labor of love. Upon release it polarized critics, with its sampling of 60-70 different languages, its use of multi-lingual puns, portmanteaus, it reads more like a word puzzle than a book. It has no discernible plot upon first inspection. The first sentence is the middle of the last sentence making it an endless cycle, and upon first read it looks like a load gibberish. And you friend reader may wonder why one would read such a work? Simply put: It is one of the most brilliant works of the 20th century (or any time for that matter). Here is the reason why. It is highly inter-textual, upon closer inspection you can see the level of detail Joyce put into this work. Every page is layered with meaning upon meaning upon further meaning. If you calculate it, 17 years, 628 pages, thats about a sentence or a little more a day. With that said. How can anyone say (like these many one star reviews) that it is just gibberish. if someone wrote that little a day, it should be apparent that this is the exact opposite of gibberish. Gibberish is to imply that it is nonsense and lacks meaning altogether. This couldn't be farther from the truth with this work. Each word or group of words or sentence is so packed with meaning that one could spend a week analyzing one page. That is the complete opposite of gibberish in my opinion. but also, this work is a hilarious tome of comedy and beauty. its use of language can make you laugh on every single page. but I digress. this work as previously stated is a work of genius and there is the reasoning. (i'm also fairly sure it is a microcosm of the universe which contains the meaning of life and other things)."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"Usually readers wants benefit from a book, especially from a novel. They want to learn some historical, ethical or philosophical.Or they just want to enjoy it; but this is also a benefit. The relation between a novel and a reader is an 'interested' relation. Whereas, Finnegans Wake is pure, abstract literature where you can 'get' nothing. You cannot buy or sell anything, when you read it. You get connected to pure literature that hurts you a bit. But it is a challange: a challange that teaches you if you are an egoist or not. Who are not egoists can taste Finnegans Wake. It is the best novel I have ever read. Sorry about it!"},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"That's really the the whole point, a multi-dimensional romp through the universe of our understanding and experience. More than anything I know in all art, the Wake makes me happy, and glad to be alive. But you must be able to read it in Irish tone and rhythm before it works. It takes a while, but when you start laughing you may know you're on the right track."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"The one thing that has struck me upon reading the negative reviews of Finnegans Wake on this page is the seemingly immature reactions of those who failed to enjoy it. One reviewer says his 'farts make more sense', while another says he urinated over a picture of Joyce because he couldn't understand the book. Pathetic. Sounds very like a 12 year olds reaction to me. I know, I know, it's a big step up from your Harry Potter books, but get over it, you either like it or you don't. I find it hilarious to hear people rave on and on about how Joyce commits disgusting crimes against the English language and so on. It's so plainly obvious that the people who write these things are people who are frustrated and afraid because they can't understand a book that is so acclaimed and highly-regarded and so to cover up the fact that they simply couldn't decipher it (which is nothing to be ashamed of) they attack Joyce and accuse him of destroying the English language. Give me a break - he revolutionised it.Now, Finnegans Wake is not exactly a book with an exact point or meaning to discover. It is there for you to use, so to speak. It is a wide open universe of sound, image, thought.... almost everything. You can just open a page and draw something magical from it. It is like an encyclopedia of literature. It is also probably one of the most self-indulgent books of all time, seeing as only Joyce was able understand its 'true' meaning, if there is one at all. It would be completely impossible to read this like a novel, page to page, chapter to chapter. This is a book with no beginning and no end, literally. The first line continues from the last line. This symbolises the theory that history goes around in circles. There really is not much to be said, other than you can find every other book written inside Finnegans Wake. It is a linguistic zenith. It is the sum of all modernist work. It is a masterpiece. And, there is no pretense or snobbery with this review. I am an Irish teenager and I happened to enjoy Dubliners so I read his other books in order of their release, and I found each one a work of genius. This is not simply an intellectual book, for intellectual garble is only a fraction of the books power. I feel you could give this book to a ten year old and they could fall in love with it, that is, if it had a nice colourful cover with smily faces and flowers on it. Anyways, that's my review. You can either surrender to immature jealousy and fear just like D.H. Lawrence and Virginia Woolf did when Ulysses was published, or you can open your mind and really use your imagination to get something from this classic."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"&quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;, the central scripture of devout Joyceanites is, as far as could read into it, a monument to Joyce's artistic enterprise &amp; simultaneously an elephantine failure. Briefly:1. Books are written to be read. They are to be read in a human language, not in a privately constructed enigmatic mishmash one can decipher, but the process of deciphering leads to...nowhere. Even turgid &amp; clumsy philosophical authors like Hegel or Heidegger had something to convey, a &quot;vision&quot; of reality. &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;, on the other hand is a carefully constructed labyrinth of &quot;perennial&quot; themes, inducing in reader's mind...epiphany ?...wisdom ?...emotions ?.. no, unfortunately only boredom. This is a book built on books &amp; mythic ( rationally catalogued ) patterns, but not a living creation nor a powerful myth itself. There is something unpleasant, musty, simply *wrong* about this novel....In other words, I experienced this &quot;novel&quot; as Joyce's prolonged ( over almost 20 years ) &quot;masturbation&quot; on his private, but in no way universal, fantasies.2. What are the merits of this book ? Let's see:a) is it cognitively strong ? Do I perceive the world in enhanced or expanded way after reading it ? Plato, Nietzsche, Augustine, Shankara, Jung ? No.b) is it aesthetically satisfying ? No. Apart from a few &quot;musical&quot; passages, this is, compared to Joyce's earlier work, a sad spectacle of a &quot;noble mind o'erthrown&quot; ( or ensnared by its own projections- something similar to the Tibetan Book of the Dead ).c) is it a book of wisdom, like Conrad's or Proust's ? Or of mythic power, like Melville's or Dostoevsky's novels ? Or a &quot;philosophical&quot; prose, like Mann's fiction or Freud's essays ? Or esoteric vision(s) of cosmos, like Tantric or Gnostic scriptures ? Unfortunately, the answer is a resounding NO to all these questions.I suppose the only people ( apart from professional idolaters ) who would extract some sort of pleasure by reading &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; are folx who revel in puns, conundrums &amp; rebus-addicts. As for the &quot;Wake&quot;, I gave it 3 stars as an homage to author's relentless pursuit of his vision ( however flawed or sterile it may be )...."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"I can't see why everybody, even if they don't understand Finnegan's Wake, proclaims it to be a 'masterpiece' and that it encapsulates 'the entirety of human history'.

I read the first page and thought &quot;this is ridiculous&quot;, so I put it back on my shelf and got a book that actually makes sense.

Therefore, I've formulated my OWN little theory about what this book is about: it's about nothing. It's just words that mean nothing, so that people can make whatever they like out of it, and smart people can sound smart and dumb people can listen to them, then transcribe the smart people's words verbatim, and sound smart! That little theory makes just about as much sense as Finnegan's Wake and all of the professing Professors that devote their lives to sounding intelligent, when, ultimately, Finnegan's Wake is just a bunch of nonsense.Don't get me wrong- I'm a nice guy (don't worry- I'm from Australia)"},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"NO!

And the blather about circular design reflects something I recall reading about how Joyce intended the reader to be able to read the book from any point and in any direction with equal felicity. It worked; it's idiotic from start to finish.So what's the end result? Well, you remember that old example that's used to demonstrate the magnitude of infinity--if you set down infinty monkeys in front of infinity typewriters (I suppose now it's computers) eventually one of them types Hamlet. Well, I think it's safe to suppose that in the meantime, they're typing Finnegan's Wake.Now, some folks claim that it should be read for the beauty of it's language alone.

How...gauche. How naive.&quot;Well, Finnegan's Wake *is* hogwash. I know people have devoted their scholarly &quot;lives&quot; to &quot;translating&quot; this or that or the other passage...what a sad, futile, and pathetic way to devote one's energies!Listen: I have worked as a computer programmer. Instead of &quot;reading&quot; this James Joyce monstrosity, just get 10-15 different foreign language dictionaries, then program your computer to randomly jumble words together. Every few lines or so, make some random allusion to some mythology, or country, or river. You'll get something completely indistinguishable from Finnegan's Wake. (In fact, I've always wanted to arrange a test to see if the average Joyce fan could even tell the difference.)Come to think of it, maybe that's what is so &quot;impressive&quot; about Finnegan's Wake...Joyce had no access to a computer!One pet peeve I have is that everyone assumes that every nonsense word actually has a meaning in some language, and that this was INTENDED by Joyce. Well, that's nonsense. For example, the quote &quot;bad of wind&quot; is supposed to make us shudder with admiration for such a clever author, since (supposedly) &quot;bad&quot; means &quot;wind&quot; in Persian. Ah hah...get it? So clever! What a genius!Well, you know what? &quot;Bad&quot; has meanings in other languages, too, including English. I doubt Joyce knew three words of Persian. My point is that in a collection of random nonsense words as dense as Finnegan's Wake, a HUGE number of randomly selected words and letter-groups will have meanings in SOME language. There are lots of languages out there, folks. Coincidence doesn't make genius.I'm not saying ALL the &quot;puns&quot; are unintentional, but that doesn't mean that Joyce is an artist.

I think it is natural to dislike it, however, and I don't think it makes a neanderthal of me because I dislike it too. Look, as a teen I read Thomas Aquinas's Summa Theologica; I struggled through at least half of Sartre's Being and Nothingness, and I've read Chekhov, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, Kierkegaard and Faulkner. I don't mind struggling with a book if I can mine something from it. FW is too long for such playful babble. I might read a pamphlet of such gobbledegook just for the fun or the exercise of my imagination, but this monster book? I have to feel that Joyce was playing a joke on everyone, or he'd really gone off his rocker. Why should we even bother? I also read Beckett's Waiting for Godot and found that a complete waste of time. My reaction was that it was absurd, but I guess the theatre of the absurd is supposed to be just that. But why bother? I can stand on a crowded street corner and hear trivial chatter as meaningful as Beckett's play. It kind of reminds me of something I saw in an art gallery years ago, during the \\"pop art\\" craze: a rectangular piece of cardboard, painted with white enamel, mounted on a flat-white background, named, appropriately, \\"White Enamel on White.\\" Yet it had an inflated price tag, and I did hear a few oohs and ahhs from people behind me. Feeling like a barbarian, I snorted and left the gallery. This is art? And Finnegan's Wake is literature? Please, give me a break.Words that don't communicate are just meaningless black symbols on white paper. What was Joyce trying to communicate? Sure, I can get a kick out of several minutes of it, but then I'm eager to return to the real world. I can't help wondering if the 5-star reviews for FW are written by the same kind of people who sighed over the white cardboard in the gallery, or who find deep meanings in Waiting for Godot. Still, maybe I am a barbarian, and maybe they're of a higher order than I am, so I'm willing to congratulate them for finding gold ore in FW, and wish them happy babbling on their re-read of this inflated classic.

During the past few years I have picked up Finnegans Wake on numerous occasions and read parts of it. It is beautiful. The sounds are so overwhelming that I always find myself repeating them over and over. Joyce was a master with language and this book was his 'masterpiece' of language play.

My goal was to get through it, reading every word and trying to make sense out of the puns but not worrying excessively about deciphering the meaning. Someday I may go through it with a fine-toothed comb, but this time around I wanted to read it as I would any novel. The verdict?Well, Finnegans Wake is clearly masterfully put together. For someone like me, with a solid knowledge of Latin and word roots, the puns that made use of etymology (and those are a large proportion of the puns) are not difficult to decipher; I also frequently had the pleasant experience that miscellaneous bits of obscure knowledge floating in the back of my head, that I never thought I would use, were jolted into memory by a passing reference in the book. Joyce poured references of every describable kind amongst the pages, and I could tell that I was not understanding even a small fraction of them, nor was I (by a long shot) understanding the book at every level. Finnegans Wake is like a delicious ice-cream cone that is covered in one of those crunchy shells. Now, imagine trying to eat through that shell only by licking, and that is what kind of task getting to the meat of Finnegans Wake is. The reward is delicious, but you have to lick through a heck of a lot of hard chocolate and nuts (I would liken biting through the chocolate to using one of the companion guides: you get to the good stuff quicker, but it might alter the shape of the ice-cream by biting off a chunk).Painfully protracted analogy aside, Finnegans Wake is an excellent investment of time for an educated reader, and even (dare I say it?) fun.

This book is not any of those things. Its \\"intention\\" is to disorient and confuse, to produce an \\"aesthetic arrest\\" and to be an epiphany. FW will never be a blockbuster movie, Hollywood will not touch this. Finn again A WAKE is written, kind of, sort of, in english. One reviewer called it a crossword puzzle in novel form, she is partially right. You can read other [negative] comments from the more simple-minded reviews too, but time has and will prove these knuckleheads wrong. Some claim intellectual independence as a smoke screen but they are hiding behind a myopic view of art and they do not want to put in the effort to research the references and push for a bigger picture. Other reviewers say it doesn't mean anything, Isn't poetry or music but there is a personal hatred to their reviews that tells me they are mad at the art work for not revealing itself, clearly, to them. This group is reviewing and revealing their own frustrations at not being able to conceive of or make great art. True critics, I suppose. They want to defend their defination of what art is, for everyone. This group is quite adamant and takes FW personally, like they are on a crusade to inform the world. I suppose, Joyce has worked his Irish magic on them too.. their banner reads:Books, ultimately, are read for the quality of the ideas they express, and the quality of the style used to express them.critics want to define artistic \\"quality\\". In any case, the \\"ideas\\" of FW have universal essence and are of an epic nature. Unfortunately, some reviewers want the transcendent nature of life to be clear, right in front of them, religion is what other people do and everything is just as it seems. Look, some great works of art do not speak to all, [Picasso's - la guerre] but make no mistake; this book is an incredible work of word art BUT does not reveal itself easily OR to everybody and that is exactly what Joyce wanted, he wanted a few sensitive and intelligent readers to experience an epiphany about the cycles of death, life, myth, history, love, war, hate, sex[lots of sex], \\"social marketing\\", male female, brother, sister, mother father- how these patterns of archetype forces affect us, this is another \\"reality\\", parallel to ours but in dark matter; [Unconscious and subconscious]. FW is not describing these forces but placing us in them by disorienting us, making the reader become part of a jumbled up night world of myth and universal cycles. How these forces of life affect us is a confusing book during the day [James Joyce's Ulysses] but at night they really go off [Finnegans Wake]. People, It doesn't get any more insightful than that.Another reviewer, a Mr. T.Powerless, who wrote a review of the \\"FW Skeleton Key\\", - keeps asking:What you think this book is trying to say in its 600+ pages of indeciperhable ramblings (and some proof would be nice)How he can write a review of a book about the meaning of FW and still keep asking this questions is befuddling. His theory is that it is all just random letters [never mind the puns and historical stuff] and there is no meaning and that all the smart people have been fooled, except him. Finnegans Wake is 95% \\"deciphered\\" but something is lost in trying to put this art book in sound bites or one-sentence sayings. Take the phrase \\"reveiling the night\\". It is \\"saying\\" several things at once, each makes sense but it is also mixed up, obscure and in the mystery of the conjoining of mixed up words, is the art. There are straight forward ideas that can be expressed from FW: one of my favorites- how we should strive for things and concepts that uplift the spirit and these will pull us together, because they inspires us as one people, not on material stuff that separate us, but- really, so what, another \\"good\\" idea but silly in a way. Like the \\"ideas\\" of Hamlet: often puerile, but with Shakespeare's brilliance take on new life. And, when JJ writes the brilliant connotations are imbued in his art. The art is lost in my translations. Yes, but the critic keeps asking, its not clear and What does it MEAN, - but... what is meaning and is meaning always clear?? The hackneyed haiku: the sound of one hand clapping?- what does it mean? The meaning is a paradox or another question. all those things that do not have a sound when struck, but what does that mean? It is not about the meaning of life it is about the feeling of being alive. If you must have a meaning rather than another perspective, understanding or an epiphany: Warning: stop reading FW before you get mad. Clearly, T.Powerless kept reading, couldn't find what it was saying and became irritated.However, FW, as a bit of a mixed up crossword puzzle, demands an explanation, a guide, patience, translations and a key. The best starting points are John Bishop's book and Joseph Campbell's \\" A Skeleton Key to FW\\". In other words, FW MUST ALSO BE STUDIED LIKE A TEXT BOOK, clues must be researched and an adventure game like quality to the mysteries and the possible solutions can be fun. yes, for some tracking down the sources and uses of JJ words and relating it to the essence of a sentence or chapter is part of the mystery. Others see The historical period of FW reflected in the work: pre World War II. Freud and Jung going at it, Picasso and Matisse going off, it was a heady time for all the western cultures. AND to top it off Joyce dies sudenly 6 months after the book is published in 1941!!! Although Joyce hated FW to be called surreal, FW is an abstract work of art and as such, like any great conceptual or complex philosophy [Nietzsche or Wittgenstein] or abstract art, is extremely personal and open to much interpretation. One can get several versions of exactly what is being \\"said\\" from the same passage; this really upsets the material minded and if you are not prepared for this kind of art or thought or are resistant to abstract art then, chances are, FW will be/ is gibberish to you. As The above reviewer states correctly: a good work must have great style, FW has a style of immense complexity and quality but NOT great clarity, intentionly.FW is a huge Irish joke about the cycles of human life, art and thought. There is a twisted sense of humor in this Irish consciousness making a sad joke of life; the punch line is about the Devine Comedy of existence. FW is also an intentional riddle with several answers; the 60 different languages, puns, portmanteaus [the crossword part] with historical and mythical referances as well. the reader can wander and wonder about this book of life for hours or years. At times, like any fine work of abstract art: it reveals the artist and viewer more than the \\"reality\\" of the subject. No, FW can not be translated into another \\"language\\", no it was not written in the way other books are, The 4 books were not written in order and can be understood as independent sketches on different and recurring themes. Yes, joyce had a comprehensive and firm intention when he wrote it. If you start to dig and study the text the book becomes an obscure magic workbook about the recycled archetypical nights of human consciousness. However, unless you are a scholar, you must study the philology or it becomes drivel and unless you have an open mind and can embrace obscurity the work quickly becomes irritating. The sound of the words can be helpful and so some find that FW is often less abstract if read out loud. Like the Hindu vedas, which are songs or hymns, FW has a lyrical quality when read out loud too. In any case the puzzle must be solved in the dark as characters, stories, change, transmute; opposites are defined and then become one and need each other and then digress again. The simple \\"story\\" has been figured out, the references have exhaustedly been researched for the last 70 years and still there are mysteries to this work. Joyce intended this too and future generations will appreciate, miss understand and wonder, love/hate it, fight over and review this book!No, not everything printed on paper is literature and not all words are found in a dictionary, not all communication is with words, from the dictionary, or for that matter verbal. So the one reviewer that says he doesn't dream in puns and his dreams are about \\"something\\" is confusing the description of a dream with the conjuring of the \\"reality\\" of a dream world, using language. the difference between going to the movies or describing the movie. Joyce is NOT trying to describe a dream; he is trying to put you in a dream cycle of life forces in motion. JJ is comunicating with strange english sounding words to make a language of dreams. Joyce's subconscious, night world is obscure, intentionally, like \\"real\\" dreams. This bothers people, just as their own dreams do. This night book has stages, like the night, but there is no meaning to the actual story or beginning or end, the individual dreams have \\"meanings\\" and there is a progression but, like reincarnation or purgatory, there is no end or beginning . How do you escape such a work of art? perhaps a third book about Nirvana or Paradise: a simple book, like the Paridiso of the Devine Comedy. Cambell thought this was in the works when JJ died.I'm sure the greatest thing is NOT to listen or watch the defenders of FW. Although there are some fascinating works on the Wake and Dante, Vico, the Egyptian book of the dead, the book of Krells, Cabala, Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, Talmud and lots of dream consciousness-etc. My suggestion is to read or scan it, with JC's \\"Skeleton Key\\" or Tindall's so you can get a sense of what is being said, see which of the 4 books speaks to you and then start digging on your own, the best annotated guide is now on the internet, John Bishop's book is insightful. he also wrote the intro to the Penguin edition. Stop after a while, put it down, read some other stuff, pick it up later. I knew almost nothing of the philosopher Vico and had not read Dante. James Joyce was a true artistic personality and scholar and, as an eccentric, sardonic Irish scholar, he wanted to be obscure and drive all the other [Irish and non Irish] scholars nuts. NON SERVIAM I am slave to none- was the motto he lived by. This book is intentionally obscure and Joyce is known to have re written parts that were not obscure enough!! WHY? Again, dreams can have several meanings because the dreamer and the dream are one. the dreamer/reader must decide which meaning is pertinent to the story and to your own story and see if it fits. There is a subjective part to making something abstract and a subjective part to interpretation the art. Unfortunately, this vagueness plus the references and language threw the doors open to the cross winds of scholarly conjecture. At the end, however, Joyce is communicating something powerful, eternal [not about time] and wondrous but the reader/dreamer must be prepared to study, dig deep and interpret and sometimes just guess. A Warning label would say: it took him 15 years to write it. 1] There is no bottom 2] the journey is \\"reveiling\\". - if FW doesn't speak to you, that's cool; just don't say there is nothing there if you can't find or see it."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"Haven't read FINNEGANS WAKE in many years, probably not since grad school, but here it is again, everybody talking about it for some reason--it's resumed its place in the zeitgeist, the way Frank O'Hara's \\"Meditations in an Emergency,\\" featured on the season opener of MAD MEN, is now rising up Amazon's best seller list as we speak--has anyone noticed the boxed ad for MAD MEN on AMC right on the page for \\"Meditations\\"? Merchandisers don't miss a trick. When I first read it we really thought it was the greatest novel of all time and we aspired to be just like James Joyce. Then postmodernism set in and FINNEGANS WAKE seemed valuable as a monstrous failure, one that moreover had everything in it, a capacious junkyard like the \\"golden\\" scrapheap at the center of Dickens' OUR MUTUAL FRIEND. In any case I pulled it off the shelf last night at 7:30 and have just come to the end, feeling like I've just swum the English Channel.The back story has never been less obvious to me. Okay, I can just about believe that the whole of the novel (bar some \\"real life\\" events impinging on the dreamers' consciousness--chimes, house noises, bladder pressure) takes place during a dream of a very sound sleeper, but how do they know for sure his name is Porter and that he actually has three children? I always liked the idea of \\"Kevin,\\" my own name, being taken up by the great novelist James Joyce, and that \\"Kevin\\" was the golden boy of the family, but now I don't even remember how I knew his name was Kevin. In any case the dream of Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker shows the eternal return of man (and woman), the endless of cycle of history, exemplified by the legends of Swift, Parnell, Adam and Eve, Tristan and Iseult, even nursery rhyme characters like Humpty Dumpty and Little Boy Blue. The two boys are always in competition with each other, and physically different too, like Laurel and Hardy, except sexier, while the young daughter is the apple of daddy's eye, and sometimes he seems to be lusting after her in an incestuous way. The great setpieces remain hypnotic, but it is significant that they are the extracts that most respect genre conventions--the trial of HCE, the procession of ALP giving out treats for 111 \\"children\\" (or are they the witnesses in Porter's trial for--and what is it he did in Phoenix Park, showed off his \\"penrose\\" I expect? The puns, anagrams, and blended languages keep one guessing, but I can see how they might grow wearying--just keep inhaling them, like weed, and you'll be able to ride the wild surf to the end.I noticed on page 387 that there's a reference to \\"poor Merkin Cornyngwham, the official out of the castle on pension,\\" and I wonder if this is where Merce Cunningham got his name from? Because it's such a grab bag, you can find everything in the book, and it's no wonder my professor used to say that Joybe had predicted events like the Berlin Wall going up, the assassination of JFK and the war in VietNam. Without even meaning to I found Lindsay Lohan! You doubt me, punk? The extravagant exchange of the quarrelling washerwoman, in which every river of the world is named, yields the following: \\"The wee taste the water left. I'll raft it back, first thing in the marne. Merced mudde! Ay, and don't forget the reckitts I lohanned you.\\" After that I knew I would find Lindsay, too, quite close, even though her name might be muddled. Page 527 has, \\"Linda, our seeyu,\\" that sounds close, or how about page 492, where \\"Lindsay\\" becomes \\"Loonacied,\\" as in \\"Loonacied! Marterdyed!! Madwakemiherculossed!!! Judascessed!!!! Pairaskivvymenassed!!!!! Luredogged!!!!!! And, needatellye, faulscrescendied!!!!!!!\\" Why all the exclamation points? More acts of prediction, mirroring the way I feel about Lohan's relationship with Samantha Ronson. All in all, a five star book with something for everybody."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"When I first saw finnegan's wake in the library, I had already heard of its difficulty and strangeness, before i lifted it and looked inside, which only affirmed my suspicion.it was then that I decided I would never read the book. it took only a year or so later to decide to give it a shot.Of course, i recommend at least some sort of guide to help you through, because this is the most difficult book to read possibly in the history of man. 'A Skeleton Key...' is a good one, but I have never checked the other guides so I cant recommend any others, but Campbell's other book on Joyce, 'Mythic Worlds, Modern Words' is also good, perhaps even better, because it provides a guide to all the works of Joyce.He was a difficult writer to read and of course he will get even more difficult to read as his 'pop' (not sure if i should call it pop...) culture reference...historical references is a better term, when his historical references become obscure...not to mention he is a very vague writer, and he expects the reader to exert him/herself on his works constantly. But once the rudiments of the story gather together inside of your head, you can see the sea of information he had inside of his crowning achievement, and thus the reason for the title of the review, and the true beauty of his rambling words, sentences and phrases that at first glance mean nothing, only to eventually coalesce into meaning and poetry.it is a very difficult read, but those up to it might be able to appreciate its grandeur.also, to spoil some of what joseph campbell says in his 'mythic worlds, modern words book', this book is purgatory, evidenced by its dreamlike repetition and idiosyncracies, while Ulysses was Inferno, his illumination of hell within the psychologies and eccentricities of the human mind. his version of paradise was never written, but campbell finds within a letter Joyce wrote to his brother that the words were to be 'simple, lucid' (a clear departure from anything he wrote).i almost feel cheated now that he never wrote it....makes you wonder what might have been in his head, after his latter two monster works..."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"I read them aloud with my kids, age 7 and 5. They have been force fed phonics and Dr. Seuss for the greater part of their lives. I read to them nightly, and have to compete with video games and action adventure comics for their imagination.2 sentences in I knew I had them; They were wide-eyed. 1 page in they were slack-jawed. After 5 pages I closed the book came the myriad pleads &quot;No, don't stop...&quot;Thank you, Mr. Joyce, for making my children smile."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"As an experiment in styles, linguistics and forms, Finnegans Wake is magesterial beyond all others. No book can compare. Much like Ulysses, it's actually very disciplined, very precise and very carefully constructed. Logic demands this. Our need for a logical universe demands this, or an endless wave of unjustified insults upon the writer as a hack, an idiot, a maniac, a con-man or something else...Firmly and foremost, the book is grounded in Irish culture, is a manifestation of the meaning of the Irish ritual of the funerary Wake...It is also a combination of works Joyce had in development at the time; a series of short stories called Finn's Hotel. Perhaps in that isolated, seperate context, things could be understood in a traditional fashion. At the very least, there would have been something of a context for interpretation. Not just for academics, but for regular readers. I don't think Joyce wrote for the intelligentsia, the academia or the writer crowd, certainly only some of his contemporaries in those lots spoke well of him...In the end, Nora Joyce was right, it's literary Chop Suey, chopped together bits, ideas and other things, shot through Joyce's obsessions with lyricism and languages to the outermost extreme of his abilities. The result is pretty much incomprehensible. It's a monster of a book. Reading it is to pick a fight with the Dragon. You will never beat the dragon, but even if you did, you don't get much.I consider it a fine literary accomplishment, and personally I love this book. This literature. This reflection on literature. But I can't in good faith as a critic whose opinions might be read by others recommend it. I mean not to insult or demean others by any stretch. There is little to recommend. It appeals to a certain niche audience, the literary equivalent of stamp collectors.If you must, I have only this advice:1. Don't try to understand it as you read it. The book is written as a series of loops; indeed, it is a loop. Both in its literal construction and in its overall purpose. It is the cyclic notion of history, myth and language interaction. You'll read a page, for example the first page, be taken aback by it, but keep on reading. The skeleton of the plot emerges. Then go back, focus on different details, then another one emerges, entirely unrelated. You'll know when you've come to the edge, or pseudo-edge of the loop, and then you can construct something...I think...I'm probably wrong. Most interlingual stuff is out of my league. I barely passed 8th grade public school Spanish.2. The book is like trying to make out every feature of every person passing you by on a highway where the traffic is going at around 300 miles an hour. This is a book however. You can stop the traffic, reverse it, look at individual passers-by in detail, and learn everything you want or need to know.3. This book is a dream. It is someone's dream, and the dreamer is unknown to us. This is one of the reasons why the plot is so tenuous, and even if it were written in only one language, operating on this understanding means that anything can mean anything, itself or anything else. That it is written in this gobbledygook of portmanteaus, puns, allusions, geographical complexes and so forth forces us to do what we would be less willing to do: Search for a meaning. Back to the review of this, this is not an admirable quality. One which is hard to deliberately construct, praise be to Joyce for this, but not something that makes for good reading, light or heavy.4. Be patient. It's easy to say this, having wrestled with around fifty pages of the book's near incomprehensible prose and able to casually cut the trees of the forest to know what lived there once, but if you're going through this the first time, just relax, chill out. The book will be there when you get back, decode the history, solve the puzzle. It's fun, if you're into it. If not, woebetide the Joyce fan who's near you!5. Read it aloud as long and as clearly as possible. Unlike many books, most books actually, including everything ever written by Joyce besides this, when read aloud, there is no wrong way to read it, or understand it. Understanding it as the half drunken slurs of the dreaming Irish mindset (vaguely resembling the fully drunken conscious slurs of my Irish uncle) is one way. It yields consistent interpretability and meaning, with all the strange stuff (the phronetic Turkish, for example) just the stammerings and the yammerings of the dream mind attempting to assemble the words. You might miss out on something. I'm probably missing out on something too. However, I'll read it. I'll understand it, to some degree. And in that I am satisfied.6. It's probably worth it to try to decode gibberish and gibberly expressions in this book in as many ways as possible.Aches-Les paines, ache the paines? The windows of a building? Ache as a name of something, the paines referencing glass, Cathedrals perhaps? Aching pains? Taking great pains? There is no concrete answer. And this is just one example, the entire book is written in this fashion...7. As historical trivia, Joyce did explain to a man how to interpet this book and understand it for what he was trying to do...That man never shared the information, and Joyce died suddenly after revealing it. Instead of some monster super-Ulysses, we get a great puzzle. An undecodeable puzzle in my opinion. You can wrestle with the Leviathian all you like if you want, frankly I can find more entertaining and worthwile literature elsewhere."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"I think what I enjoy most about it is that--like e e cummings--charles dodgson--emily dickinson--his joyceness gives us all persimmon to push the limits of our language.

In 1999 (this is 2005) I started to read the Wake, with the best of intentions, but I soon noticed a problem. A few paragraphs in, my mind would start to wander, for there was nothing solid that my mind could hang on to. I encountered no setting, no characters, no plot, no narration, nothing concrete nor conceptual. The best that I could say was that every once in a while, some group of words would be evocative of an image or memory, but even when this would happen I could not say for certain whether it was intentional on the part of the author or accident. Eventually, I started reading it aloud in order to keep myself \\"in\\" the book but, no help. Today, I am 100 pages in; I can't really bear to read more than a page at a time, and even this is an effort. I get as close to 'zero' from reading it as I can imagine.Now, please understand that I am not a stupid man, nor unaccustomed to difficult literature. I've a college degree and, in fact, currently teach 10th grade English. I've read (and understood), among other things, Shakespeare, The Bible, War and Peace, and also Ulysses. It is sometimes said that this book was written \\"for the intelligensia\\"... well... I consider myself part of the intelligensia and this book was not written for me. I am not here trying to argue that the book was written as a joke, or has no actual meaning (though I think those arguments have some merit, when one considers the work) but that a person who picks this up and starts running their eyes over any given page will not be engaging in the same activity as they would when reading a book. The Wake might be closer to some sort of giant puzzle, though I doubt this as well, but a prospective reader should ask himself whether he wants to engage in a 600 page rebus. Further, I doubt that the Wake could have been \\"written\\" in the same sense that other books are. Am I to imagine that Joyce had a firm intention in mind that guided his decisions in writing this book? That he, say, edited it? Rearranged sentences for impact? Checked for consistency? Is this book translated into other languages? How could it be? And wouldn't that assume that it had been written in some language to begin with. And, finally, if it's not written in English (and it's not), or in any other intelligble language (and it's not), then in what sense do we have a book?Is everything printed on paper literature?I think not. I do not believe that the Wake was written as a book, and I do not think it possible to read it as one, and I submit the book itself as my evidence. It has occured to me that it would be fun, someday, to take some group of people who've given the Wake 5-star reviews, and then test them. Perhaps we could give them a group of five selections, with one of them a faux-passage and four of them authentic FW-Joyce, and see if they could determine the fake? Or, we could provide them with a passage and then ask for an explanation, and them compare their explanations with one another to see if there's any validity. In fact, FW could make for a great party game along the lines of Balderdash.Yes, FW is perhaps (doubtful, though) a rebus and it could, with some imagination, provide a party game of sorts (largely revolving around mockery), but it is not a book to be read. Don't feel bad--it wasn't intended to be read. Through it all, the most interesting thing and the greatest value of the book is to watch the actions of the book's defenders. They haven't read it either, in any meaningful sense, and yet like the people in the fable they claim to see the clothing. After all, people of the highest virtue are able to see the Emperor's New Clothes, you see.

Those readers who cannot make sense of the novel should begin with &quot;Dubliners,&quot; and when they have successfully digested that, proceed chronologically through Joyce's works; to pick up Finnegans' Wake and then try and read it without having any of Joyce's nuance of style under your belt is akin to mental suicide, and, worse, will frustrate you into not reading Joyce at all. Every word, even the hundred-letter Thunderwords, Joyce placed carefully in his seventeen years writing the novel; surely, no one of them can be easily dismissed after one or two hours' cursory reading. What is more, the book requires only that someone have the barest knowledge of Language to begin with-- it is the human sense of music, that sense from which language derives all of its power to both frighten and quell, that Joyce's prose tries to capture. Little wonder that certain episodes from the book have been called &quot;The greatest prose ever written by a man.&quot;"},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"Joyce's Finnegans Wake is a masterwork of linguistic indecipherability.

But this novel is no place to start with Joyce: he made monumental leaps between Dubliners, Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Ulysses, and Finnegans Wake--to start at the end is like trying to do quantum physics without having taken an algebra course.

Rather, the offending party is that tiresome brood of sanctimonious and disgustingly pedantic clowns collectively insisting, in a manner devoid of decency and respect for the common man, that it is the greatest and most important piece ever written, that somehow the entire history of the universe is encoded within its babblings, that it is their duty to proclaim its manifold glories to the vulgar masses, and that you are but a debased philistine and a hopeless product of the MTV generation if you either don't like it or can't understand it upon your first perusal. It is they who engender such ire, and deservedly so. Ignore them. In the words of Christ, \\"Verily I say unto you, they have their reward.\\"The idea that one should sit down and read FW as one would your average novel is as absurd as they come. I say that if you are so inclined and are looking for a challenge, by all means give FW a try. Dig up for yourself a quality dictionary, preferrably of the Oxford variety, whether in print or online (many works of classic literature practically require one as a companion piece anyway), an explanatory work like Campbell's if such suits you, and dig in. Take it little by little, don't feel yourself obliged to plow through it like a steamroller, and don't be afraid to read other, lighter works along the way (this last suggestion also works for those looking to tackle Proust in its entirity, but that's another can of worms). Reading it aloud, as has been said, is highly recommended. Of course you're not going to understand it all or even most of it(those that say they do belong to that class of fools already mentioned), but with adequate preparation and time for reflection you'll surprise yourself. No, it isn't easy, but it absolutely is rewarding. FW is one dense fruitcake, and it is comforting to know that you can return to it again and again throughout your life and continue to pick out all manner of goodies.So if you like it, great! If you don't, you're in good company, as some of the sharpest literary minds of the 20th century didn't like it either. In the end, it's a matter of individual taste and whether or not you're looking for something as radically experimental and unique as this.

They're right, of course--nobody fully understands this book. That's the whole point.'Finnegans Wake' does not tell a story; it plunges the reader into it. The reader becomes the dreamer-- things are slightly out of focus, the real and the unreal mix freely, words and thoughts blur and merge together, everything has multiple connotations, and it is both beautiful and baffling. However, its not simply unstructured chaos-- there is a &quot;plotline&quot; which seeks to examine the relationships between members of a family through the dreams of H.C.E (the central character and father) and his wife. But Joyce extends the &quot;plot&quot; far beyond the specific characters, so (like 'Ulysses') 'F.W.' becomes timeless.Speaking of Ulysses, I think many people (I, in some ways, was one of them) are upset when they realize that F.W. is entirely different, because Ulysses is so amazingly beautiful and perfect. Many reviewers here ask why Joyce didn't write more of the gorgeous prose-poetry of 'Portrait...' and Ulysses. Here's why: Joyce was genius. And geniuses never hold still for very long. Ulysses proves Joyce as a literary master. F.W. proves Joyce to be a master of ideas, art, and language itself. Comparing Joyce's previous work with F.W. is like comparing apples to oranges, as his aims and motives are entirely different. 'Portrait' and 'Ulysses' are both literary masterpieces, while F.W. is simply a masterpiece (though it may perhaps fail as &quot;literature&quot; because it isn't meant to be-- that probably won't make any sense to those who have not read it). The structure, ideas, and concepts Joyce puts forth allows F.W. to transcend the medium of a book; it really belongs on its own seperate shelf at the library or in a museum.Bottom line: 'Finnegans Wake' is a work of art. Those who dismiss it because it is confusing as well as those who try to analyze the meaning of every word are missing the point. Its beauty lies in its confusion, double-meanings, and wordplay. Yes, it is difficult, but reading F.W. is an experience that no other book compares to. It is beautiful. It is chaotic. It is magnificent."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"For the uninitiated, the crowning of Joyce's mad genius is summed up best here---Hugh Hall \\"Speakcore\\" (NJ, USA) -With this lit tall reave view I rue in all love Joyce is \\"Fink Against Wake.\\" Poor Read errs, why do use still read that mess?!

This book is the bane of my existence. James Joyce must have self-inflicted mercury poisoning in order to write this. The only other plausible explanation is that he became severely mentally retarded from a lack of flow of oxygen to the brain. If you want to actually understand anything, you have to read explanations EVERY \\"sentence\\". This turns it into a f'n time vampire. It is terrible in every aspect - there are no plot, characters, situations, comedy, horror, storyline, or anything else that books usually consist of.

You've right to your opinion but...I'm reading FW for a 3rd time now, and I'm convinced it's not a novel, or poetry or even a book (although it is, in a way) but a new kind of medium. It's written vertically, like counterpoint in music. That one leaf on the last page, that the mother river is bearing on her, is the actual page you're holding; the river takes it out to the sea and to the first page. It's a spiral.

Read the first five pages -- any five pages -- and declare otherwise. I dare you. Although there are undoubtedly a handful of literary scholars who feel compelled to try to grasp everything Joyce wrote, the vast majority of those who actually venture to wade through it -- let alone those who pretend that they have done so -- are playing ego games."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"There are scholars who make their careers on Finnegans Wake. I have read many of them, hoping to understand this book. However, among the scholars, there is no agreement as to what this book is about, or even if it is about anything, or even if it is readable. To those of us who have enjoyed Joyce's other works, such as Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and The Dubliners, Finnegans Wake is a real disappointment.The book consists of 628 pages of crypticisms, foreign languages, and languages that haven't yet been invented. In those 628 pages one will struggle to find two words that actually go together to form a discernable thought. Of his works, Joyce said, &quot;Ulysees is the day; Finnegans Wake is the night.&quot; Well, I take a lot of walks at night, and even on moonless nights I can make out shapes and shadows, something that is quite impossible in The Wake.No one will ever deny that James Joyce was a brilliant writer. But, it took him 13 years to write Finnegans Wake. If he actually meant to say anything, 13 years is enough time to come up with a way to do so that actually communicates. This book actually seems like Joyce took a set of the Oxford English Dictionary, placed it atop a couple of sticks of dynamite, detonated the dynamite, and walked through the fragments, writing down whatever his failing eyesight was able to pick up. Hence, one is left with the conclusion that Joyce has succeeded in pulling off a hoax, the literary equivalent of the Sokol hoax on the high-brow journal Social Text. And this is what is so disappointing about Finnegans Wake.If you feel that you must read James Joyce (and you should), then by all means, read one of the aforementioned books. But avoid The Wake; you have better things to do with your time."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"I've tried a couple of times to read this book, and honestly, I never got past the first page. I think it's the biggest hoax ever perpetrated on a gullible literary world, and if James Joyce was sane (as I seriously doubt) then he must have had a huge laugh at its expense. However, I think he must've been totally nuts to write such garbed nonsense.I read the glowing reviews by other readers praising Joyce's &quot;genius&quot; and begin to doubt my own sanity. Is it possible I just can't read as well as I've always thought I can?However, I truly think they're just afraid to express their real opinion, after so many have called this thing a work of genius."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"Finnegan's Wake is a beautiful, profound work. It succeeds as an interpretation of the dream of everyman (history). The reader becomes an active part of the novel because, even if two or three meanings escape notice, the meanings that have relevance to one's own life stand out and are easily interpreble as having signifigance to the entire work. Secondary sources are unnecessary. Understanding the entire work is not the point of reading the Wake- the book is meant to help one understand one's role in history, but not to allow a holistic vision of history itself.As an expression of the state of sleep from the sleeper's perspective, Finnegan's Wake is intentionally garbled and thrown together as a rubbish heap of information from the dreamer's life. Because the sleeper is meant to represent Everyman, however, the dreams and thoughts of this particular night are applicable to everyone's life in some way or another. As in Ulysses,although to a greater extent, the words are often obtuse while the scenes depicted are commonplace. This gives an air of mystery and insolubility to everyday life. You may say that this is disingenuous pompous posturing- but I would respond that life in itself is a great mystery and that I am sorry you think you have it figured out.The language is decipherable, but don't read the book just to decipher the words. As with any novel, the innate joy in reading it is just that- reading it. Take what you find therein- if you do, upon reading it again, you will find more. The humor and power of the work shows itself again and again if you allow it to do so, and the many meanings and perspectives of Joyce's universalism are often subconciously understood and not realized as such until later thought.I highly recommend this book to anyone with a great amount of time on their hands. \\"Phall if you but will, rise you must.\\" Dive in; Finnegan's Wake does not disappoint."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"A test of patience?

Some words can be made out, of course, even if his sentences construction purposely shuns any discernable semblance of the rules of English. Deciphering each lines meaning would surely risk your sanity (and take a lifetime). My advice: just enjoy the ride. It's okay to do this. This is not a conventional novel and it does not have to be read conventionally. Really, it's okay. One necessity when reading this book is reading aloud in your head. Your brain may see \\"huh?\\" But when it's spoken you go \\"oh.\\" I couldn't really decipher any fine plot points. There was like, a letter... Finnegan and a wake was mentioned multiple times... Yeah... I heed my own advice.Thus marks Joyce's penultimate achievement; a unique hodgepodge of hitherto unmatched literary artistry, and a brave absence of linearity and all convention of plot.

It had a different feel to it that way.Boring, gratuitous Finnegans Wake story follows:I had heard about this book for years, ever since high school, and one day, while in college, I went to the library and took out a copy. I started reading it and thought, \\"What the . . . . \\"Actually I realized I was reading Anthony Burgess's short version, so I went back and took out the real thing. I showed it to my friends who were likewise all bewildered.So next I marched into my 20th Century Literature professor's office and asked him what was up with this book. He actually began laughing at me. When that was over he told me I shouldn't simply start reading Finnegans Wake, I should begin with Dubliners and then move on to Portrait. Then I could try Ulysses. If I made it that far I could proceed to Finnegans Wake.At that time I had just read The Promise by Chaim Potok and was impressed with the way those Jewish kids studied the Talmud with various guides and commentaries opened side by side - so that is the way I approached Joyce - like a young Talmud scholar. (But on my own - never in the context of a class or seminar, unfortunately)I found Burgess's ReJoyce very helpful, and of course there are a million Ulysses and Finnegans Wake guides available.Eight years later (punctuated by six years of podiatry school and residency) I had finally finished all four and honestly have no idea what I was reading as far as Finnegans Wake was concerned; but I appreciated the style, the rhythm of it, and the overall experience."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"This book is not really readable, straight through anyway. But I own a copy and I flip through now and then. I treat it like a long poem, and then, it can be cool. The language sounds good and you can get sucked into it and there is something of a plot I suppose. I personally think the book is a blend of Eden and Babylon; confusion and also paradise, and Joyce was probably bored. This book is more of him being a linguist than a novelist. I recommend the companion by Burgess called Re-Joyce and would say, you may not want to buy this, just get it from the library. But you would have to buy it to play my fun game with guest: What Are You Reading. Here is how you play- whenever someone says wow you have a lot of books, so what are you reading now, I say Finnegan's Wake and hand them the book. Read a page I say and then walk out of the room. When I come back their face is priceless and really, the conversation could go in any direction. Now that's worth paying $8 to have the book laying around."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"The thing that makes Joyce so difficult is his tendency to write stream of consciousness, with an emphasis on the here and now. But you figured that out.In Ulysses, the narrative is more or less linear in time. Not necessarily so in FW, or not obviously so. Where Ulysses' narrative involved a sort of mumbling about what to prepare for breakfast, a running commentary of the act of doing so, and then fleeting thoughts of friends, family, and events from the past.FW? Well there are definite sections to the book where the mood and the activity level changes. I'm told this indicates the various stages of sleep, and the physiologic changes during sleep.That being said, the rest of the book is less of a narrative and more successive word plays, tangents, I understood only a fraction of his references in English to literature and history. I understood very little of the foreign language bits - and there are many bits from many languages. You'd pretty much have to be an ethnographer to get any of it, I believe. It not Reader's Digest, that is for certain.But I still believe it's worth reading in a odd out of control sort of way.Who the hell is HCE?I plan to obtain Joseph Campbell's \\"A Skeleton Key to Finnegan's Wake\\" and use it as a study guide next time.

Well, the important thing about this book is that Joyce sat down and actually did it. Art moves forward by a few souls cutting down what lie in front of them, and plant something new. Then others come, and hybrid that with the past, and so on. This work is important because he could down everything in front, and replaced it with something so different, hybrids are impossible. So what if its pure gibberish? In madness there is always an essence of genius, and in this madness, the stench of genius permiates throughout. i say that we can scorn it all we want, but if we do, it should be with a grain in awe in that someone had the audacity to go out, and hurl this challenge back at us."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"This book is full of made-up language, words as long as your arm and an almost incomprehensible grammatical structure.

For me, it is too difficult to understand--like the ravings of a lunatic. If it has a message, I don't see it, and no-one whose review I have read of this book has ever convinced me that they have understood it any better.It's apparently a grand book for the literary elite to parade in front of the rest of us while puffing out their chests and patting each other on the back, boosting their own conceit. I think it a massive prank by Joyce. One which has taken many in and will no doubt continue to do so for time immemorial. To listen to people state how fabulous this book is and how monumental it is for them and then have nothing whatever to tell about what they actually got from it is nauseating. I think Joyce must be chuckling in his grave at these literary lightweights pronouncing this prankish experimental book a perennial classic."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"Before continuing this review I would first like to make it clear that I have only read parts of 'Finnegan's Wake.' Not the entire thing. I personally don't think it's necessary to read all of 'Finnegan's Wake' to truly enjoy it -- it is, for the lover of nonsense, explosive creativity, and utter literary chaos, a delight. I loved what I read of it and intend to continue sifting through it's many linguistic treasures. Who knows, maybe I'll finish it one day.'Finnegan's Wake' was an experiment. The result of an idea James Joyce wanted to flip around. I'm sure all you writers out there understand the concept -- Joyce was trying out a new form of the art. Whether or not he succeeded is totally up to the reader. Fan of the nonsensical? Sick of technical, murky prose? Give 'Finnegan's Wake' a try. To those people (myself included), Joyce's book is an absolute joy; a hilarious, thought-provoking joyride through the English language.However, there is the other side of the argument, a side not entirely without merit. 'Finnegan's Wake' makes no sense. Literally. It is not supposed to. It represents the intricacies of Joyce's complex mind. There are those that scorn that type of literature, calling it pointless and difficult, lacking depth and meaning. To them, 'Finnegan's Wake' is a failed experiment. Perhaps you are one of them -- if so, read the lovely section Amazon has open and decide whether or not you REALLY want to spend your money on this book.What's truly wonderful about 'Finnegan's Wake' is that it's ambivalent. It is the embodiment of ridiculous (sometimes frustrating) linguistic puns, yet also hints at a deeper meaning. Perhaps that in and of itself was Joyce's experiment, to create tension between the rational and the irrational, and he's poking fun at us 'artsy intellectuals' as we argue over this oddity in traditional canon.One last note: to anybody that enjoyed 'Finnegan's Wake', I would highly recommend John Lennon's book 'In His Own Write' (yes, John Lennon wrote other material besides songs). It is a similar mish-mash of twisted words, running together in a very James Joyce-esque manner. Sometimes the similarities are eerie.

Let me explain with this example: If you don't speak French and you pick up a book written in French you will probably recognize some of the words and even understand a few sentences based on knowledge you might have of basic French and because of the similarity of many French words to English words (or whatever language(s) you know). But you won't be able to completely understand the book unless you sit down and translate it. It would be stupid to proclaim that the book is a failure just because you don't understand the language. In the same way, you might appreciate the beauty of the French language and think the book sounds pretty even if you can't understand it, but this is no reason to claim that the book is a masterpiece.We might as well consider Finnegan's Wake as a book written in a different language that we aren't fluent in. A book (or any work of art, for that matter) isn't bad just because you have to work to understand it. That may make it frustrating but it doesn't make it bad. So, if you don't think it's worth the time and effort to use reading guides or whatever to make sense of this book, then you should just leave it alone instead of going around acting like anything you have to say about the book has any merit whatsoever.On another note, it's completely absurd to review this book just as you would a book by Stephen King - based on how entertaining the storyline was or how realistic certain characters were - simply because this is not what the book is aiming for in the first place. This would be like judging the Mona Lisa as a piece of crap because you're a big fan of cave drawings showing a chain of events and you didn't see what the chain of events was in Mona Lisa.

And obviously it doesn't. Apparently, Joyce -nearly blind at the time- he wrote FW wrote out a lot of the text &amp; had it typed up. Apparently, fairly often the typist couldn't read Joyce's handwriting, so she would guess what the word was. Joyce is reported to have been amused by these errors &amp; let them stand. Also, Beckett took dictation for a lot of FW: enough said...I don't think Joyce was interested in referential sense. And I agree that FW works more like Modern art than a regular book. In his mixing up words at the morphological level, he exploits the gap between signification &amp; meaning to such an extent that meaning is so exact that it abstracted -kind of like Andy Warhol's car crash pictures? A text definately more than a &quot;book&quot; FW is in my opinion one of the original self-referential ones &amp; for that a lot cooler than most texts. I like to read it for the sounds of the language &amp; I like criticism on it becuase that actually makes sense. An annotated book like the one for Ulysses would be awesome!"},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"This book is a drug. This book is a weapon. I'm almost surprised it's legal. But then a friend of mine tells me that people can get away with a lot more in books than they can in other mediums, because so few people read these days. Buy this book. Pick any page. Make sure it is daytime; reading late at night may cause insomnia. You do not have to finish or understand this book to enjoy it. It's like Joyce took all of human energy and made it into one huge handy random reference tome. Incredible. A sure cure for depression. When I discovered it I almost immediately felt like going out on the street and reading ramdom parts to random people."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"The question of the Wake is rightly espoused by Harold Bloom, who wonders, and then affirms: \\"Can one live the whole of literary history in a night's sleep? Finnegan's Wake says yes and asserts that all of human history can pass through one in a long, discontinuous dream.\\" The long-accepted and necessary route a writer must take toward greatness is to read for influence, to read as much as possible, and then twist all of that into one monstrosity of singular talent, and by doing so, to create your own voice. James Joyce took this further than any other writer in the history of the world, and in the end, because no one else (as the novel and the legacy of literature dies) will ever approach what he accomplished in Finnegan's Wake, he is the only writer who shall ever have the credit of having absorbed all of literary history, turned, and exploded all of it onto a page.The criticism of the Wake universally stems from incomprehension, and I allow, the work is certainly incomprehensible. What the nu-Critics cannot understand, however, is that literature does not have to be clear. Are any of you crazy enough to truly believe Joyce wrote the Wake to have it read in the same manner as Stephen King's \\"The Stand\\"? This is a work of literature, not of entertainment. The reason that fact fails before this generation is because literature is dying at the hands of those whose worth to humanity is far lesser than that which it is destroying.The movement misnamed \\"multiculturalism,\\" which is altogether anti-intellectual and anti-literary, is removing from the curriculum most works that present imaginative and cognitive difficulties, which means most of the canonical books. Finnegans Wake, Joyce's masterpiece, presents so many initial difficulties that one has to be anxious about its survival. I suspect that it will find company in Spenser's great poetic romance, The Faerie Queene, and that both works will be read, for the rest of time, by only a small band of enthusiastic specialists. This is a sadness, that we are moving toward a time when Faulkner and Conrad may have to endure the same fate. One of my closest friends defended her university's decision to drop Hemingway from the required course in favor of a rather inadequate Chicano short-story writer, by telling me that her students would thus be better prepared to live in the United States. This is why literature will die.I can hardly explain all the reasons why Finnegans wake is a masterpiece, a work so singular in nature that it belongs alongside Shakespeare, Dante, Milton, and Tolstoy. That argument would far exceed word requirements posited by Amazon,com, for the work is indeed that deep. It is not a book for high school students, or even for college students, and we will never again live in a society where it might be the choice of a casual reader. Joyce's masterpiece is to literature what Heidegger's \\"Being and Time\\" is to philosophy: utterly blinding to anyone who has not had a long and studied history with their respective subjects. But for those who give it a genuine try, I can recommend only one piece of advice: read it aloud. The words so many claim Joyce makes up in the Wake are not made up, but purposefully misspelled. If you read it aloud, you will realize what he means to say.Finnegans Wake is the ocean of literature. It is everything that has come before, and because of our culture, will likely be more than what will ever be said after. I leave you with the monologue of of the dying Anna Livia of Finnegans Wake--mother, wife, and river--which is frequently and rightly esteemed by critics as the most beautiful passage in all of Joyce.\\"But I'm loothing them that's here and all I lothe. Loonely in me loneness. For all their faults. I am passing out. O bitter ending! I'll slip away before they're up. They'll never see. Nor know. Nor miss me. And it's old and old it's sad and old it's sad and weary I go back to you, my cold father, my cold mad father, my cold mad feary father, till the near sight of the mere size of him, the moyles and moyles of it, moananoaning, makes me seasilt and saltsick and I rush, my only, into your arms.\\"Going on fifty-eight he wrote this final fiction, and was dead two years later. We will likely never see another like him, and given our current trends, likely never take the time to study him as we have studied authors before, to recognize his greatness. His memory will die. Look at this book's rating on Amazon. Three and a half stars? This novel took sixteen years of Joyce's life to complete, and people have the audacity to believe he intentionally made it difficult to play a joke on those he left behind? Finnegans Wake is a masterpiece worthy of a thousand stars, and soon none will see it. The words of Anna ring true, as if they come from Joyce's own mouth: \\"I'll slip away before they're up. They'll never see. Nor know. Nor miss me.\\"It is a genuine shame."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"This version of \\"Finnegans Wake\\" is the uncorrected version. Joyce spent the final years of his life correcting \\"Finnegans Wake\\", and this book omits all of those corrections. While this may not pain the casual reader of the wake, it does cast a vale around Joyce's maddening masterwork."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"I didn't expect to like this book at all. I certainly didn't expect to fall in love with it but that is exactly what happened! I love this book! It is really funny and readable, in fact it's a page turner!

I like it better than any other Joyce."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"Without a doubt this is the most fun I've ever had \\"reading\\" a book. I frequently had to put the book down to wipe my eyes and blow my nose from the tears of laughter. After just a few pages I started taking notes so I could go back to especially humorous passages and read them to friends. Forget all the garbage about how difficult the book is and how it will require all sorts of study and research to appreciate the deep meaning and language. Nonsense. There is no meaning and there is no language. The book is a continuous series of some of the funniest writing ever commited to paper. I suppose the reader gets from the book what they already have in their own mind and from the things I got from this book . . . I undoubtedly have a very dirty mind. Joyce frequently comes up with \\"sentences\\" that strike me as undoubtedly and hilariously obscene (in the best possible way). Honestly, this reads like a series of those filthy limericks that make you marvel at what sort of demented and nasty mind could have conceived them. For me, this is quite simply one of the dirtiest books I've ever read and certainly the most fun. I'm not even sure that \\"reading\\" is what you do with FINNEGANS WAKE. I confess I have no idea what it was about and couldn't care less (because I'm fairly certain the only person who knew what any of this meant was Joyce himself). It dosen't matter. This book is hilarious and not at all difficult to read if you immediately give up the idea that you need to understand it or even be able to pronounce it. Folks, there isn't anything to understand here. Just delight in what the book does to your head because (make no mistake) this book WILL do something to you as you \\"read\\" it that is somewhat like a strange and euphoric form of hypnosis. It is a work of absolute genious and a true one of a kind. It's the only book I can think of that contained characters who purchased wallpaper to match the cat. This is a book for EVERYONE to enjoy, not just stuffy academic \\"Joyceans\\" and those of the professorial ilk, in fact this is really a book for people who don't even like to read. I can't think of any other book that I would give a more enthusiastic endorsement of than FINNEGANS WAKE. If you are a fan of DUBLINERS, PORTRAIT and ULYSSES but have avoided reading this one because of its reputation as being impenetrable, then please dive into it with joy. It's a lot more fun than ULYSSES (though undoubtedly ULYSSES is the greater work as a \\"novel\\") and you will never have to work at trying to keep up with the plot (a sometimes difficult task with ULYSSES). READ IT READ IT READ IT. You will never be sorry you did (unless you have no sense of humor) as it is the greatest literary joke book ever penned and will almost certainly never be bested. You will enjoy it even more if you have (as I apparently do) a very dirty sense of humor. Don't let the length worry you either. It took me two weeks to read it and it was never a chore. I can't imagine what the people who say it took them years to finish were actually doing with this book. They were either more capable of wringing amusing perversions from it than I was or were more likely (sadly) trying to understand it. Don't try to \\"get it\\" just read it and you WILL get it."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"I think the time has come for Finnegans Wake fans to stop having to constantly justify their passion for this book and share our favourite aspects of this inimitable work.What often gets missed among all the discussions about the book is just how funny it is. There are few books that have had me crying with laughter - this is certainly one of them.Joyce's inventive use of language allows him to create a world like no other - few more enjoyable reads can ever be had."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"Reading James Joyce's \\"Finnegans Wake\\" (first published in 1939) is like reading a long really long surrealist poem. I got started by printing a 30-page article from Wikipedia and using it as my guide while I read book from book, chapter to chapter. Even the title is a mystery. There is, of course, no apostrophe between the \\"n\\" and the \\"s\\", so this is not a question of possession. It's been suggested that the title is actually a corruption of the phrase \\"Finn is again awake\\", Finn being the father of the gods in Irish mythology, like Odin in Norse mythology. But near the end of the book Joyce actually uses the phrase Finnegan's Wake, complete with apostrophe. The novel itself seems to be an interpretation of the symbolic death and resurrection of Finn or Finnegan in the person of Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker, whose name at times changes to Porter (Earwicker is the keeper of a pub), a mysterious sin he may have committed, and how it affects his wife Anna Livia Plurabelle and their three strange children, all this in very obscure poetic prose. Many scholars such as Edmund Wilson and Joseph Campbell have devised a plot out of all this abstract poetry, but I have to admit that finding a conventional plot in Joyce's \\"Finnegans Wake\\" is like finding a representational landscape in Pollock's \\"Enchanted Forest\\". It's significant that the scholars disagree on which chapters mean what. (I also have to admit that I have not read \\"A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake\\", which is evidently considered indispensable.){Note: Since writing these comments I have read \\"A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake\\". Yes, it is erudite and enlightening, but readers should be aware that this key is almost as complex as the novel itself.} By the way, I would have sworn that no one would possible attempt a translation of \\"Finnegans Wake\\" (that way lies madness!), but evidently there have been translations -- one in Japanese, no less. There is also a reading of the complete text on 17 CDs by an Irish philosopher Patrick Healy; but, you know, I really doubt if it's on Amazon.com's bestseller list. The reader must work his way through a thicket of puns (Book I Chapter 8 is a catalogue of the world's rivers and at one point an impatient gossip cries: \\"I amstell waiting. Garonne, garonne!\\") and obscure historical references (Earwicker's name may derive from a British politician Hugh Childers whose girth gave him the sobriquet Here Comes Everybody) as well as deal with mythological and Biblical comparisons. Scholars seem to agree that the novel was inspired by an 18th Century Italian work \\"La Scienza Nuova\\" by Giovanni Battista Vico, but a more familiar Italian book could also be mentioned, Dante's \\"The Divine Comedy\\", because Joyce's \\"night novel\\" ends with the revelation of dawn. Will a reader really be able to work his way through its nearly 600 pages? I think if you approach the book as fun (after all, it's considered a comic masterpiece) rather than as a chore, you'll find that its light wittiness outweighs any heavy expectations you may have had."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"Far and away the best thing about this book is the quality of the analysis it has spawned. The book itself is drivel; but the reactions to it form some of the most intelligent and enlightened reviews I have encountered. I have never sprinkled as many \\"helpful\\" votes within a single site as I have here, to both one-star and five-star appraisals alike.Firstly, the book itself. I cannot subscribe to any of the academic apologias. This book took an interesting concept and stretched it well past the point of absurdity. Like the surrealist movement that ultimately ended up justifying paintings of Campbell's Soup cans, \\"Finnegan's Wake\\" takes stream-of-subconsciousness to such idiotic lengths that it becomes self-parody.Yes, I have exhaustively analysed the book. I studied it many years ago under the tutelage of an infectiously enthusiastic English professor who dissected its every nuance. Puns, portmanteau constructs, auditory versus literary jabberwocky, dream-state evocation: we analysed all of these elements and more. And for a time, during my \\"intellectual\\" period, I pretended to admire it. Nowadays, age and--I like to think--wisdom compels honesty: this book is a self-indulgent conceit. Had anyone other than Joyce written it, it would never have been published, much less garnered all the notoriety it has enjoyed over the years.The real value in \\"Finnegan's Wake\\" has been in the intelligent debate that it has fostered. By stringing together chaotically connected thought fragments, Joyce created the literary equivalent of a star-field: any resulting patterns are a tribute to the richness of the readers' imaginations and not the writer's.Does Joyce's exercise constitute genius? Hardly. Artificial Intelligence research has produced numerous examples of similar jabberwocky constructs, some practically indistinguishable from \\"Finnegan's Wake\\". So what we have here is a sampling of the peculiarly human ability to impose order upon chaos. Some of these five-star reviews are testaments not to the meaningless jumble that is \\"Finnegan's Wake\\", but to the creative ingenuity of their authors and to the larger genius of the human imagination.Joyce was not a prolific author, but what he did produce was some of the best writing ever conceived. \\"Portrait\\", \\"Ulysses\\", \\"Dubliners\\": each is a star in the literary firmament. It is natural to try finding a place for his last work in the same firmament, but \\"Finnegan's Wake\\" doesn't deserve such elevation. This novel was the product of a genius who in the end became so narcissistic and self-absorbed that he dared to pen a scatter-brained homage to his own ego. Would we dismiss this work as vapid nonsense by any other author, it would be dishonest to do otherwise just because that author's name is James Joyce."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"I just finished reading FW last night after almost six weeks of thorough plowing-ahead through it. I don't know where to begin in my review of it. I would start by summing it up in the word amazing. This book reinvents language. All through school, we're taught grammar, spelling, punctuation, the format for writing essays, letters, etc., but Joyce rejects that education, says the hell with it and does his own thing. What interpretation of a word is right? Is there a correct interpretation to be conceived? Is there any possible way to wrestle the magnitude of this book to the ground and pin it down to really understand what's going on?? Who knows. Joyce has the reader in the palm of his hand, and it's frightening what FW can do to one's mind. I'm sure that now everything else I read will make me think of Joyce in one way or another. I probably don't know 2% of the amount of foreign languages, literary, geographical, historical and mythological allusions and references which are crammed into the book, but the parts that I CAN decipher are very clever. It's not an interesting &quot;story&quot;, but it's captivating simply because it's such an enigma of a book.There is not so much a story here as there is a SERIES of stories or vignettes parodying various myths, historical events, etc. But several patterns occur and reoccur. Variations of the initials H C E and A L P (What does Joyce achieve with FW? Why, He Confuses Everyone! All Living Persons!), rearrangements of the name of Finn MacCool, the mythological Irish hero, and the predominant Vicoian theme of history repeating itself. H C E is born and reborn as Adam, as Humpty Dumpty, as Finn MacCool himself.. ad infinitum. Joyce deliberately left the whole thing open-ended so that every word can be interpreted in any way, depending on the individual readers personal knowledge. The more you learn, the more meanings will apply themselves to FW. Tip.And those of you who call this book a piece of garbage have to admit one thing- at least it's original and unique. There's no other book quite like it. Joyce didn't write for other people to understand him. He didn't write to appeal to the literary elite. Joyce wrote for Joyce, and if the reader can be in on the joke, it can produce great results. If you don't get it and call it a pretentious collection of random phrases, then darn it, it's your loss. And don't criticize people for saying they like it. And no, I'm NOT &quot;pretending&quot; to like it- I LIKE IT! Certainly it has some dull spots, but it's 90% great!It Awnly tuck me sicksweex to reed the hole booke, anned I enjoid it vary moch. Tip. To you extramely pretentious revousers who say that knowbody has ever red it all the weigh thru (whaat maycs you so dammed shore of it in the fursed plays?!), then increase the number of people of all time who have read it all the way through from &quot;zero&quot; to ONE. That one being me. Not only did I read every last word, but I ENJOYED it, and very much so. So stack that in yore piep und smoe kit!On to bigger and better(?) things! I'm starting Ulysses tonight!"},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"I've read all of Joyce's novels and short stories and have taken graduate courses featuring hours of seminar and discussion, so don't consider myself unqualified to cast an opinion. I must say though, that Joyce was having a bit of fun with his readers here. This is his endgame in which he outmaneuvers all other authors. Remember this is the same writer who prophesied, shortly after its publication by Shakespeare &amp; Co. that Ulysses would keep the academics guessing for 100 years (it will have them arguing a lot longer than that I'll wager).Well take Ulysses and multiply it to the tenth power and you will have some perspective of this Tower of Babel of a novel. Joyce wants to take you higher and higher up the tower steps until you become so disoriented you have no longer have any clue what speech or language signify (which is the primary reason it is one of the deconstructionists holy texts).If you will recall, Ulysses begins in a tower as well. Only here, the higher he takes you, the more you are overcome by vertigo as you peer down at the vestiges of culture and what you supposed was community below.Anyone who has seriously studied Joyce and has read his biographers (Edelman is my favorite, but Leon Edel also provides some sharp insights) is aware that few authors had a more colossal Ego than JJ. This work is the author's ego as edifice. Take the climb if you so desire. He will definitely not lead you by the hand, and the only thing you will see and hear when you get to the top are provided by your own inadequate sensory apparati. You might just get a whiff of your own sweat and mortality as well. If your eyes can still focus, you might also see JJ, bent over, laughing at you for having made the trip. I know, I thought he was a one-eyed SOB at that point too."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"Im a first time reader of Finnegans Wake (a simple title you can interpret in at least four different ways). Along with FW Im reading Campbell's book &quot;A Skeleton Key to FW&quot; and while its not the optimal resource to totally understand Joyce's masterpiece, its been a big help so far. I recommend. There are too many levels to discuss here, so here's my advice- do not read FW if you want a quick read. Read it if you enjoy wordplay, like in ee cummings' poetry, or allegory, like in Dante's. Read it if you like comedy- many fail to mention FW is FUNNY. Read it if you like a mental challenge. Read it if you are Irish. Read it if you are not Irish. After FW you will chuck your TV out the window and never look back. Read it if you are sick of John Grisham and Stephen King and Oprah's Wet Noodle Book Club for The Grammatically Harmless."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"The last work of his that Joyce ever saw published--the work he labored on for 17 years--is Finnegans Wake and easily one of the oddest books ever. Some people do get hostile towards the book, because it IS odd, but you have to appreciate Joyce's OTHER works the way I do to even want to read it. I can honestly say I don't get all of it--no one ever will. I don't think it's a book intended to be read just once.The one problem is that Joyce maybe got a tad out of hand. Okay, it was the book he probably wanted to be remembered for (although &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot; and maybe &quot;Ulysses&quot; are more accessible and therefore get more readers today), but I think maybe he was showing off a bit. Not that he didn't have the right to.The first time I read a work by Joyce I figured I was going to hate him. When I hate an author, I really hate one. But somehow Joyce grew on me. That was pretty strange. And although I haven't read most of Joyce's stuff, I like to get in over my head--hence, reading Finnegans Wake.This is not a beginner's book, that's for sure. If you've heard of Joyce and want to explore his works, start with &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot;, because that is a classic all its own and also much easier to follow. Actually, I'd build even more than that before Finnegans Wake, but that's up to you.In all, I strongly suggest Finnegans Wake for people who like interesting literature."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"OK, first of all, I can't help but notice that in many of the negative reviews of Finnegans Wake the reviewer admitted to &quot;not getting past the first page&quot; or some such thing. I think that anybody trying to read this book needs to realize that it's not nearly as difficult as it seems on first impression. You need to approach it with an open mind, though. Don't expect it to follow any familiar rules, and don't feel lost when it doesn't. People who couldn't get past the first few pages probably let their biases of what a novel &quot;should be&quot; interfere with their enjoyment of the book.Example: I just started reading FW for the first time, and I'm about halfway through it. So far I've enjoyed it thoroughly. I'm also a 17 year old senior in high school. I don't have the background to understand many of Joyce's allusions, I only speak two (English and Spanish) of the sixty languages he uses. But I still understand enough to know that I like what I'm reading. And even when I don't understand, it doesn't matter - simply the sound of the language is enjoyable. &quot;As we there are where are we are we there from tomtittot to teetootomtotalitarian. Tea tea too oo.&quot; What the hell does that mean? Who knows! But it doesn't matter, it rocks!The point is that with an open mind and occasional extra research, I've gotten something out of Finnegans Wake. I know I haven't even scratched the surface, but it just goes to show that as inaccessible as this book may seem, there is something in it for everyone."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"The last and most bizarre of Joyce's works, Finnegans Wake is considered by many to be the ultimate in inaccessible literature. I've read the book in its entirety, and admittedly, I don't know what it's supposed to &quot;mean&quot;. In spite of all the critical commentary that's been published on it in the last 60 years, it's likely that no one knows what Joyce was really getting at. The book is written in a language of humorous puns and exotic coinages which tends to obscure what little &quot;plot&quot; there is. Several central personalities keep resurfacing: HCE, the father; ALP, the long-suffering mother; Shem and Shaun, the brothers who are polar opposites; and Issy, the daughter. These &quot;characters&quot; are shown in various situations: playing games, getting drunk, doing schoolwork, etc. Sometimes they are identified with personages from legends or history: Tristan and Isolde, Adam and Eve, and so on. Some readers have interpreted the book as being Joyce's autobiography, or as a kind of heretical Bible (given the author's antipathy to Irish Catholicism). Needless to say, this is not the sort of book that most people will want as a little light summer reading. But it rewards the diligent reader who is willing to enjoy and puzzle over the linguistic experiments that Joyce set up."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"This book was obviously written by a man with a patch over his eye. You see, it's a book comprised solely of footnotes to footnotes. The great thing about it is you don't really have to read it to have an opinion about it! I've read far more words about the book than I've read in the book! My girlfriend worked in the Fredonia (SUNY) Library where they had 30 feet worth of shelf space for the James Joyce Quarterly. More amazing than the book itself is the serious time and effort others have dedicated to it. I'd spend hours reading 10,000 word essays on a new interpretation of the meaning of a three word sentence in the Wake! A former girlfriend once said he wrote it to make scholars talk baby talk for 1,000 years...another friend joked that, to receive his BA at Utica College, he was going to write THE DEFINITIVE ESSAY on Finnegans Wake. Of course this can't be done. Approach the book the way you would a dream, with suspended disbelief. You know how in a dream nothing is questioned, no matter how surreal? (I have a friend who dreams 'ordinary' dreams, which seems odd to me.) - Read the book aloud, and with an Irish accent. Don't strain to &quot;get&quot; what it is you're reading (think in terms of Jazz/John Coltrane/sheetsofmusic), and Most importantly have a bellyfull of beer. The best time to read it is for an audience at an afterhours party (4AM) when everyone is pretty zonked out and there are a few people there whom you've never met before and will in all likelyhood never meet again. Open the book randomly and read aloud for a page or two (if possible), then continue with the party as if you've done nothing out of the ordinary. (Interestingly, the usual reaction to this is complete indifference, as if it never happened!- but I suspect years later it'll occure to them that something odd happened for a moment during those parties. A delayed response? Or was it just a dream? How much can you trust your memory?)...Finally, a reviewer somewhere below got it right when he said Joyce shows promise. Indeed, He shows the promise of a man who was once attacked by a dog on the beaches of Holland (circa. 1926)- :) &lt;----primative symbols in a postmodern age!+media overload =Finnegans Wake...XOXOXO"},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"I admit that I am not qualified to \\"judge\\" FW. Not because I am stupid, as many 5-star reviewers would assert, I think. I would consider giving up on THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO \\"stupid.\\" I cannot judge FW as literature because literature is meant to be read, and comprehended. It is not complexity, depth, or any of the like that make this book incomprehensible to me. It is written in its own language. It is its own realm. To judge it would be like judging the writing of an alien civilization. And that is why I gave FW 1 star: it is nonscoreable.This book--FW--seems to be Joyce's joke, or private world, or both. I doubt that any one who claims to love this book has \\"got it\\" in the sense that Joyce meant it to be understood, either. If one has the perserverance, one will find one's own meaning/pattern in FW, if only because it is human nature to impose order on chaos and...gibberish.FW is certainly fascinating for its complexity of word games. As for the poetic quality of the words? I couldn't speak for that. When a word is over 20 characters long, a mishmash of randomness, I generally stumble like an idiot over every syllable. Thus: it was not fluid. It was not poetic.Yet, for all of its puzzle-like quality, I could not call FW great literature. This is unreadable. Even if one knew all of the languages Joyce was acquainted with, it would still be, I think, unreadable. Joyce was the only one who understood it, and he is dead. I agree, the many interpretations FW has spawned are impressive; but also quite pathetic, if one considers how many scholars spent their lives trying to decipher this.If there is any definite meaning here--any statement Joyce was trying to make--then he failed in conveying it.I'd recommend that anyone who still has any doubts look up FINNEGANS WAKE online--one can find a free online copy.

Yes, this book is hard to understand and read. That's where its beauty lies. For me, it's a pleasure to read it. Although the story's wiven through the book, you can follow it hardly. But for me, the story is not what the book's about. The book is just a great series of great sounds, wordplays and everything and it is in it's form as great as any other piece of abstract art. Because that's what it is. Abstract art. We have abstract paintings (do I have to name examples?), abstract music, so why can't we have abstract literature? I think it's very interesting to read this and give your own meaning to it, as you (might) do with abstract paintings and/or music. In that way it's a great effort of James Joyce, since you can give anything your own meaning: music, paintings... except for books. Books are beautiful but at the same time there are unwritten rules for books: a storyline, grammar... I could go on for hours. James Joyce breaks with this tradition. But that's great! It has been done before in every form of art! Look at the way music evolved: from classical music all the way to grindcore. There's such a big difference between all those. Music can be simple, and difficult, and I dunno how to explain it. It's just not so rule-based as literature. And therefore, once again, we should cherish this piece of art. It's groundbreaking. Can't say anything to that."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"I actually managed to read FW cover to cover. From what I gathered, Joyce was trying to intersperse life, death and rebirth into a mythical Irish epic. With it's obscure references, jabberwocky-like sentences and chaotic theme, he has a lot of fun keeping the reader guessing. His chief talent here is playing with words, puns, and puzzles all while trying to tell an obscure tale with no obvious plot. If you enjoy a seriously challenging read and are looking for a novel like no other give this one a try."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"1"},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"How can a person use less than 1,000 words to describe a book that utilizes 65 different languages to deliver a tale of sin, betrayal and politics into a dream-like realm of reality? As Seamus Deane's introduction to the Wake states, this novel could have been written on the building sight of the Tower of Babel.What is it about? A father and his daughter uncover themselves in a Garden of Eden park setting. Their exploration is spied upon by four evangelists. Their names are Matthew Mark Luke and John.A hard novel to read? Finnegan's Wake is my brain's favorite jungle gym. Absolutely the hardest read there is, even when compared to Joyce's novel Ulysses.

I did not enjoy reading it, but it is, without a doubt, the greatest endevor literature has conceived. This is not for the weak or the weak-hearted, and even those strong enough to get through it will inevitably throw up everything that's inside of them and have to start from scratch, but it will be worth it. I feel Joyce's writing hand still throbbing with life, and I still feel the amorous tongue of Finnegans Wake deep within my throat. If I were to be exiled to the moon and could only take one thing with me, it would be Barth's &quot;The Sot-Weed Factor&quot;, but if I could take another thing, there's an outside chance it would be this book. That's how great it is."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"Above all,this book must be read ALOUD-to oneself and/or to others, in a fake Irish brogue (or a real one if you're Irish); using this method, it is amazing how formerly incomprehensible references will come to light!

USQUEBAUGH!"},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"This wonderful book rewards the effort necessary to prepare you for the experience. There's music, magic, and laughs aplenty here for the ready mind. It's a cryptic compendium of games, puzzles, riddles, and songs.But for those of you too daunted by the challenge of reading Joyce's final masterwork, there's always the consolation of complaining about your shortcomings on the internet. Please follow these rules when posting your hatchet-job reviews of Finnegans Wake, to make sure you don't deviate from the list of tired tropes churned out by every negative reviewer in the seventy years since the Wake's publication.1) Make it plain that you didn't finish the book. Describe in excruciating detail the amount of times you tried to read it, and the circumstances surrounding your decision to stop in each instance. Remember, literature is all about you.2) Be sure you call it \\"gibberish\\" or \\"drivel,\\" so that everyone realizes your humble dedication to experiencing this work of literature and your respect for the talent and hard work of its author. In order to demonstrate that you have the attention to detail necessary for the task of reading the Wake, misspell the title frequently.3) Show what an original thinker you are by considering that Joyce wrote Finnegans Wake as a colossal joke, or to punish his admirers for whatever reason. Make it seem like you are literally the first person in history to make this observation.4) Deride Joyce for having the arrogance and presumption to be more intelligent and well-read than you. Remember, it's not that you have an inferiority complex or anything. It's important that Joyce be called out as an insensitive literary snob. Every negative review of the Wake has to contain the sentence, \\"The Emperor has no clothes.\\"5) Revile Joyce's admirers as academic phonies who only claim to have read Finnegans Wake so they can lord it over everyone else. Pat yourself on the back for your maverick integrity while you're actually expressing the overwhelming majority opinion on the book. You can also credit Joyce with creating an entire edifice of pseudo-intellectual postmodern dogma that infests literary criticism to this day, but remember, this has to be done with a straight face and no subtlety whatsoever.6) For advanced haters only. Come up with an oh-so-droll Reading Challenge that will expose professed lovers of the Wake as the frauds they are. Propose, for example, that readers try to tell the difference between a passage of the Wake and the product of a random word generator. Be creative!For people with no such issues, Finnegans Wake is a challenge worth facing."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"i haven't yet finished my first read through of this book, but even now i think it's fair to say that this is an amazing piece of work. i just want to reiterate what a couple of people have said. firstly this is not literature, as such, it shares far more with music than it does with literature, and secondly, it should be read as you would listen to music, letting it wash over you, not trying to control any of it, not trying to realize what is happening. you should realize that after a while things will make sense, and even if the book never makes sense to you entirely it doesn't matter. to view this book as beautiful nonsense does no disservice to it, i think, because it is definitely the ultimate in beautiful nonsense if that's the way you want to see it.and really, if you're going to write this off as gibberish, realize the man spent 17 years of his life perfecting this book. he went blind while writing it. his daughter was put into a mental asylum and europe was in the begining throes of world war II and still he wrote this book. more work has been lovingly poured into these pages than most writers put into their entire career. if you don't like it, fine, but calling this book gibberish is doing a huge disservice to the author and only making yourself look stupid. just say you don't like it, that's all you need to say."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"When you get past all the strange words and polyglot puns, Finnegans Wake just isn't that interesting of a book. The ideas expressed are contrived and uninteresting, and many have been already been treated, better, in Ulysses. \\"But how do you get past the language?\\" is the rejoinder I'm expecting to hear. It's true that very few people understand every word in the book. However I refuse to suscribe to the school of thought that states that FW is a great book just because its hard to understand and nobody will ever \\"get\\" all of it. Some people have come pretty close- MacHugh's \\"Annotations\\" goes a long way with individual words, and Campbell's \\"Skeleton Key\\" well give you the overarching meaning (yes, there is meaning) if you read it with a critical eye. These two books pretty much have FW cracked, end of story.Now many people will also argue that one shouldn't read FW for the meanings or ideas, like other books, but rather that simply the sweet sounds of the language are enough to give it value as a literary object- essentially, even if we don't understand a word, it sounds nice. This is just silly. If you want an auditory experience listen to music or the sounds of nature. If euphonious words is your thing, read some poetry. But for heavens' sakes don't spend the time required to read 680 pages of garbled words simply because they sound cool. My point is that there are already artistic and, in my view, far more enjoyable ways to go about getting a cathartic auditory experience. FW has neither the mellifluosity of The Raven or a Spenserian sonnet, nor obviously can it provide the sonic intensity of a symphony. Books, ultimately, are read for the quality of the ideas they express, and the quality of the style used to express them.The style of FW is idiotic. It was a nice idea at the time, sure, and probably it had to be done when considering the progress of literature as a whole, but these points don't mean that the style is of any aesthetic worth. Most of the words are incomprehensible without some guide, like the \\"Annotations.\\" Because the difficulty is at the level of words, rather than ideas, one doesn't read FW, one translates it. Joyce uses foreign words (from 60 languages!) and perversions of English as the basis for the vocabulary of the text, and combines and arranges these as he pleases. Now I don't mind foreign language quotes in my books, and I'm as big of a fan of witty word-play as anyone, but when you're essentially inventing a language arbitrarily as you go along you've made a huge and pointless mistake. Why stop at the level of words? Why not write using a whole new alphabet? And the kicker is that the many of the puns are incredibly POINTLESS! A \\"bad of winds,\\" for example- \\"bad\\" is Persian for \\"wind,\\" apparently. So this means what, a \\"wind of winds\\"? Come on, this is lame! and a far cry from true wit. In another \\"celebrated\\" passage, Joyce weaves the names of a bunch of rivers into a conversation between two washerwomen. I.e., \\"kennet,\\" meaning \\"ken it\\" or \\"know it\\", and the Kennet river in England. But what's the point? That rivers are cool? That Joyce is cool because he looked up a bunch of river names? That we're cool for figuring them out? Such puerile and mechanical displays of erudition are a waste of time for everyone involved.The common response to attacks on FW's style is that Joyce was attempting to convey the nebulous and polysemous state of dreams. If so he failed miserably. I don't know about the rest of you but I don't dream in portmanteau words- when people talk I know exactly what they're saying. We may not understand why particular things happen in dreams, but at least we know, at a literal level, what is happening (eg. I may not know WHY, in a dream, I'm being chased by a herd of mustachioed ducks wielding blunderbusses, but I can at least describe it as such). FW lacks even that- because of the near-incomprehensibility of the language, it lacks a literal level to start out from.Now all of this could feasibly be tolerable- the translating, the wading through secondary sources, the silliness of a contrived \\"dream-language\\"- if the payoff was worth it- ie if Joyce was saying something really profound and insightful. If the ideas validated the words. Well, they don't. Underneath it all you just have a cliched quasi-biblical myth with aspirations to allegory. It deals with how one man is Everyman and the whole is contained within its parts and history repeats and cycles are cool and male is destructive and female is fertile. Blah blah blah. Its the world according to Joyce. If you want obsolete notions about the \\"nature of man\\" and such nonsense, read the Bible or any other religious text. If you would argue that the \\"meaning\\" isn't the point, please see paragraph two above.FW, depending on who you ask, attempts to do a lot of different things. The problem is that it fails at all of them. As music it is necessarily inadequate, as poetry it is far surpassed by real poetry, as a novel it is incomprehensible, and as a myth or an allegory it is highly derivative and essentially boring. And don't try to sell me those poststructuralist lines about \\"foregrounding language\\" or \\"de-stabilizing the signifier\\" either- you know as well as I do that FW doesn't do either of those particularly effectively, and furthermore that those are silly and pretentious concepts to begin with. I love Joyce's earlier works, but Finnegans Wake is just a monstrous waste of time and effort."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"No, Finnegan's Wake isn't written in a drab, unambiguous way, and that's a darn good thing. Unthinking directness is great for cafeteria lunch menus, but fortunately great works like FW allow us to explore ideas and language in a new way.Imagine how dull life would be if everything were always written in a way to satisfy a high school English department's style book. But I suppose some people won't be satisfied until we drop the balcony scene in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and instead Romeo just walks in and says &quot;I know our families hate one another, but I've really got the hots for you.&quot; Of course, that doesn't even begin to cover what goes on in that scene, but maybe that's because some ideas are so hard to grasp that the only way to explain them is to use obscure, incomprensible, and elusive words and phrases.

End result: no more individual life.Still others just write reviews of it here.Who's to say which are the truly sentient beings?"},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"While Joyce's Ulysses demonstrates his monstrous success with literary experimentation styles, FW does not. I find it poor by his standards. In academics (and among pseudo-intellectuals) the book is quite fashionable, and understably so - the style is unique. Its almost comical to listen to my fellow Joyce fans rave about it. But whenever I corner them, and beg them to dissect the work for me, the responses are as incoherent as the book itself. Perhaps it inspires creative thinking/translation from its readers, but nothing of the sort on my part, despite my repeated efforts to sincerely read it.I've read far worse, that's for sure, but someone thinking of dabbling with Joyce for the first time should seriously consider selecting one of his more substantial earlier works, or the frustration with FW may alienate them forever from an otherwise brilliant and often very powerful author."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"British author (and ardent admirer of Lolita) Martin Amis once drew a connection between the work of Nabokov and Joyce. He said essentially that both authors' minor novels are guilty of a fair amount of self-indulgence. To clarify, Nabokov is famous for passages such as this doozy:\\"the distant meadows opening fanwise, the near trees sweeping up on invisible swings toward the track, a parallel rail line all at once committing suicide by anastomosis, a bank of nictitating grass rising, rising, rising, until the little witness of mixed velocities was made to discharge his portion of omelette aux confitures de fraises.\\"--Speak, MemoryFinnegans Wake is also self-indulgent in its use of esoteric language, but in a different way. Its characteristic poorly-spelled utterances parody many different modes of writing, from eulogy to nursery rhyme to literary criticism:\\"Shize? I should shee! Macool, Macool, orra whyi deed ye die? of a trying thirstay mournin? Sobs they sighdid at Fillagain's chrissormisss wake, all the hoolivans of the nation, prostrated in their consternation, and their duodismally profusive plethora of ululation. There was plumbs and grumes and ccheriffs and citherers and raiders and cinemen too. And the all gained in with the shout-most shoviality. Agog and magog and the round of them agrog.

It has been blurtingly bruited by certain wisecrackers (the stinks of Mohorat are in the nightplots of the morning), that he suffered from a vile disease. Athma, unmanner them!\\"--Chapters 1 and 2E'erawhere in this whorl would you hear such a din again?!These are only the most recognizable of the plethora of parodies Joyce invokes in the mammoth text. They have meaning, no doubt. What is the meaning of the eulogy? \\"Twas he the decent gaylabouring youth!\\" shout hordes of drunk coworkers, friends and party-crashers at his \\"chrissormiss wake,\\" as his body is being lowered into a grave, most likely, sobbing sighs, crying and making a good deal of noise, as evidenced by the ample misspellings. How did he die? He fell off a ladder, like Humpty dumpty, and was put back together, \\"sunny-side up\\" (so his wake-goers could eat him??? Seems like it. They certainly want him back in his coffin, when he wakes up asking them whether they've drunk him out of house and home). How will this text be received? With Freudian speculation, and, as Joyce sees it, nonsense. The reviewer becomes a character in the novel himself, who seems to be writing sections of it himself in short mini-essays on various topics, obviously still very bizarre and dreamlike (the one on the Lord's Prayer has at least 200 different names for it, none of them real, all some sort of pun or biblical reference or HCE butt-size reference or other...(\\"Peter Peopler Picked a Plot to Pitch his Poppolin,\\" \\"For Ark see Zoo,\\" \\"An Apology for a Big...\\" etc).Truthfully, it is a book about the disintegration of language into nonsense. If there is a major flaw in the book, it is no doubt aesthetic, as the book lacks the momentum to keep the reader going: in a sort of prelude to the now-dominant trend of hysterical realism, in which we are told \\"how the world works rather than how somebody felt about something,\\" as James Wood puts it, we are told how the anarchy of the innermost crannies of the [dead?] mind can be rendered onto paper, rather than anything actually engaging enough to want to read. Beckett covered the same subject in his Trilogy of Molloy, Malone Dies, and the Unnameable, but in my view, did a much better job of it, creating a disturbing and utterly desolate body, but one of extreme, bleak, beauty. So did Kubrick in 2001. Like Wood, I can't emphasize enough that what makes a novels (or frankly any work of art) great is the intense emotion and wonder it stirs deep within you. That's what is missing, and that is why Finnegans Wake is simply not worth reading, at least not in the way you would read any other novel. Perhaps take it off the shelf every now and again, just for a laugh, but that's probably all you'll get."},{"Title":"Finnegans Wake","review":"(You started reading Finnegans Wake at age 13?

As difficult and obscure as they were at times, they all had some relative merits. I eventually even found some of them enjoyable on 2nd or 3rd readings (Proust was even enjoyable on the first).This book, on the other hand, is devoid of anything approaching meaning on any level but the most reductionist as an occassional examination of words at play. It's a series of puns and obscurantist references without anything approaching a story or structure or even internal coherency. Of course, what could just as easily be the warblings of a paranoid schizphrenic has been inexplicably hailed by some academics as a masterwork. This is not a masterful examination of language. It's more like the musings of a 6 year old struggling with it who has a taste for bad puns and a serious case of apophenia.If you have finished Joyce other works (which are mostly excellent btw) pick up some Dostoevsky or Proust, Borges, Chesterton, or Calvino.

He spent 17 years on this book because he knew people would spend (waste?) hours, days, years of their lives trying to get to the &quot;truth&quot; of FINNEGAN'S WAKE, and feel superior to the great unwashed who don't even know such a work of literature exists.

To know this book, learn to sleep. GO to bed when the sun goes down. Turn off the Television and the ipod when you sleep and maybe after 25 years you might get to realize this as well.If you must follow some traditional narrative thread, get the Skeleton Key to Finnegan's Wake and you will get some idea as to what is going on, but miss three quarters of the fun. It'd be like reading the script of Star Wars to see what happened in that movie (only Finnegans is a much better script). Joseph Campbell has done us literal literate readers, who have learned to see no more than what is in front of our eyes in a simple logical progression, a great service in spelling out, read his lips, exactly what is going on at all times.But what is going on is that vast consciousness we may enter when we enter deepest sleep, beyond words, where everything interconnects.Several other commentaries are as useful and more interesting. THe Skeleton Key, as is implied, lays out the bare bones of the narrative part by part. Others explore different motifs, such as heraldry or children's stories, or other languages, etc.You can find commentaries such as Joyce and the Jews which traces a Talmudic structure throughout the Wake and a Hebraic origin to its use of each letter as signifier, including the Cabalistic curious numerical value of ALP, the female essence of the dreamland. You can find other commentaries which discover Sherlock Holmes lurking beyond each passageway.Each element in Finnegans Wake is not random, but intentional, a tribute to the genius and all-inclusive learning of Mr. Joyce. Like the great cathedrals of Europe, at Chartres, etc., it is far beyond our dumbed-down televised understanding. Just as it is now impossible for us to rebuild the Cathedral at Chartres (the rose window alone could never be reconstructed) so do we find the construction of Finnegans incomprehensible without every aid available.We find our exiled selves now so unfortunately devolved literally as to be no longer capable of comprehension, but only dismissal. It makes our heads hurt to think, to laugh, to expand.Finnegans is a great mountain beyond our vision, beyond the clouds, too wide and too tall to see, but one we do well to climb attentively, to broaden our own perceptions, our horizons, our fitness, our minds, our souls.Get it. Get the commentaries, beginning with Joseph Campbell, but soon you will see his own limitations and struggle to go beyond him. His Skeleton Key is like the Finnegans Wake for Dummies series.

It's nice to discover those little goodies that everyone else glosses over. Clever puns and whatnot are great, but they are no substitute for a good story, strong characters, and so on. Finnegans Wake has nothing going for it. (While it does have puns, they are anything but clever). When you read a good book it should have an effect on you. You should lose sleep turning it over in your mind. Finnegans Wake sort of makes you think in that you have to try to figure out what this word is, or what language this might be, or what Joyce was smoking when he wrote this schlock. What it doesn't do, however, is make you laugh, cry, gasp, grimace, or reminisce like true literature does.Questions for all those that gave this 5 stars: Did you really enjoy reading this? Did it elicit any sort of emotional response out of you? At best it will make you feel smart for recognizing a few foreign words.Honestly, I think Joyce was just a polyglot wordsmith and wrote this as a sort of mental exercise for the same reason people do Sudoku puzzles.

I read Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway from cover to cover and it is actually entertaining. Or, at the very least, the sentences actually flow together in the way people would actually speak them.So Finnegans Wake is a dream-like mumbo jumbo. The question is, is there any purpose to it? Why should the reader spend time and effort deciphering the cryptic nonsense in order to figure out what the story actually is, when there are perfectly coherent novels out there that actually tell the story as it is?For one thing, if the author needs to disguise the plot with a ton of fancy language, it just means the plot is too thin to be interesting on its own.

After just reading a small portion of Finnegans Wake here on Amazon - thank you for the excerpts because you saved me a bundle - and after flipping through a few pages of Ulysses - too bad I paid full price for the Modern Library Edition - I am now disposed to think that Joyce was the biggest humbug for a writer ever.When I read through the first page of Finnegans Wake, I was quite consternated at my limited vocabulary - I mean, after all, there were something like twenty words - I didn't count - that I didn't know! Which has never happened to me from reading any book, even Melville or Shakespeare! Then I looked some of them up and discovered that they weren't even in the dictionary.Even if some of the words are foreign and actually do exist, this doesn't prove that Joyce was a great writer in English. For a man who was so educated, he sure couldn't compose an original piece of literature with any sort of structural integrity and plot congruency.Scholars would have you believe that Joyce was a genius, whose mastery of the language was invidious. But I query which lingo he conquered, for it surely isn't English.Maybe it was because Melville wrote Moby Dick in one year, or maybe it was because he composed White-Jacket and Redburn in one summer, perhaps Joyce realized his limitations and provinciality of ingenuity, so that's maybe why he foisted Ulysses and Finnegans Wake at the public.

Against &#145;moralists&#146; and &#145;religions&#146; (esp. Christianity) such statements might invoke hostility on Nietzsche himself by the reader. Who does understand Nietzsche, except Nietzsche himself? The reader must go beyond this degradation &#150; for to see the world of Nietzsche one must see Nietzsche from within. Nietzsche&#146;s philosophy of a &#147;philosophy of life&#148; (Paul Tillich) is the only one that is. Much can be learned from reading Nietzsche. Nietzsche valued life and perhaps understood it more so than the &#145;moralists&#146; of yesterday and today. - First purchase and readingNietzsche&#146;s philosophy, I believe, rests on his assertion: &#147;Whether we have grown more moral&#148; (TI, 37). Nietzsche was a man who had no need of pity or &#145;convictions&#146; of any certainty, that be called &#145;truth&#146; (the former, i.e., certainty, which only limits perspective). Nietzsche, firstly, was a philologist (the study of ancient literature), followed by that of a psychologist (how certain &#145;concepts&#146; in literature &#145;seduce&#146; man), and lastly, that of a physician (how these &#145;seductions&#146; harm man&#146;s health to the point of man becoming &#145;morbid&#146;). Asserting himself to be all three, Nietzsche&#146;s philosophy and Nietzsche as philosopher sprang forth with the statement: &#147;Revaluation of All Values&#148; (AC, 62). Going back to the assertion above, &#147;whether we have grown more moral,&#148; Nietzsche is concerned with the &#145;first order of rank,&#146; and that first order is the creation of a &#145;higher type&#146; of &#145;morality,&#146; that which man has been depraved of and denied, especially from &#145;Christian morals.&#146; He is concerned with freeing man from this &#145;enslaved morbid morality&#146; and placing him on a ladder that ascends to a &#145;higher type&#146; of man: the Overman or Superman. It is the &#145;Will to Power&#146; for More Life that says &#147;Yes&#148; to Life. But then again, this is Nietzsche&#146;s interpretation of the history of morals&#133; But what better interpretation is there than &#145;experience.&#146;- Second purchase and reading"},{"Title":"Twilight of the Idols and the Anti-Christ","review":"The two works contained in this volume were the last two works that Friedrich Nietzsche was to complete in his lifetime. Shorly after finishing them, he went insane, and in reading The Anti-Christ, in particular, one senses that he is very much at the end of his rope.There are two ways of reading this book. I fear that many read it primarily as an attack on Christianity (which it certainly is), but it is also far more than that. If one takes Nietzsche's tirades against Christianity (in both its Protestant and Roman Catholic variants) seriously, one is left with a sort of bad version of Feuerbach: highly reactionary, occasionally humorous, and without the potential for changing minds. In short, Nietzsche's attacks are really quite banal and devoid of creativity - not to mention that he did them better in his younger days before his madness began to set in.The second way of reading this book is the way that both shows Nietzsche's insight and the frightening ways in which his insight would be picked up by the Nazis, in particular: \\"When one gives up Christian belief one thereby deprives oneself of the *right* to Christian morality\\" (Twilight, 80). Nietzsche sought to replace Christian morality with Dionysian morality, which celebrated destruction as much as it celebrated creation, which looked toward what he termed, in an earlier work, \\"the overman\\" who was humanity risen above itself.If one wants to understand Nietzsche, one must not read him as the anti-prophet (indeed, the anti-Christ) of God's death, but of the anti-prophet of life after the death of God, which is also the death of all that this God anchored. It is an irony that the self-styled anti-Christ who \\"philosophized with a hammer\\" so as to \\"sound out idols\\" would spend the last 10 years of his life clinically insane while the world outside would just begin to discover him. The question that must be asked is whether or not the location of the concentration camp Buchenwald directly across the valley from the Nietsche archive in Weimar is a continuance of this irony or its natural consummation."},{"Title":"Twilight of the Idols and the Anti-Christ","review":"I don't want to summarize the content of the book (you can get it from other reviews). I only want to point out the best and worst things of it and just let you to decide whether you want to read it.WORST: TWILIGHT reveals the weakness of Nietzsche as a philosopher better than the other of his works: his greatest fault is that, if you want to \\"learn something\\" by reading his books, you will be utterly disappointed. He do not develop the arguments, and most of the time you will find him going round and round. Indeed, many of the points in this book he had already mentioned in his earlier works, such as BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL (which is a book that I don't recommend). After reading the first 70 pages you'll feel that he seems to have nothing more to say, but he keeps on repeating his points like a madman (really, he's mad), and that's why his arguments are sometimes illogical: the repetitions made him contradict himself. Moreover, THE ANTI-CHRIST is a mere superficial repetition of TWILIGHT.BEST: If you're a Nietzsche beginner, this book (and THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSRA) would be a good sample of Nietzsche's thoughts and writing style. If you don't like this book, don't even bother to read BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL and ECCE HOMO, which are 10 times \\"drier\\" than TWILIGHT. But if you like it and if you've finished it, you will acquire a good grasp of Nietzschian philosophy (which, in my opinion, is not that fascinating), and all his other books will become optional reading, for they will be mere repetitions of TWILIGHT. Last but not least, Hollingdale's translation is one of the best.MY OPINION: As an aside, if you are really interested in a logical analysis of Christian philosophy/psychology, go for Kierkegaard's THE SICKNESS UNTO DEATH rather than Nietzsche."},{"Title":"Twilight of the Idols and the Anti-Christ","review":"Twilight of the Idols-This starts off with some almost funny (something even vaguely resembling humor is not something you expect to see in a Nietzsche book) observations from Nietzsche and goes from there into his critiques of Socrates. He later goes into critiques and observations about other philosophers, as well as critiquing Germans and Germany. This book has plenty of what I normally like and dislike about Nietzsche. Dislike, sometimes reading his work is about as exciting as watching paint dry and he comes off personality wise as way too anal retentive, dogmatic to his own worldview and humorless. He reminds me of the current wave of militant atheists. Dogmatic atheism is the trendy new system created religion in case you haven't noticed.What I like about Nietzsche, the creed of self improvement and the anti-Christianity stuff, is here in abundance. Like in most of his work between pages of boredom you get instances of brilliance such as the following from Twilight of the Idols when talking about what Christianity did to the great \\"Teutonic Blonde Beast\\"he say Christianity made him \\"sick, miserable, filled with ill-will towards himself, full of hatred for the impulses towards life, full of suspicion of all that was still strong and happy\\". In other words he lost his healthy Pagan Odinic worldview and became a psychological and spiritual Jew.The Anti-Christ-Nietzsche really rips into Christianity in this one. There are other critiques of Christianity that I like better (Natures Eternal Religion by Ben Klassen and The Age of Reason by Thomas Paine are a couple off the top of my head) but for someone with the worldview that Nietzsche had this is pretty good.

A previous translation, in The Portable Nietzsche, presented the ideas here as philosophical thought: &quot;to have spirit: one must arrogate it, one must have the arrogance to have spirit.&quot; (TPN, p. 505) As a predominantly German-American nobody, who knows how far from the ethos of our comic society such an attitude would be, I prefer the more apologetic tone used by Hollingdale at the beginning of his section on What the Germans Lack. &quot;Among Germans today it is not enough to possess spirit: one must also possess the presumption to possess it.&quot; (Twilight of the Idols, p. 71) My joy is not in any possession here, but simply in the opportunity which Nietzsche created to raise certain issues. &quot;I also add that here people can still obey without being humiliated by obeying. . . . And no one despises his adversary . . .&quot; Perhaps Nietzsche was thinking of philosophers like Kant when he wrote that. A page later, Nietzsche is back to an old complaint: &quot;But this nation has deliberately made itself stupid, . . . how much beer there is in the German intellect!&quot; As a critic of something like a culture, based on power and a common touch for everything concerning greatness, there is much that one can find to sympathize with Nietzsche's views today. Such a view of this work might be in keeping with his line, &quot;That the Germans have so much as endured their philosophers, above all that most deformed conceptual cripple there has ever been, the great Kant, offers a good idea of German amenableness.&quot; (p. 77) I suppose this is really about unconditional surrender to whatever is considered culturally superior, but only a fool would admit it. This comes coupled with an attack on the common form of religion."},{"Title":"Twilight of the Idols and the Anti-Christ","review":"I have a friend that shared with me how if there is no God, then Nietzsche makes perfect sense; for his philosophy naturally follows from the blind assumption that \\"God is dead\\". Oh man, if this is so, then this books makes me desperately hope there is a God! Nietzsche scorns Christian morality, which is arguably the very foundation for western civilization. With fanatic zeal he tries to saw off the limb upon which he sits. With a moralistic passion he derides self-control, mercy, equality and kindness as vile wickedness that should be purged from the earth. Whereas the ideal world would be one that is in a continual state war, cruelty, struggle, injustice and evil.Nietzsche, what?! Oh you poor soul, You were born in the wrong place. Oh if only you were born in some cannibalistic headhunting tribe in the Amazon. You would have been in your idea of heaven, but damn it, you'd never would have gotten a chance to write about it.What?! Why should I heed? Its like you demand me to try to find oxygen on the ocean floor. You give me the recipe for a miserable, empty, meaningless life and then you act like I am the fool for not consuming it?What!? You counsel me to be the slave of my animal passions, to chained myself to instinct and to be a faithful servant to my every irrational whim? You want me to cut away from myself all that is human until I am nothing more then a beast? You want me to work with you in shaving away from the world all that is beautiful, good and true?

Most of his errors are what logician call &quot;informal fallacies,&quot; or error with the type of inferences he makes with his data.To his credit, Nietzsche is a very bouncy, scintillating an energetic writer. I think that many people can learn from his literary style. I certainly have. But a well-perfumed lie is like a well-perfumed skunk: eventually both will stink, since you cannot change their nature no matter how pretty you make them up to be!Here are some samples of hi errors:P. 56. &quot;Let us consider finally what naivety it is to say 'man ought to be thus and thus.'&quot; In other words, we ought not say ought. See the internal incoherency?Ibid. &quot;We others, we immoralists, have on the contrary open wide our hearts to every kind of understanding, comprehension, approval.&quot; Has he opened his heart wide to accept religion or God? This, by the way, is called &quot;dicto simplicter,&quot; or a sweeping generalization; and it is also an &quot;iron man&quot; argument, where you overstate your own position.P. 64. &quot;The error of free will. --We no longer have any sympathy today with the concept of 'free will.&quot; One you remove freedom, you remove meaning. If Hitler, Dahmer, or whom ever wasn't free to choose not to become incarnate devils, then we cannot hold them accountable. We do not blame blind people for being born blind because they simply have no control over that condition. But we do have an ability to control our own souls, to make gods and angels of ourselves, or to make demons and devils of ourselves. If we have no freedom, then we have no penal system, simply the criminal could not control his or herself. And that would be hell on earth.Ibid. &quot;Men were thought of as 'free' so that they could become guilt.&quot; This is probably a Freudian Slip on Nietzsche's part. Religion has a cutting edge to it--always repent and do not make excuses for your meanness. We get so concerned about the evil in the world around us; we forget the evil deep within us.P. 66. &quot;One knows my demand of philosophers that they place themselves beyond good and evil--that they have the illusion of moral judgments beneath them.&quot; It is good to be beyond good. It is moral to be beyond morality. In other words, Nietzsche assumes what he tries to disprove.The only reason why I think Nietzsche's philosophy caught on is that first, he was a bouncy and vibrant voice. I enjoy reading his works because they are rather witty and quick and slicing. Secondly, his philosophy is very flattering one. God is dead; you become the Superman and replace God (Thus Spoke Zarathustra, ch. 24). This unctuous punch has made many people punch drunk with lust. A very appealing idea that you can become a new god by yourself, which is the oldest lie in the Book!The Anti-Christ:Being a Christian does not dampen or deny my ideas, being biased against the conclusion, any more than an atheist is tainted, being biased in favor of the conclusion. Bias cuts both ways.It is true, and no one doubts this, many abuses have been in the name of religion. But is it fair to judge a thing by its abuse? Shall we judge all Austrians by the abuses of Hitler? Do we throw out Mozart with the bathwater? No. Nietzsche makes yet another &quot;dicto simplicter&quot; in accusing Christians of being unworthy.As I read his treatment of Christianity, I kept asking myself, &quot;What religion is he talking about?&quot; It seems that Nietzsche is describing Christianity in the worst possible of terms, as if he intentionally wants to misunderstand what the religions is about. It is like the genies or fairy that play syntax-games with the wishes they grant human beings--&quot;Make me a sandwich!&quot; *Poof!*In conclusion, I find Nietzsche an engaging, fun and passionate writer. We have so man wet noodles out there; it is great to read some one with a backbone. However, Nietzsche falls apart miserably with his non-existent logic. And that is a deathblow.The Book:This is a great \\"two-fer,\\" since both books are rather slender and trim books. Penguin Classics always does a superb job with these books-the introductory essays are helpful and the notes are useful. They type is excellent and there are no typos. I found the glossary of names in the back an added plus, since I am not up to speed on may of the German philosophers and Nietzsche's time period.

It is dogmatic to the point of shrill, and surprisingly lacking in real self-confidence. (perhaps he using his rhetoric as a way to convince himself of things not even he can believe.) It is full of vulgar unnatural and irational opinions meant mainly to shock lacking true conviction in the end. There is a constant confusion of thought and feeling, a endless muddying of the waters of interesting thought by a kind of upside down stoicism that could only be the product of a thorougly dacadent romanticism. There is also a kind of disturbing right wing athuritarianism,that is obviously the product of (M. Andre Gide's words )Nietschze's insane jealousy of Christ. He distorts history into a recreation of his own amusing and rather twisted pysche. His rants against christianity, while amusing, are often a attack on liberal christianity, which Nietschze being the ultra right winger he is patently despises.

I only understood about 40% of it and have reread it about 3 times, each time understanding more. Anything of Nietzsche's is good. It's just a matter of rereading it if you really don't get it. The bits which at first seem like padding become the most interesting bits eventually.This is a good place to start partly because of Michael Tanner's excellent introduction and also because it is not too long but covers the most important bits of his writing, his attack on Christianity (and the post-Christian mealymouthed morality we've inherited), the moral system which really made him puke. As Tanner says though, in many of his arguments against Christianity you can see he is arguing against it when practised by the overwhelming majority of people, not the person of Jesus or the philosophy itself which he often seems to appreciate and value.Nietzsche is THE must read for all adults because I could have lived 1000 years and not figured so much of it out myself - that Christianity is a religion of hate, dressed up in 'love'. Sounds batty, but it's not. Because you can read Edmund Burke and others and have already thought these things yourself.

No matter which side of the debate you belong to -- or if you are a third party altogether -- Nietzsche has something to rock your world. I first read these books as a teenager and they forever changed the way that I view the world. The question that everyone who reads these books, and the rest of Nietzsche's work, must ask themselves is what to make of the modern world. As we enter a supposedly post-Christian era, an era of which Nietzsche was certainly the forerunner and prophet, we must ask ourselves just how much of our heritage we are willing to part with as we part with Christianity. And we must ask ourselves upon what basis we will build this new, post-Christian civilization. My belief is that Nietzsche was right: the foundation will be power."},{"Title":"Twilight of the Idols and the Anti-Christ","review":"This two works by one of the more influential philosophers of the end of the 19th century, must be read with a proviso. They were published posthumously by Elisabeth, his sister, in a sequence conforming to her own authoritarian views.This said, the Antichrist is a must read for those philosophers concerned with the nihilistic (nihilismus) and transmutation of all occidental values (Umwertung aller Werte) central aspects of Nietzche's philosophy. If you read them at face value, confusion migth ensue and the intrinsic power of an effort to demonstrate the futility and perversion of certain occidental values is lost. Then the road opens for misrepresentations and the exploitation for propaganda and other purposes. To put things in perspective, one must not forget that \\"God's death\\", according to N. is a metaphysical event consisting in the slaughter of God by the human being, for the sake of truth and religion itself. According to the author, God's death appurtains to the essence of cristianism because, by way of the interpretation of Plato's philosophy, this religion considers truth and God as exogenous or outherworld elements. As a consequence of this platonic view, the world itself and its Gods appear void of basis and truth, and therefore the nihilism of the modern man ensues. That God is dead is evident, but no man lives this event as a passage and liberation from metaphysical duality ( world and outher world), in order to reconcile with the earth and real life.

But in looking at this work again I became impressed with another dimension of Nietzsche which I believe is not so much talked about. His bombast. And how his exaggerations( which some dismiss as playful madness) can truly mislead and injure. I read a passage on his celebration of War and I am appalled for it is obviously written by someone whose wars have all been inner ones. The broken, the bleeding, the lamed, the terrible pain and injury of the battlefied is not something Nietzsche knows firsthand- and so he can romanticize it.In the 'AntiChrist' Neitzsche makes his well- known critique of Christianity.Nietzsche's brilliance is indisputable but the re-evaluation of values, the celebration of the ' superman'the praising of strength and power contributed to historical consequences he had no control over.I recommend reading this book but with an extremely critical mind."},{"Title":"Twilight of the Idols and the Anti-Christ","review":"To read, and to review, Fredrich Nietzsche who is one of the pre-eminent philosophers of the modern era is not a task to be taken lightly. A critique of his work is probably beyond the purview of one sitting or one writer.Here, Penguin Classics combines two of his better-known works, Twilight Of The Idols and The Anti-Christ, into one tome. Both works were, perhaps ironically, written at the twilight of the German philosophers life. He would descend into personal chaos a year after finishing the latter title and end up insane. The coming of the conflict would not have been a surprise given the polemic, frustrated and bitter nature of his work here. Bearing that, Nietzsche also musters enough humour amidst his onslaught of logic to cast a bitter smile upon his subjects.While The Twilight Of The Idol (his unkind take on Wagner's Twilight Of The Gods) is a panoramic and wide-reaching synopsis of his misanthropy and clash with conventional history, The Anti-Christ turns his pen into a more focused attack against Christianity. Taking accepted thinking and the mainstream as his prey, the German philosopher spares no fire when bearing down on Greek philosophy, Englishmen, Germans and the Jews, among others. Christianity might be his main source of contempt, and certainly his keen interpretation of that dogma is torrid and furious, but Nietzsche's mildly tolerant views on Buddhism, the Romans and Islamic Moors, in contrast, must have juxtaposed his condemnation even further and driven his contemporaries and eventual enemies just as much into furor.Despite several notable contradictions and conflicting arguments the books and Nietzsche are both a fascinating revelation of the world mythos and an unrelenting denigration of individual thought patterns."},{"Title":"Twilight of the Idols and the Anti-Christ","review":"If there was any question of whether Nietzsche was an absolute genius, these two books will prove it.

Despite being Christian or not, (I being in the latter category), it really shines new light on how you see the Christian faith, or any faith in general."},{"Title":"Twilight of the Idols and the Anti-Christ","review":"The perfect album from Crazy Freddie? This is a rip-snorting read - delivered in punchy three minutes bursts of exhilarating energy. Much of Nietszche can, for today's eyes, be pretty impnenetrable stuff (Thus Spake Zarathustra, for example, is a tough read: a bit like Freddie's old sparring partner Dickie Wagner, it has wonderful moments, but some dreadful half hours), but The Antichrist suffers no such lag: Here Continental philosophy's very own Johnny Rotten puts it all together, buzzsawing headlong through the sacred cows, and BOY the band is on song. This is a deconstruction, not of God, not even of the Bible, but of Christanity AS practiced. And what a demolition job it is. Make no mistake, this is no points victory; it's a rout. Christianity has NEVER been beaten up this badly before, but it has never had to fight according to the rules. OK, I'm changing metaphors here, now - Nietzsche is Mohammed Ali, dancing around the Ring (sorry Dickie W, no pun intended) taunting this corpulent, drugged up, pale, pasty opponent, darting in with a vicious jab, ducking out again. There's blood on the floor. The fall guy never stands a chance. Champion of the World, Nietzsche glistens, fizzes, grandstands, and struts round the ring, belt held high above his head, while someone wipes the floor up and bundles off the poor Christian dude to get his face fixed up - it's beautiful, its systematic, and it's unanswerable. But most of all it is so stylish, even in translation. I could quote some of this boiling invective, but I fear it may upset delicate sensibilities. Wonderful stuff!"},{"Title":"Twilight of the Idols and the Anti-Christ","review":"These two books, earlier regarded as products of the onset of his insanity, are now accounted two of the deepest and most profound of Nietzche's works. Reading them is like a revelation, every page a feast for soul and mind alike. I must admit, I was an atheist long before reading Nietzche, but if I had ever had any doubts before they were cleansed after just two pages from these two powerful polemics."},{"Title":"Twilight of the Idols and the Anti-Christ","review":"Two excellent works. However, it might now be the best idea to deliver them in one package, as twilight is an awesome introduction to, and synopsis of, Nietzsche's philosophy and hence a good read for a first encounter with Nietzsche (and a parallel lecture to Zarathustra!), whereas Anthchrist is best understood with the background of Nietzsches other major works, hence more of a last or later read.Nonetheless 5 stars for the quality of the content:Twilight: It is extremely rare that a philosopher manages to write such a precise, witty, deep and to-the-point synopsis of his own ideas as Nietzsche did in Twilight - some of the best aphorisms and metaphors in modern philosophy!Antichrist: Don't be fooled by the polemic style of the book: This is a brilliant psychological and historical analysis AND criticism of christianity. Under the skillful but fierce rhethoric it stays grounded in historic research and observations and substantiates its points with sound arguments. Christians who feel brave enough to think for themselves and test their faith must read this book, as it is a mindblowing exposition of the religion's underlying mechanisms and thoroughly challenges the belief with arguments that Christianity has yet to find answers to."},{"Title":"Twilight of the Idols and the Anti-Christ","review":"\\"Twilight\\" is the book i always recommend to first-time readers of Nietzsche: It is the most concise statement of his most important ideas. If you read only one book by Nietzsche, make it this one. Both Hollingdale's and Kaufmann's translations are readable and try to be as faithful to the original as possible in style and substance.If you were raised Christian or have been a Christian, \\"Antichrist\\" is quite important as an exposition of dangers in the philosophical underpinings of Christianity (or \\"Paulism\\") as world view and praxis, beyond ordinary criticisms that usually focus on the hypocrisy of the Church, etc, which are ultimately less useful. A less important read for those who have never been Christians, especially as N deals in \\"Twilight\\" with the \\"undercover Christianity\\" (Kantianism, etc.) one is likely to encounter outside the church.By the way, a previous reviewer cautioned readers that these books were edited by Elisabeth, Nietzsche's sister-- that reviewer was mistaken. She edited only \\"The Will to Power,\\" which despite her claims was not a book at all but a collection of unconnected notebook entries not intended for publication. Avoid that book until you've read all the rest. \\"Twilight\\" and \\"Antichrist\\" were written in the prolific year before N became ill and were certainly intended for publication."},{"Title":"Twilight of the Idols and the Anti-Christ","review":"Hollingdale's translation of &quot;Twilight of the Idols&quot; and &quot;The Antichrist&quot; is a standard in the classroom. H.L. Mencken, who wrote what I believe was the first American study of Nietzsche in 1908, also translated &quot;The Antichrist&quot; (Mencken's title is &quot;The Anti-Christ&quot;) in 1917. I cannot say which of the two translations is the more &quot;accurate.&quot; But I can say that Mencken's recently re-issued translation (see Amazon.com listing) is the more interesting and compelling read of the two, and definitely deserves a look."},{"Title":"Twilight of the Idols and the Anti-Christ","review":"These books are not for the light minded, or the closed minded... or for the severly openminded. they are for those who are ready to get on a bull of philosophy that just might throw you to the mat. But, having said that, it is a great read, and could very well be better for you 'in the long run'.Not recommended for children or republicans."},{"Title":"Twilight of the Idols and the Anti-Christ","review":"Ours is a time not that very different from that of Nietzsche's. We too live in a kind of Victorian hell, a genteel time of right thinking professors who would make Nietzsche feel as unwelcome as did his \\"betters,\\" who recognized he was a genius but didn't want him around. \\"Twilight of the Idols\\" is a lot of fun to read. It is exhilarating to read such frankness, without the American way of combining honestly with profanity. It is straight talk on the decline of German culture. I will leave it to the reader to decide if this may be applied to our once great country. Nietzsche's great insight in his time was to return to the Greeks, but to cast Plato aside, in favor of the great historian Thucydides, who immortalized the rhetoricians, such as Pericles, and sang the praises of the speaker and doer of deeds in contrast to the \\"armchair\\" thinkers such as Socrates. Nietzsche seems to be the ultimate heavy, but he is a hoot to read and seems to have had as much fun writing this work as I have had reading it."},{"Title":"Twilight of the Idols and the Anti-Christ","review":"The two books nicely translated by Hollingdale are among Nietzsche's last four books. The other two being &quot;Ecce Homo&quot; and &quot;The Case of Wagner.&quot; But it is this volume that presents Nietzsche's most blatant challenge to the foundations of Western thought, namely, rationalism and Christian values of love, hope, faith, and compassion. Nietzsche is in his most strident in &quot;The Anti-Christ.&quot; He clearly saw himself as a world-transforming figure, who was to supplant the figure of Jesus, as he is presented in the Bible.&quot;The Anti-Christ&quot; poses a difficult challenge to the critic. What aspect of the book is the most important one? By Nietzsche's own account, it is his desire to revaluate all values. If that is the ultimate goal of the book, then Nietzsche fails rather miserabley, as his version of new values offers little more than ruthlessness and principled denial of anything that stands in the way of raging power. However, if viewed as historical criticism, &quot;The Anti-Christ&quot; stand up as an interesting and, at times, insightful, read. Nietzsche continues to probe the psychological depth of the human soul, just as he did in the &quot;Twilight of the Idols.&quot;All in all, this is a must read for any student of philosophy, history, or politics. And here you will see an insightful philosopher and a literary master who, scandalized by the imiplications of Darwin's theory of evolution, constructed a nightmarish visions that would be used and misused by his pseudo-disciples, including the Nazis, to justify cruelty and absurdity. Of all 19th century philosophers, Nietzsche has the greatest impact on the intellectual developments in the humanities in continetal Europe. These two books will give you a taste of the strident and uncompromising genius, tortured by narrow-mindedness and abusrdities of the world, as well as by the bitterness that comes for the total lack of recognition."},{"Title":"Twilight of the Idols and the Anti-Christ","review":"In this powerful work of philosophy, Nietzsche ponders the value of nearly everything. In the first text Twilight of the Idols, he offers a compelling attack on the prevalent beliefs of his time, including such thinkers as Hegel and Kant, as well as Socrates, theology, morality, and all things German. In the second text, the Anti-Christ, Nietzsche brilliantly and energetically provides his counter-arguement to Christianity and the ways the institution has distorted and murdered the teachings of Christ. His writing is breathtaking and his arguments are made in brief, explosive flashes of immense genius. However, his work can be exhausting as he continues to negate all thought besides his own, and his ability to draw references can be formidable. I'm sure the latter essay will not be palatable to devout Christians but it is necessary that you read it, for it will surely shake the foundations of your belief."},{"Title":"Twilight of the Idols and the Anti-Christ","review":"\\"Twilight of the Idols\\" and \\"The Anti-Christ\\" are two of the last books, both composed in 1888, that Nietzsche wrote before his final descent into syphilis-induced madness which occurred during the first week of 1889. They continue themes he had developed in his earlier work, and \\"The Anti-Christ\\" especially approaches Christianity with a particularly ferocious and critical eye.As anyone who has thumbed through a volume of Nietzsche can tell you, his work isn't composed of clear, well-defined propositions to be ultimately accepted or rejected; instead, his arguments have a kind of ravishing rhetorical force to them. His writing is less apothegmatic here than in other work, but is still never syllogistic or ratiocinated in such a way that we usually associate with philosophy. This isn't a mistake; he intended his work to speak as much if not more through the force of style than anything else. In his \\"attack\\" on Socrates in the first book, he calls reason itself a \\"tyrant,\\" and wonders if Socrates enjoys his \\"own form of ferocity in the knife-thrust of the syllogism.\\"The greatest part of \\"Twilight of the Idols\\" is the chapter called \\"Morality as Anti-Nature\\" in which he says that all moral systems up until now, and particularly Christianity, are wrong precisely because they try to deform and reshape human nature to their own image. For Nietzsche, the moral is the natural, but Christianity - and this is really an attack on all religious systems, though some more than others - stops being moral when it tries to impose concepts that are completely foreign to human beings like the idea that \\"everyone is created the same\\" or a selfless Christian charity. Whether or not you agree with the thrust of the argument, I found the idea of moral systems as rational attempts to remold nature an interesting one. Of course, people jump on these passages to try to make him look like some kind of nihilist or immoralist, when nothing could be further from the truth. He simply wants the principles and drives of human nature to inform ethical systems, not something foreign to them. Freud may have picked up on this, admitting as he did a great debt to Nietzsche. \\"The Anti-Christ\\" goes on to attack what I would call religious psychology, and especially the moral precepts of Christianity.If you haven't read Nietzsche and have some sort of caricature of what he says in your head, start with this book, probably one of his most readable, which is ironic when considered in the light of his mental breakdown immediately thereafter. His attacks are never the ones you hear from atheists these days, that \\"the idea of God is irrational\\" or \\"we have no scientific evidence for such a being.\\" His criticisms are fresh and invigorating, including accusations that the apostle Paul distorted Christ's message beyond measure and that Christianity focuses on another world essentially devaluing this one. Again, this isn't about agreement or disagreement with his basic assertions. (Some of the people on whom he had the biggest influence fundamentally disagreed with what he said.) It's the punch that he packs while delivering them. There was a reason why he subtitled the book \\"Wie man mit dem Hammer philosophiert\\" (\\"How to Philosophize with a Hammer\\").Other than Nietzsche's writing itself, some of the most impressive things about him are the downright preposterousness of the criticisms that people levy against him, the sheer width and breadth of intellectual laziness with which people read him. Just from reading a small sampling of the reviews posted on this book alone, there are accusations of him \\"deriding self-control\\" and being \\"obnoxiously right-wing,\\" the first a willful misreading, the second a risible attempt to foist a set of anachronistic political opinions on the ideas of a man who was hugely contemptuous of the German politics of his own day, left and right alike. Those who are trying to discover their token protofascist in Nietzsche would do better to look elsewhere, especially at his contemporaries Paul de Lagarde, Julius Langbehn, and Arthur Moeller van den Bruck, all of whose ideas make Nietzsche's supposed illiberalism look like mere child's play (for details, see either Fritz Stern's marvelous \\"The Politics of Cultural Despair\\" or my review of it posted on this site). That Nietzsche still serves as a lodestar around which people feel free to hang their own various political opinions can only be a testament to his continued cultural importance."},{"Title":"Twilight of the Idols and the Anti-Christ","review":"I had a hard time trying to come up with a concise rating and review of this 2-in-1 book. On the one hand, Nietzsche sums up and elucidates some fantastic points about the general state of Christian morality and Church teaching (and thus about the human tendency to \\"hate thyself and one's own nature\\"). On the other hand, he does appear to suffer from some misunderstandings concerning some particulars of Christianity and Buddhism, worsened to say the least by rampant generalizations and a notable lack of syllogistic explication.Nietzsche definitely broke ground with many of his other contemporaries of the Modern Era in Western Philosophy by not working in syllogisms and theoretical tabulations. Nietzsche is a man who passionately makes stabs at his opponents without worry of backlash or micrological scrutiny. And this is what makes these two works so fun to read!Twilight of the Idols is basically a summation of many of his ideas - anyone wishing to gain an overall sense of Nietzsche's position on humanity's relation to the world and itself would do well to read this work.The Anti-Christ is his most ferocious attack on institutional Christianity and it's many hypocrises. I believe the material still holds relevant today, not as an affront to Jesus' teachings, but on the establishment and growth of Paulism over the last two millenia.Anyone who is looking to get a good sense of Nietzsche's philosophy and/or a dynamic view of religious law-practice would do well to read this pair of essays, bearing in mind that generalizations run rampant in his writing. I myself found this to be an enjoyable read, although I noted some inaccuracies in content."},{"Title":"Twilight of the Idols and the Anti-Christ","review":"\\"Twilight of the Idols\\" and \\"The Anti-Christ\\" are excellent works. There's no problem with them. Only there may be with my review, given that I read \\"Twilight,\\" Saint Augustine's \\"Confessions,\\" and \\"The Anti-Christ\\" in that order. It's not a good combination. And it may have motivated my negative (and now deleted) review of the \\"Confessions.\\" You see, I'd just had Nietzsche explain to me that \\"the complete woman perpetrates literature in the same way that she perpetrates a little sin.\\" Nietzsche takes a while to get used to.In \\"Twilight,\\" Nietzsche makes the point that there are four great logical errors: confusion of cause and consequence, false causality, imaginary causes, and free will. His illustration of the first is the claim that virtue causes happiness.Another fine point is made in reference to liberal causes. While they are being fought for, they often promote freedom. But once they are attained, there is a restoration of the herd mentality, and freedom is a thing of the past at best. And one final point right before I read the \\"Confessions\\": \\"nothing is rarer among moralists and saints than integrity.\\"In \\"The Anti-Christ,\\" Nietzsche strongly condemns Christianity. Nietzsche soon makes an important point which I happen to disagree with. He says that in condemning Christianity, he does not want to \\"wrong a kindred religion,\\" namely Buddhism. After all, Buddhism's \\"supreme goal is cheerfulness, stillness, absence of malice, and this goal is achieved.\\" He's right about Buddhism's goal, and he's right that it is achieved. But I think he's wrong about this being completely desirable: I think it removes so much emotion that it takes away some of what makes being human worthwhile.Nietzsche is outraged by the fact that Christians have made a hero of Jesus, and uses words to describe it such as \\"an instinctive hatred of reality.\\" He analyzes Christianity from this point of view: as a constant opponent of truth. And he concludes that it has caused distress, and that it has been a conspiracy against health, beauty, bravery, intellect, and life itself.I think those who have a vague feeling that monotheistic attitudes are a natural part of the human spirit ought to read this book."},{"Title":"Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life (Pilgrimage Growth Guide)","review":"Donald Whitney is clearly a disciplined man who loves God, and who would love to take the time to help you grow in your love for Him as well.

At the moment I am still reading it. Great."},{"Title":"Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life (Pilgrimage Growth Guide)","review":"Authoring a book that overflows with great advice and suggestions, Whiney captures the true essence of the spiritual disciplines. Not only does he distinguish and explain spiritual disciplines that should be found in a Christian's life, but he gives the reasoning and biblical context behind them as well. Whitney succeeds in defining the purpose of these disciplines as godliness.The book is divided into thirteen easy to read chapters, most detailing a discipline. The first and last chapters serve as bookends, explaining the purpose of these disciplines and how to persevere in them, respectively. These disciplines are explained as a means to godliness that the Lord expects. The author points out that there is danger in neglecting, freedom in embracing, and an invitation for all Christians to enjoy the spiritual disciplines.The disciplines begin with bible intake, which are split into two chapters because of the depth and importance. Whitney explains the different types of intake which include hearing, reading, studying, memorizing, meditating on, and applying God's word.After the foundation of bible intake is laid, the author leads us into prayer. He reminds us that prayer is expected, learned, and answered. Whitney then begins to explain how worship if focusing on and responding to God. It is done in spirit and truth. It is expected both publicly and privately and is a discipline to be cultivated. In a sense, prayer and worship go hand in hand. It is hard to do one and not another.Whitney then shifts gears and speaks of evangelism. A recurring theme, he reminds us that evangelism is expected. It is also an empowered discipline. The next discipline, serving, is explained as motivated by obedience, gratitude, gladness, forgiveness, humility and love. Spiritual gifts are then explained as they pertain to serving and he reminds us that it is hard work.After going through so many different disciplines, it is fitting that Whitney wants to remind us of our focus and not allow us to be overwhelmed. Stewardship is the perfect way to do that. Whitney breaks down stewardship into the proper use of time and money.Following stewardship, the author dives into a lesser performed discipline: fasting. Because of its unfamiliarity, he first explains it and then reminds us that it is expected and for a purpose. Going hand in hand with silence and solitude, Whitney has an easy entrance into the next chapter. He explains silence and solitude and gives valuable reasons for it. A useful tool in silence and solitude is journaling. After the explanation, Whitney shows us the value of and ways to journal.The last chapter before the \\"book end\\" is on the discipline of learning. The author reminds us that learning characterizes the wise person, fulfills the greatest commandment, and is essential for increased godliness. Learning is done mostly by discipline, not by accident and can be done in a variety of ways. The closing chapter encourages us to persevere in all of these disciplines. Whitney explains the role of the Holy Spirit, fellowship, and struggle in perseverance.There are not many books that can be read in which the reader has little to no disagreement with the author. Yet, this book is a great example of one. The author does a wonderful job of using the biblical texts to back up his arguments. Occasionally, the text he selects seems to be a bit of a stretch out of its context, but more often than not, he does a great job. His claims and arguments are very well supported when they come backed with relevant scripture.Many Christians tend to view these disciplines as necessary or even unnecessary evils. It is not uncommon to hear someone say they have to go have their daily prayer, have to go read their bible, or that a discipline such as fasting is no longer applicable. Personally, there have been times when I've read the Word only because I felt guilty if I did not. Whitney does an amazing job of reminding us that God expects us to do all of these things but he doesn't leave it at that. He then shows us how to joyfully apply these disciplines in our lives. It is hard to read the Scripture that Whitney cites without being convicted.Though all of the chapters are necessary and good, my favorites were bible intake, prayer, worship and stewardship. However, all of the disciplines resonate in my being. In respect to the author's theological position, it has been pointed out by some that he is obviously Calvinistic. The argument for this is that there are so many verses quoted that accentuate the sovereignty of God. Yet this does not present a problem for the book and its overall purpose. Even if the author does have a bend toward Calvinism, the disciplines are none the less applicable and pertinent, regardless of the readers belief on the topic.The applicability of this book may be questioned in the context of other cultures. However, the entire belief system of Christianity may be questioned in these same contexts but is no less true. With this in mind, we cannot simply disregard what scripture commands. If God expects us to fast, we should do so regardless of a culture's opinion on the topic. Using that example, most Americans find it strange when someone fasts but does that mean we should not do it? Absolutely not!There are many different books available on the topic of spiritual disciplines but without having read them, a comparison cannot easily be made. From recommendations, it is obvious that this book is highly regarded by many respected sources.As briefly mentioned earlier, the book is very easy to read and flows well. A person can read one chapter a day with ease and work on different topics accordingly. The book is also a great assistance for small group settings. It has been used as a supplement in many Sunday School classes and is applicable to Christians of various ages.Another thing that is enjoyable about the book is the way each chapter ends. Whitney gives a page or so to \\"more application.\\" In this section, he summarizes the chapter and reiterates our need to apply the specific discipline.Overall the book does a great job of making a person stop and think about the disciplines he or she is or is not currently doing. A person could be excellent with the discipline of bible intake, and yet have no concept of serving. This book reminds us of the importance of all the disciplines and encourages us to start at once."},{"Title":"Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life (Pilgrimage Growth Guide)","review":"This very practical and readable book should be required reading for all Christians desiring to grow in their faith.

Questions that one might even lie to themselves about.When we strip away the veil that we all tend to hide behind from time to time, when we look in the mirror honestly, we see that Jesus Christ is not manifest in our lives the way that He must be.Donald S.

Overall, it was a fair book - you probably won't enjoy it much but you'll benefit from what it says, if you put it into practice."},{"Title":"Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life (Pilgrimage Growth Guide)","review":"A word that is completely foreign to most 21st century American ears is \\"discipline\\". We know what the word means; we just don't like to see it in action. One has to look no further than the current economic crisis to see how much we eschew the word. Regardless of the scapegoatism employed by the government and the media, the economic slide has its roots in lack of personal discipline by American consumers. But we don't want to hear that. We would rather hear how it's the government or AIG's fault. It is far easier to rail against an unknown employee's bonus money than it is to cut up our own credit card.Because of our distaste for personal accountability and discipline, I can imagine that this is not currently a very popular book. If that is the case, as with most things, popularity is no indication of value, because it is certainly a valuable book. In these days when occasional Sunday morning church attendance is the extent of Christian living, a book like this is needed.I must admit that the title is a turn-off. First, it is a turn-off to those for whom discipline is a four-letter word. Second, it is a turn-off to those of us who immediately think of pharisaical legalism when we think of spiritual disciplines. Although I fell into the second camp, I picked up the book at last year's SBC annual meeting anyway. I'm glad I did.Whitney's thesis is that godly people are disciplined people. He looks through history into the lives of heroes of the faith such as Augustine, Luther, Calvin, Bunyan, Wesley, Whitefield, Edwards, Spurgeon and Muller and sees that they all led disciplined lives. Because of that observation, he builds the book around 1 Timothy 4:7 and highlights ten spiritual disciplines to expound. Since the first discipline of Bible intake is also the foundational discipline, Whitney spends more time on it than the others. Of particular value is the kind of Bible intake that is most often overlooked--that of Scripture meditation. He takes great care to differentiate between meditation upon Scripture and the kind of new age meditation practiced in many circles today. Scripture meditation is concerned with filling the mind while new age meditation is obsessed with emptying it.Whitney creatively and thoroughly covers each discipline. He provides examples and illustrations while purposefully staying rooted and grounded in Scripture. I deeply appreciate the fact that when he lists a personal practice that he has extrapolated from sparse Scriptural support, he doesn't try to convince his readers of its validity. He simply states his practice, gives examples and moves on without trying to make his practice authoritative.The book is intensely practical without being a how-to book. It is a book of orthopraxy without being legalistic. It is about having a disciplined life without being ascetic. It succeeds in walking the fine line the author intended. It is up to the readers to maintain that same fine line in their own lives."},{"Title":"Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life (Pilgrimage Growth Guide)","review":"Few books have proven to be as practical to me as Spiritual Disciplines For the Christian Life.

I'm only 17 and I can respond to this book, so you should too."},{"Title":"Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life (Pilgrimage Growth Guide)","review":"Folks: Dr. Whitley hit a homerun with this one. He identifies in 13 chapters exactly why the Western Church is filled with problems, lethargy, and even heresy at times. But he does more than just identify the problem, he gives an answer for every believer to first fix himself, and then spread this cure. If you are serious about loving God, if you want more, but don't know how to get there, if your church lacks a mentorship or disciple program, this is your book. Dr. Whitney does not sugar coat anything, and rest assured following these disciplines to be more godly require work. This is not a works argument; far from it, but a willingness by the believer to serve the most amazing God who deserves nothing less than His creation's love, worship, and obedience. May this book convict, edify, and bless every church in America and the world."},{"Title":"Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life (Pilgrimage Growth Guide)","review":"Whitney's book is a classic on the subject of spiritual disciplines. From the start of the book to the end the purpose of the disciplines is made crystal clear - \\"Discipline yourself for the purpose of godliness\\" (I Tim 4:7, NASB). The book starts with an analogy for the freedom that discipline can bring - learning to play a musical instrument. Without a goal such practice is meaningless, or as Whitney puts it in the opening line of the book \\"Discipline without direction is drudgery.\\" He is careful to point out that the disciplines do not by their merit nor direct action earn grace or produce godliness. That alone is God's role, but spiritual disciplines allow us to place ourselves in the path of God's grace. The disciplines are one tool of many (including other people, and circumstances) that God uses to produce in us greater godliness. There is a paradox that when we bind ourselves with discipline, the result is increasing freedom.Of all the disciplines Whitney refers to the intake of God's word as the most important; nothing can substitute for it. \\"There simply is no healthy Christian life apart from a diet of the milk and meat of Scripture.\\" In addition to Bible intake, he covers prayer, worship, evangelism, serving, stewardship, fasting, silence and solitude, journaling, and learning. Whitney ties in each discipline he to godliness and freedom. This book is also available in Kindle edition and an excellent audiobook format. For another solid book on spiritual disciplines, aimed at busy people with little time to practice the disciplines and even less time to read a book on them, seeSimplify Your Spiritual Life: Spiritual Disciplines for the Overwhelmed."},{"Title":"Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life (Pilgrimage Growth Guide)","review":"I have had this book for 10 years. Each time I read this book, I am convicted to lead a more spiritually disciplined life. It helps me place my focus on Christ and not worldy things. I encourage every Christ follower to read it often."},{"Title":"Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life (Pilgrimage Growth Guide)","review":"Spiritual Disciplines by Whitney is one of the best books I have read in a long time. It is easy to read, straight forward and to the point, and covers topics every Christian needs to know. This book has been the inspiration I needed to do what I should have been doing all along.Whitney addresses reading your bible, meditating on scripture, prayer, worship, evangelism, serving, stewardship, fasting, solitude, journaling, learning and perserverance in the above disciplines. Whitey gets right down to business and matter-of-factly explains what each discipline entails, why it's important and how to get started or improve upon it. He backs his recommendations with appropriate scripture references and other solid sources, and he uses memorable stories that paint lasting visual images to drive home the main points. Some of them - like the shelf full of unread bibles - really 'get you where you live', yet he doesn't guilt you into obedience, but rather he inspires you into a great relationship with the Lord.I made a profession of faith at the tender age of 10 and have been a Christian for years, but I never really developed the disciplines like I should have. How many years I wasted! Sometimes I find myself unsure of things and need someone to 'spell it out' for me. This book did just that. If you have been imitating other Christians and yet find yourself feeling like you are just going through the motions and wondering what it's really all about, this book makes everything clear. You'll kick yourself for not figuring it out because it's so simple, yet you'll be glad you finally understand what everyone else seems to naturally know.Most people, upon making a profession of faith, receive a gift bible. If churches whould also hand them a copy of this book to go with it, we'd have a lot more Christians out there living like they ought to live."},{"Title":"Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life (Pilgrimage Growth Guide)","review":"This book lists excuses and breaks down the how-to's of growing as a Christian.

In this helpful book Whitney teaches us that the Christian should look like Christ. And the way to look like Christ is through through Spiritual Disciplines.What are Spiritual Disciplines? I'll let Whitney himself explain: 'The Spiritual Disciplines are those personal and corporate disciplines that promote spiritual growth. They are the habits of devotion and experiential Christianity that have been practiced by the people of God since biblical times. This book examines the Spiritual Disciplines of Bible intake, prayer, worship, evangelism, service, stewardship, fasting, silence and solitude, journaling, and learning. This is by no means, however, an exhaustive list of the Disciplines of Christian living...Whatever the Discipline, its most important feature is its purpose. Just as there is little value in practicing the scales on a guitar or piano apart from the purpose of playing music, there is little value in practicing Spiritual Discipline apart from the single purpose that unites them (Colossians 2:20-23, 1 Tim 4:8). That purpose is godliness. Thus we are told in 1 Tim 4:7 to discipline ourselves \\"for the purpose of godliness\\"...Godly people are disciplined people. It has always been so. Call to mind some heroes of church history - Augustine, Martin Luther, John Calvin, John Bunyan, Susanna Wesley, George Whitefield, Lady Huntingdon, Jonathan and Sarah Edwards, Charles Spurgeon, George Muller - they were all disciplined people. In my own pastoral and person Christian experience, I can say that I've never known a man or woman who came to spiritual maturity except through discipline.'This book will help encourage you to change your life from one of sinful chaos to one of orderly growth in godliness."},{"Title":"Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life (Pilgrimage Growth Guide)","review":"This book is the best book I have read on the subject of spiritual discipline so far. It is Bible based and filled with practical application. It presents the Christian disciplines in a way that is not legalistic.

I definately recommend this book to any that desires to become more spiritually mature."},{"Title":"Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life (Pilgrimage Growth Guide)","review":"This book is a solid read and works well as a go-to-guide to spiritual disicplines.

I highly recommend this book for anyone wishing to move from merely knowing about God to deeply experiencing Him."},{"Title":"Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life (Pilgrimage Growth Guide)","review":"I almost always carry a journal or notebook with me so I can scribble down thoughts as they come to me during the day. Some of these turn into articles and others turn into devotional material. More often than not I look at them weeks or months later and have absolutely no idea what they mean or what I was thinking when I scribbled them down. Recently I saw a comment in a notebook that did make sense to me. I had written about the difference between my friend Jason and myself when we sit down with a guitar on our laps and a sheet of music in front of us. I can read the music and strum those strings and make nothing but awful, painful sounds that bear little resemblance to music. Jason, on the other hand, can sit down and make music at will, even with no sheet music in front of him. The difference between Jason and myself is not necessarily inate musical ability or the quality of our guitars. The difference is in disciplined practice. Jason has dedicated thousands of hours to honing his skills so that it seems to require little effort to play the music. The freedom to play with this skill has come only at the expense of dedicated, disciplined effort.Don Whitney uses this same metaphor to show the importance of being disciplined in the pursuit of godliness, for there is freedom in discipline. The freedom to grow in godliness - \\"to naturally express Christ's character through your own personality - is in large part dependent on a deliberate cultivation of the spiritual disciplines.\\" (From the back cover)And so this book is an examination of spiritual disciplines - disciplines provided by God which are designed to help us grow in godliness, allowing us to become more and more conformed to the image of Christ. The disciplines Whitney writes about are:* Bible intake* Prayer* Worship* Evangelism* Serving* Stewardship* Fasting* Silence and solitude* Journalling* LearningThe book is prefaced with an examination of the reason for disciplining ourselves in the spiritual disciplines and Whitney teaches here that we are to do all things for God's glory. Because God requires each of these disciplines of us, there is danger in neglecting any of them. Each of the disciplines is then examined in the light of bringing glory to God through them. The book closes with encouragment in persevering in the disciplines, even in the inevitable times of spiritual dryness.Each of the disciplines is drawn from and examined in the light of Scripture. The author shows how the Biblical basis for each discipline, explains how it will help the Christian grow in godliness and provides practical suggestions for beginning the practice. Each chapter closes with a section entitled \\"More Application\\" where the reader is challenged to put these practices info effect in his life.One of my favorite aspects about Whitney's writings, in this book and his others, is that he draws heavily from the Puritans and from other great Christians of the past. This is especially important in a discussion of spiritual disciplines as these are practices that were regarded more highly in the past than they are today. When we examine such practices, there is much to learn from these great believers.While the vast majority of sources cited in this book are from Puritan and other Reformed authors, there were several references to Richard Foster. I questioned Whitney about this and he replied as follows: \\"...since it was not an academic book, I didn't want the emphasis to be critical (in the academic sense), but rather simply to set forth in practical ways what I thought the Biblical teaching on the subjects to be, and to find good supportive quotations. Occasionally it served my purposes to quote Foster. But I never tried to sound as approvingly of him when I quoted him as I did with most other writers. For instance, I never said something like, 'As the GREAT Richard Foster said,'...it was before Foster had started Renovare and before he had tipped his hand on some other matters.\\" He also referred me to a couple of article he has written which show his thoughts on Christian mysticism (link and link 2). Lest I make a mountain of a molehill, I was completely satisfied with Whitney's answer and in no way do I feel that his references to Foster's work detracts from the powerful message in Spiritual Disciplines For The Christian Life. I merely did not wish to have people see the references to Foster in the bibliography and be scared away from a wonderful book.I found this book powerful and above all, convicting. Because it is so Biblical, continually returning to the Word of God, it allowed the Spirit to act and convict me in areas of my life where I have become lax. While I rejoice that God has allowed me to become disciplined in some areas of life, I know now that there are many others where I must make changes, lest I stunt my spiritual growth. I highly recommend this book for private or group study (Please note that there is an associated study guide which can be purchased seperately)."},{"Title":"Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life (Pilgrimage Growth Guide)","review":"Donald Whitney is now a professor at a large midwestern seminary but was a local pastor when he wrote this excellent book. I mention that to say this was written out of practical experience and not as some thesis or doctoral work with no bearing on reality.It is extremely readable, practical and applicable. An individual can read it alone and benefit wonderfully from it, or can also use the book in a discussion book and find it equally rewarding.The Disciplines are ancient as avenues to express one's Christian life, but for modern audiences Richard Foster's Celebration of Discipline was the hearkening call back to their practice. Dallas Willard's book followed several years later called The Spirit of the Disciplines, a &quot;why&quot; and rationale for the Disciplines. Whitney's book is the practical way to incorporate the Disciplines into one's everyday life, to escape the discuss and do nothing mode of many so called believers, and actually change one's life.I heartily recommend the book.

He unites the best of both of these fine authors--the bold practicality of Foster and the theological precision of Willard.In \\"Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life,\\" Whitney develops the classical Protestant teaching on the means for tapping into Christ's resurrection power. Like an experienced athletic coach, Whitney offers a spiritual workout routine that each reader can format into a personalized plan for growth in grace.Integrating scriptural wisdom, historic practice, Puritan theology, and relevant illustrations, Whitney weaves together a mosaic of \\"the habits of devotion and experiential Christianity that have been practiced by the people of God since biblical times\\" (p. 15, \\"Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life\\").After anchoring his theory in theology (chapter one), Whitney explains ten classic spiritual disciplines: Bible intake, prayer, worship, evangelism, serving, stewardship, fasting, silence/solitude, journaling, and learning. Wisely, he emphasizes the core purpose of each discipline: godliness, Christlikeness. Knowing human nature well, he concludes his study with exhortations to perseverance in the disciplines.Written a decade-and-a-half ago, \\"Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life\\" remains relevant and required reading for anyone wanting to know how and why to practice the spiritual disciplines. One could only hope that Willard might now write a companion volume teaching how to practice some of the less frequently practiced historic disciplines such as Sabbath rest, holy listening, confession, secrecy, chastity, and submission.Reviewer: Dr. Robert W.

I would probably rate it in the top three that I have read during this time and I am a very avid reader.This book is about change. We can live our day to day lives and never experience any growth, but this book will definitely include change and growth in a believer's life.I am going to recommend it to my pastor, minister of education and music minister and any other believer I come in contact with that is serious about growing in their Christian life.The only reason I came across this book was I was cleaning and found it and it looked interesting.

I have read it once and am currently reading it again. As I page through it and gaze over the applicable lessons, the pointed truths, the relevance to life, the personal illustrations and more, I am driven with desire to conform my life to Jesus all the more! Dr. Whitney is completely without apology in presenting several disciplines that all Christians should follow, backing up each with several Scriptures to demonstrate the authority of what it is he is writing.I attended Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary where Dr. Whitney serves as Professor of Spiritual Formation. He is what he makes himself out to be in his book. He is a humble man, desiring that God be honored and glorified and that men and women grown in Christ-likeness. He is truly one of the most Godly men I have ever met and I am honored and priviliged to have sat under his teaching. God blessed me through him and his teaching tremendously.Why do I say this? This book is the foundation of everything he teaches, for his desire is indeed Godliness for himself and those he teaches, either in person or in absentia through the books he writes.If you indeed have desire to grow in Jesus Christ, no matter how long you have been a Christian, my strong recommendation is to buy this book and read it carefully. You indeed will be blessed!!"},{"Title":"Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life (Pilgrimage Growth Guide)","review":"Whitney's book meets a need that is not met by any of the other books on the disciplines. I found this book to be a valuable companion and balance to Celebration of Discipline by Richard Foster and to similar works by Dallas Willard on the classic disciplines. Like the others, Whitney writes clearly and his insights are very motivating. But his many illustrations by early Puritan practitioners of the disciplines stands apart and makes it very clear that practicing the disciplines was a mainstay for believers in more than the Mystic or other Christian traditions. Make no mistake, I deeply appreciate Celebration by Foster and am greatly appreciative of Willard's writings. But I feel much more confident in recommending Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life by Whitney to new believers because all of the references are from those with which I have much closer theological affinity. Whitney's work is an excellent primer and very accessible to readers of all levels.Whitney's approach is very practical. His insights are profound and it is clear that his understanding of the disciplines has grown out of many years of practice and ongoing study of others who have labored to live them.

You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life (Pilgrimage Growth Guide)","review":"In the past I have not been too thrilled to read or hear about spiritual disciplines.

But this book presents the spiritual disciplines (Bible reading and meditation, Scripture memorization, prayer, stewardship, evangelism, etc.) in such a way that not only do I have a clear understanding of why they're so necessary to Christian growth, but I also am so tremendously inspired to do them! They've changed in my perspective from being things I *ought* to do to being things I *want* to do (and *can* do). I frequently read Christian books and have taken a lot of discipleship courses, but I don't know when I've learned so much in such a short period of time. This man is an incredible teacher.

But Dr. Whitney's book effectively provides great insight into the Biblical foundations of the disciplines. In fact, the disciplines espoused herein are Biblically based and taught, modeled, and reinforced through the teachings in Scripture. Each chapter deals with a different discipline, the first two chapters being the exception. The disciplines are expounded upon by the author with one oft repeated purpose, \\"for the purpose of Godliness.\\" Whitney's theology is conservative, but no hint of denominational dogma or creedalism comes out in the book, it is simply a Biblically based work.The book also offers ample examples from outside the Bible as well.

These are: Bible intake, prayer, worship, evangelism, serving, stewardship, fasting, silence and solitude, journaling, and learning.There are numerous nuggets of wisdom that can be found throughout the book. What I enjoyed (and respected Dr. Whitney for doing) was that he not only drew off his own understanding and ample passages in scripture, but he drew heavily off other Christian giants by quoting them frequently. Undoubtedly, Dr. Whitney is very well read and skillfully uses quotes, stories, and experiences of these men and women to help make his point.The only words that are quoted more often than respected believers are the words of scripture. He does a very good job of using God's Word to emphasize and support the discipline being discussed. I could not find one instance where he misuses a verse to suit his own agenda. My book is now ripe with highlighted bible passages. (In fact, I'll be using this book as a reference to find future passages to memorize!)My biblical understanding and desire to strive to become more like Christ was (and is) has been sharpened through the reading of this book. We are saved by grace through faith alone, but we are also required to witness and live out our love for God just as Jesus did."},{"Title":"Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life (Pilgrimage Growth Guide)","review":"I would recommend this book to any believer, at any stage of their walk.

It took until 2011, but a few days ago, I opened it and read it again. This exceptional book could be a benefit to any Christian hoping to grow in their Christian walk. His key verse is \\"Discipline yourself for the purpose of godliness\\" (1 Timothy 4:7). Whitney covers 11 different disciplines, with 2 bookend summary chapters. Actually, this would be a perfect amount that the interested reader could cover a discipline a month throughout the year, with a month for wrap up.Quotable quotes:-So many professing Christians are so spiritually undisciplined that they seem to have little fruit and power in their lives (21).-Here then, is the real problem of our negligence. We fail in our duty to study God's word not so much because it is difficult to understand, not so much because it is dull and boring, but because it is work. Our problem is not a lack of intelligence or a lack of passion. Our problem is that we are lazy. -Sproul (36).-Scripture memory is like reinforcing steel to a sagging faith (43).-One of the reasons for a lack of godliness is prayerlessness (66).-Focusing on the world more than on the Lord makes us more worldly than godly (95).There are many others, though I hope you will all discipline yourself and read this book to discover them for yourself."},{"Title":"Calling in the Night","review":"Calling in the Night has seventy-six different parts to it. Some are for children who are innocent and easy-going, the others are for adults who are outspoken and honest about problems and desires. You will most likely read this book through once, probably in five hours or so, then go back and read parts of it here and there many more times. I think about the stories throughout my day, then I return to the book and read them again at night. They stay with you and in my opinion that's what makes a great book!"},{"Title":"Calling in the Night","review":"Plaza Literary SocietySheila Zallis-Vice PresidentReview for Calling in the NightAs the holidays approach, and we find that we have less and less time to read long and complicated novels, the idea of an enjoyable and compelling story in the form of many short stories becomes more and more attractive to us. Promoted as a collection of stories to be kept on the nightstand and read before bed, Calling in the Night not only lives up to its intention, but also offers an unexpected surprise: real emotion.As with most books that are an assortment of short stories, essays and verse, your first instinct will be to just open up the book, pick one section and read it. Do not pay attention to such instincts. Calling in the Night not only has a theme for each section of the book, but it also has an overall theme that will be missed if you do not read the book in sequence from page one to page 205. After you read the book through once, then go back and read your favorite sections as much as you like.Right from the beginning we learn of \\"a voice in this silence.\\" What is the voice? What is it saying? Who is \\"everyone\\" and why is It talking to them?Different readers will probably come to different conclusions about who the \\"voice\\" is. Based on the dedication at the beginning of the book, I believe it to be God or another spiritual being. Other readers might conclude that it is a person's sanity or mentality. Still others might decide it is the vocalization of emotion, instinct, or morals. Others yet might think it is the author's grandfather whose spirit lingers throughout the pages of the book. The possibilities, amusingly, change shape while you read.As a collection, Calling in the Night, simply put, is a book about life. Michele Geraldi blends physical life with spiritual life. On one page you read about how mad a person gets when he/she is almost run over by a car. On the next page, you read about being inside one of Holman Hunt's paintings. On the next page, you read about a man so scorned by his lover's betrayal that he threatens to kill the man she is cheating with. On another page you read about waiting after school for \\"Him\\" (God), so \\"He\\" can be followed \\"home\\" rather than just taking the bus. There are \\"lessons\\" about raising children, dating, forgiving yourself and others, judging people, and learning how to recognize God's smile, voice and handwriting. There are stories about classic movies, plays and books such as The Great Gatsby, The Phantom of the Opera, and It's A Wonderful Life. There are poems meant for Christmas and Valentine's Day. There are stories about baseball stadiums, players, and games. The author's \\"resume\\" at the end of the book details her friendships, her loves, her dreams (and actually says nothing about education, job experience, or anything else on a typical resume).Although it is safe to assume that the beginning and end of Calling in the Night is written through the eyes of the author, Michele Geraldi (when she talks about the \\"voice\\" and when she writes her resume), it would be foolish to assume that the book itself is autobiographical. In fact, \\"The Sound of Forever\\" talks about \\"my bride.\\" This is just another ability that Michele Geraldi performs so interstingly: the creative capacity to go inside the mind of someone and write from that person's perspective.All in all, the most refreshing quality that Michele Geraldi possesses as a writer is her ability to keep everything real. She is confident about what she writes (her beliefs, etc.), but she does not say, \\"This is what you have to believe, too.\\" She is insightful and makes strong statements in many of the quotes, stories and poems, but she is also unafraid to write about the emotions that make us human; jealousy, irritation, anger, hate. She is not out to save the world with her writing, but instead out to display the parts of life that most people experience, but few people acknowledge and express."},{"Title":"Calling in the Night","review":"You really feel like you get more than what you pay for when you read Calling in the Night. There are stories within this book that cater to your every mood and desire. Feeling angry? Sentimental? Passionate? Turn the page and there you have another and another lovely chapter full of love, insight and observation. In fact, if one word could describe the stories in this book, it would probably be \\"observant.\\" There are huge events written about that are picked apart to the very last detail, and there are small, almost nothing-type events that are observed and written about until they are huge and meaningful. Really a very observant and nicely written book that is worthy of a solid five stars."},{"Title":"Calling in the Night","review":"I received Calling in the Night as a 3-book birthday gift from my daughter, and I must say I have found the book to be extremely charming. With so many different facets (poems, essays, stories, quotes), it is a difficult collection to summarize, but I think it's important to note that a large part of the book has a spiritual and/or religious tone, as well as a very moderate politically conservative tone. That being said, since I have the same viewpoints, I was able to identify with the stories very easily. The stories and poems about love (and lost love) moved me to tears. Anyone who has felt these emotions will be affected by these stories. I also really enjoyed the life lessons because, even though they were lessons I have learned once or twice before, I was never able to condense their meaning into one short paragraph, like Michele J. Geraldi has at the end of each lesson. My favorite part of Calling in the Night, however, is the intended audience. As I read, I got the distinct feeling that the author was writing for one person and one person alone, God, and I appreciated that so much that it came to the point where I felt privillaged to share in that special purpose."},{"Title":"Calling in the Night","review":"Calling in the Night is a cute book that I am glad I found. Most of the book is sweet, about love and innocence, etc., but other parts are more serious and real about disliking someone, or not forgiving a bad person, etc. Just a really comprehensive collection of human feelings that is easy to identify with."},{"Title":"Calling in the Night","review":"I am delighted to have read this book and will find delight in reading it again very soon. Recommended to all!"},{"Title":"Calling in the Night","review":"Calling in the Night: A Book Worth KeepingBy Deidre Kramer July 20, 2005Rating: ANotes: Exceptional Work; Highly Recommended; A Very Enjoyable ReadLet's face it: there are millions of books out there, and hundreds more are being published all the time. Every summer, though, we as consumers really only hear about a small handful of the books that are released. We knew for months that the sixth installment of Harry Potter was going to be released in July. We also knew that a new James Patterson book was coming out. Sue Monk Kidd's The Mermaid Chair--her follow up novel to The Secret Life of Bees--came out a few months ago and has been all the rage around the literary world. But have you ever heard about an author named Michele Geraldi or a book titled Calling in the Night? I doubt that you have, but you definitely WILL. Calling in the Night obviously does not have the same publicity as the better known books of the summer, but it has just as much heart and soul as any other book on the market today, if not more.On the cover, you see the blurry image of a young woman, under a blanket, holding a stuffed animal, and staring at the close and complicated full blue moon. All at once the girl seems forlorn, curious, dreamy, reflective, worried, anxious and excited. She obviously can't sleep, and the reader is instantly led to wonder why? The table of contents is called \\"The Dusk\\" and it contains about seventy-five different titles. \\"Inspiration\\", \\"God's Goo\\", \\"As I Love You\\", \\"The Miniature Train\\", \\"Lesson #1\\", \\"Candlestick Park\\", \\"Orphan\\", \\"Gatsby\\", \\"Teddy's Future\\", \\"Gray Sky!\\", \\"Golden Clock\\", and \\"Old Man at the Lagoon\\" are just a few pieces in this vast and elaborate collection of different styles and emotions. The first piece is simply titled \\"2:55\\". It is four paragraphs that are apparently written to the stuffed animal on the cover of the book, and it talks about the nighttime sky, how it ignites many questions, and how it is silent and calm but least of all lonely.From there, we turn to the title poem, \\"Calling in the Night\\". It is the story of a woman who has been closed off from emotion for \\"eighty-thousand days\\" until one day a golden-haired young man comes into her life and makes her feel something again. They fall for one another and plan to get married, settle down, and live the life that everyone seems to want. But it's not enough for the girl; it is not HER dream. When she is visited by \\"my child\\" (her younger self), she realizes that her life is not meant for marriage yet because her dreams have not been realized. She vows to explore the dreams, listen to \\"the voice\\", and write about all that she encounters. And she encounters a lot of different scenarios!Michele Geraldi is from Northern California and many of the pieces in Calling in the Night take place in San Francisco. \\"All Aboard\\" is about the ghosts of three blue-collar workers, all of whom worked in the Fishermen's Wharf area of the city. \\"Sound of Forever\\" is a beautiful love story that takes place in the Presidio and Crissy Field areas of San Francisco; it welds the present with the past when it talks about World War II, the 1915 World's Fair, the beaches, the trees, and the businesses that stand there today.There are roughly five poems in this collection that are about The Phantom of the Opera. One is written through the eyes of the Phantom. Another is about Christine. Yet another is written through the eyes of one of Raul's servants. There is even one poem written from the perspective of someone who wants to help the Phantom, someone who wants to love him when Christine will not. Any Phantom fan will love these pieces. There are also several pieces written about baseball. One is about Dave Dravecky, a Giants pitcher who suffered Cancer in the late 1980's. The other is about a young woman who doesn't know anything about baseball but goes to the game to feel closer to the past she shared with her father.There are seven \\"Lessons\\" in Calling in the Night. They are short stories about a variety of different situations and the \\"lesson\\" comes at the very end of the story, like a moral at the end of a children's book. Other pieces in the book are about pregnancy, overcast days, an untrustworthy make-believe friend, baby pictures, curious children, famous paintings, Christmas, Valentines Day, war, American military, trying to retain youth, Easter, wanting the impossible, meetings with God, Pope John Paul II, writing a resume about your life, a wedding speech, a Christmas card poem, and prayers. There is definitely a strong spiritual aspect to Calling in the Night. It is clear that the author is Christian, but she does not impose any one particular belief on the reader. She simply maintains an overall suggestion that God is in everything, especially the silence of the night.There are so many different ideas and themes in Calling in the Night that by reading a review alone the reader may come to wonder, \\"How can this work? Isn't it chaotic?\\"The answer is: It works. Similar to the night sky, where so many different things are happening and moving and changing at the same time, Calling in the Night comes together to form an exciting, multi-dimensional, and still somewhat mysterious body of work.Calling in the Night is the first book in Michele Geraldi's Nightstand Narrative Series. The next is scheduled to be released in the Summer of 2006. If the following books can be as beautiful and artistic as Calling in the Night, Michele J. Geraldi's books will be highly anticipated and appreciated for many years to come."},{"Title":"Calling in the Night","review":"Not your run-of-the-mill book. Some sections are autobiographical, some are not. Some parts are fiction, some are not. Some parts are written through a woman, some a man, some a child, and so forth.

Maybe the lessons she is trying to pass on I have learned a long time ago. Things like it's not O.K. to tease or take advantage of another person. . . Just disappointing. Maybe it is a good read for someone who hasn't done a great deal of living yet."},{"Title":"Single in Saudi","review":"The author begins with the statement that she has probably spiced up the material a lot.

Bold, adventourous and at times just a little plain crazy, this woman navigated her way through humble Saudi homes and opulent palaces with equal aplomb. Unlike many of her Western counterparts who never left their Westernized componds, she engaged in meeting the countries residents- some very kind, some a bit scary, but she kept her cool and navigated the unknown when an opportunity presented itself to travel to Mecca, a forbidden city to non-Muslims and managed to pull off many other adventures under the guise of the veil that her Western co-workers would never have contemplated.She certainly had some adventures, took advantage of the \\"forbidden\\" liquor that was so prevalent, smoked hash hish w/ princes and just generally had a great time in the late 70's and early 80's before the strict Wahabbi religious rulers took over and imposed the very strict rules now so prevalent in Saudi today.She describes these adventures, her nursing challenges and the many sexual encounters she enccountered, but often rebuffed, as well as her travels to over 25 foreign countries during her tenure as a 30 year old blonde, single blue eyed nurse working in the formidable Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Take yourself off to a different culture, a different time and a definite adventure, as this story has all of those components.Single in Saudi"},{"Title":"Everything I Know I Learned at the Movies: A Compilation of Cliche's and Un-Truisms Gleaned from a Lifetime Spent Entirely Too Much in the Dark","review":"This book (as the subtitle says) is a humorous collections of cliches and un-truisms that can be gathered from watching movies.

Each statement has a picture from a movie beside it that illustrates what is said.

He only neglected one important detail - securing the Princess' agreement first. When Julia reads of her impending nuptials in a newspaper, outrage does not begin to cover the gamut of emotions she feels.Julia vows she will never marry the son of her father's sworn enemy. The accusations and counter-accusations between the Kamals and the Sebastianis prevents anyone from knowing the truth of the origin of the family feud. Despite his father's feelings, Prince Rashid vows to end the family feud. If he must investigate the past to secure a future with the Princess, then so be it. The peace between two countries depends upon his destermination.Author Alexandra Sellers brings her remarkable talent for writing about the sexy men of the desert to bear once again in BORN ROYAL, the concluding novel of the Firstborn Sons continuity. Prince Rashid is every woman's dream: intelligent, sexy and romantic. He keeps proposing again and again, despite the very public headlines about the princess' refusal. His match in every way, Princess Julia provides a delightful, if hardheaded, counterpart.Further, Sellers approaches the challenges of writing the concluding segment even as she introduces another series with aplomb. The careful tying up of loose ends as well as seamless inclusion of preparatory details never interrupts the flow of the narrative. In addition, BORN ROYAL takes several delightful twists that make it an exciting and dynamic read. Tempestuous, tempting and sinful, BORN ROYAL comes very highly recommended."},{"Title":"The epigrams of Martial (Bohn's classical library)","review":"Martial, like many of the Latin poets, was born in Bibilis, Spain, probably around 38-41 AD. He appears to have lived in Rome for nearly thirty-four years, under the patronage of the great Spaniard Senaca the Younger. He belonged to a class of intellectuals who were in resolute opposition to the emperor Domitian, so many times figures like Cicero, Brutus, and Pompey are used as literary devices against the crazed tyrant. Martial's poems are definitely modeled off of Catullus' epigrams and elegiac verses, although they are different in meaning and theme. These poems are hilarious and audacious, cruel, lewd, charming, spiteful, and creative; and they bring to life the social and political milieu of Rome. Martial's poems make for great bedtime reading and they are at their best when read in small doses. Michie's Anglo-cized translation, with a parallel Latin text, is good, however the rhyming couplet certainly does Martial's epigrams a grave injustice. The poems are excellent, although another translation is recommended; but another one will be hard to find which remains faithful to the original. The Loeb editions are always great, but the translators nearly always kill the original poetic song with dry early-twentieth-century prose."},{"Title":"The epigrams of Martial (Bohn's classical library)","review":"This book is a pleasant and often amusing read, a nice mix of day to day observations, occasional spice, certainly cheap at twice the price."},{"Title":"The epigrams of Martial (Bohn's classical library)","review":"Firstly, let me say that I am not an expert in Latin, though I am certaintly able to read it, understand it, and also know a little about its literary techniques. One of the most grating errors I have found in this translation is the continual rhyming of its lines. Latin, being a language of often mutable word ending but even more amorphous word order, had no need to rhyme its verse, and therefore any translation, in English, that insists on rhyming for any purpose usually obfuscates the original meaning so much that it is, in of itself, a whole different poem.I have also seen the ommission of many names in the work, which I find unappealing. While I do enjoy that it is able to combine the original latin with the english translation, I would recommend searching for a similar book with a better translator: it will make the epigrams far more enjoyable."},{"Title":"The epigrams of Martial (Bohn's classical library)","review":"This is a very poor translation. Martial is a lively, urbane poet with a razor-sharp wit; his language is precise and powerful. James Michie's translation is insipid as poetry, and often unrecognizable when set next to the Latin. A single example: Mr. Michie has a penchant for translating simple Latin words like \\"terra\\" into configurations like \\"turf and dew,\\" rather than the obvious and elegantly simple \\"earth.\\" In Michie's translation, Martial's more beautiful elegiac lyrics are made gaudy and his urban bullets of observation become flaccid. Get the Loeb Martial and a good dictionary and work through the epigrams yourself. You will be better served by Loeb's literal translation than something that sounds as if it were written by a mediocre pre-Raphaelite poet."},{"Title":"\\"Henry Herbes, come on over\\": A history of the German Emigrant, Henry Herbes, 1840-1901","review":"All I know of this book is that it has a lot of family history, and it is very hard to find.

This book gives the fruits of a fifteen-year journey through the world's religious traditions, learning how to pray for the whole world effectively. The chapters describe various approaches to praying for global transformation including: petitioning Divine Mother and the Holy Spirit, the Native American Four Direction Ceremony, the esotericists' Shamballa Force, and the practice of invocation which he says brings a tangible and sometimes overwhelming cascade of spiritual light. Written with enthusiasm and clearsightedness, this book is a clarion call to global service and will change the way you think about praying for the world.Also by this author: The Soul and the Ascension; Suns Beyond Suns; The Ancient Light; A Wanderer in the Spirit Lands (editor)."},{"Title":"Current Surgical Therapy","review":"If you only have time to read one book, this is the one.

Knew nothing about it, and sled dogs are not my dog-of-choice, but was immediately compelled to buy it even tho it cost more than I'd planned. Amazingly full of good information, understanding of dogs and pulling, but there was a twinkle in the eye of the author, too. Imagine the runway team surrounding the ice-fisherman and eating all his catch!The illustrations too are extraordinary. Such obvious awareness of the inner workings of dogs is unusual. The expressions of each dog are wonderful.Highest recommendation for sled-dog enthusiast or any dog person, young or old."},{"Title":"Born to Pull","review":"&quot;Born to Pull&quot; was recommended to me by the owner of the kennel where our family would be going for our first mushing experience. Though aimed at upper elementary kids, the amount of information is amazing. The illustrations enhance the content beautifully; particularly stunning is a painting of a team pulling under the Northern Lights.Most enjoyable are the stories interspersed throughout; stories from well-known mushers such as Gary Paulsen and Jamie Nelson. Stories of dogs that decided to run the wrong way at the end of a race, and of dogs who found the way home in a raging storm.Reading this book did not guarantee that I would not wipe out on the sled, but when I did, I knew just what the snow hook was!"},{"Title":"Born to Pull","review":"&quot;Born to Pull&quot; was a joyous surprise.

Even die-hard Cary fans will be moved by the stories of mushers and their dogs.This is a beautifully put-together book. It even feels good to hold. The centerpiece is the collection of great stories.

However, I did find a few things that were not to great. First of all, when describing the Alaskan Malamute, the illustration had a pure black dog... Malamutes are NEVER pure black, they can be all white but that's the only exception for all one color, the only labeled pic of malamutes are an all white and all black, no markings! They also had very vague info on them. Malamute's real name is ALASKAN MALAMUTE, no where in the book did it say ALASKAN in front of malamute, well howcome you put SIBERIAN and ALASKAN in front of the husky? And two, I got a pup this August and I'm going to start training, so I read the chapter called &quot;How to train Sled Dogs&quot; it had absolutely nothing about training them except for, start training as pups!

Great inspiration."},{"Title":"\\"In the Days of Serfdom\\" and Other Stories (Pine Street Books)","review":"This collection consists of the 1863 novella \\"Polikoushka\\" (which the Maudes chose to translate as \\"In the Days of Serfdom\\") and the stories \\"A Prayer,\\" \\"Korney Vasilyev,\\" \\"Strawberries,\\" \\"Why?\\" and \\"God's Way and Man's,\\" each written in 1905 or 1906. It might seem an odd choice to juxtapose works written over 40 years apart, especially since Tolstoy's great religious conversion--generally seen as the major dividing line in his writing career--took place around 1880, but there's actually more continuity here than one might expect.\\"Polikoushka\\" deals with events surrounding the recruitment of troops from an estate into the army. A member of a peasant family is chosen as the estate's last recruit instead of the title character, a domestic serf, but a tragedy that occurs to Polikoushka changes the course of things. \\"A Prayer\\" is Tolstoy's brief attempt to come to terms with the tragedy of a child's death. \\"Korney Vasilyev\\" deals with a man who returns home to make amends many years after crippling his daughter and leaving his wife upon learning of his wife's adultery. \\"Strawberries\\" sets the idle chatter of liberal aristocrats against the simple life of the berry-gathering peasant children living near them. \\"Why?\\" tells the story of a Polish revolutionary who is sent to Siberia and of the woman who joins him there to marry him and some years later tries to escape with him. \\"God's Way and Man's\\" is about two imprisoned 1870's radicals, one of whom finds peace in Tolstoy's Sermon on the Mount-based version of Christianity shortly before his execution, and the other of whom is shattered to learn of the futility of his revolutionary pursuits.All of these works show Tolstoy's impressive sensitivity toward his characters, and we see much of his disillusionment with the artificial customs of Russian life, from the pointless meeting of the steward with the proprietress in \\"Polikoushka\\" to the absurd wording of the death sentence in \\"God's Way and Man's.\\" \\"Polikoushka\\" is unusual among Tolstoy's pre-conversion work for focusing on peasants, which helps it seem at home among his later works. As for the other five stories, although by the time he wrote them Tolstoy had come to believe that the only worthwhile purpose of art was to provide a clear moral and infect the audience with the spirit of brotherly love, these stories (especially the longer ones) are really more nuanced than that. Just as Tolstoy had a hard time putting the values of Tolstoyism into practice in his personal life, it seems that in his art he couldn't help writing works more complex and interesting than what he believed to be appropriate (though he still certainly makes his message come through).The back of the book claims that these stories are \\"now in paperback for the first time since their original publication,\\" which isn't really true: the Gordon Spence-translated \\"Divine and Human and Other Stories\\" contains three of the stories (there's also a Peter Sekirin-translated book called \\"Divine and Human\\" that contains all five of the 1905-06 stories from this volume, but that book seems to be available only in hardcover). However, I'm not aware of any English-language book containing \\"Polikoushka,\\" which is a very good work and the highlight of this collection, so I would tend to recommend this volume over either of the others.These stories don't quite reach the level of Tolstoy's very best short works (I have in mind \\"The Death of Ivan Ilich,\\" \\"The Kreutzer Sonata,\\" and \\"Master and Man\\"), but they're still quite good, so if you've liked some of his other short stories and novellas you should take a look at this volume."},{"Title":"The 2 1/2 Pillars of Wisdom (The Von Igelfeld Trilogy)","review":"I read this book over a year ago, so I can't write all that I could have when I had just finished it. But I noticed there were no reviews of this book available, and that's a shame because this is a masterpiece of subtle (and not-so-subtle) humor about a stiff and pompous German professor and his colleagues, their interpersonal intrigues, and their various adventures. It's one of my few \\"keepers\\".As with other books by this author, you can't judge this book by the description of the story, which I admit sounds dry. The same plot, implemented by another author, might have been a complete flop. But McCall Smith can take the most mundane or obscure story and bring it to life, adding twists of irony and color that entertain and charm the reader.This book (which contains a trilogy, actually) is not the light and merry read that we're used to from McCall Smith's \\"No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency\\" series, but every bit as entertaining.Any experience or knowledge that readers may have of German culture and customs will make this book even more of a delight to read -- unless, of course, you're a German without the ability to laugh at your own culture."},{"Title":"The 2 1/2 Pillars of Wisdom (The Von Igelfeld Trilogy)","review":"Contains three stories:Portuguese Irregular VerbsThe Finer Points of Sausage DogsAt the Villa of Reduced CircumstancesThey are all funny, but The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs is absolutely hilarious.Completely mad, and has a lot of in-jokes for academics, but enjoyable for anyone.

This is one, there are three books in here, Portuguese Irregular Verbs, the Finer Points of Sausage Dogs and At the Villa of reduced circumstances.This series follows the adventures of Professor Dr Moritz-Maria von Iglefled, author of Portuguese Irregular Verbs, (which has sold over 200 copies) and his friends (and arch rivals) Unterholzen and Prinzel - as they attend philology conferences, or establish themselves in the finely details pecking order of academia - all done in the best of good manners with almost no open hostility.Truly this is a marvellous peice of writing. The story where - as friends, von Iglefeld, Prinzel and Unterholzen read a book on tennis and its rules and then decide that they can play and indeed will play - all they need to know of tennis can be gained from books after all.It has been reviewed as cultivated pomposity, but there is also a marvellous edge of appealingness about them. I think we can all relate to their battles, their own pride and firm assurance in their very rightness. I think there appeal is not that they are pompous and ridiculous, but rather - there but for the grace of god go I!If you like this series I am sure you will enjoy another author - E E Benson who wrote the Lucia series, another very finely observed series of books where the small politics of a isolated community dominate the actions of everyone.

She learned much of her grandmother's craft, who's name she also bears. So when a stranger comes to the door looking for her grandmother, she offers her help.Declan Harper has little patience for ineptitude and determines to own the town and run it by his own exacting standards. He's going to own the town that once scorned him, and every business in it. When he overhears two children, Hason and Grechen, talking with their mother about a witch, he recalls Matilda Candy fondly, as the only townsperson who treated him well and believed in his positive future. The only thing Declan wants, that he doesn't yet have, is Vanessa Arrington. So he hopes Matilda Candy can help. After he realizes the old woman has passed away, he asks the young Matilda for a love potion. Declan insists, despite her assurances that there are no magic potions to affect the workings of the heart. She can, however, create an aphrodisiac -- a lust potion.To Declan's way of thinking, Vanessa is the paragon of feminine beauty. In addition, marriage to her offers the perfect revenge. Her father had always referred to him as &quot;that Harper boy&quot;, calling him and his sisters poor white trash. The elder Arrington hadn't yet equated the wealthy Declan with the boy he'd maligned years ago. Declan looked forward to enlightening him, maybe after the wedding.As Matilida turns the pages of aged and dusty books, she finds a note from her grandmother cautioning her about trifling with ways of the heart. Matilida and Declan are kindred spirits, both knowing what is to be on the outside looking in. Both have strong purpose in their lives. What Matilida would really like to give him is a common-sense potion, rather than a love potion to win a vain, vacuous ninny. Nevertheless, she draws up the potion, which they test on themselves. Let the fireworks begin!This whimsical, entrancing tale will satisfy the romance fan demanding something unusual and wonderful.

He wants to wed the most beautiful woman in town so he needs the Candy lady to make him a love potion to help his plan succeed.Matilda Candy knew the town thought she was a witch but she ignored them and continued on as her dear sweet grandmother had taught her.

Unlike other stories out there, there is an actual buildup to \\"love\\". Admittedly they find each other attractive almost immediately, but that's a common occurrence in these kinds of books. It's how it builds from there that really got me. The characters flirt. They have quiet scenes. And the best part is they aren't always on top of each other. But, yes they do get on top of each other but even then the naughty bits are written quite well (not overly descriptive erotica, but explicit enough to be sexy)This book has intrigue. One of the main characters even has a revenge plot that actually has consequence to the story. There are many romances out there that forget about their subplots, this isn't one of them. It's well woven into the main narrative.This book has well rounded characters. In lots of stories there's an insistence that the female leads declare themselves to be strong, only to never prove it in their actions. The female lead in this one has a silent strength that you can feel throughout the book. She makes her own decisions, right or wrong, and doesn't wait for the writer/fate to make them for her. The male is human. He feels like a real person. Most romances forego giving their \\"prince charmings\\" a personality. You have to supply your own dreamboat in those cases, but this one is an actual human and screwed up. Even the some of the townspeople and the side characters have humanity in them and go through their own arcs.This book has annoying children.

Matilda Candy is the woman in the woods who makes candy and other things. But unlike in the fairy tale her beauty is very real. And the candy and sweets she bakes are from scratch and not due to magic. She receives frequent visits from the kids next door as they like her candy. So much so that the kids end up a little alarmed when they see her spending more and more time with Declan and less time on baking the treats they love so much. She's working on a love potion for Declan to use on Vanessa(a woman he's come to see as a potential wife). Declan has come back to town as a fairly successful man, but memories from his past have made him determined to go through the big plans he has for Tanglewood. Marrying Vanessa would be a big step towards him achieving those plans.While the love potion doesn't seem to work on Vanessa, it does on Matilda. Are the feelings growing between them real or are they just under a spell? And what happens when Warren Harrington remembers who Declan is? Will Declan decide to continue to explore these feelings with Miss Candy or is he determined to continue to try and make Vanessa his, even as he starts to realize that Vanessa's beauty may only be skin deep. Will it ever rain in Tanglewood ever again?I really enjoyed reading the story and rooted for the couple to get their happy ending.

Watt wrote \\"Dare Call It Treason\\" about the mutinies in the French Army in 1917 and \\"The Kings Depart\\" about the German Revolution of 1918-1919. This book is a history of Poland from 1918 to 1939. Poland had once been an enormous and powerful nation stretching from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea, and second only to France in population (p.16). Lacking natural frontiers like mountains and major rivers it was frequently invaded in wars. Its aristocracy was huge and quarrelsome, and elected the Polish king. The wars in the mid 17th century caused a 25% loss of population (p.17) and led to a decline. Poland was partitioned between Prussia, Austria, and Russia (p.18). Patriots sought a new Constitution in 1791 but Russia invaded for the Second Partition. There was a new war in 1794 but the defeat led to the Third Partition and an end to Poland (p.19). Thomas Jefferson and others spoke out against this. Emigr&eacute; Poles formed the Polish Legions of Napoleon and this led to the creation of the \\"Grand Duchy of Warsaw\\". The Congress of Vienna created a small Kingdom of Poland (p.20). The revolts of 1830 and 1863 were unsuccessful and ended this Kingdom (p.21).Both Russia and Prussia began a culture war to de-Polonize the population (p.22). This strengthened national consciousness (p.23). Austria allowed its peoples their nationalist sentiments and had few problems (p.24). A population explosion in Poland led to emigration, mostly to America. The united Polish Socialist Party was formed to work for independence (p.25), but split into factions (p.26). One man stood out as a leader (p.27). J&oacute;zef Pilsudski believed that Polish independence could only result from a general European war where Germany and Austria defeated Russia and were beaten by France (p.39). It seemed fantastic. The National Democratic Party were political opponents (pp.40-42). The Great War began in August 1914 (Chapter 2) and led to Polish independence (Wilson's 13th point). But the question of boundaries remained. France wanted an ally in Russia, but the Bolshevik Revolution changed that. Instead they wanted an alliance with the countries west of Russia. [No thought of an independent Bavaria and Rhineland?] A great Poland would be stronger but contain minority peoples who wished to be part of a neighboring country (p.71).The new nation had many problems (Chapter 4). The Polish-Soviet War (1919-1920) was over the eastern boundary of Poland (Chapter 5). Pilsudski wanted an independent Lithuania, Ukraine, and Belorussia allied to Poland (p.93). Poland's eastern border was settled (Chapters 6,7). Chapter 8 discusses politics. Chapter 9 tells about the economic devastation caused by the war and afterwards. Pilsudski's coup succeeded because of support from workers (Chapter 10). Economic conditions improved by chance (p.245). Pilsudski became more autocratic (Chapter 12). The Great Depression arrived in early 1929 (Chapter 13). Every class suffered (p.295). Insolvent industries were taken over by the government (p.297). Pilsudski was in control of Poland (Chapter 14). What happens when an autocrat dies (Chapter 15)? Would a replacement be given too much power (p.351)? A man who inherits a position is not as good as the man who earned it (Chapter 16). Poland depended on its treaties with France and Rumania and would not consider any alliance with Germany or the Soviet Union (Chapter 17). The military occupation of the Rhineland showed German intentions (p.372). Poland chose to fight rather than submit to Hitler (p.396). They expected France to attack when war began (pp.401-402). The Soviet-German Nonaggression Pact surprised the world (p.408). Chapter 18 describes the short war. The Blitzkrieg offensive worked (p.418). Armored tanks destroyed artillery (p.423). It was over in 20 days (p.441). Poland was only partially mobilized. The \`Afterword' summarizes the later events."},{"Title":"Bitter Glory: Poland and Its Fate (1918-1939)","review":"A MUST for any fan of, history, WWII, Polish history and/or european history.An excellent book."},{"Title":"Bitter Glory: Poland and Its Fate (1918-1939)","review":"This is the first non-fiction book I've ever read regarding Polish history (having read the novel, The Painted Bird) and I couldn't put it down once I started. I read the 1982 2nd edition. Any American wanting to understand Poland from WW I thru the end of WW II should read this book, and after reading it you will have a much better understanding of the diplomatic mess that was the end of WW I and which resulted in so many problems between and within European nations in the 1920s and 1930s. Watt is \\"fair\\" to all and appears to have no axe to grind. His writing is more than adequate. Not too dry or boring, though not overly exciting either. Just about perfect for the serious matter discussed and the tragic consequences of the various major players involved (both men and nations).Depending upon your desires, the sections on the two major military conflicts may seem a bit short in comparison to the discussions about Polish politics, Polish personalities (esp. the ever-so-imprtant General/Marshal Pilsudski, whose biography opens the book and who dies at age 67 in 1935 on p. 338), socio-economics, and diplomatic relations. For those interested in war, the 1920 Russo-Polish War essentially starts on p. 108 and ends on p. 152. The 1939 invastions starting WW II begins on p. 411 and is over on p. 439. So there is more on the 1920 war than the 1939 war.Fortunately, the title is a bit misleading as there is an excellent Afterward on pages 441-462 that help the reader understand a bit about Poland during WW II from 1941-1945, the Polish government in exile versus the Soviet puppet regime, the machinations of the USSR vis-a-vis USA/UK, and the decisions/actions behind the final boundaries between the USSR, Germany, and Poland after WW II.My biggest pleasant surprises were the excellent discussions about the non-Polish minorities (primarily Ukranians and Belorussians) as well as the diplomatic histories involving Lithuania, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Rumania, esp. the border disputes and problems brought on by various ethnic minorities within their borders. Sadly, Poland's treatment of its minority groups and the various positions of these nations on their borders and minorities leaves much to be desired from a current perspective. Poland did bring some of its own ruin down on itself by its less than admirable conduct towards others.My biggest disappointment was the very limited discussion of the Soviet invasion of Poland on September 17, 1939. This appears on page 432 and is over on p. 439. I wanted to know a lot more about Soviet planning, preparation, and execution of this reprehensible invasion, that should've led to declarations of war by France and Britain against Stalin's aggression that was done in concert with Hitler. (Though these same two nations showed their true weak natures at the time by doing next to nothing to help Poland in September 1939 (as did Rumania) and then left Finland and the Baltic states to be dominated by Stalin. A tragic story with no heroes!)There are just 2 maps: pgs. 116-117, covering the Polish-Soviet War of 1920, and p. 412, covering the September 1939 invasions by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. Both are outstanding maps. The 1920 map really brings the Russo-Polish War to life! Oddly, neither map is shown on the table of contents. There are a total of 32 pages of nice b&w; photographs in two separate sections of 16 pages each. For such an extensive and lengthy book the endnotes are only acceptable, not being too extensive (on pages 463-474). There is a decent 4-page bibliography (pgs. 475-479). And an more than adequate Index (pgs. 483-511)There are 18 chapters that cover the primary text (pages 15-439), and the lengthy Afterward (pgs. 441-462). There is a 3-page Preface and a 2-page Special Introduction to the 1982 edition."},{"Title":"Bitter Glory: Poland and Its Fate (1918-1939)","review":"If you want to know about interwar Poland, this is the book to read. It's fascinating! It shows you a completely different perspective on WWI and WWII, and it's probably the perspective that most accurately draws in all of the issues that lead to those two wars. The story of Poland in the twentieth century IS the story of Europe in the twentieth century. The book is a great read, to boot."},{"Title":"Bitter Glory: Poland and Its Fate (1918-1939)","review":"As Mr. Watts showed in his earlier works &quot;Dare Call it Treason&quot; on the French mutinies of 1917 and &quot;The Kings Depart&quot; on Germany and the Versailles Treaty, he is a master of narrative history. The present book is of similar quality. It is the sort of &quot;find&quot; one dreams of encountering but so seldom does, a well-written, exciting account of a subject one knows to be of interest and importance, but on which little seems to be available outside detailed academic histories. Mr. Watts has a splendidly exciting story to tell - how Modern Poland sprung from a dream of freedom that had been kept alive despite a century and a half of partition and foreign repression - and he tells it with verve. The initial part of the story is on an epic scale: the apparently hopeless struggle of Pilsudski and other nationalists to breathe new life into the Polish ideal prior to the First World War, their brilliant exploitation of events as the German, Austro-Hungarian and Russian Empires crumbled at the end of it, their momentarily-successful attempt to revive an earlier Greater Poland stretching from the Baltic to the Black Sea and their final, incredible, last-ditch success in repulsing Bolshevik invasion in 1920. After this deliverance - or rather nineteen-year stay of execution, as subsequent events were to prove - the challenge of creating a modern, economically viable state was a daunting one, with minimal resources and an impoverished, undereducated population. The second part of the book, detailing the painful process of industrialisation and of land, fiscal and education reform is no less fascinating than the first, playing out against a background of hostile neighbours and internal political squabbling. Petty party politics and narrow sectional interests bedevilled the new nation and once Pilsudski, the founding father, a benevolent not-quite-dictator, passed from the scene in the mid '30s these became ever more malignant factors, not least in unworthy half-tolerance of increasing Anti-Semitism. Despite all however, one gets the sense of a heroic people seeking a higher destiny, faltering on occasion, yet never losing faith in themselves and hope in the future. Mr.Watts guides the reader through the morass of party politics with assurance, never losing one's interest, and is very effective in bringing to life the main players in inter-war Polish society. The book ends with the disaster of 1939, with Poland once again partitioned by its ruthless neighbours and with its indomitable citizens entering the hell that will see them brutalised and enslaved, but also fighting on battle fronts from North Africa to Normandy and the Netherlands, over the skies of Western Europe and, bloody but unbowed, in the very ruins and sewers of Warsaw itself. These latter epics of Polish heroism are well recorded elsewhere and it is to Mr.Watts' credit that he has recorded so well what set the scene for these later events."},{"Title":"Bitter Glory: Poland and Its Fate (1918-1939)","review":"This book covers the history of Poland between World War I and World War II. The period was lively, to say the least, involving what are now almost-forgotten conflicts with most of Poland's neighbors, not to mention much political infighting and the period of the depression. The story loses nothing in the telling: as several reviewers have previously stated, this author is an excellent writer of narrative history. The description of the ebb and flow of armies are clear and fast-moving, and the characters of the major players come vividly to life. I think that both the casual reader and the specialist will find much to enjoy. I think that the lead-up to WWII isn't quite as strong as the rest of the account. This is the only thing that, in my mind, keeps this from being a 5-star review.Of course, Mr. Watts virtually has the field to himself, so if you are interested in the history of Poland between the wars, you have to read this book. I'm pleased to say it's a very good one.P.S. I also recommend Mr. Watts' other books, The Kings Depart (Germany immediately after WWI) and Some Dare Call it Treason (the French Army Mutinies in WWI)."},{"Title":"Bitter Glory: Poland and Its Fate (1918-1939)","review":"Although the name of the Poland in the interwar years is often invoked in many narrative volumes, there is precious little written about Poland in the interwar period. Best has gone a very long way in balancing the deficit.There is also a lot of supposed truths of which scholars of the 20th Century take without critical discussion: Pilsudki was a dictator, Poland was anti-semitic, Poland was a loyal ally of other eastern European countries, Poland distrusted the Germans more than the Russians.In fact Pulsudski was probably one of the most balanced authoritarian personalities in the 20th century, using force in the 1926 coup to rescue an immature Parliament, and acting as a balancing hand on the rudder of state to protect the right of Jews inside Poland. He never used political murder to further his ends.This is important because it is often cited that Britain and Empire went to war for a country with anti-semetic background subject to pogroms. When Pilsudski died persecution of Jews started. Boycotting of Jewish shops was quintessentially Nazi-like --- but there the comparison ends! Polish Police were quick to move in whenever there was a threat of physical violence. Although shameful, the post 1936 Polish method, to remove Jews from Poland was one based upon economics only and not force --- no concentration camps ever littered the Polish landscape.Poland on the other hand may have been too clever by half for its own good. Defeating the Red Army in 1920 Poland went on a foreign policy determined to make it a major power in Europe. All predicated on the notion that Poland would not take sides in any political or polemical conflict between Russia or Germany.That strong-armed realist strategy gained her the southern lands of Lithuania, the German majority area of Silesia, and most notoriously, Poland took advantage in the wake of Munich to bully Czechoslovakia to give up Tsechen. It set a poor example and robbed Poland of some sympathy when the Germans pushed for the return of Danzig. Poland's objective was never to wipe a country off the face of the earth like Hitler's was for Poland. But it did lose Poland sympathy internationally and made it easier for Hitler to claim that all he wanted was the Corridor and Danzig.The last days of Poland could have been described in greater detail, but Best goes a long way in answering the question of what went wrong with Poland and why, when the crunch came, it was so devastating. I do not think that Poland, even with the most consumate statemanship could have done much to survive. But there clearly were signs that Poland, with it tough infantry should have been able to withstand the nazi-Soviet agression longer that it did.Best's descriptions are fast, lively and one gets a real sense of Pilsudski as a man, Smygly-Ritz, and foreign minister Beck. One also gets a better idea of the challenges this country faced being crushed between the Nazis and Soviet Russians outside, and imploding from lack of an effective Parliament and minority discontent.One of the 10 best narrative reads this year for me."},{"Title":"Bitter Glory: Poland and Its Fate (1918-1939)","review":"There aren't too many English-language histories of inter-war Poland, so this book is very welcome. It is easy to read and provides many interesting details on subjects (often regarded these days as obscure) such as inter-war Danzig and Poland's troubled relations with Lithuania and Cezchoslovakia. In many ways, it is popular history more than academic history: it has little to say on the inter-war economy and social structure of Poland. Its account of Polish diplomacy could be a little more rigorous, but the author, though clearly sympathetic to Poland, does not flinch awkward facts. One drawback is that the book hardly draws at all on modern research."},{"Title":"Bitter Glory: Poland and Its Fate (1918-1939)","review":"Until recently, Poland was a satelite of the Soviet Union. Before World War One, Poland was part of three different Empires. The only time Poland was truly an independent country was between the two World Wars. Under the leadership of Marshall Pilsudski, a large European nation was born which had been submerged for over 100 years. As part of that emerging process, Poland fought a war with the Soviet Union and managed to stem the tide of Communist advancement in Europe.This is a great history book. The politics and history of Poland come alive. During this time period, Poland was not a democracy, but an authoritarian state ruled by a benovolent leader. Poland played a balancing act between Germany and the Soviet Union. The National Democrats, the PPS, and Marshall Pilsudski played power politics. This book was very complimentary to Pilsudski, portraying him as the glue that held the nation together whereas the other political parties used power to enrich themselves.Watt is a favorite author of mine. His books, Dare Call It Treason and The Kings Depart are two of my favorite books on World War One. Watt does another home run with this book on interwar Poland. For those interested in Polish history, this is a must read. For those interested in general history, this is a great book to read about Poland."},{"Title":"Bitter Glory: Poland and Its Fate (1918-1939)","review":"Richard Watt has produced a readable volume that recounts the only period of modern Polish independance prior to the current one. It's complete, and seems to cover the issues reasonably well. Looming over the whole book is the figure of Jozef Pilsudski, the father of modern Poland, and he is reasonably well-described here. Good book, though the writing, while reasonable, isn't on the Barbara Tuchman-Robert Massie skill level writing-style wise."},{"Title":"Bitter Glory: Poland and Its Fate (1918-1939)","review":"For most people Polish history between the wars is probably a mystery.

Watt (1982)Details of an intense, brief, and pivotal period in Poland's independence. His 460 page book delves in great detail into the creation of modern Poland in the crumbling empires of World War I, through the Fourth Partition of 1939. Watt does a very good job of exploring Poland's \`fate' as he calls it, from the inside out, and expertly sets this amidst the backdrop of European politics in the period inter bella. For Poland, this period was a series of sustained and linked crises, as a people that had pined and fought for independence since 1792 suddenly found themselves in possession of a large nation with a diverse set of peoples, many neighboring countries, each also trying to forge itself out of the debris of World War I, and a passionate but wholly inexperienced set of disagreeing actors on the new Polish national stage.In his 1982 special edition (Solidarity was in full swing) Watt notes \\"Poles are awesomely patriotic, revere their military tradition, possess great personal courage, and have repeatedly shown themselves willing to die in a romantic cause as long as it is in Poland's defense. They are also of course devout adherents of their church which they view as a special repository of Polish tradition representing the principal continuous force in Polish history.\\" Later in the introduction, \\"Whatever the considerable faults and failings of Pilsudski and his followers...they were seen as honest representatives of the Polish character and the creators of authentic Polish independence.\\" These passages set the tone for the entire book, which runs 18 chapters and details the birth pains to the death pains of Poland 1918-1939.The first chapter sets the stage with a detailed examination of the complex person of Jozef Pilsudski, and the fermented political climate which produced him, and the great many adherents, followers and supporters that he was to find across all of Poland, whether it be under German, Austrian or Russian rule prior to August 1914. Chapter three covers in detail the infighting between Polish political parties at Versailles, and the disagreements between the major victors of World War I, as well as Germany and Russia (Soviet Union) over Poland. Because the dissolution of Imperial Russia and Germany was so stark, and confused, Watt shows that the peacemakers and treaty writers at Versailles can certainly be forgiven for not getting it perfectly right, especially given the added frictions in the outlooks and approach of Roman Dmowski and Pilsudski. Add to this the final result that not all of Poland's borders were decided at Versailles, let to future ambiguity, and the reader quickly grasps the continuous quagmire in which Poland was gripped heading into the 1920's.Chapters 4-6 details the massive bureaucratic tasks that faced the new leaders of Poland. Facing these were immense. Add to this the physical destruction of Poland during the Eastern Campaign, and the need for Poland to settle border issues with Czechoslovakia, Ukraine, Russia and Lithuania, and one quickly sees the almost Sisyphean tasks that faced the new leaders of Poland. In fact the question more properly may be asked, not why they did it so \`poorly' but how they did it all?The Polish-Soviet War marked the transition from Poland as an idea to Poland as a viable nation state. After this resounding victory, Poland can be forgiven, by Watt's description, some sense of enlarged importance in central and indeed all of Europe, but the fact of the matter was that as Europe recovered from the war, staggered under the depression, and then began the gradual violent slide towards the tragic chaos of World War II, Poland was the only democratic country in eastern Europe, and the only country of significance between the Soviet Union and Germany. While others could retire to their drawing rooms after dinner and cognac to discuss the future of Europe, Poland had to live it every day.As Watt makes painfully clear, Pisudki failed in not setting up Poland for a better transition to civilian leadership, but Watt also makes clear that perhaps no one could have successfully stopped the coming clash. Even if Czechoslovakia and Poland had formed some sort of early Visegrad Union, it is doubtful that it would have been enough to stop the \`fate of Poland' as the book title states up front. The second half of the book carefully chronicles the domestic politics of Poland, including the painfully awkward return of Pilsudski and the subsequent \`rule of the colonels.' It also carefully shows Poland's struggles to get the best possible deals and compromises in Mittleeuropa in the increasingly perilous 1930's.One of the many results of Versailles was that Poland had to honor a loosely defined Minorities Treaty. With a very diverse population, this would be a challenge for anyone. With burgeoning fascism, communism and anti-Semitism across Europe, Poland struggled with all of this. At the same time, this treaty provided diplomatic cover for other western European powers to keep Poland at arms distance diplomatically, when in their own interests for self-preservation, they should have drawn her ever closer. In many ways, Watt alludes to the second great diplomatic failure of France in the first half of the 20th century when they did not pull Poland ever closer and tighter, especially given the continuing fond memory for Napoleon in Poland.Thus diplomatically isolated, and geographically contiguous to the two great terror dictatorships of Europe, Poland sought the art of the possible. Poland in 1938 was not yet doomed - but almost, and as 1939 played out, Poland found herself physically more and more surrounded, more threatened, and more endangered. Watt closes his book with the same fatalistic view of the Poles who, in the summer of 1939, knew they had been dealt a bad hand, and resolutely tightened their belt buckles and prepared to drive forward. That Poland, far less capable in terms on modern military technology, should have fought a double invasion for a month, and in the brief violent campaign, kill more Germans than the French managed to do a year later, speaks volumes to the drive and determination of the Poles as a people and a nation. As the Soviets were to discover forty years later, Stalin was right - trying to rule and conquer Poland is \\"jak siodla do krowy\\" like trying to saddle a cow.If you want to understand how Poland got from World war I to where they are today, and what still drives a great deal of their national thought processes, this book is indispensable."},{"Title":"Bitter Glory: Poland and Its Fate (1918-1939)","review":"This has to be one of the most readable history books written. It's fascinating because it tells the story of rebuilding a nation that had disappeared from the map of the world for more than 125 years. The nation that emerged had to combine the damage of 3 divergent occupying powers where even trains didn't run on the same type tracks, and satisfy the demands of opposing and even militant ethnic groups within its borders while staving off attacks from dangerous and militant neighbors without its borders. Sound familiar?I only gave this book four stars because it included nothing about what was happening within the United States for or against Poland's rebirth. President Wilson included the resurrection of Poland as one of Germany and Austria's conditions of surrender. Knowing how this was greeted or opposed by former citizens of Poland within the U.S. would give greater clarity to what was going on amongst the citizens within Poland's borders.Some new information I was astounded to learn was that Poland initiated and WON A WAR AGAINST THE SOVIET UNION!!!Who would have thought! And such an important war it was too! It stopped the spread of communism within Europe and took the snap out of Stalin's beans for a long time. He retaliated later when he found a socialist bedfellow in Hitler. Communism was pushed back later in the century.Interwar Poland is not the prejudiced disaster that many people imagine. Even Mr. Watt sometimes has to amplify, emphasize and elaborate to put across the point, but overall this is a fair and unbiased approach to the problems and politics of interwar Poland. I recommend it highly because it works on many levels and depicts the difficulties of forging a new nation and...one more time...I can't BELIEVE POLAND WON A WAR THEY INITIATED AGAINST THE SOVIET UNION!!!!"},{"Title":"The Legend Of Ragnarok","review":"Ignatius Donnelly was born in 1831 Philadelphia and became a lawyer in 1852. Married in 1855, they moved to Minnesota. When Minnesota became a state in 1857 Donnelly was elected lieutenant governor. In 1862 he was elected to Congress for three terms. He campaigned for Greenback policies and served in the state senate. Donnelly wrote \\"Atlantis\\" and \\"Ragnarok\\" which became sensational best sellers and made him wealthy. \\"The Great Cryptogram\\" analyzed Shakespeare's plays to prove they were written by Francis Bacon. Two novels dealt with a fascist takeover of America \\"Caesar's Column\\", and racial intolerance \\"Dr. Huguet\\". In 1887 he became a founder of the Populist Party, and was nominated for Vice-President in 1898. He died in Minneapolis on 1/1/1901. His politics, oratory, and literature marked his originality and talents; his writings are now out of fashion.Donnelly studied the legends and mythologies of Hindus, Persians, Britons, Chinese, Greeks, Scandinavians, the North, Central, and South American Indians, Arabians, Babylonians, and Egyptians that told of disaster by fire, hail, frost, darkness, changes in climates, and tales of dragons and other monsters. Donnelly claimed these reflected a visit from a giant comet, and the proof lay in The Drift of unstratified deposits which came from a cometic collision rather than glacial movement. Donnelly suggested a comet could have caused Old Testament events such as the destruction of the wicked cities, the sun standing still, and stones falling from the heavens. Ragnarok, the Twilight of the Gods (or Rain of Rocks), commanded the interest of general readers, and the admiration (if not credence) of the scientific world. Donnelly, a good lawyer, argued his case well with all the evidence available to him at the time. Decades later Immanuel Velikovsky would publish his version of this theory.The surface of our planet consists of layers of sand, clay, and gravel (over stratified rock). It contains no trace of fossils. The pre-glacial world saw tropical plants growing near the Arctic Circle in Miocene times. Herds of elephants and other animals lived in Europe. Donnelly says a sudden cataclysm brought severe cold, and left deposits of sand, clay, and gravel; fissures were created in earth's crust. He explains why this was caused by a comet striking earth, the heat vaporizing the seas to create clouds, rain, and snow. Rocks on the surface would be smashed and crushed. This collision was preserved in the legends of mankind. The Great Lakes suggest points of impact. Vast clouds, and debris in the sky, would create a \\"nuclear winter\\".Donnelly says myths and legends are ultimately based on some fact. Finding the same legends among different nations suggests a common experience in prehistoric times. These myths of a cataclysm imply the existence of mankind; they are in accord with the facts known to science and from deep excavations. The legends coincide in this: a monster in the air; the heat; the fire; the cave-life; the darkness; the return of light. Donnelly respectfully suggests the Book of Job is the oldest in the Bible, and gives a new viewpoint to the beginning of Genesis.Donnelly answers objections in Part IV Chapter IV. The position of certain constellations in Job estimates this time as 30,000 years ago. Donnelly suggests the fire that seemed to drop out of the heavens and set a number of fires in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Illinois on October 8, 1871 was the result of Bielas' comet. There is a universal feeling that regards comets with fear; Revelation (chapter xii, v.3) is a symbol of a comet brushing the earth. Why would God permit such a calamity? Perhaps what was destroyed was not worth preserving? It could be God's plan to punish the wicked of this world, says Donnelly."},{"Title":"Rubrics for Elementary Assessment : Classroom Ready Blackline Masters for K-6 Assessment","review":"I use this book all the time in my Elementary Classroom.

It is a poem, a watercolor, a dream half-remembered upon waking, a world rebuilt. You will be swept away, and it will stay in your heart for a long time.In stunning words, Beth Kephart writes of a coffee farm where her husband grew up in the jungled hills of El Salvador. It is a farm inhabited by souls living, mythical and dead: here among the dusty roads, crowded graveyards, and lush coffee plantations we meet ghosts of 11th century Indians, Siguanaba (the witch who haunts the doomed) and especially Don Alberto, her husband's beloved and legendary grandfather, who founded the coffee farm and died there &quot;anchored into the hands of those he loved and into the memories of others.&quot;This book is a testament to memory, and to the endurance of our deeds. It is a book about a beautiful and fecund land lacerated by earthquakes, snipers, and greed. It is a dramatic book by a brave woman about an exotic place, but it is a book that speaks to all of us about what holds the world together: memory, family, courage, love. Read it, and give it to the people who matter most to you. This is a brilliant work."},{"Title":"Still Love in Strange Places: A Memoir","review":"The way I see this evocative and quite heroic book is this: This is a beautiful journey not only to another place, but it's a story, really about a brave, sensitive, shy writer, who happens to be an impassioned mother and wife who is trying to figure out how to understand her (the) new American Family, of which she is a wonderful chronicler. This is an epic adventure, really, but not just to an exotic place but deep inside of what it means to be in a family in America in 2002. The very idea of family is radically different than just a few years ago. Kephardt had a longer way to go than most of us to understand where she fit in, where her family came from, and how she could cope with and understand it. What an admirable trip and what a lucky family to have her.This book is quite relevant to anybody who loves anybody and is frightened of their enormous responsibilities therein. It's a monument ot the bravery of those rare spouses, moms, sisters who just won't ever quit on the people they love. The fact that it's beautifully written, and very evocative is a huge bonus.

In this book, #4 is an especially original piece portraying a mood of agony. There is ingenious motive play in #14. There is a sprinkling of harmonic gems, such as augmented sixths (#5, #19), Neopolitan sixths (#25), and Phrygian cadences (#15, #21).The codas in this book are especially interesting. In some of the pieces, Concone withholds any subdominant chords until the coda--a practice which he probably borrowed from Mozart and Beethoven. Music theory buffs should be sure to notice the chromatic descent in the codas in #14, #17, #18, and #20.That does not mean that the educational goal has been overlooked.

This one speaks with a black voice, as George E. Stephens wrote as correspondent for the (New York) &quot;Weekly Anglo-African,&quot; from the events of John Brown's rebellion (Nov. 1859) through September, 1864. Along the way he shifted from member of the press to acting patriot-soldier, recruiting and then enlisting in the Massachusetts 54th, that leader among black regiments depicted in the movie &quot;Glory.&quot; Donald Yacovone provides not only notes for the letters but also information on Stephens' family background. After the 54th disbanded Yacovone follows Stephens' ongoing struggles to educate freed slaves in Virginia; the story of many black patriots' efforts to move their people upward by finally granting them some education is not widely told or appreciated. These chapters fill a need today. So the life taken as a whole is both glorious and tragic: it's distressing to follow Stephens' hopes, from fresh optimism through disillusionment to despair, time and time again from the events of Fort Wagner to the last anguished efforts of his life. At its end he had to sue the government he'd served all his life to obtain the commission denied to him because of his race (though illegally), and provide for his wife with a higher pension. He never lived to receive it, dying in 1888 before the promotion came through. In this Stephens is typical of black men of his time, and it's deeply saddening.This is not a happy, but it is a useful, book, and a corrective for many cheap heroics about how well we treated our black veterans. We need to ponder its message today."},{"Title":"ONE EYED DREAM","review":"I feel Scratch had to have closure on the past as he had to find out the three men he first road with had in deed betrayed him and took his firs and left him to fend for his self.

Dan Harrow comes off the farm to take a job as a towboy and through hard work and good fortune is able to get his own boat. He meets Molly Larkins who becomes his cook; it seems they might marry but Dan comes to realize the canaller's life is not for him, and when he decides to take a job on a farm, they depart company. He also befriends the evil outlaw Gentleman Joe Calash and must overcome the bully Jotham Klore in a fist fight that takes on legendary proportions. The story is somewhat episodic with some chapters reading like separate short stories, but the basic storyline of Dan and Molly and their tribulations remains steady throughout. The book is an excellent piece of regional historical fiction, with very realistic and lively characters holding our attention from beginning to end."},{"Title":"Rome Haul (Award A318N)","review":"This book is a good tool for explaining what life was like on the Erie canal during the mid 1800's (the book starts in 1850). The main character is Dan Harrow a young man who goes to find work on the Erie after his father dies. He meets up with various waterside characters, as well as a dangerous outlaw known as 'Gentleman Joe'. He works for various boaters until he eventually gets his own boat. He meets a young beautiful girl named Molly whom he hires to become his cook, which she does. Most of the story is simply showing what it was like to live on the Erie canal and all the things that happened. It does not end happily though, so be forewarned. The girl leaves him and he leaves the Erie to get a farm. Also, it is not the most moral book. Although nothing is ever clearly stated, it is very evident that the two live together on the boat with no intention of marriage. If you like storys about hicky cowboys filled with lots of typical western hicks (like an old dancehall girl with a blond wig, who smokes a long pipe), you will like this book.

It comes at this issue from a particularly Reformational angle. What does that mean? He grounds his thesis in the way of looking at the world rediscovered during the Protestant Reformation: creation, fall, and redemption. When we consider life everything is considered from this biblical viewpoint. What Wolters presets is a great introduction to three points that can radically change the way we think and live. If you are looking for a worldview book that is heavy on applicable, biblical content rather than a rant about how the world is going to hell in a hand-basket this it the book for you."},{"Title":"Creation Regained: Biblical Basics for a Reformational Worldview","review":"I have heard about this book for several years and was excited at the opportunity to read through it. I was not disapointed.The things I enjoyed...This was the best book I have read that outlines creation - fall - redemption as the basis for Christian Worldview. Wolters did an excellent job with this.His emphasis on creation - fall - redemption as far reaching (these categories reach everything, all of creation) was a breath of fresh air and a helpful concentration.Areas I still have questions...In his new addition (last chapter) with the church's role in mission and the Gospel as it relates to worldview, I found myself wanting more definitional distinctions between Gospel and redemption. Is the Gospel an aspect of redemption or toally different? If my vocation as a carpenter is bringing \\"directional\\" kingdom order to the \\"structure\\" of carpentry, can this be my mission or is it my role in redemption, and how are those two different? Any book recomendations to help with these latter questions, please forward them to me."},{"Title":"Creation Regained: Biblical Basics for a Reformational Worldview","review":"Through the lens of the Gospel, Wolters examines the concept of a worldview. In the first chapter, Wolters previews the topic and discusses the concept and implications of a worldview. The writer answers these and many other questions in the first chapter: What is a worldview? Why is a worldview important? Who has a worldview? Having established these foundational concepts, the following three chapters serve as a guide for a Christian worldview. Wolters uses these chapters (2-4) as the basis of a biblical worldview (viz., Creation, Fall, and Redemption). In all of these areas, the writer guides the reader to the understanding that the cosmic significance of the Gospel has much to do with the moral and ethical choices of the believer. Throughout these three chapters as well as the conclusion, the reader is driven away from poor paradigms (secular vs. sacred, categorically good vs. categorically bad) to a wholly different paradigm (redeemed vs. fallen). In essence, when doing studies in ethics, Wolters would have Christians ask these questions: 1. What was God's creative ideal (law) in this area? 2. In what way has the depravity of fallen man marred this ideal? 3. In what ways can we see the creative ideal restored through the Gospel? These questions will directly affect the life of a believer if their answers are translated into practice. Wolters' conclusion is extremely practical. The summary chapter was very helpful in its added dimensions and explanations.Overall, the work was an enjoyable and enlightening read. Several flaws may exist in the argument and in the work as a whole. Some of these may be more significant depending on ones' denominational and theological background. First, Wolters stands committedly in the Reformed tradition. One who is outside those bounds may find some disconnect with the views of the writer. For example, Wolters takes a somewhat unfair shot at Dispensationalism (79) by stating that they only hold to the kingdom as millennial. Also, some of the concepts such as a \\"cultural mandate\\" and \\"redeeming culture\\" are predicated on an understanding of Niebuhr's \\"Christ and Culture,\\" and his concept of \\"Christ redeeming culture.\\" Most premillennialists struggle with this position due to what they see as a downturn in morality at the end of the current age, rather than a slow victory in the realm of culture. That being said, dispensationalists will not disagree in whole with the premise of the work. Even the concept of the Church battling towards victory (albeit, not accomplished until after the millennium) in the realm of ethics is supported by most dispensationalists who are more than willing to combat the pessimistic possibilities of their theology.These concerns are only significant to a select few, so they are of little significance. The book itself is extremely significant. While only an introduction to redemptive worldviews, the work turns the eyes of the reader to the Gospel in order to find the deepest of ethical implications."},{"Title":"Creation Regained: Biblical Basics for a Reformational Worldview","review":"The author uses scripture and examples to make the case for looking at creation from a reformational perspective to guide Christians in daily living.The book is easy to understand, and presented in a logical format.This book would be an excellent resource for small group study in a local church."},{"Title":"Creation Regained: Biblical Basics for a Reformational Worldview","review":"I received the wrong book in the mail.

I found this helpful, but there are other things in the book that I don't agree with."},{"Title":"Creation Regained: Biblical Basics for a Reformational Worldview","review":"Wolters has done a terrific job of explaining how Christians are to relate to all of the created world in this brief treatise. In a time in which Christians in America lack a clear vision of their place in and with society, many have succumbed to the belief that that some areas are less important and less holy than others. Having forced life into a dichotomy of &quot;secular&quot; and &quot;sacred&quot; activities, Christendom has lost its sense of the inherent value and goodness of life outside the walls of their Sunday School classroom. With more and more Christians abandoning their posts and ceasing to believe in the inherent goodness of culture and society, it is no wonder that the machinery of soceity has come to a grinding and nauseating halt. The air is ripe for believers to rediscover the truth about God's love and plans for the redemption of all of life and to realize that the myth of the sacred/secular dichotomy is nothing more than the ancient, but everpresent, heresy of Gnosticism which has always plaugud the church (and no doubt always will til Christ comes back).Creation is intrinsically a good thing. Sin entered the world and like a parasite attached itself to all things. But God, in His everlasting and everreaching mercy, has brought about a plan of redemption, not only to individual persons, but also to the world as a whole, through the death and resurrection of His Son. This short, yet masterfully written book (98 pages), will impart to Christians an intoxicating vision and direction about the world at large that is much needed in the Church today. _Creation Regained_ offers a comforting and encouraging word, reassuring the troubled Christian with the implications of redemption and how they must drive our interaction with culture. God desires the restoration of all of life, and Christians are his salt and light to accomplish that purpose. A must read for all who seriously struggle to understand their place in the world."},{"Title":"Creation Regained: Biblical Basics for a Reformational Worldview","review":"The subtitle of this book is \\"Biblical Basics for a Reformational Worldview,\\" and as the book develops, the author clearly aligns himself with the Dutch Reformed school of thought. This school of thought is best represented by Abraham Kuyper and there is a real sense in which this book can be viewed as an introduction to Kuyperian thinking.Wolters begins the book by defining what a worldview is. He distinguishes \\"worldview\\" from the academic disciplines of theology and philosophy. He says that one may need specialized education to engage in theology and philosophy, but a worldview is something that everyone has, regardless of education. He defines a worldview as \\"the comprehensive framework of one's basic beliefs about things.\\"He goes on to say that a Biblical worldview is to understand the world through the biblical lenses of creation, fall, and redemption. Chuck Colson's book \\"How Now Shall We Live,\\" takes the same approach.What is unique about Wolters book, and this is a theme that runs throughout, is his distinction between structure and direction. Structure refers to the way something was created. In other words, everything has a structure - the family, government, labor, etc., all have a structure given to them. Direction refers to their movement toward or away from God.He shows that many Christians tend to reject the structure of a thing, when they should be dealing with direction. For instance, he speaks of human sexuality. Many Christians view sex in a negative light. However, sexuality has a biblical structure, i.e. it was created by God for a purpose and is to be pursued according to that purpose. To reject sexuality out of hand is to reject God's created order, or structure. It is the direction of human sexuality that we are to engage, not the structure. We are to seek to redeem it, pointing it in a godward direction.Wolters goes on to develop these themes through looking at how the fall affected the created order (structure) and how redemption affects it. Redemption is concerned with reversing the effects of the fall. Because the scope of redemption is as wide as the scope of the fall, there is nothing in all of creation that is irredeemable.All of this leads up to an explanation of the Kuyperian notion of sphere sovereignty - which states that no societal institution is subordinate to any other. In other words, the church is not subordinate to the state, nor vice versa. This applies to all institutions - family, education, etc.. If I read him right each institution has a created structure and though they are not subordinate to one another, they are subordinate to God's laws. Hence, all can and must be redeemed - i.e. put in a godward direction.I enjoyed the book - there is a lot of meat in a few pages. It has motivated me to study Kuyper and his disciples more closely. I am not sure that I am completed persuaded on the sphere sovereignty notion yet, but regardless, this book is provocative and well worth a read."},{"Title":"Creation Regained: Biblical Basics for a Reformational Worldview","review":"This is a gem of a book. First published in 1985, it has been reissued several times since then, with the newest edition appearing in 2005.The gist of the book can be stated this way: there are two major themes in biblical theology - creation and redemption. Unfortunately many believers today only consider the latter. Sometimes they have reduced Christianity to just one thing: getting souls into heaven. Now that of course is vital.But Wolters reminds us that this is not the entire gospel. Redemption is important, but so too is creation. Recognising that one day there will be a new heaven and a new earth should remind us that this world is not just secondary to God's purposes. In fact the two-fold nature of the biblical worldview is really a threefold one: creation, fall/redemption, and re-creation.God is not finished with this world, and has great plans for it. Indeed, argues Wolters, we need to have a more wholistic view of what biblical redemption in fact entails. He says that \\"the redemption in Jesus Christ means the restoration of an original good creation. . . . In other words, redemption is re-creation\\".Everything that God created - be it social, relational, cultural or personal - is part of God's good creation and is meant to be redeemed, to be taken into the Lordship of Christ.As Wolters says, \\"everything is creational\\". That is, every aspect of natural life is part of God's created order. As we are commanded in the so-called dominion mandate of Gen. 1: 27-31, we are to tend God's creation; we are to be his stewards on planet earth. \\"Almighty God has withdrawn from the work of creation,\\" says Wolters, but \\"he has put an image of himself on the earth with a mandate to continue\\".He explains, \\"Mankind, as God's representatives on earth, carry on where God left off\\". And our task is no less than the development of civilisation, and all which that entails. Thus a cultural order is to be developed and sustained by God's people. And a political order. And an economic order. And a social order, and so on. All these are aspects of the civilisation which God intended mankind to develop and propagate.Thus in one sense there is to be no sacred-secular dichotomy. This whole world is God's world. Satan has sought to claim it as his own, but it is not. It does not belong to him. It belongs to God, and doubly so: by creation and by redemption. Again, the goal of the church is not just to get disembodied souls into some cloudy-like heaven, but to get whole embodied people into a new earth in the future, and remake them on this earth now.So we are partakers with God in the creation/recreation theme that pervades all of Scripture. \\"Creation is not something that, once made, remains a static quantity,\\" says Wolters. \\"There is ... an unfolding of creation. This takes place through the task that people have been given of bringing to fruition the possibilities of development implicit in the work of God's hands\\".In other words, \\"We are called to participate in the ongoing creational work of God, to be God's helper in executing to the end the blueprint for his masterpiece\\". Seen in this light, the Christian life is far more than what happens on a Sunday morning, or in daily devotionals, or in \\"witnessing:. It takes on the whole of life.Thus writing a novel, tending a garden, or singing in a choir can all be parts of God's creational and redemptive work. Doing the best job you can in a factory can be just as important as becoming an overseas missionary. As Paul reminds us, whatever we do, we should do all for the glory of God (1 Cor. 10:31).What Wolters wants to remind us is that \\"human history and the unfolding of culture and society are integral to creation and its development\\". They are \\"not outside God's plan for the cosmos, despite the sinful aberrations\\".Wolters argues that we must take sin and its effects seriously, but we must remember that the beauty and purposes of God's creation are not totally eradicated by sin. Believers are called to redeem the created order, bringing it under the Lordship of Christ. That means every area, not just what we consider to be \\"spiritual\\".The view being put forth by Wolters (a view which has always been part of the Reformed biblical worldview) helps us to think outside of the box, and see our calling and mission as much larger than how we tend to view them. Wolters rightly says, \\"The scope of redemption is as great as that of the fall; it embraces creation as a whole\\".Wolters deserves much credit for reminding us of these foundational truths that have in many ways been lost in much of the church."},{"Title":"Creation Regained: Biblical Basics for a Reformational Worldview","review":"In this brief and smartly written book, readers are introduced to a distinct Christian worldview that has existed throughout church history but has come to be identified with theological traditions stemming from the Protestant reformation. Informing this worldview, in the author's own words, are the beliefs that \\"(1) creation is much broader and more comprehensive than we tend to think, (2) the fall affects that creation to its full extent, and (3) redemption in Jesus Christ reaches just as far as the fall.\\" The author's substantial giftedness in teaching and communication is on full display as he explains the biblical underpinnings and implications of each of these core beliefs; his writing is always clear and sometimes deeply stirring. The profound and empowering message of Creation Regained, appropriate for Christians of all traditions and vocations, will have readers marveling at the redemptive action of God in human history and considering their own roles in his work of making all things new."},{"Title":"Creation Regained: Biblical Basics for a Reformational Worldview","review":"Creation Regained: Biblical Basics for a Reformational Worldview (143 pp & first published in 85') is a great intro to worldview studies, and in particular Neo-Calvinism (Kuyper et al). It is a great read. I would recommend reading this one, then beelinin' it to Pearcey's 'Total Truth.' Most Christians are ignorant of the fact that Scripture calls us to commitment to Christ in more aspects than our private faith. Christ's Lordship is much more comprehensive than your thirty minutes before work. As Kuyper famously put it, there is not a square inch of planet Earth over which Christ does not say, Mine! This has implications for how we live our life, how we engage culture, how we work, and how we think about virtually everything.----Here are the contents:I. What is a WorldviewII. CreationIII. FallIV. RedemptionV. Discerning Structure and DirectionConclusionPost-Script: Worldview between Story and Mission----Wolters lays out the basic biblical worldview, examining creation, fall, and redemption. In the chapter on Redemption, there is a section called 'Salvation as Restoration' which is worth the price of the book! Christ comes as the Last Adam to restore our humanity and return us to the original state, the way it was supposed to be. The new humanity is to be about renewal. We are to renew and reform all aspects of life in obedience to Christ (societal, cultural, political, and personal). In chapter 5, Wolters analyzes the following themes as test cases on how to apply our worldview: aggression, spiritual gits, sexuality, and dance.----The Post-Script was written by Michael Goheen, and was excellent. It was basically a chapter on Biblical Theology and Mission, following the missional ecclesiology of Newbigin. We are in the era of witness, between the two comings. In the overlapping of the ages, the new humanity is to be about being Christ's ambassadors. In many ways, this chapter is his book, 'The Drama of Scripture,' chopped down to 24 pages. I highly recommend this one to all believers."},{"Title":"Creation Regained: Biblical Basics for a Reformational Worldview","review":"I started reading Abraham Kuyper's \\"Lectures on Calvinism\\", but for some reason I purchased this book thinking I needed a primer first, even though I was enjoying Kuyper and finding him lucid and stimulating.

While many evangelicals grasp the mantra \\"evangelize the lost,\\" they make this case only for souls.

As a result, the whole of human endeavor is to redeem ANYTHING that was affected by the fall - music, the arts, government. This book is a clear and concise explanation that is organized in a progressive way. It's as though after every chapter I had a question and in the subsequent chapter he answered it. I HIGHLY recommend this book for anyone who is wanting to A) understand the basic tenets of Abraham Kuyper's theology and B) have his life changed in a great way. This book not only lays out the theoretical, but helps the Christian draw practical applications for redeeming his world."},{"Title":"Creation Regained: Biblical Basics for a Reformational Worldview","review":"Wolters advocates building a worldview founded upon the three categories of Creation, Fall, and Redemption. All of reality can considered under one or more of those three rubrics. He concludes that Creation consists of creative acts in three realms, (1) the creation of the physical cosmos, (2) the creation of natural laws, (3) the creation of norms, or normal behavior within the various spheres of the creation. The Fall has corrupted creation in its three parts. Redemption redeems, not just man, but all of creation.Wolters then advocates that the Christian's role is to promote redemption in all three of the realms of creation. He proposes doing this by looking at the world through the grid of \\"structure\\" and \\"direction\\". Structure has to do with analyzing something to see what part of it is part of the original good creation. What part of it is creational? Direction has to do with trajectory, discerning how the Fall (or Redemption since the Fall) is influencing it.Wolters firmly believes that it is the job of the Christian not to wholly reject any portion of the creation, but to rather bring redemptive direction back to it, ie, to redeem it.His categories and analysis are fascinating and very provocative. Of particular note is his argument that there are \\"norms\\" in creation, norms which have been perverted and warped by the Fall. There are also a few weaknesses to the book: it really does not engage the cataclysmic destruction of the earth and world systems contained in Revelation. His eschatological view appears to be probably post-millennial or a-millennial; hence, in his viewpoint the kingdom just continues to advance. His view of spiritual gifts is a little weak (what part of miraculous healing, for example, is creational?). At a few points he contradicts himself (no one human institution is above another; but government creates laws to regulate business). But these are minor issues; on the whole the book is excellent in providing a path to form the right questions (this is how Wolters puts it) to properly analyze modern cultural issues. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Creation Regained: Biblical Basics for a Reformational Worldview","review":"1. Introduction to the Christian WorldviewIn this brief treatise, Albert Wolters develops a Christian worldview that revolves around the three chief themes outlined in the Bible: the creation, the fall, and the redemption. He establishes an ethical system that determines how Christians should respond to basic questions of right and wrong by analyzing moral dilemmas in terms of: (i) how the object of the dilemma was created by God in the original, untainted creation; (ii) how the object fell as a result of man's sin; and (iii) what that object would look like in a redeemed universe.He begins his thesis in chapter 1 by distinguishing between belief, worldview, philosophy, and theology. While a belief is something that one holds to be true, a worldview colors his entire perception of the world and shapes his decision-making. It involves \\"our view of the essential nature of humankind\\" (p. 6). While all people hold a worldview, theology and philosophy are \\"specialized fields of inquiry that not everyone can engage in\\" (p. 9). All people, whether they know it or not, hold a worldview; not all hold a philosophical or theological outlook on life.2. Creation, Fall, RedemptionWith this in mind, Wolters sets down a reformational Christian worldview placed \\"in the broader context of Christian worldviews as a whole\\" (p. 12). He does this by examining, in this order, creation (chapter 2), fall (chapter 3), and redemption (chapter 4).In his discussion of creation, he first sets forth a basic distinction between \\"God's activity of making the world\\" and the \\"resulting cosmos\\" (p. 13), and then shows that these concepts are closely related, since creation is \\"the correction of the sovereign activity of the Creator and the created order\\" (p. 14). Wolters distinguishes the laws of nature, which govern the creation, with norms, which govern men's affairs, and then goes on to describe the range of creation, the effects of sin on the fall of creation, and the redemption, which is \\"cosmic\\" in that it \\"restores the whole creation\\" (p. 69). As a result of the redemption, \\"marriage should not be avoided by Christians, but sanctified. Emotions should not be repressed, but purirfied. Sexuality is not simply to be shunned, but redeemed. Politics should not be declared off-limits, but reformed. Art ought not to be pronounced worldly, but claimed for Christ.\\" (p. 71).3. Structure and DirectionIn chapter 5, Wolters distinguishes between structure, which is the \\"'essence' of a creaturely thing,\\" as it was created by God, and direction, the \\"sinful deviation from that structural ordinance and renewed conformity to it in Christ\\" (p. 88). He discusses the idea of direction as it applies to: (i) the sphere of \\"reformation\\" in general; (ii) \\"societal renewal\\" at large; and (iii) \\"personal renewal.\\" Wolters explains that determining the acceptability of certain acts using points of references such as \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" are limiting; rather, we should focus on an analysis that takes into consideration the structure and direction of such acts. Nothing in creation is inherently evil or wrong, for \\"everything created by God is good and is reclaimed by Jesus Christ\\" (p. 113). The question should be \\"what is the most effective manner of bringing reformation and transformation to this area of our lives?\\" (p. 113)."},{"Title":"The Mark of the Maker","review":"This beautiful version of the Christmas story is lovingly told from Joseph's perspective. It allows you to begin to understand the terrible fear and apprehension he must have felt knowing that Mary, the woman he loved, was pregnant by the grace of God. It also explores the father/child relationship on several levels. This book is filled with grace, love, and genuine heart. Enjoy the peace that it can bring to your world..."},{"Title":"The Mark of the Maker","review":"Mr Hegg has obviously had differences with his own father sometime in the past. He has imagined a story about a young man's dilemma's growing up and tied it in beautifully with the Christmas story. Every American male should read this book or have it read to him. Then take 2 or 3 days to think it over and see if he can relate. It can remove any doubts about his own worth and about the worth of doing a job right. Maybe I'm reading too much into a juvenile story but I got the message that there's a deeper mature meaning to the last passage in the book. And Tom had the astuteness to leave it open to the readers interpretation. I absolutely loved the book."},{"Title":"The Mark of the Maker","review":"Tom Hegg and Warren Hanson have, over the years, given their fans some wonderful and memorable books. The Mark of the Maker is no exception.Hegg tells the biblical story of Joseph as the apprentice carpenter. The lessons from his father are not understood at first. It's only as Joseph matures, learns his craft and is then given the remarkable experience of becoming the earthly father of Jesus, that the lessons finally make sense. As Joseph gazes at the manger that holds the Christ child, it all becomes clear.The Mark of the Maker is an inspirational version of Joseph's story. The sepia illustrations are beautiful and add an important dimension.Armchair Interviews says: The Mark of the Maker is a wonderful gift book for any time of the year. But with the Christmas season approaching, it is a poignant reminder of what came before Jesus' birth."},{"Title":"The Mark of the Maker","review":"This is a fantastic story of the manner in which Mary and Joseph grew up and met, an account that we don't hear very often.

It plays on both Windows and Mac computers. I recommend it for what it is. A beginner's learning tool for the essential words and phases. A useful feature is you can learn using YOUR native language as you have choice of over 70 languages. I tried Chinese as I know it reasonably well and it worked just OK - I feel they designed it primarily for those with English as their 1st language. So if you American, Brit, Aussie, or Canadian this is a good beginner's guide for you.It's best feature is it's pronounces the words in both male and female voices as many Tagalog courses do not pronounce the words for you :-( You will enjoy the games and tests to measure your progress and it allows you to print your own dictionary for handy reference. I just wish it covered even more of our Tagalog words. Just incase I forget them.hehehe"},{"Title":"Talk Now! Tagalog (French Edition)","review":"Nice interactive cd for beginning Tagalog.

Tagalog (French Edition)","review":"If you are looking to buy this software in order to speak to someone back and forth, this is not the product for you. It will teach you phrases and questions, but you won't be able to understand any answers that a native speaker might give you because it doesn't teach you that. You will be able to identify objects in a house or building, but you won't know how to use them in a sentence or even in a fragmented sentence. This is also true for colors. If this is what you rely on to travel somewhere you might find yourself in the middle of a croud just saying azul(blue)......pula(red).... malalim na azul(dark blue)....Nasaan ang maipaparada ng kotse(where can I park the car?) and then even when you ask where can I park the car you won't know where to park it because you won't understand anything that people will tell you because it doesn't teach you that(people might think you're retarded haha). It only teaches you numbers up to 20, so you're out of luck if you ask magkano ito? (how much is this?) and the answer is 150 pisos. You'll just have to hand a merchant a wad of cash and hope he is honest and gives you your change. However, with all the bad things out of the way, this might make a good start for you to learn how to say the words correctly, even though the guy that talk doesn't pronounce the words correctly on there, just click on the girl(she says the correct pronunciations).

At only 120 pages I breezed through it in a few days. The book covers Sikh history, teachings, traditions, scriptures, worship, festivals, rites of passage, sects and the diaspora. It is pretty easy reading and no one high school age or over should have any trouble with the text. The only problem I had with the book was that there is so much Punjabi (the language of most Sikhs) that I couldn't remember what all the words meant and they would be used later without translation and I had to flip to the glossary or flip back to the original spot a decent bit. Even then, that is largely unavoidable as many religious terms (not just in Sikhism) are difficult to translate and repeatedly translating within the text would have been even more distracting. This definately isn't the place to go for in depth knowledge, but that's not the point of this book. If you want a general idea of what Sikhism is all about then this is a good place to go."},{"Title":"Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary PB with CD-ROM","review":"I consider the CD-Rom you get with the book the best dictionary on the market.

You just point the mouse at a Word document or at the text on a web page and the software speaks up the sound for you. While listening to the sound, the QUICKfind let you have a small dictionary window open on the screen with the meaning of each word you are pointing the mouse at, and the two loudspeakers with both English and American pronunciations are still there. Just imagine all those foreign languages and literatures university students who are going to prepare for their oral exams and have to be able to read aloud loads of poems with a perfect pronunciation and also explain the words' meanings - what a lot of time saved with the aid of this software!The main window has three other useful icons, i.e. Exercises, Pictures and Study pages.Among the Exercises, you can find Word Exercises (adjectives and adverbs, affixes, homophones, irregular and problem verbs, noun forms, suffixes, verbs meaning 'perform') and Pictures Exercises (animals, back, birds, body, car exterior, car interior, cars and trucks, clothes, flowers, foot, fruit, hair, hand, hats, head, in the kitchen, in the office, kitchen equipment, office equipment, phrasal verbs, planes, ships and boats, skeleton, sports, vegetables).Among the Pictures you can find about 100 tables of content with colourful drawings. If you point the mouse at a drawing, its word appears, whereas if you click on the drawing, its meaning appears.Among the Study pages you can find very useful documents in PDF format, divided into two categories, i.e. \\"Vocabulary, Grammar, Pronunciation\\" (a guide to pronunciation, determiners, homographs, homophones, irregular verbs, modal verbs, phrasal verbs, prefixes and suffixes, punctuation, regular inflections, regular verb tenses, relative clauses, word building) and \\"General Information\\" (common names, common symbols, computers, geographical names, letter writing, measurements and quantities, money, periods of time, relationships, sounds and smells, telephoning, varieties of English, work and jobs).I would give this item six stars, if only I could!
