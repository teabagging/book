This book has an uncommon spirituality and such a breathtaking grasp on human connections, that it is an appropriate gift for anyone in the midst of a loving, intense partnership or for anyone who has felt such ties to another person and has been forever changed. I give this to all my best friends who are getting married or simply pondering what it is to love someone else. Absolutely lovely, memorable."},{"Title":"Two-Part Invention: the story of a marriage","review":"M.

And also how marriage, above all things, is a beautiful, spiritual, sacrifice of self."},{"Title":"Two-Part Invention: the story of a marriage","review":"In creating a portrait of her life with Hugh Franklin (yes, ofthe soap opera), Ms. L'Engle employs a device she alsouses in her fiction: cutting back and forth between timesso that the reader is at once engaged in their courtship, inher mourning as she watches her husband die, in thebustle of their extraordinary lives. One engages in all ofthese at once, knowing the outcomes, suspense is not thepoint. When Hugh does eventually die, you have beeninvolved in the best and worst of the marriage and feel itscentrality in the author's life. Even after multiple readings,this chapter is good for a cathartic sob. Part of the remarkablegrip this book has on me is the humility of the author. Sheis unimpressed by her Newbery Award and tremendouscontribution to American letters, unimpressed by herhusband's fame as a television star. She is impressed,however, by their ability to share a life, to give themselvesto a family, and to balance those with maintaining theirindividuality and ensuring that each of them pursued theirdreams. Her priorities are clear, and without ever beingstrident or judgmental, this work is a gentle reminder ofwhat is important"},{"Title":"Two-Part Invention: the story of a marriage","review":"I read this book after receiving seperate recomendations by two people I trust- my sister, the English major, and my friend Jean: both had enjoyed the book a great deal.

I love the descriptions of Claudia's cleverly put together ensembles and her appreciation for art. That speaks to sensitivity and creativity.Betsy Sobak, Claudia's young charge is a virtuoso in the fine art of practical jokes. Her jokes are hostile and are always at the expense of another person. During Claudia's first sitting stint with Betsy, she falls from a tire swing and breaks her leg. Luckily for Claudia, her trio of sitting pals come through like the Cavalry by out-joking Betsy (in a safe way, of course) to teach her an object lesson in how to treat people in a humane fashion. Lesson: It is only kidding or funny if all sides are enjoying it, but if one side is not having fun, it is no longer kidding, it is mean.I liked Betsy. The description given of her sounds like a cute kid with a vivid imagination. Ann Martin has a real gift for descriptions, dialogs, character development and I like the way the charges have a parallel plot running to the central plot the sitters are contending with. Ms. Martin has a real gift for the voices and feelings of kids."},{"Title":"Claudia and the Bad Joke (Baby-Sitters Club, No. 19)","review":"Claudia's not worried when she hears her newest baby-sitting charge, Betsy Sobak, is a great practical joker.After all, how much harm can one little girl do?

This book doesn't seem to have that secondary story, which was too bad - I thought there were several chances for it, especially with Cathy, Claudia's hospital roommate. It didn't detract from the story, though.When a call comes in to the BSC from a new client, the girls voice some suspicion - the Sobak's live in an area where people usually use other sitters - so Claudia, who has taken the job, asks around. Told by other sitters that Betsy's a handful, and a practical joker, Claudia believes she's prepared. She has no idea! A practical joke goes badly and Claudia ends up with a badly broken leg.Missing a lot of school is not a good thing for a student like Claudia, who has to work hard just to keep up. With little to do, Claudia's mind dwells on her accident and she begins to wonder if babysitting is too dangerous. What if she had broken her arm or hand and couldn't do her art anymore? Prepared to quit the BSC if necessary, Claudia turns to her grandmother Mimi, who believes that her fear is really of not being in control.The girls set out to teach Betsy that practical jokes are not always funny - and they go a few rounds with the girl before she finally gets it. Betsy does learn, and Claudia does heal but will Claudia really quit the BSC?The practical jokes battles were amusing, and it was good that the girls were aware that they probably shouldn't be engaging Betsy in them. It was also nice that Stacey hasn't been forgotten. Martin always seems to do a very good job with those details.- AnnaLovesBooks"},{"Title":"Claudia and the Bad Joke (Baby-Sitters Club, No. 19)","review":"The Baby-Sitters Club books were fun to read back then when I was in elementary school, but they also taught valuable lessons. This one teaches how pranks might not seem to be a big deal, but people can seriously get hurt from them, like poor Claudia.

Suppose there was a land of shadow....&quot;In the imagination of Mitsumasa Anno, during the dark and sunless days of winter shadows go into a secret land of their own, where they frolic and play until the sunshine makes them go back and take their places in the world once again. But this would be a magical land where all the shadows in the world could come together and there be no problems of population or racial differences. Anno envisions a happy place, but allows that even in Shadowland there might be good and evil things.&quot;In Shadowland&quot; tells the story of one winter night when the shadows are interrupted at their games as the Shadowland watchman sees a poor light match girl standing barefoot in the snow in a town of the real world. Deserting his post, the Shadowland watchman come to her rescue, lighting match after match to help keep the young girl warm. But the light of the matches bring forth shadows and then the two worlds, that of people and that of shadows, are in an uproar and the watchman and the little match girl must flee for their lives.While the story is captivating so are the contrasting styles of the artwork that Anno provides. The &quot;real&quot; world is done in Western-style watercolor and ink paintings, while the fanciful pictures of Shadowland are black-and-white pictures done in oriental papercut technique, where each one is cut from a single piece of paper. The contrast is striking and enhances the simple story of what happens when the shadows raised on a a cold winter's night do not try to run away to Shadowland and a scared shadow monkey turns bright red with fright.Mitsumasa Anno has produced many beautifully illustrated books in the field of children's literature. Born in Tsuawano in the western part of Japan, Anno has subordinated his meticulous training in the techniques of art to the spirit of creativity that distinguishes his works. As you may well suspect from the characters in this story, Anno was inspired for the story of &quot;In Shadowland&quot; by the work of Hans Christian Anderson&quot; and in 1984 the writer-artist received the Hans Christian Andersen Award, the highest honor in the field of children's literature. After you read this enchanting book, you will understand why."},{"Title":"Tricia Guilds Country Color","review":"Tricia Guild's Country Color is a refreshing view of country life in England.

If you prefer her contemporary romantic suspense novels like _The Dancing Floor_, this is probably not for you. If, however, you love _Jane Eyre_ and books in the true gothic tradition--a sympathetic, adventurous heroine; a sinister villain; a bleak nineteenth-century setting; and increasing suspense and danger--this is a must-read. Michaels also offers her trademark enhancements of the formula in the shape of an engaging, humorous, and genuinely likeable hero (no brooding churl!) and welcome touches of humor. I find the heroine especially enjoyable, unlike Michaels's more recent heroines, who are more abrasive, defensive, and unsympathetic. This is perfect rainy-day or winter reading. If you listen, you can hear the howling of the wolves..."},{"Title":"Sons of the Wolf","review":"I have read this book numerous times, and each time it gets better. I even bought a hardcover copy because my paperback version is dog-eared and bent in several places because of how many times I have read it. The heroine in this book is especially likeable as is the hero. Even the villian is somewhat likeable because of the talent of the author. This book is in my opinion Barbara Michaels finest work and I have read all her books. Other books I would recommend by this author are &quot;Here I Stay&quot; and &quot;Vanish with the Rose&quot;. Also by her other pseudonym Elizabeth Peters, I would recommend the Vicky Bliss mysteries."},{"Title":"Sons of the Wolf","review":"Sons of the Wolf has to be Barbara Michaels greatest novel yet.

Yet the main question circulating throughout the novel is, who is the true wolf trying to devour the innocent sheep like sisters. If you love mystery and dramam I highly recommend you read this novel."},{"Title":"Sons of the Wolf","review":"This novel lacks the sophistication of many of Barbara Michaels' other works, but it offers a good read just the same. You have to get into the gothic spirit of the thing to enjoy it. Sure, it's silly and the wolves aren't that scary - and there are limited possibilities as to who the villain could turn out to be. But if you're a fan of that &quot;windswept moor&quot; kind of suspense novel, complete with carriages, heiresses, castles, and crumbling ruins by moonlight, then you will probably enjoy it. It's certainly not a bad specimen of the genre, and I found it fun to read. But if you're looking for a suspense novel like the author's Stitches in Time or Houses of Stone, you won't find it here. Sons of the Wolf just doesn't have that kind of intellectual breadth and it won't absorb you the same way."},{"Title":"Sons of the Wolf","review":"Sons of the Wolf by Barbara Michaels (also known as Elizabeth Peters) is a gothic romance set in the mid 1800s.The narrative takes the form of a semi-regular journal kept by Harriet Barton. Harriet and her cousin Ada have recently lost their grandmother, who was also their guardian. Having run out of closer living relatives, they are sent to live with Mr. Wolfson, their very distant cousin, and his son Julian. Julian is pleasant, if not particularly bright, and assiduously courts the beautiful Ada. Mr. Wolfson is confined to a wheelchair, and his two wolf-like dogs follow him wherever he goes. Just as Harriet finds herself adjusting to their new home, she encounters a disturbance in the form of Francis Wolfson, the older, previously undisclosed son. The villagers and servants try to warn her about the Wolfson family, but she dismisses their concern as superstition, and determines to hold to her own judgments.Francis, unlike his brother, seems uninterested in either girl, and finds his joy in stirring up trouble and turning the members of the house against one another. A band of gypsies and a handsome stable boy add complications when Ada is attacked on one of her daily rides, and the two dogs are a constant threatening presence. However, in good Barbara Michaels tradition, things are never as they seem, people's motives are clouded, and Harriet soon discovers a dastardly plot to deprive both girls of their fortune and freedom.The book is not long, but the plot doesn't come across as worn or trite. Harriet's character is very believable, and the story flows naturally from her eyewitness account. I found it a very pleasant for whiling away a few hours with a cup of tea. I rate it appropriate for 14 and older on the Aardvark scale due to frightening situations and violence.See more of my reviews at: [...]"},{"Title":"Sons of the Wolf","review":"I agree the book was slow at first, but then I could not put it down.

One was the Town Marshal, James E. Larimer and the other officer was Indiana State Trooper, John Streu.The killers of the two police officers were two young men, John Robert Lee, 17, of Greenwood, Ky., and Lonnie David Williams, 24, of Hammond, Indiana. Williams was a Viet Nam War Veteran and an escapee from the Putnamville, Indiana Correctional facility.When Williams made his escape, he made his way to Greenwood, Ky., where he met young Lee. The two became friends and then decided to head out for Arizona. They would first go to Hammond to visit with Williams' mother.They burglarized a store in Greenwood, taking a .25 caliber pistol and some cash from the cash register and headed north, hitch-hiking.At some point they hijacked an Ohio man and his car. Pulling into a motel they registered, and checking into the room they tied the driver up, taking his car keys and identification. They then headed for Hammond.Spending that night at the Williams' home in Hammond, the two headed south on Saturday morning. Arriving in St. John early that same morning, they decided to pull into the schoolyard and get some sleep.The two were awakened from their sleep by the two police officers who had been called by the school janitor who had become suspicious of the parked car.The rest is history... Two police officers are dead, one of the killers, 17-year-old John Robert Lee, is wounded and a third police officer to arrive on the scene is wounded.That very day, Saturday, February 20, 1971, Bill Tuley, St. John Town Board President, arrived at the scene minutes after the shooting, he swore he would do all in his power to see that the killers never would be freed from prison, that they would never see the light of day as free men again.He has spent thirty years of his life keeping that promise. He, and a few other dedicated people, have attended countless clemency and parole hearings, new trials and hearings to determine if a new trial should be granted to one of the killers.Thirty years later, Lonnie David Williams and John Robert Lee are still behind bars.This is his story..."},{"Title":"Opium and Other Stories (Writers from the Other Europe)","review":"Opium Dreams is a rather obscure little collection of short stories by a virtually unknown writer who died under bizarre and violent circumstances at the end of World War I. The stories are excellent dream-like journeys through the macabre world of addiction. From opium to absinthe, each story is a window which sheds light on the darker sides of the human mind caught in the throes of addiction.

But it still gets 5 stars!!"},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"This book keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. I like that you can see the clan through different cats' eyes rather than just Firestar's. The book is as just as good as the others and I encourage Erin to keep on writing."},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"It is my opinion that Erin Hunter did a terrific job with this book and the new series in general. This book features the new generation of warrior cats, including Brambleclaw and Firestar's two daughters, Squirrelpaw and Leafpaw (new medicine cat apprentice). It was great to meet these new characters, and even though Brambleclaw is not as beloved as Fireheart was, he still makes a pretty good main character. The book on the whole was satisfying and will delight loyal warriors fans (like meself^^).On to the weaker parts of the book-- mainly Squirrelpaw. Though she undoubtably gets her annoying stubborness from her cousin Cloudtail, Cloudpaw was somehow a more likable character. Squrrielpaw seems a bit cliched and weak, and besides she /is/ annoying. The new prophecy, too, is more complicated then those in the first series and includes much more of the Twoleg goings-on; but I'll say no more here.Though this new series has lost some of the simple charm of the first books and is a bit darker, loyal fans should be able to brush away these small flaws and thouroughly enjoy this new addition. I heartily reccomend it!"},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"I loved this book! I thought the series was over after The Darkest Hour and was so happy that there was another book.

Stormfur has a lil crush on Squirrelpaw i think. anyway i wont say no more they are good books and everyone i got to read them has LOVED them."},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"Their now is a new prophecy including one cat from each Clan to go on a long journey to save the clans from destruction. Brambleclaw of Thunder Clan, Feathertail of RiverClan, Tawnypelt of ShadowClan, and Crowpaw of WindClan go to the sun-drown place (the sea) to find out what to do to save their Clans. Not only the four chosen cats go though. Two other cats come along; Squirrelpaw and Stormfur go with them. Meanwhile back at the forest the Clans are wondering where they went because they didn't know they went on a journey. On the journey they meat a loner called Purdy who helps them through Twoleg place. When they get there they meet Midnight. They find out from Midnight that a great evil is coming from the forest.This book is as good as the first of the original prophecy, but is more adventurous. This book will make you want to read onward and find out how they escape the danger that haunts the forest. If you thought it was over at the end of the sixth book you need to think again."},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"These Books are great for any cat lover out there,Erin hunter(Both Authors)Thought up a wonderful story that anyone from 5 to 100 would enjoy.I highly reccomend this book!"},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"I thought this series was going to be not as good as the first one because I found out that Firestar wasn't going to be the main character anymore.

And that one cat from each clan,has been chosen to fulfill this prophecy that they were requested by Starclan. They all meet by the Fourtrees, and that's when their mission begins! If you want to read this book, go to the public library closet to you or maybe your school library if you want you can buy it like I did, but I recommend you read the whole series first (if you haven't!)

The writing really keeps you turning the pages and I can't wait to get back to the book to find out what will happen next.

However, when I started Midnight, I was not let down. In fact, the characters were far more interesting and had far better points of view than the characters in the first part of the series. The book was so intriguing I couldn't wait for the second and third novels and immediately went to buy them. The series even improves as the books go on. The cats have human emotions and are easy to relate to though I have to disagree with the person who said they did not seem like cats. It is easy to tell that these are cats rather than people talking because of their behavior, habitat and pastimes. Live on Leafpool!I must advise you though--the books are not for the faint of heart. Bloodshed and the rather frequent death are apparent in the stories."},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"Story begins in the eyes of a young warrior cat named Brambleclaw.

I'm sorry, but Midnight was probably the WORST book I have read. I'm still reading this series (Don't read this part, people who have not read Dawn yet) to see if Graystripe will come back (Okay, you can read this now) and if Firestar will become the main character and the heroe again (And I WON'T mind one bit if you kill off that idiot, Brambleclaw).

Not certain I will read this series with my grand kids.We are currently on book #3 (Forest of Secrets) of the first series (which I read all 6 books first before reading it with the grand kids)...While I prefer the one view point of the first series, there is no denying Erin Hunter is a Story Teller FOR ALL AGES."},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"Great you have to read this book but only if you have read the series before it , otherwise it will make no sense"},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"warriors is my favorite series!!!:) but still,compared to omen of the stars,the new prophecy isn't quite as interesting.power of three is better 2.but at any rate,read this first!-frostclaw of thunderclan"},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"I got the box set of this series as a gift, but i have already read this book in the library before, so i didn't read the one that came in my book set. anyhow, this book is fantastic! A great, suspenseful tale about a cat from each clan, (plus a couple extras) going on a long journey to save their clans from the two-legs, and their giant monsters that are digging up the forest!As all warriors books I've read, this series is a joy to read and contains lively words causing a lovely idea and picture to pop up in your mind, as if you were coming along with the adventurous and determined cats yourself!There are such great questions to ask about this book even before you read it at the sight of all the good reviews on it: Where will they venture into? What other cats will they encounter? How long will they stay in each area? What will happen to the clans while they are gone? The questions are countless. Chew on these until you get the book, if you are considering it.overall, this is a fabulous book. It paints a colorful image in your mind. I would suggest it to older children and above. There could be some parts like when a cat is being hunted or a cat is hunting itself, that may not my suitable for all ages, so i have reasons to why i say it is for a this certain age group. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask. I check back to all my reviews frequently."},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"First of all, let me just say that I am a writer. When I try to come up with ideas for stories, what pops into my head first is&#34; warriors...Clans...apprentices....&#34; These books have ironed themselves onto my heart, and I will give my children, and my childrens' children my copies, in the hope that they will love them too.Midnight, the first in the New Prophecy series, is a brilliant start to the second series. Midnight is fast-paced, full of suspense and enjoyment, and unexpected twists that will glue the book to your eyes.Midnight launches off with a fabulous prologue, in where StarClan choose the four cats who will hear what Midnight has to tell them. Erin doesn't make it clear who the four cats are, but she does drop some hints&#8230; such as the ShadowClan cat is halfClan, and that the WindClan cat is an apprentice.Next, we shift directly to Brambleclaw recieving the&#34; Darkness, air, water, and sky&#34; prophecy. Brambleclaw quickly dismisses the prophecy, until he has another dream about the sun-drown place, and Brambleclaw begins to connect the two dreams.Eventually Brambleclaw leaves on a journey with Squirrelpaw, Firestar's daughter; Tawnypelt, the ShadowClan cat; Feathertail and Stormfur, the RiverClan cats; and Crowpaw, the WindClan cat. They all recieved the&#34; Darkness, air, water, and sky&#34; prophecy, exept for Squirrelpaw and Stormfur, who tagged along to help the others.Meanwhile, the Clans have begun to notice more Twoleg activity in the forest. But when cats suddenly go missing, no cat knows what's behind these disappearances.As the cats struggle to find the sun-drown place to hear what midnight has to tell them, the Clans struggle against a force that even StarClan is powerless to ease. Can Brambleclaw, Squirrelpaw, and all the others overcome this challenge? Or will they be forced to leave the forest?Midnight is a wonderful book. It opens up the daunting question&#34; Will they have to leave the forest?&#34; to the rest of the series. This book nearly explodes with the suspense and the adventure. No matter where, Italy, France, the U.S.A, this book deserves to be on a bookshelf anywhere."},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"Overall, Erin, it was a good book, but I miss Firestar.

And I would love if you killed off those terrible idiots, Brook Where Small Fish Swim, and that total catastrophy, Blackstar.) Crowpaw is so annoying, you can't not hate him. I hope Erin kills him off by the end of the series. And, how could I have forgotten, what's the bad guy! In the original series, there was Brokenstar, Tigerstar, and Scourge! Now, it's just a _____________. Empty space. Nothing suprises me know, there is just the fact that it's an interesting journey.

Longtail's gone elder soft and Thornclaw's a bit more serious than before. Cloudtail is still a sarcastic cat and Brackenfur's gentle and strong.

Sorry, I don't mean Cinderpelt is narrorating. It definatly lived up to Warriors. I'm not giving anything away, but if you like Warriors, go and get it. I wouldn't suggest starting it without reading the other 6. In fact, Besides new characters in phrophecys, it doesn't seem like a new seris. That's ok, I'm not complaing. The only flaw is ypu don't hear so much on clan life. Sad, but it was great anyhow. The next book is Moonrise and comes out this summer. This is going to be another 6 book seris, and there might be a third seris. (...)Enjoy this book! It's a keeper!"},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"\\"Midnight\\" is not the best book in the \\"Warriors: The New Prophecy\\" series, but it is still a good read. This first installment in the series takes place a full year after the defeat of Tigerstar, Scourge, and BloodClan.The four warrior cat Clans of the forest have enjoyed many moons of peace. Firestar, the kittypet-turned-ThunderClan leader, now has two daughters -- the feisty Squirrelpaw and her milder sister, Leafpaw. But it is a peace that is doomed not to last. A young ThunderClan warrior, Brambleclaw, receives an ominous warning from StarClan and finds that three other cats have also gotten this message: his sister, Tawnypelt of ShadowClan; Graystripe's daughter, Feathertail of RiverClan; and the obstinate apprentice, Crowpaw of WindClan. The four chosen cats are joined by Squirrelpaw and Stormfur, Feathertail's brother, and set out on a journey to save the Clans.The main problem with \\"Midnight\\" is the fact that the story is told mainly from Brambleclaw's perspective, a big leap from the typical Firestar's point of view. Granted, it makes sense to have the story told from the main StarClan-chosen cat's viewpoint, but we barely know anything about Brambleclaw to start with. In the first \\"Warriors\\" series, we had plenty of time to get to know young Firepaw/Fireheart/Firestar before anything really major happened. But for poor Brambleclaw the story pretty much begins, \\"Here's a prophecy of certain doom, okay? Hurry up and go deal with it before the whole forest is destroyed and everyone dies.\\" Know what I'm getting at?Still, I liked this book. Despite its flaws, I think \\"Midnight\\" is an overall entertaining read. The series really picks up the pace with the next book, \\"Moonrise,\\" so if you don't particularly enjoy this one there's no need to give up hope. I would recommend it to any fan of this great feline fantasy series, though I'd advise you to read the first \\"Warriors\\" series before picking up the \\"New Prophecy\\" books."},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"At last Tigerstar and BloodClan are gone. The forest Clans are currently living in peace, but then Brambleclaw gets a mysterious dream from Bluestar telling of a prophecy and how he must meet with four other cats and listen to midnight. Brambleclaw struggles to make heads or tails of this dream. Meanwhile, Firestar's daughter Squirrelpaw continues to get on Brambleclaw's nerves. Although later on the cats get along better after Brambleclaw meets Feathertail, Tawnypelt (his sister), and Crowpaw, who is a rather irritating apprentice. Feathertail is joined by Stormfur, her brother who wants to protect her (both of the warriors are Graystripe's kits), and Squirrelpaw tags along as well.Firestar's other daughter Leafpaw (who's a medicine cat apprentice)worries about Squirrelpaw since she can tell what her sister is doing even when they're miles apart, which happens when the six cats go off questing for StarClan.Firestar, who is suddenly older and more distant and doesn't all seem like the insecure cat he was in the first series, can act rather unemotional at times and Graystripe, Cloudtail, Brightheart, Sandstorm, and pretty much all the cats in the first series are now all rather strict. Still, it's rather interesting to watch Squirrelpaw and Brambleclaw grow really close and it's cool how Firestar and Sandstorm had kits and so did Cloudtail and Brightheart (Whitepaw) and Dustpelt and Ferncloud (Hollykit, Larchkit, Birchkit)!

There's something about their little slit-eyed faces that just lights up my heart when I get home to that big, empty house. Without my kitties, that 2BDR 1BTH ranch would feel pretty lonesome. Fortunately, Whiskers, Persia, Sassy-Girl, ThunderNuts (my nephew picked that name), Sapphire, and \\"Gee\\" Clooney make me feel right at home.Naturally, my (human) friends search far and wide to get me gifts pertaining to my love of cats...and I'm always amazed at the treasures both of them are able to unearth!Case in point: the magnificent \\"Warriors\\" series of books. Frankly, in my honest opinion, ALL fiction should feature cats -- hence my love of Lillian Jackson Braun's cat mysteries. But whereas most cat-related stories involve humans in a lead role, the world of Ms. Hunter's \\"Warriors\\" illustrates just what literary magic can be achieved when the dramatis personae -- or draCATis personae, if you will -- consists solely of four-pawed angels who always land on their feet (i.e. cats).There's nothing about these books that I don't adore -- from the gripping titles to the lavishly illustrated covers, each one is a masterpiece that can't be contained by the word \\"cool.\\" Every night, I light some aromatherapy candles and whisk myself away to a world where warrior cat clans rule the wild. Only the fact that \\"Lost\\" is on TV makes me want to bother coming back to reality! Even better, I've been inspired to create my own \\"Warriors\\" fan-fiction (only some of which is suitable for all audiences).I'm sure that someday, I'll find a gentle, caring man who shares my love of \\"Warriors\\" and cats in general. I hope he has a mustache."},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"This was a good story and all but nowhere NEAR as good as the first 6 books.

The story isn't as suspensful with as much mystery, and the characters aren't as well-written this time around. The story is original, and I think that this series will pick up more later rather than sooner. I like getting more than one character's prespective in this series, which is an interesting element. Overall, I like the books, but this one in particular was quite the let-down after the first series. I am looking forward to the rest of the series, and I will definantly keep reading the books until they are finished publishing."},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"This book was as good as the first set of warriors!

The saying was only fire can save our clan. Now bramblepaw and 3 other cats fom differnt clans are out on a mission. it is them who are on a journey. with them is firestars dauter squirrelpaw and a warrior stonefur. the cats who were chosen were:bramblepaw, tannypelt, crowpaw, and featherheart.these cats set out on a amazing aventer and if you want to know what it is tjen read the book to find out!"},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"It was such a good book I wanted to read it really fast but I also wanted to savor the moments.

I am emotionaly attached to the first books 'cause my orange tabby kitty ran away and I WOULD LOVE to think that she joined a clan. All in all- this was a great book. I heard somewhere it was a trilogy and another place it was six books and I say JUST NEVER STOP WRITING THEM!

In Midnight, I don't like the new character Brambleclaw. I miss Firestar. I think it was much better to write about him. There is so much information lost between the sixth and the new book Midnight which makes it very confusing. I wish for the seventh book and not the New Prophecy.Amanda"},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"I could hardly believe it when I turned the last page of The Darkest Hour and saw the first book in the continuation of Warriors. At first I thought, \\"All right,Firestar's legacy continues. Then I read the bottom of the page, and saw that thier children were leading the show. Let me just say, the New Phrophecy, Midnight, was an exciting whirl of adventure, true-calling, and a great refresher if you've been just yearning for another Erin Hunter adventure. This is it. Though as the series moves on, it will become lopsided and a little repitive, but it will still be Warriors, and that is good enough for me. Twolegs are once again threatening the forest, but this time it is even more serious then before. Prey is scarce, the forest is being destroyed, and cats are dying. So the children of Firestar, Tigerstar,and Graystripe, are chosen by Starclan to find a new home. But will they succeed,and if they do so, will thier new home be any less dangerous?

I think Warriors, and The New Prohecy should get a New York Times bestseller, and even a Newbery award!!! It is so intresting how the cats operate, and battle for land. Even not fantasy, cats are still cool and mysterious creatures. So is you are looking for a good book this is the one!!! The number 1#!!!"},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"My friend drew me into Warriors a few months ago. I read all of the books, and was very exited when my parents allowed me to get Midnight. It was surprisingly adventurous, though to me it seemed as if Hunter was rushing through it. The main characters in this series, are, instead of Firestar, Brambleclaw((in the first series Bramblepaw)), Tigerstar's son, and Leafpaw, the apprentice medicine cat and Firestar's daughter. Leafpaw's sister, Squirrelpaw, is not at all like her sister. Midnight made you want to keep on reading once you began, and when the book ends you are held in suspence waiting for the next book. Midnight was truly fantastic! Tied with The Darkest Hour for my favorite book! Hope I helped. =)"},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"I really do love the Warriors books and this was another great book! I only gave it four stars because I miss Firestar alot! And in the first series I liked it how there was only one main cat that you where following around and they where like your friend, but in the new series it is leafpaw and Brambleclaw! But I do highly recomend ALL of the warriors books by erin hunter, especially the first series! I am not saying I did not love this book, I just liked the first series better! I guess ever since the first 6 warriors books I have been expecting the best lol :o) But don't take my opinion on it, Grab this book, curl up in bed, and read on! :o) have fun and I hope this is helpful!"},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"I don't know if it's the best in the Warriors series, but i loved it. There's a new prophecy and new characters, some still the same(Firestar, Brambleclaw, Cinderpelt, ect.) I say the best character in these books is Squirrelpaw, Firestar's daughter, an adventurous and outspoken cat. The beginning of the book makes you keep reading, you don't know what's going to happen. But in the middle it's not as suspensful, but still great. Then at the end you are left wondering what is going to happen. I think the Forest of Secrets is the best warriors book, but Midnight and the Darkest hour are tied for second. I read Midnight in three hours it was so good. Any Warriors fan will love this book!"},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"although this was a great book, the main character isn't firestar which was kinda dissapiontoing because the other books were about him. The story is about brambleclaw, tigerstars son. It doesn't have the same feeling as the other six. The plot isn't that interesting and its a little hard to follow, like the characters. The characters from the original are barley mentioned, like graystripe, firestar, sandstorm, barley in the book which pissed me of. ERIN TRY TO GO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL!"},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"Althougb I was partial to the first six warriors books that erin Hunter had written I loved this one just as much. It was nice to see the clan through another cats eyes (two cats eyes actually) and the plot drew me in. I could hardly believe what midnight was (was any one else a little stunned?) and the personalities of all the young warriors who were involved in the prophecy is well written. I cant wait for the next book in this series (moonrise) to come out (august cant come fast enough)Keep on writing Erin Hunter!!!"},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"This book is great, just like all the other Warriors books. It was good to have the focus off of Firestar, and see some other cat's point of view. It was also good to have cats from idfferent Clans working together, for a change.If you want to see more about Warriors, go to www.warriorcats.com Also, for those that don't know already, The New Prophecy is going to be a six-book series, I've heard, so we can all look forward to at least five more Warriors books!"},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"Like some others, I was a little surprised that Midnight doesn't have any new Clans, but only has a couple of differences. THe main one is that now that Firestar has grown-up the story comes from Brambleclaw's (remember Bramblepaw?) point of view, along with Leafpaw, apprentice medicine cat and Firestar and Sandstorm's daughter.I don't want to give away too much, so I'll just give a brief little description: In this edition of the Warriors, there is a new prophecy, (actually two), and Brambleclaw must go with some other chosen cats to the \\"sun-drown\\" place, and find out what they can do to save their forest from the worst fate ever. The book has a cliffhanger ending, and we have to wait for Moonrise to find out what the Clans can do to save their forest from destruction."},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"I loved this book. Erin Hunter did a marvelous job picking up the story and from new characters' perspectives as well. Warriors books I would still recommend to Tolkien fans and kids or teens who love fantasies. I believe that I got every penny's worth from Midnight. It's a book I could read again and again."},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"Okay, you know what? Cool it! Firestar was a little too good, a goody-goody. In my opinion, Brambleclaw's opinion is great! They're coming out with another book, all about Firestar, so calm it down.However, I have to say this series is following too much along the lines of the first one. *Don't read any farther if you haven't read all the way up to Starlight until you see the double *'s* Brambleclaw- a misfit like Firestar, chosen to fulfill something. Falls in love with Squirrelpaw/flight, also a ginger she-cat like Sandstorm. Then they fight, just like Firestar and Sandstorm. Leafpaw, medicine cat apprentice of ThunderClan, falls in love with Crowfeather of WindClan, and he falls in love with her. Just like Graystripe and his love. ** I would like to see this series have a little more originiality to it, but all in all, it's a great series."},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"This book was REALLY good. It wasn't at first what I was expecting, I thought it would be about Firestar, but it was still good. Although I love cats I never thought about their lives like that. It made me look at my own cats differently.I really love cats a lot more now. Its the kind of book you never want to put down. Brambleclaw is having strange dreams sent from Star Clan. After a while he learns that Crowpaw from WindClan, Tawnypelt from ShadowClan and Feathertail from RiverClan have shared the same dreams. Meanwhile Cinderpelt is having other strange dreams from StarClan. Firestar is afraid that it concerns his daughter Squirrelpaw that resembles him in a great way. Brambleclaw sets out to meet Crowpaw and Tawnypelt and Feathertail at fourtrees. They feel that StarClan wants them to go to a sun drown place [the ocean]. Squirrelpaw follows Brambleclaw and he agrees to let her come with him. Stormfur also comes with Feathertail, being her brother.They all set out for a journey that they don't know where it will lead. As they journey from place to place the four chosen cats all experience different signs from StarClan. Feathertail becomes very fond of Crowpaw along the journey. At the end of their journey they meet someone they don't expect. Its a totally awesome book that anyone will enjoy. HIGHLY RECOMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"I love all of the warrior series, and just because this book is from a different P.O.V. doesn't mean it's any different. The only problem I noticed was that Firestar had a daughter... I had thought that the clan leader and deputy weren't suppossed to have kits. What happened to that rule?I hope that this would be fixed, but that's just me. Observant and logical. Other then this minor mistake, nothing."},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"the warriors book midnight of the the new prophecy is an thrilling start to the new prophecy. altought i thought it started of a bit slow i really liked it. when i first started to read it i knew pracically wat was gunna happen so it was kinda like, when is this gunna happen! and stuf so i advice not to look throught the warriors timeline on the warrior cats website before reading this amazing series. but besides all that i thought ive liked the warrior cat series for so long. and i love erin huntwrs work! after the warriors series dont forget to get erin hunters series seekers."},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"this was a twist to the seires i am glad to have everything refreshed and love the new caracters. i myself am on the forth book in the new prophecy. i am enjoying the wholes seires and dont know what to do when i have finish the whole warriors all together. hope you will love this seires as much as i do. it came to my interest because fo my love of cats. i recamend this seires for cat lovers or adventure lovers. these books alway have a twist and suprise me. wish you a good reading! :) -haley ;)"},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"This book was a very interesting, with lots of adventure.

While reading this if you get to a spot that seems boaring keep reading it because it will get much better.Hope you like the bookIts good for even the whole family.:P"},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"Having constantly seen these books in the book store and hearing how good they were I really wanted to read some of them. That being said when I got the first book in the series I didn't realize I was getting the first book in the second series. So I never read the first 6 book in the Warriors series and my first Erin Hunter book is actually the second series about the Warrior Clans. Strangely enough I did read that Erin Hunter is not an actual person but is the pen-name for a group of 3-4 women who all write for this series; I just thought that was interesting. Anyway, on to the book review.This was an engaging, suspenseful, and fun to read book. It is about the four Warrior Clans of cats (introduced in the Warriors series). The story focuses on Brambleclaw who has a dream about salt water accompanied by a warning about a horrible storm that will come to the home of the Clans. When Brambleclaw finds that Warriors in the other Clans are also having similar dreams, he groups up with them and they go off on a quest to find the salt water in hopes that this will reveal the storm that is supposed to overtake their home.The book is well written; not anything spectacular but it is good reading. The cat's personalities are somewhat stereotyped but still well developed. This book reminded me very strongly ofTailchaser's Song. If you like this series I would definitely recommend you read Tailchaser's Song; it is a wonderful book if a bit darker than these books. There is quite a bit of action in this story; it is definitely a fantasy adventure type of story. The book kept me interested and pulled me right through the story. I am starting the second book as we speak because (although the main objective of the book is concluded) the events surrounding the main goal of the cats in this book are not concluded and you are kind of left hanging.My biggest complaint with this book is that in the first few chapters you have a billion names thrown at you and they are all similar so it is very hard to keep everyone straight. I think maybe I would have had an easier time with this if I had read the 6 books in the first series. Hunter does try to help you out by throwing an index in the front of the book with all of the Clans and all of the cats in the Clans; unfortunately that information didn't mean squat to me until I had struggled through the first few chapters. I decided to relax and just go with it; hoping that it would be easier to keep everyone straight when the cats took off on their quest. Ends up I was right, when the cats took off on their quest things got much better and I was much less confused. I still get the feeling though that Hunter didn't really need to introduce all those different Warrior cats in the first few chapters. Most of them don't play any role in the story; at least not yet. If not for the first few chapters I would have given this book more like 4.5 stars."},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"I used to work with feral cats, and we fed and managed the trap-neuter-return of many colonies, so my son and I really looked forward to reading this book together. The mythology is consistent, well-thought-out, and intricately connected to observable feral cat behavior. The author really knows her cats. However, the prose is not well-suited to reading aloud, as the sentence structure can be somewhat clumsy and the word choices are more utilitarian than poetic. The pacing of this book also seems a bit sluggish.My 8 year old son is thoroughly engaged in the saga, though, and that's the important thing. I don't have to adore the book, as long as it keeps him wanting to read."},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"This book really captures my imagination, says Taima, age 8 1/2.

Even older people could read it and I'm sure that it would be good for them too."},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"All of the Erin Hunter books are great!

Thank you for your help in my quest. Midnight is actually one of my favorite Warrior books."},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"First, I wanna say that I'm a loyal Warriors reader and I still love them all to death.But... This book, quite frankly, SUCKED.The characters, for starters, were dull. We barely know who Brambleclaw is, having never seen things from his point of view before, and suddenly he's our main character. Well, that would be okay if Erin had given us some ground under his feet before he took off into the woods. In Warriors 1 (Into the Wild) it was slow and easy, not a particularly complicated plot. It was great because then we got to know little Firepaw well enough so that when he raged into battle against ShadowClan, we cheered him on and prayed for his saftey. It just doesn't work here. Not enough time for character development makes a dull, seemingly overly-dramatic plot. Next on my list would probably be Squirrelpaw. She's probably the most annoying character I've ever had to read. ATLEAST make her SOMEWHAT likeable. The rest of the 'chosen cats' were dull, boring, lifeless characters. That was dissapointing, since Graystripe's kits should be vivacious and spunky like he is.Firestar seemed really out-of-character in this book. I'm so use to him now that I've seen him change from a young, hopeful apprentice, eager to fit in to a fierce, noble warrior who's determined to keep his Clan safe. Now, he's... I don't know how to describe it. But it doesn't seem like Firestar would do that to Brambleclaw and Squirrelpaw. He's just not the type. It just didn't work.This was the worst Warriors book by a mile. Erin, you're losing your touch."},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"WHAT THE HECK IS UP WITH ERIN HUNTER? Why did she switch the viewpoints like that? All Bramblepaw is is a even better Firestar without all his errors... He is just a goody goody freak. Why change viewpoints when you have already made your audience love the character you gave them in the first book. In this book Firestar is a dumb, old cat who is just mean. She also pretty much takes out all the other good characters like Graystripe, Dustpelt, Sandstorm, Ravenpaw, Barley, and lots of others."},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"This will be a great book!

The cats are not catlike - for example - they sleep at night and get going at daybreak. If you view them as people in fur coats with human emotions - jealousy, love, hate, ambition - it helps a lot.I found the first five books very depressing - just a series of unfortunate events without the humor - but book 6 is worth reading - a mix of courage and friendship, love and joy, as well as the terrible things that happen in life. Everything a good story should be."},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"I've seen these books around and saw them on the bestseller list so I read this one with high expectations. I was pretty disappointed. I only finished it to see if it got better.Maybe it's just bad timing, but it so reminds me of the \\"brat-coms\\" on TV - the youngsters are mouthy to their parents, know better than the \\"adults\\", lie, tell half-truths, and are sneaky because they're \\"right\\" and the adults aren't trustworthy and \\"just wouldn't understand\\". Yeah, that's not a message I need to reinforce with my kids anymore than they're already getting in the media.Whatever happened to books with actual ethics and true honor, instead of this pseudo-ethics \\"ends justify the means\\" stuff?

This is how Brambleclaw, warrior of ThunderClan, must now embark on a journey to find the answer he needs to figure out the prophesy.The setting of the story is present day and takes place in the forest, a small town, and the coast. The main characters of the book are Brambleclaw and Squirrelpaw, cats of ThunderClan, Stormfur and Feathertail, cats of RiverClan, Crowpaw, young apprentice of WindClan, Tawnypelt, a she-cat of ShadowClan, and Leafpaw, Squirrelpaw's sister.The plot of the story is about Brambleclaw, a warrior cat of ThunderClan who must find the answer to a new and grim prophesy foretold to him by his warrior ancestors in his dreams. He later finds out that he must now journey to the coastline to seek the answer he needs to save his clan and all the other clans of the forest. He is accompanied by cats from the other clans, for they have had the same dreams as him. Now six cats must journey to the coastline so that they can \\"listen to what midnight tells them\\" before all four clans of the forest are destroyed by an unpredicted threat.The theme of the book is about how important teamwork can be. Unfortunately I don't know what the title of the book stands for. The pacing of this book is really fast and the authors craft is excellent because the author leaves cliffhangers at the end of every chapter, encouraging you to keep reading. I don't think this book is in a Christian perspective because when cat die they don't go to heaven, they go to StarClan. I have no negative opinions of this book. I recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure and fantasy books."},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"ok. all these people are complaning about not getting what firestar says in book 6 sunset about his quest. and people are also saying that there was a huge space in between the first series and the new one. well there is a new book coming out soon called FIRESTARS QUEST and it will explain all that stuff. and for all you people who miss firestar as the main character, he will be the main character in FIRESTARS QUEST.THIS IS THE BEST SERIES EVER AND I THINK IT IS JUST AS GOOD AS THE FIRST ONE!"},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"This was the first Warriors book I got and I thought it was awesome.

By the way, gee, thanks to all the people who sent in reveiws that either spoiled the ending or said that any of the characters were stupid, boring, idiots, wished they were dead, or said the plot was horrid. All the characters did their best. in conclusion, this book should be read by any Warriors fan, especially one who wanted more when the first series ended. Warriors (and this book) ROCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!p.s.

At first, they are unsure of how to handle this, I mean surely their warrior ancesters would have given the signs to their medicine cats or their leaders. But as more prophecies come, the four cats become more positive about them being the chosen to carry out the quest to Midnight. One night, as planned, Brambleclaw sneaks out of camp to meet the others so that they could begin their journey. On the first meeting with the others, Squirrelflight had followed Brambleclaw and found out everything, so he had no choice in letting her go with them along Stormfur, Feathertail's brother and Greystripes son.On their way to the sun-down-place, they encounter Smudge, a loner, who leads them through Twoleg yards and neighborhoods. When they to the sun-down-place they find that Midnight is a badger who can speak to Starclan. She gives them a horrible prophecy that predicts the distruction of the forest and the Clans if they do not stop them from leaving their homes and finding new a new territory to live in. The prophecy says, \\"Darkness, Air, Water, and Sky Will Come Together...and Shake the Forest to it's Roots.\\" This book is wonderful and full of surprises. Read it and you'll see how much you will love it!"},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"This first one in the series worried my son, he was afraid that it wouldn't be as good as the other series because it didn't focus on the same characters, but he was thrilled when he got to know the new cats in this series. These books have been incredible for my 9 year old. This is the second series that he's read in the Warriors group by Erin Hunter. He uses the language that the cats in the book use, and he often comes to tell me about some exciting twist that has happened, or a new character that he's falling in love with. These have been great for his reading speed, he's reading much faster and with greater recall since starting these books a few months ago. I highly recommend them."},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"As I'm sure you've heard of all the series(warriors, the new prophecy,the sight,manga series about graystripe, and Firestar's Quest) but this isone of the best."},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"This book is one of the most thrilling and magneficent books I've read. And the second book is even better!!!!!"},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"Warriors: MidnightBy: Erin HunterAre you a fan of animals? How about fantasy? This is a brilliant combination of the two. The sequel to the best-selling Warriors series, Midnight is the first book in Warriors: The New Prophecy. I couldn't put this book down. It's loaded with action and lots of cliff-hangers. The story follows young warrior cat, Brambleclaw, and his companions from all the other warrior cat clans, on a journey to save their home.After a message from his warrior ancestors, StarClan, Brambleclaw of ThunderClan, accompanied by one or two cats from each clan, is on a journey to save the forest of wild cats. But to do this, he must journey through a town of twolegs (humans) and through a new, different forest, filled with dangers.I'm sure any animal and fantasy lover of the age of 9 through 13 will enjoy this. This is a fantastic book for cat-lovers. But if you are a person who enjoys happy endings, this one does not end very happily. The ending will have you begging to read more."},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"I found this book at Borders when I was browsing the shelves. It caught my eye, so I bought it. The first page was amazing! This book holds the readers' attention. I was actually sad when the book ended, wishing it'd go on. Fortunatley for me, there was a sequel. The sequel, \\"Moonlight\\", is good too, as is the rest of the series down to the last word."},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"This book was really really great! Any cat or fiction reader should love this book!Summary: There has been peace among the Clans for many moons since BloodClan was driven from the forest. But a new prophecy has been made known to the cats. A great danger is coming to befall the forest and StarClan has chosen the warriors that will save the forest.Brambleclaw, Tigerstar's son in ThunderClan, has recieved a dream where Bluestar gives him the message to meet three other cats and hear what midnight has to say. He travels to FourTrees and meets the others: Tawnypelt, his sister who now lives in ShadowClan; Feathertail, Graystripe's daughter in RiverClan; and Crowpaw, an young apprentice from WindClan.At first, they are reluctant and unsure but, after reciving more signs from StarClan, they decide to head to the sun-drown place. But they dont go alone, they are accompanied by Squirrelpaw, Firestar's daughter, and Stormfur, Feathertail's brother. Together the six cats journey to the sun-drown place, hoping midnight will give them a clue to save the forest.But there is trouble in the forest. Leafpaw, Firestar's other daughter who is studying as a medicine cat, has gotten messages from StarClan as well. Fire, tiger, and trouble. Could this refer to Firestar's daughter Squirrelpaw and Tigerstar's son Brambleclaw? And the Twolegs are closing in with their monsters. What do they plan to do?This series is so great! I think its even better than the first. Firestar was cool and all but the idea of a cat from each clan working together was more appealing than just one cat who whined too much. No offense to Firestar.Cant wait for the next book. I heard this might only be a trilogy but I hope that's wrong. Its a quick read but its worth it!"},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"Yes, it was as good as the first series. First, there were characters we cared about - Leafpaw, Squirrelpaw, Brambleclaw, Tawnypelt, Crowpaw, Cinderpelt, Firestar, Graystripe, Sandstorm, Ravenpaw, etc. And an adventure. And, of course, Erin Hunter's simple yet descriptive writing style. And who could forget prophetic dreams? Ah, yes. These reasons are what made the original Warriors series good.However...I have now realized just how much the first series depended on the tension of expecting a battle to happen anywhere, at any time. This suspense is a large part of what made me a Warriors fan. Midnight, while written well and with characters we care about, lacks this suspense. This is actually strange, since the plot is moving faster in Midnight than in Into the Wild. There was suspense and tension near the end, though, which was definitely something good.I also realized just how much the original series depended on subplots. In Midnight, there are virtually no subplots. At least, none that I remember. The subplots in the original series were interesting, and a reason they were so suspenseful. I guess this is a factor contributing to the lack of suspense in Midnight.When I say lack of suspense, I do not mean lack of interest. I have read worse books before. Midnight is an interesting book, but with a lack of battles, it can be viewed as boring.There was one way in which Midnight surpassed the original series, however. Characterization. This is a very important thing in a story. In Warriors, the main characters had some sort of personality, and sometimes it was strong, but most of the time, the cats weren't really that different from one another. In Midnight, each cat has their distinct personality, and it is communicated in a much better way to the original series.Not to compare it further to Warriors, Midnight is a pretty good book. Its lack of action in the middle and beginning could make a boring read, but the ending was superb. The writing was smooth and descriptive. The characterization was above average, if not great.Midnight is a book worthy of bookshelves and libraries everywhere."},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"You justcan't beat it! It is the only book series that I have become addicted to. I find myself thinking about the book and this seried throughtout the day wondering \\"I wonder if my kitten Spice would make a good clan cat?\\" or \\"Will the cats make it back in time?\\" It's an awsome book. Recomened to any 11 year ols that are completely in love with cats =)."},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"I have read all 7 books, and each one was great, but i like this one because of how the villain's son ends up as the main character. And how he and 5 others carry the burden of every life in the forest on their shoulders. It takes place around a year after book 6. Firestar has kits and Bramblepaw is a warrior. But it takes a while to get used to the new prophecy, no more Firestar as the main character. Check out warriorcats.com for more info!!!!"},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"This book, in my opinion, is not the best in the entire Warriors world. Before it was released, I heard much debate over whether it would be new clans and characters or old ones. Upon opening the book, I was quite surprised by who Erin Hunter picked as a main character. Brambleclaw, or Bramblepaw then, was my favorite character in books five and six, but I don't think he's such a great main character. Also, an interesting new thing in this book is that it switches perspectives for longish periods of time.The book starts out with a wonderful prologue, and the first half is almost the best section in the series. The rest, though, doesn't move along to fast. The starting has the action and suspense that draws readers into the Series, but the further parts just are one thing after another. There's one outer plot. Nothing else. And it's mostly the same. The last few chapters, though bring back the suspense we saw in the first part. Unfortunately, it leaves right in the middle of a suspenseful, surprising ending. One of the nice things about it, though, is that in the ending, I had no idea what was coming. There are hints throughout the book, but the ending gives it more substance.The characters in this book are very well-developed, though that may come from having fewer characters you meet on a regular basis. Each has its on strong personality, its own history and its own abilities.I found this a great book, though some of the books in the first series outrank it. But if you've read the first series, this is a must-have continuation of the much-loved books."},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"Any Warriors fans will be hooked on Midnight-- I know I was! It is different from the first series, mainly because its from Brambleclaw's point of view now, as well as Leafpaw's (Firestar's daughter) at some points. I missed hearing Firestar's thoughts, but it was also exciting to hear from another cat for a change. Several moons have passed, so there are some other changes that come as a surprise... the end of a book is a huge shock; it hints at something coming that will completely change the series. THe new characters are great and it's just as adventurous as the previous books, but the new phrophecy will give you something different to think about. If you haven't read the rest of the series, do so before reading this book, as you'll be confused, but I highly recomend fans of adventure and animals to get into it! It's not superb writing, but the plot is extremely well- developed, original, and gripping, and the characters are super! You get to know everyone and every aspect of Erin Hunter's world."},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"This is a story about a cat named Brambleclaw. Brambleclaw had a prophecy from star clan and so had three other cats. The three other cats are from shadow clan, Wind clan, and River clan. There was also two other cats named Squrielpaw and Feathertail. The chosen cats thought it was their duty to profil the prophecy. So the three cats travel without telling any other cat other than Leafpaw (Squrielpaw\`s sister). The six set off together and met an outsider named Purdy. Purdy showed them the way to get passed the tweloges' nest (Us). While the cats were gone their clans began to worry. Leafpaw was the only one that new and this was hard to keep secret from their father who worried so much about them. Come along with them as they fight battles and taste salt water. As they find this place see what they meet and what they have to do. What does this prophecy have in store for them? Will they survive?I liked this book a lot. It gave such could detail and it makes you guess what is going to happen. I make you feel like you are there and it makes you cry. The characters are interesting and are good and described. What I didn't like was the cruelly to the animals. I know it isn't really but it was still mean. This is the only thing that I really disliked.I would recommend this book to people that love the Redwall series. I would also recommend this to people that love cats as much I do.

Half of the book doesn't take place in the forest but that doesn't mean the book is bad. It still is in my top ten books I've read. While the third book in the series is still my favorite. This book still competes with it. The book's main charatcter is Brambleclaw, Tigerclaw's son,Firestar had kits, Squirellpaw, who is very annoying, and Leafpaw, a young kit training to be a medicine cat,.

Him and three other cats, Tawnypelt (his sister) feathertail (graystripe's daughter) and Crowpaw (an annoying windclan apprentice)were chosen for the journey, but really six cats come, Stormfur who is feathertail's brother comes because of their strong bond with each other.

If you combine those two, you get a pretty good idea of the book, with Bramble claw and all the other cats chosen. I also like how she has written it, with the cats being organized in their Clans, and how Hunter's material is so purely her own, not anyone else's.

At first I was struggling to remember which cats were which and keep track of the new characters, but after the first 50 pages or so, I had them all straight.Basically, this book is not about Firestar, as the last six books were, but it's about Tigerstar's son, Brambleclaw, and also about Leafpaw, the medicine cat in training, at some parts. Brambleclaw has a strange, almost prophetic, dream and discovers that three other cats have had that dream. Soon Brambleclaw has another dream about a large place filled with salt water, and he and five other cats travel there on StarClan's wishes. Once there, they receive some shocking news about the fate of the forest, and must return home. The book then ends in a cliffhanger.I enjoyed reading about different cats for once, but this story might have been even better if it were told by a cat in a different clan, like Tawnypelt. This book is definately worth a read, but only if you've read all six books in the original series. I also recommend getting it from the library, borrowing it from a friend, or waiting for the paperback, because I personally don't think the price for the hardcover was worth it."},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"I absolutely love this book!

Have you seen everything you love be destroyed? Midnight shows us the Forest Cats watch their beloved forest be destroyed. This is a nice blending of many problems, coming together to make the protagonist's life miserable. But the author also avoids a complete melancholy state in the book. And that would normally destroy any chances of enjoying the book. Brambleclaw, an inexperienced Thunderclan warrior, must lead five cats from other clans into unknown places to find the sun drown place, which is where Starclan will apparently divulge the truth. But he must hurry, because Twoleg monsters (cars) are destroying what the cats have called home for many generations. This adds another problem that just destroys the protagonist's confidence. But rather than make the book depressing, the author recurrently adds things that show a bright side, which keeps you reading. Including the fact that Stormfur is always there and always allies with Brambleclaw, which shows Brambleclaw that he is not a total idiot. The author also makes the settings and characters in such a way that there is no one specific antagonist. The antagonist jumps from character to character which contributes to the protagonist's life being horridly saddening. Unfortunately Brambleclaw's companions do not support him and his uncertainty of Starclan's faith crushes his hopes. Crowpaw, the worst, has been tormenting him. And Tawnypelt, his own sister opposes every decision Brambleclaw makes. At least Squirrelpaw is there, which motivates him. This shows that the author does not just put in blind fantasy, but also shows an emotional side, which attracts more readers. The book nicely blends emotional and fantasy like problems, which allow for a nice \\"gumbo\\" of elements, forming a very nice book, satisfying all reading appetites.

The original series was great, the characters were well drawn out and it made you want to read on. But this series takes a death spiral as copy cat (no pun intended) characters are quickly etched out of the original. Brambleclaw is basically a more perfect Firestar while squirrel paw is possibly the first ever bimbo like character that has been transformed into a cat. Not only is plot flat, the villians are as thin as card board. Firestar and the original characters turn into robotic kitties while his dim witted daughter and dead beat bramble claw destroy the forest. If you love warriors, don\`t read this. But if you must save your money and go to a library.

When I got the New Prophecy box set for easter (it arrived a month earlier than Amazon expected it to - kudos!) I immediately started reading but... What's this? Really? Erin Hunter have made many mistakes during the first season:-Overlapping/messed-up timelines and events-Getting facts/events wrong in flashbacks-Describing the same cat differently at different moments-Word/phrase repetitions (\\"with a pang of...\\", \\"he drank in the air\\", \\"It was Tigerxxx!\\" and so on and on and on)-Almost insultingly frequent reminders of what had previously happened as if the readers are too dumb to remember key moments-A poor balance between humor and blood/death/goreBut all those were forgivable because the suspense could be breath-taking. Some scenes are real heartbreakers.But this new series? I've passed page 160 and I'm still waiting for something to happen. No, having dreams all the time and feeling guilty about not telling anyone about your plans/worries, is not \\"something happening\\".Also, I finally see why some writers say you should stick to ONE character's omniscient point of view. There is frequent, chaotic head-hopping (the point of view alternating between multiple characters in short intervals without actually being necessary). And often it's not even needed. Sticking to one character worked very well and was very engaging in the first series. However, the second series feels like a black tie party: You talk to all the guests, but it's all fleeting and overlapping chitchat, whereas in the first series, it felt more like you were sitting with one guy telling you, with passion, his whole story.Here, nothing has happened so far.Also, while it's cute to tell another cat's story, Firestar, the previous main character, plays too little of a role. All the characters I learned to love during the first series, are now minor sideshows. And since Brambleclaw's loyalty is no longer being questioned, his heritage isn't an issue either now, so he's also a less interesting, conflicted character than Firestar who always had to defend himself about his roots. He's a boring character. The only thing that ever made him interesting, was his father, and he is dead, so there. This seems to be a random quest with random excuses for random Warriors elements such as StarClan, journeys and of course, the unrelenting death and violence.Boo."},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","review":"This book is very intersting.

In this sense, it is more a history of the modern world - and of events that brought this about - rather than of the world as it may have been at any selected time in history. Given this logic, areas like China, for example, tend to receive attention more proportional to Roberts' assumptions on their place in the world at the time of writing, rather than in respect to how powerful and influential they may once have been (or may soon become).Accordingly, this history starts off more-or-less in the traditional way, with much emphasis being placed on the early Middle Eastern / Mediterranean civilisations (the Sumerians, the Egyptians, the Greeks, etc). It then progresses comfortably to the rise and fall of Rome (and the Greco-Roman Empire) and then to the tumultuous rise of (especially Western) Europe to world supremacy. As we know, this then passes on to America and (for a while) Russia.All the other main players, such as Japan, China, India, and the Ottoman Empire (to name only a handful) receive their due chapters (often with much emphasis on how they affected or otherwise failed to affect Europe). Then of course such civilisations as those once belonging to the Americas get their coverage partly because we've heard of them, partly because it's important to see how Western civilisations swept them away, and partly (I venture to say) because without the Americas the book would hardly seem geographically balanced.What I am getting at here is that this book might disappoint some people who want for a more balanced perspective on history, but it shouldn't significantly bother anyone who is happy to read the chain of events as outlined above. As I have already touched upon, some justification can be found in the fact that Roberts is really more interested in giving us a history as far as it has shaped today's world. Another thing to bear in mind is that it is merely a one volume book, and as such much of these limitations are quite unavoidable. This is the first thing that a reader must come to accept if he or she is going to enjoy this book (and readers who are looking for a more balanced and thorough account need to appreciate that they will ultimately have to read a great many related books). After all, there is much history to be understood from this book, even if it cannot hope to fit the whole history of the world so neatly into only one volume.Second:The other thing to accept or appreciate is more a matter of the book's register. For example, it may help if the reader already has some general historical knowledge; it is very much a book for people who are already fascinated by history. (There are much more entertaining reads for those who are relatively new to the subject. Try something by Giles Milton, or read something more specific - say, about WWII, or any other particular history that interests you.) In other words, I doubt this is a book to inspire in the uninitiated a new found love for historical literature, but if you already have this love then this book will do much to further your interest and consolidate your knowledge.By way of another example, I am at the moment two-thirds of the way through reading 'The Penguin History of Europe', by J.M. Roberts - I have already read many similar histories (such as 'Europe: A History', by Norman Davies) - and I find Roberts' style to be very similar in both books. It is in no way nearly as balanced or compulsive as other reads (Davies' book is brilliant for this), but it is thorough, educational, and mostly enjoyable, and it keeps me turning the pages. However, it may say something to add that I have read perhaps seven or eight other books since starting on this one if only to keep it light, and so neither reads are easy.Overall, 'The New Penguin History of the World' is a thoroughly good book. It is mostly interesting, always educational, and it pretty much accomplishes what it sets out to do. If you can accept the near-inevitable Western emphasis on this book, and if you are already something of a history buff, then I am sure that you will fully enjoy this read. I may have found it a challenge - sometimes getting through a chapter could be nearly overwhelming - but this reflects more on the depth of the work than on the style in which it is written. It is much to say for the book that despite the density of the thing it kept me happily turning the pages for weeks on end."},{"Title":"The New Penguin History of the World: Fourth Edition","review":"This is the last edition of the book there will be. Roberts died soon after he finished this book. The original one volume \\"History of the World\\" was the best one volume world history book in existence. The update is well worth the price for it as well. I own several editions of the book.I would compare the excellence in quality of the book to the 11 volume \\"Story of Civilization\\" series by Wil Durant. Of course, Durant's works are in many cases outdated today. Roberts updated his work in order to \\"fix\\" things where evidence has leaned one-way or-another over the last several years, as well as to bring it up-to-date with the fall of the Soviet Union and the new global supremacy of the United States.Of course, Roberts only hits the highlights. But he doesn't ignore anything; even so-called minor issues are discussed. In many ways, he is outlining how the modern world came to be the way it is. All too much of what passes for history now a days is really little more than gossip about minor events in the relatively recent past. The grand sweep of historical events is often lost. Looking at well sells as history books today can make one cringe that somebody would read something, let alone write it.Because people lack and true appreciation and understanding of history, they seem to be electing leaders who also lack the willingness to learn from past events. Democracy is on - at the very lest - a tenitive rise. Leaders need to know how Rome or Britain affected things in the modern political landscape. Churchill made decisions that are still being played out in the Middle East and Iraq today. Roman and even ancient Greek leaders had to deal with the issues of in the Balkans in southeast Europe over two-millennia ago. You can't fully understand the former Yugoslavia without understanding Roman province carving and its long term affects on world history.How can leaders hope to make the best decisions if they don't understand the causes of the original problems? And since democratically elected leaders are, at least in the West, the norm now, people need to understand history in order to recognize people who understand it.Roberts tries to restore the grand scope to the matter of human history. Something people and our political leaders seem to have very much lost sight of now. True History, the whys and wherefores need more attention."},{"Title":"The New Penguin History of the World: Fourth Edition","review":"Not having read his older version I have no idea how it compares or how much has been changed and/or added. My first attempt at a straight through read of a book on the subject, I am confident I made a good choice in picking up this particular book.Some have said that this book suffers from an over-abundence of euro-centrism. I would disagree. If your conception of a fair portrayl of world history is the collection of \\"national\\" (for lack of a better word) histories each given an equal amount of attention (or even an amount of attention proportinate to their achievments within their borders), then this book will certainly not satisfy you. In this book, great civilazations (such as the chinese, japanese, and native americans) that were more isolationist in ideology get compartively little attention because they contributed compartively little to the lives of those living outside their oversight. Therefore, in selecting national histories to focus on, Roberts spends a large portion of the time discussing the history of europeans because they played a large role (\\"for better or for worse\\" he acknowledges) in the histories of other people. That europeans, for better or for worse, have succeded more then any other people in spreading their idealogies and influences is less a matter of opinion and more a matter of fact.So if you are interested in a 1200-page, slightly sophisticated introduction to world history, with a particular focus on war and economics, I would heartily recommend this book."},{"Title":"The New Penguin History of the World: Fourth Edition","review":"There are two ways to write history, one as a tapestry that follows the threads of social themes continuously through the ages, the other as a mosaic that jumps from major event and personality to major event and personality. The New Penguin History of the World is solidly in the first camp, more a social history tracing such things as economics, politics, and religion than a compendium of the events that resonate most loudly in our past. Each approach has its pros and cons. The mosaic can oversimplify as the author attempts to crystallize long term and continuous trends into discrete events but it also provides clear milestones of major changes and their consequences. The tapestry can weave a more continuous story of important topics one at a time but can veil as much as it reveals. Sadly this book veils and clouds a lot more than I think it has to.For the positive I cannot give the book anything less than four stars because it is simply a breathtaking achievement, literally a history of the world from \\"cave-man\\" times (obviously analysis of anthropological evidence and not \\"events\\") to around 2007 (updated by a second author for the more recent years after Mr. Roberts' passing.) It also does an excellent job of filtering out the most important aspects of such a giant topic, and even at 1188 pages of densely packed text can only scratch the surface. In the end you will be put on an excellent footing for further reading on nearly any subject of history and to be able understand it in its comprehensive context by reading this book. It is thus eminently worth it. (Even though, it can literally take months to read.)However some negatives did detract. Although a \\"tapestry\\" as explained above it doesn't really draw any sweeping conclusions of convincing or profound nature (it does make a small few attempts), something of a lost opportunity given its amazing scope. As a matter of fact he is rather open about tending to avoid such conclusions. Any judgement from history would be non-final and arguably biased but I would rather hear the author's best and most insightful stab at it and then think over whether I agree or disagree than be left with nothing to mull over. However this is not to say that he doesn't provide any attempts at explanation, he does sometimes, and it's a sad disappointment that the whole world appears a nail. Mr. Roberts wields the hammer of \\"overpopulation\\" and this becomes the reason for every ill almost any society throughout history has encountered. Demography is certainly one of the most powerful forces driving history on a scale such as this, but the author seems to lack any imagination or will to attempt other perhaps more plausible explanations for many world events. Near the more recent part of the book you can see more clearly that the author also brings a progressive bias. Although there were many small cases (far more praise for Democratic US presidents, backhanded compliments for the Republican ones, reform always being described as necessary and change always described as good, etc.) the thing that struck me most egregiously was that in his page or two on Mao Tze-Tung he spent more time on the fact that Mao wrote poetry than he did on the fact that Mao has the blood of more people on his hands than any other person who has lived in history. Mao is ultimately presented as a great modernizer who made some missteps along the way. A small example, but one that for some reason I felt particularly telling.Nonetheless the drawbacks do not approach undoing the value of reading the book. A great, solid foundation for learning world history, one that I am glad to have read and makes me interested in further detail reading."},{"Title":"The New Penguin History of the World: Fourth Edition","review":"I've been a reading a lot of history in the last few years, each book an in-depth study of a particular period or country or a recurring theme. Quite often I realized that I didn't understand the offstage action, so I went looking for a broad-brush world history to provide some context for my *other* reading. If that's what you are looking for, this book is ideal.It is Euro-centric. But if you are interested in how events in one part of the world affected another, for long stretches of world history what happened in, say, Japan had no bearing on anyone but the Japanese."},{"Title":"The New Penguin History of the World: Fourth Edition","review":"I must sadly agree that there is simply not enough coverage of many regions and their rich histories: Roberts' unfortunately places too much emphasis on the flowering of Europe and its tremendous, ambivalent impact on the rest of the world. For those of us who might have been intrigued by finding out more about the Muslim heritage in SouthEast Asia (and its dialogue with Hinduism, Buddhism and Confucianism) - or the kingdoms of Benin, Congo, or Oman - the book is, on that score, a disappointment.So why four stars?Because the book is nonetheless VERY VERY GOOD. Roberts is never dry or dull, and attempts to be judicious and coolly objective. His partisanship is I suspect structural, not rhetorical. Narrative history at its best is enthralling, provocative and entertaining. This is narrative history close to its best.And those who feel the need to castigate Roberts for any reference to September 11, 2001 should be aware that Roberts mentions that tragic event to argue AGAINST the defining role in world history that many have claimed for it. He is according it its PROPER place against the polemics surrounding it."},{"Title":"The New Penguin History of the World: Fourth Edition","review":"It took me two separate mult-week sessions to complete this tome, about 1200 pages of small print, but it was well worth the effort. Reading this book gave me a much better Big Picture grasp of human history. Of course a single book covering thousands of years of history is going to pick and choose what to devote attention to, so anyone can nitpick the choices, but it's really a great accomplishment.The first half of the book covers pre-history through the Middle Ages, and the second half proceeds from aroung 1500 to present day. Although there is a general focus on the Western world, there is still a good deal written about China, India, and the Muslim world, though certainly not in proportion to population. Africa receives some treatment, but a relatively small amount.I would probably not recommend this to high school students, unless their attention span is significantly above average. It's well written, but you have to want to learn about the subject.Summary: well worth the many hours!"},{"Title":"The New Penguin History of the World: Fourth Edition","review":"Roberts is a master of the broad brush, managing to make world history a page-turner and 1200 pages seem like 300 (or so). Because the subject's so large, it always feels like you're moving at high speed and observing from high above. There's little room for detail, but that's the nature of world history. The beauty of it is that Roberts makes connections and observations of patterns, and we're able to do the same, which wouldn't be possible in a history of smaller scope with more detail (of course, we need both).One particularly valuable example is the context in which he places the American Revolution and subsequent US expansion. At the time, the revolution was a relatively small matter and Europe was focused on more important things. After the war, Britain controlled the seas and also controlled the territory north of the new nation. With a weak power (Spain) controlling much of the areas south and west, and with France checked by Britain in North America, the US was able to expand in an essentially invisible bubble of protection created by Britain. It was in Britain's interests to let this weak little English-speaking upstart expand rather than allowing another European power to fill the relative void of North America (it doesn't make it right, but one of the European powers would have done it if the US hadn't). A little deflating for our national mythology, but isn't that one of the purposes of history done well?"},{"Title":"The New Penguin History of the World: Fourth Edition","review":"*Caveat: I read the third edition of this of this book, so my comments do not address any additional material or revisions added since then, but I am posting this review under the newest edition so that as many people as are interested will see it.*First let me say that I would recommend this to anyone who feels grossly under-informed by the (at least in American schools of my experience) formal education in history they received in public schools. I would argue that a book like this might even be of notable value to a full-time student of history at a good university, because rather than taking a piecemeal approach, it attempts to formulate an overarching thematic narrative, to draw all the disparate knowledge of different regions and epochs into a unified, and therefore comprehensible, whole. For this reason too, it is immensely valuable to the reader cultivating an initial interest in history. For this reason I would recommend it as an overall introduction, or primer.I know what you're thinking: \\"A 1000+ (densely packed) page primer?\\" Well, for a subject this massive, that is precisely what we need. Some reviewers have noted that some minimal knowledge of history is necessary to comprehend this book, and it is true that you won't understand everything if you are completely clueless. But I think this is true of almost any non-fiction. As much as is possible, Roberts explains everything as clearly as space permits, not assuming prior knowledge. But so much is covered, that the reader must adopt some approach to digest it all. I recommend stopping every now and again when you come across a peoples or figure you are unfamiliar with, and do a web search. By connecting the events with the contemporaneous art, architecture, etc, it will enrich the information and be much easier to retain; such embellishments (beyond maps) were simply not practical for a book of this magnitude to remain in a single volume.This brings me to the somewhat unique format of the book. It seems to endeavor to be as long and as dense as possible while remaining publishable as a singe affordable volume. At times I found this approach questionable, but I must say if you are using the volume for reference you will no doubt appreciate it. By the way, this book is wonderful for reference. Although I thought the index ought to have been somewhat more comprehensive, it includes the most immensely useful page headings, which describe the content of EACH and EVERY page. This is wonderful and makes the book a pleasure to browse, and if you read like I do, scanning ahead to form an idea of the upcoming chapter, you will find this pleasant and useful.Roberts is even-handed about social, economic, and political issues. While there is a sense of informed, modern morality, it is in no way sectarian, and the assumptions he makes will hardly be contested by any educated person. When he goes beyond what would seem patently obvious, he is always deferential to other possibilities and views.I will quickly remark on the idea some espouse about this (or virtually any history written in the west) book being \\"euro-centric.\\" It can not be denied that one of this book's major thematic structures centers around the emanation and subsequent near-universal adoption of cultural and political institutions from Europe. However, Roberts does not deify or condemn this process, he only describes it. And I, at least, am convinced that it is not an overly exaggerated description. It is in no way bigoted or naive, though it is clearly a choice of perspective, which while entirely convincing, is certainly one among many defensible positions.If this book has any major flaws, I would say that it is in some ways too ambitious, and in other ways not ambitious enough. It attempts to thread together almost every major event in history (at least to the degree which present scholarship and Roberts ability permit) into a single narrative idea; in this respect it offers a unique opportunity to build a coat rack in your mind to hang new ideas on when you continue to other, more comprehensive histories with more limited scope, or even a new found context for the next history channel documentary. However, this very comprehensiveness also in some instances obscures the theme and makes the narrative feel forced, and is, in any event, a chimera: no doubt even at its great length the history buff will find something important missing.Even with these flaws and eccentricities though, I think this book is very unique in its approach, depth, and breadth, given its format. I highly recommend it and have not come across a similar work that stands up to it (feel free to comment if you have)."},{"Title":"The New Penguin History of the World: Fourth Edition","review":"The book is helping me reviewing my knowledge on world history, with vivid approaches in simple language.

Even if one has read a lot of history (of the world, of regions or nations, of art, religion, philosophy, economics, wars, politics, etc.), it is easy to drown i details. Then this book can help to put a lot of interesting details into perspectives. I am not a professional historian, but have read a lot of history (my favourite world history is of 33 volumes, and that is only the \\"beginning\\"), but Roberts' world history i turn to again and again, to get a useful overview.There are more ideological histories with a rightist or leftist leaning that may challenge one to take a stand, but for a well balanced survey, I know of no better one volume book than this one, which I have read from the first version (as the Hutchinson History of the World) through all tater editions (and I take particular pleasure in later richly illustrated volumes). The Penguin editions I have found very handy as companions during my many years as an itinerant development worker. A highly recommended world history!"},{"Title":"The New Penguin History of the World: Fourth Edition","review":"The author explained in the Preface to the 4th edition of this book, \\"I sought from the start to recognize... the elements of general influences which had the widest and deepest impact and not just to collect again accounts of traditionally important themes. I wished... to set out instead the major historical processes which affected the largest numbers of human beings... I also tried not to write about those subjects where material was most plentiful.\\" (Pg xiii)Of the biblical accounts of Moses and the Exodus, he says, \\"though the biblical account cannot be accepted as it stands, it should be treated with respect as our only evidence for much of Jewish history. It contains much that can be related to what is known or inferred from other sources.\\" (Pg. 111) Later, he adds, \\"A fundamental contribution of [Judaism] to Christianity would be its sense of the people apart, its eyes set on things not of this world; Christians were to go on to the idea of ... working to redeem the world.\\" (Pg. 264) He says, \\"The picture of Jesus presented in [the gospels] is of a man of modest though not destitute family, with a claim to royal lineage... Jesus knew himself to be a holy man...Shortly after his death, Jesus's disciples believed that he had risen from the dead... All this ths Gospels tell us.\\" (Pg. 265-266)He suggests about the achievements of the Greeks, \\"there is a salient theme which emerges in it: a growing confidence in rational, conscious enquiry. If civilization is to advance towards the control of mentality and environment by reason, then the Greeks did more for it than any of their predecessors.\\" (Pg. 199) Later, he observes, \\"The rejection of authority by the thoughtful in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was only rarely complete, in the sense that new authority was sought and discovered in what were believed to be the teachings of science and reason. Yet increasingly... the authority of the past was rejected.\\" (Pg. 688-689)He says of WWII, \\"Few people and no nations had engaged in the war because they saw it as a struggle against ... wickedness. It cannot be doubted, though, that many of them were heartened ... by the sense that the conflict had a moral dimension... Too much was heard about the regrettable consequences of Allied victory, and it is too easily forgotten that it crushed the worst challenge to liberal civilization that has ever arisen.\\" (Pg. 964) He observes of the fall of the Soviet Union, \\"History, moreover, has no favourites for long. Although some Americans had been frightened by Soviet strength after the Cuban missile crisis, there were plentiful signs by the early 1970s that the Soviet rulers were in difficulties. They had to face a truism that Marxism itself proclaimed: that consciousness evolves with material conditions.\\" (Pg. 1125)He concludes, \\"The story told in this book has no end. However dramatic and disrupted, a history of the world cannot pull up short and come to a halt at a neat chronological boundary... An history is what one age thinks worth noting about another... Perspective is harder and harder to maintain. This does not mean that the record is no more than a collection of facts... Discernible trends and forces have operated over long periods and wide areas.\\" (Pg. 1173)For anyone seeking a thorough, comprehensive world history by a single author, this is definitely a book to buy."},{"Title":"The New Penguin History of the World: Fourth Edition","review":"This is a book that had been sitting on my shelf for an extended period of time before I set out to read it. It did take a long time, but in the end I ultimately feel it was worth it.I feel this book could function as a way to tie together and consolidate a lot of disparate historical knowledge or to serve as a way to contextualize further reading. When reading this book, I found myself in the latter category, seeking to contextualize future reading; my own knowledge of world history was relatively bare. Ultimately, the book succeeded and I feel confident that I will be able to contextualize my future readings, and hopefully be able to return to this someday with even more perspective. There is truth to the other reviews that the author assumes some knowledge of history on your end; there were, honestly, a lot of things mentioned in passing in the book that I was unfamiliar with. Stopping to look up everything can make it take even longer to read the book if you're doing just one or two chapters a week like I was. Despite this, I don't feel like it diminishes the value of the book to someone who's not well-read in history, although a little bit of extra effort is required.Other reviews have also mentioned the book focusing much more on Western History. This may be a turn off for some people, but if you do read the book as a history that explains how the world is today (or as it was in 2007 or so when the book was last updated), I did not find myself wanting for any additional knowledge of the other areas to tie things together. However, depending on what you're looking for, it's certainly worth noting.My thoughts about the book largely mirror a lot of the other reviews here: despite its limitations, it is still a very good book and worth your time. Don't let these limitations put you off from it. If you put the time and energy into it needed to get something out of it, you will be rewarded."},{"Title":"The New Penguin History of the World: Fourth Edition","review":"This is an excellent comprehensive coverage of recorded human history. My views of The New Penguin History of the World are:(+)Covering all the major events and civilizations with the breadth that their significance deserves. Note that it is all done at an introductory level for obvious space limitations.(+)Very thorough and comprehensive(-)Mainly focuses on western history with less attention to the rest of the world so the title may be slightly deceiving.(-)A more minor issue but still of detrimental value: the publisher must have wanted to maintain this work as a single tome so cramming 1264 pages necessitated the use of a small font. The small font is less comfortable to read but as mentioned above this is a minor issue."},{"Title":"The New Penguin History of the World: Fourth Edition","review":"I was looking for information that would tell me how the world came to be organized the way it is. I am casually familliar with the archaelogical information about how and where humans first existed, and the beginnings of tools and agriculture and the gradual spread of people out from Africa to all over. I dont know a great deal of detail and specifics, I am no scholar, but generally, I get it, even as there is much I still dont know. What I had almost no idea of was the order in which dynastys came and went, what were the differences between them? What changed in, and for people, with each succeeding change? And many other questions. How did nations and cultures rise to dominate and others remain unchanged and even backward. So I ordered this book after reading reviews and browsing others. I have been satisfied with it. I ordered it in 11/2009, and today I have not finished it. Since I got this book, I have read many others which were simply more fun, while others were equally challenging in content, but much shorter.I am up to page 915. the book is 1188 pages and so far there have been times when i read something that made me say\\" now I understand\\" This book is the most and best info on how the world came to be organised the way it is. Which is exactly what I was hoping to learn. How countries were organised and how religion factored into the whole thing. How Europe colonised the world and became the dominant civilizationWho came, who left; the whole panoramic progression of cultures and why some became extinct or less important. This is a big, important, interesting book. After I finally finish it I will know more about the world and the assumptions that still continue to dominate. I will be more knowledgeable. And that was my reason for buying this book in the first place. I am glad I did, and highly recommend it to anyone who seeks to know the history behind how the world is organised. Knowing this will also open ones eyes to see that the goal of domination have not much changed, although the methods have evolved."},{"Title":"The New Penguin History of the World: Fourth Edition","review":"I have not finished the book yet but so far it's nothing short of amazing for an \\"overview\\" of history.

This paperback is 1200+ pages long and the font (#9) is very small. Even though I an old duffer, I just passed my commercial pilot's eye exam. After three of the Penguin's pages, I had a huge headache. Just to prove myself wrong, I handed the book to my Daughter and asked her to read a page or two. She said she neededa ruler to keep her place on the page. I returned the book the next day and ordered the H. G. Wells version of history for my kindle. it's like having a \\"heads-up\\" display for your car. Jim in Virginia Beach, P.S. You'll need a magnifing glass for the maps!"},{"Title":"The New Penguin History of the World: Fourth Edition","review":"This is definitely not the best book for high schoolers. While it is very informative, it is hard to read and all the young adults using the book in our group find it very difficult to get into and most say that it is \\"boring\\". I do believe that my child has learned a lot from it though. The author is obviously an expert on the subject. It is just difficult to read, even for a more seasoned adult."},{"Title":"The New Penguin History of the World: Fourth Edition","review":"In his introduction to the earlier edition, Roberts quotes a saying to the effect that a work of history should not reveal the author's \\"party, country, or religion.\\" Sadly, Roberts utterly fails at his own goal.This book purports to give a global history, but it's mostly European history and a brief sprinkling of the other areas of the world that one might have heard of.To pick just one example that I found particularly egregious, the book goes into depth about Charlemagne and his ancestors (of limited historical importance), then devotes about 20 pages for over 1000 years of Chinese history. I kid you not.Roberts tries to justify this by saying how Europeans have been so influential in the world, but this is only partly true. China has over one billion people who have largely remained isolated from the world. It's true that one can explain a lot of history without much need for the details of China, but it shortchanges a huge mass of humanity and their doings, no matter what their impact on the West has been. [Let me note that a reviewer of the earlier edition, also named Jim, makes a similar point about China as well; it is coincidence: he and I are not the same person].Moreover, with China's rising influence over the already Sinic-based cultures of Southeast Asia, for example, or India's likely rise in the coming years, any claims to a \\"European dominated\\" world are already becoming obsolete. The truth is, the finer points of the Peloponnesian War are not really more important than the details of the Tai, Mon, and Kymer kingdoms, for example.I suspect the real reason for such imbalance was because the author just didn't know anything about China (or India) and couldn't be bothered to find out. Supposedly Roberts has a reputation as a distinguished professor, and I think the reputation made him complacent in writing this and trying to pass it off as some great world history. The editors who should have said something about it were probably loath to criticize such a \\"master.\\"I was thinking that the new edition might fix some of these problems (since appreciation of globalism has become more prevalent), but no. Also, I suppose the book is marketed to mostly English speaking Westerners, so a little more detail about Europe may be inevitable. But it shouldn't be billed as some comprehensive history of the world when it makes such a ridiculously small effort to actually cover the world properly.A true history of the world, propotional to all the areas of the world, would be an instant classic. Unfortunately, this book only makes you wish for it."},{"Title":"The New Penguin History of the World: Fourth Edition","review":"This book was in great shape and received in a timely manner.

Thanks."},{"Title":"Mama Makes Up Her Mind: And Other Dangers of Southern Living (Curley Large Print Books)","review":"Bailey White's short stories about her childhood, mother, and the surroundings of her small town touch upon the very fabric of American Life. Some segments will make you cry, others will make you laugh out loud. Most segments, however, are a humorous account of Bailey's strange, yet somehow remarkably familiar life.Trust me, you'll never want to put this book down once you've started. For a real treat, however, share some of Bailey's stories with children. Each chapter makes the perfect bedtime story for young and old."},{"Title":"Mama Makes Up Her Mind: And Other Dangers of Southern Living (Curley Large Print Books)","review":"Bailey White's Mama Makes Up Her Mind and Other Dangers of Southern Living is illustrative of the complexity present within a seemingly simple subject or person. The book seeks to show the influence of mothers, and the power they wield in shaping their children's inner lives. Bailey White's Mama appears to be a benign, traditional wife and mother who makes her home the center of her universe, and she is that and much more. Although her daughter Bailey realizes she has inherited an ambivalence about the male gender from her mother, she attempts to explain her complicated relationship with her family throughout the essays in the book.The stories about Mama and the White family are too complex to fit into a conventional form of narrative such as novel or short story, and the essay style of the book enables the reader to better understand the complicated way of how Mama came to be the strong woman that she is.The book is a quick read but really dense with ideas and imagery."},{"Title":"Mama Makes Up Her Mind: And Other Dangers of Southern Living (Curley Large Print Books)","review":"Whenever I (re)read stories from this book, I can hear Bailey White telling them as she used to on NPR. Quirky, yes, but she and her mama and their various cousins, siblings, aunts, uncles, ancestors, and neighbors are genuinely southern, from their never-ending tales that wander around among peoples' various marriages, children, inlaws, deaths, and relationships--sometimes getting to the point--to their calm acceptance of the eccentric and even the nearly unbelievable. My own mother came from a different part of the South (Mississippi), but there is something in that voice, be it Georgia-, North Carolina-, or Mississipi-accented (and they are all different) that sets it apart from other American storytellers and that rings true to those of us who grew up in the South or with southern parents."},{"Title":"Mama Makes Up Her Mind: And Other Dangers of Southern Living (Curley Large Print Books)","review":"You will laugh out loud! An easy read with several short stories to read/put down/ pick up any time. Especially funny for those familiar with south Georgia!

In addition, there is a complete lack of the tiresome agendas so prevalent in current books. I have read the book twice now, and intend to read it again when I need a reminder that life's many facets are all worth relishing and (re)discovering. I have read sections to others who enjoyed it just as much as I have. Let this book entertain and even teach you a thing or two."},{"Title":"Mama Makes Up Her Mind: And Other Dangers of Southern Living (Curley Large Print Books)","review":"Southern living is really dangerous. Random thoughts could get you in a ton of trouble. Mama Makes Up Her Mind by Bailey White is a hilarious memoir about her wacky family. One of the best qualities about the book is the way Bailey White paints the pictures of Mama. You can just see her sitting in her reclining chair, listening to the radio, and reading UFO newsletter or picking up some road kill for dinner. Another great quality is that the characters are easy to relate to. By the end of the book you want to talk to Mama or you wish that Bailey was your 2nd grade teacher. The characters are fun and exciting. The last quality that was really wonderful was that throughout the book you learned many lessons about life. From how great instant-care is to how to deal with 36 first graders on a field trip. Bailey White's life is as entertaining and Mama and the way She describes it is amazing. Mama Makes Up Her Mind was and entertaining group of stories that will make you laugh out loud. Buckle-up, because your about to read a thoroughly eccentric book."},{"Title":"Mama Makes Up Her Mind: And Other Dangers of Southern Living (Curley Large Print Books)","review":"I have thoroughly enjoyed all of Bailey White's books and this is my favorite. She is refreshingly honest and hilarious at the same time. I laughed out loud constantly while reading.

A great commentary on life in the South."},{"Title":"Mama Makes Up Her Mind: And Other Dangers of Southern Living (Curley Large Print Books)","review":"I guess I was assuming a novel about the gracious South; but no, its about the totally eccentric and whacky South and I enjoyed every minute of it.

I will be looking forward to experiencing more of Ms White's work."},{"Title":"Mama Makes Up Her Mind: And Other Dangers of Southern Living (Curley Large Print Books)","review":"From the beginning of \\"Mama makes up her mind\\", you know that mama is not your average person. Bailey White tells about her up bringing in the deep south. Her mother, who is referred to as mama through out the entire book, is a humorous yet crucial part of the stories along with many neighbors and family members. Some of the best qualities about this book, are the humor that Bailey White includes in all of the stories whether they be light hearted stories, like \\"Dead on the road\\", or a more serious theme like \\"Porsche\\". In \\"Dead on the Road\\" when a prissy relative comes to eat one evening, she compliments mama on the quail and asks her how she manages not to have a single piece of shot in the whole bird. Mama recites where she picked the animal up and the car that hit it, \\"Intersection of 93 and Baggs Road, green late model pickup, Florida tag.\\" Another good quality is that Bailey's writing is very easy but gets the point across. It is enjoyable and paints a mental picture for every scene. In the story \\"Summer Afternoon\\" she talks of a lake that her aunt used to take her to. She was also very descriptive about the sounds around her. She talked about the alligator that swam to shore and bellowed at her aunt's command. After the alligator passes on she says that at night sometimes she can almost hear the bellow. I think that every one of Bailey's stories teaches me something. Each memory has a special meaning to it. In one of the stories about a garden she grew, she talks about how much she wanted a huge field of flowers to be able to walk through. For years she slaves day after day over the garden, but when she finally has it the way she dreamed of it being, she no longer wants to relax and just walk through it, she wants to keep gardening and keep changing the variety. She explains how much she grows to love the garden and how one dream fades but another is born. These are the kind of morals and lessons Ms. White's stories have. These were just some of the stories and wonderful qualities of Bailey's writing. There are so many more memories of relations and friends that share the qualities of the ones above and many have their own unique twist. Over all, this book was a fun filled and enjoyable experience."},{"Title":"Mama Makes Up Her Mind: And Other Dangers of Southern Living (Curley Large Print Books)","review":"This is an amusing collection of short stories concerning a family in the deep South.The Mama of the family is an out and out eccentric but totally charming with it.Her house is a repository for generations of junk (and none too clean),but life with her is never dull.I found this to be a very likeable &quot;little&quot; read when you don't feel like delving into anything too heavy or involved."},{"Title":"Mama Makes Up Her Mind: And Other Dangers of Southern Living (Curley Large Print Books)","review":"Bailey White's matter-of-fact prose sneaks up and surprises you with the outrageousness of her characters and situations.I loved &quot;The One-eared Intellectual&quot; so much that I called a friend of mine, a Master Teacher, to read it to her long distance.

One of my favorite stories is when Mama makes up her mind that she wants some smoked mullet and they have to go down to Rosey's, &quot;a tough juke joint on the edge of the marsh in an old-fashioned part of Florida where tourists don't even go because they have more sense.&quot; Each story will grab your heart and give it a little squeeze.

I have plenty of relatives from the South, though none quite so eccentric as Bailey's Mama. Somehow every observation, every turn of phrase rang true in each story.

The author's relaxed writing style and frequent humor made the book a joy to read.This is one of those books you can get lost in and when life is stressing you out, you can make a cup of tea, turn to this book and get some relief from reality. I loved that you can come in anywhere in this book and not feel that you have been left out of the loop. That, to me, is the mark of an excellent writer.

Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, 1993.Bailey White has been heard and relished by millions of National Public Radio listeners. Her short stories and essays have appeared in various journals and magazines. Mama Makes Up Her Mind is Ms. Whites first book in which she gathers over fifty of these works. Her stories and keen observations are all set in Georgia, and cover more ground than kudzu.We have all had childhoods and we can all tell a few tales about ourselves. But can you honestly say that ornithologists once placed orphaned turkey eggs on your hot and feverish measle-covered body to hatch them overnight? Only Bailey White can claim to have been used as a child turkey-incubator.You really have got to read her stories and meet her mother -- a woman who eats road kill (only when it is fresh), and thwarts the randiest of telephone perverts with her own concept of the conversation, taking the wind right out of his sails. A woman who is filled with as much knowledge as curiosity about the world. A mother you will wish were yours.I was fascinated while reading how Ms. Baileys Aunt Belle tamed an alligator slowly but surely. No doubt, the alligator was just as fascinated as I was with this sprawling southern family. Or read about another aunt whose descent into senility is reflected in her very own mirrors, with which she holds loud and disparaging conversations, chock full of name-calling and laying blame squarely where it belongs.It is Southern, and charming, filled with gentility and just the right dash of degeneration. Buy this book and treasure it, then send a copy to your favorite aunt, or your cousin who left home but secretly would like to return to the family fold. Like kudzu, the stories and Miss Bailey will take hold of your heart with tender tendrils and not let go. A must read for Southerners and Yankees, alike."},{"Title":"Mama Makes Up Her Mind: And Other Dangers of Southern Living (Curley Large Print Books)","review":"Bailey White's book &quot;Mama Makes Up her Mind&quot; is hysterical, especially the chapters entitled &quot;Instant Care&quot; (you will never want to see another doctor again) and &quot;Something Like A Husband&quot;, you will never react to an obscene phone the same again.

There's a story in that section called &quot;Instant Care&quot; that had me rolling on the floor. I can readily identify with Ms. White's mother - she's a real character!

Her standards are high. She claims she won't eat anything that's not a fresh kill. Mama is an adventurous and excellent cook also. We have feasted not only on doves, turkeys, and quail, but robins, squirrels, and, only once, a possum. That's my Mama.\\" This book, \\"Mama Makes up her Mind,\\" by Bailey White is a hilarious string of stories that reflect on what it was like growing up in the Deep South with her \\"practical\\" but funny mother and her siblings. This book had many wonderful qualities. One of the best ones is the book's hilarious and unforgettable characters. Mama encounters many strange characters and learns how to relate to them in her own \\"unique\\" way. \\"I could tell from the fully present look on the top of the artist's glowing bald head that Mama was describing her invention of a cure for male-pattern baldness. She calls it the axillary transplant.\\" The artist in this chapter called \\"Nonrepresentational Art\\" was their host and they were on their way home from one of his exhibits in a gallery. This is only one example of the witty ways of Mama.Another quality of this book is it's ability to \\"paint a picture.\\" The adjectives and form of writing really made me think of an old country house in the South. The dialogue and characters helped also. An example of these elaborate descriptions is about Rosey's restaurant in the following quote from the book. \\"Rosey's restaurant is a tough juke jointon the edge of the marsh in an old-fashioned part of Florida. At Rosey's you never know whether you're drunk or not because the floors wave up and down anyway. The foundations are sagging and you can eat inside if you can take the smoke or you can eat outside and throw your fish bones down to vulture looking pelicans.\\" This is from the first chapter titled, \\"Rosey's.\\" Simple, yet suspenseful.While reading this funny book, I found myself simply laughing out loud.

At the same time, there's a heart-warming sweetness to the stories, and you may long to be part of Mama's eccentric, but loving, family.Once Mama makes up her mind to do something, there's no changing it."},{"Title":"Mama Makes Up Her Mind: And Other Dangers of Southern Living (Curley Large Print Books)","review":"Do not be misled by the statements of various reviewers who attempt to place White in the same pigeonhole with Flannery O'Connor or who describe White's work as intellectual in scope. White is absolutely nothing like O'Connor, whose humor was extremely dark and often brutal, and while often touching her work could scarcely be described as particularly deep; you will not be provoked to think deep thoughts. But this is not a criticism of White or her work; the lady has created a niche for herself that is uniquely her own, and she fills it extremely well indeed.MAMA MAKES UP HER MIND is a collection of very short essays of the type White and other essayists have popularized on national public radio: most run two to three pages, and I don't believe the longest piece ran more than five pages at most. They are bites of eccentric character, local color, and regional humor with an often laugh-out-loud quality. As you might expect, the subject of many of these essays is Mama, and when writing about her mother, Aunt Bell, or the other Southern eccentrics that populate her world White is at her most successful and most memorable. White is less successful, however, when she herself is the main focus of her writings, and although these particular essays remain enjoyable they seem to lack the same sense of purpose found in her other pieces. Even so, MAMA MAKES UP HER MIND will entertain from cover to cover with its wry and winsome commentary on &quot;the dangers of Southern living,&quot; and any one who enjoys regional humor expertly conveyed will find tremendous enjoyment in this particular book.

Most of the selections are just a few pages long, so you'll be moving on to the next one before you know it.The common themes throughout the book are southern living and Bailey White's quirky family. The author puts this material to brilliant use, weaving her humor and personality into every page. And one thing that I especially appreciated is that the author never gets preachy. The stories are there strictly for your enjoyment, a series of five-minute freebies to brighten up your day. For what it's worth, my favorites were \\"Good Housekeeping\\" and \\"Rattlesnake Belt\\". But they were all pleasant enough to read.If you've just finished reading a dark novel or a heavy piece of non-fiction, then \\"Mama Makes Up Her Mind\\" is a well deserved respite.

Her eccentric, no-nonsense brand of maternal philosophy, how she handles neighbors and man-handles strangers provide riotous reading--no matter what corner of the country you hail from. The cover of the Vintage Books 1994 edition offers a broad hint into the zany nostalgia inside: a red Porsche and a claw foot bathtub share front porch honors at Mama's homestead, shameless mementoes of Mama's past, permanently ensconced for all the world to notice. Between charming alligators and politicians, Mama continually astonishes her two daughters with her jackhammer logic and unflappable humor.Undaunted Mama tackles a wide variety of Southern wildlife: turkeys, swans, rattlesnakes, buzzards--not to mention Taming a gator. Truly a Mother to be Reckoned with, who never minces words, and is rarely outmaneuvered. The latter half of this collection of uproarious anecdotes centers more on the author's career as a first grade teacher.Ah the joy of training little, innocent minds along the path to maturity--even if this creative daughter has failed to civilized her southern Mama.

Before he died Pa made Janet vow she would get out of the outlawing business and marry a respectful person. Though the Marshal has the drop on her and her brother Clint, Janet and her sibling manage to escape, but she shoots the other lawman. Feeling guilty for being a \\"softy\\" Marshal Dagger Blackthorn vows to bring in the last two members of the Garret gang especially that blond male who crippled his brother.Janet becomes a schoolmarm in Whiskeytown, but Dagger begins to wonder about her especially when she cusses, beats up bullies, and shoots more accurately than any man he knows. His suspicions grow as he falls in love with Janet Donner. She surprises herself by reciprocating, but Clint is coming to town with plans to reform the Garret gang and he needs his sis to succeed.A STOLEN TIMES will live up to its title as readers will find western romance steals time from other activities to finish in one sitting. The story line is fun to follow as the assertive Janet takes no prisoners while learning life on the legal side and working her way through two conflicting loves that of her brother and that of her Marshal. She also fears that when he learns the truth, he will hate her while locking her up and throwing away the key. Though Dagger overcomes his obsession too easily, fans will appreciate this delightful novel.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"A Stolen Time","review":"A STOLEN TIME, is the story of an outlaw trying to go straight. An old story, yes, however its author Shari Boullion gives it a great twist: the outlaw is a woman. The outlaw's name is Janet Garret and she made a promise to her dying father to go straight, so now she's trying really hard to do it by becoming an ever proper schoolmarm, who just happens to carry a gun in her pocket and a taste for whiskey in her heart. The towns sexy marshall Dagger Blackthorn takes to watching the proper schoolmarm after she does some things that aren't taught in school such as, shooting rattle snakes, scaling school roofs and kicking bullies butts. The chemistry between Dagger and Janet leaps off the page, you can feel his suspision and her worry at being found out. Seriously, what is an outlaw doing going around with the marshall? Can this outlaw and marshall make it work? Of course, and Ms. Boullion makes you believe it could happen even outside of fiction. When you read A STOLEN TIME you will truly feel as though you have stepped back in time to watch the strong marshall catch himself an outlaw that he will never consider releasing, even for good behavior."},{"Title":"A Stolen Time","review":"What a pleasure to discover a new author who pens a unique tale of love and redemption.

She becomes a school teacher even though she's not qualified and settles down. She falls in love with the town's marshal, Dagger. He doesn't know that he was the one who shot her during a robbery and that she shot his brother and maimed him. Dagger is a terrific hero - sweet and strong - although I was a bit confused about how him growing up with Indians fits into it all. Janet is feisty and funny as she tries to learn civilized ways.

Hope so."},{"Title":"Only You Can Save Mankind","review":"Only You Can Save Mankind is the first book in Terry Pratchett's Johnny Maxwell trilogy. While this is considered juvenile or young adult fiction, it's a lot of fun for adults as well. It seems a little strange to journey with Terry Pratchett to a place other than the Discworld, but this little jaunt is quite enjoyable. Johnny Maxwell is a rather typical twelve year old boy; he's not smart or popular or rich, and he tends to prefer operating below the radar of those around him. He is living in Trying Times, basically having to take care of himself for the most part while his parents argue and come ever closer to splitting up. Like any kid, he enjoys a good computer game every now and then, and his friend Wobbler, born to be a hacker, supplies him with just about any illegally pirated game he could want. As earth's last remaining fighter, he has destroyed all but the last big alien ship in the game Only You Can Save Mankind when a message suddenly appears on the screen: We wish to talk. Thus begins a journey that takes him inside the game as the Chosen One, the human who will lead the alien ScreeWee race back to safety beyond The Boundary. The reptilian captain of the ScreeWee is tired of fighting; the human fighters appear out of nowhere, kill and destroy ships in her fleet, and keep coming back no matter how many times they are killed. She has seen what happened to the Space Invaders and would rather surrender than die fighting.You don't have to remember playing Space Invaders to enjoy this book, but it does make the story a little more enjoyable. As always with Pratchett, the characters are well-developed and quite remarkable. I really liked Wobbler, the future hacker who designed a game of his own called Journey to Alpha Centauri to be played in real time, meaning all the thousands of years it would take to reach Alpha Centauri is how many years the game would take you to actually finish it. Beyond the comedy present in this story, there is also a message. The backdrop of the earth-based events of the book is the Persian Gulf War, and the juxtaposition of this war that is real but seems like a game with the computer game that becomes real for Johnny Maxwell conveys a message about violence and one's attitude toward it. It is not an overbearing theme, but it is there to some degree, helping make this short novel much more than just a juvenile read intended to entertain the reader and nothing else. This is a short book that never falters from beginning to end, and it houses much more in its pages than might be apparent at first glance. It is not as complicated or brilliant as the Discworld novels, but it is a fun read nonetheless, sure to entertain Pratchett fans while capturing the attention and interest of young readers."},{"Title":"Only You Can Save Mankind","review":"This is a terrific story, with many classic bits and a very realistic portrayal of kids in primary school. Johnny's best friends include Wobbler (a computer hacker), Yo-less (named because he never says Yo), and Bigmac (who lives in the rough part of town).Johnny Maxwell, while his parents are going through &quot;trying times&quot; and the Gulf War is getting going on the tele, was playing a shoot-em-up computer game when he found that the Mighty ScreeWee(tm) Empire had no interest in fighting back, and wanted to surrender. This becomes quite complicated.There are deeper meanings, etc, but don't let them frighten you off a book that is also very entertaining for adult Pratchett fans. :)"},{"Title":"Only You Can Save Mankind","review":"Don't dismiss this as a simple Children's book, it's one of the most thought-provoking books I've ever read. It shows us how we portray warfare in the real world, particulary the Gulf War, and reduce it to a computer game on our television screens, a fun game where nobody really gets killed, excpet for &quot;The Bad Guys&quot;.Of course, after reading this book we understand that there really isn't any good or bad side in any war. I'd better stop now before I write a lenghty essay on this subject!"},{"Title":"Only You Can Save Mankind","review":"That's really the question, isn't it? The old saw says that one person can make a difference, but no one ever thinks that it's them so no one does anything. And no difference is ever made. That's what the question on the cover of the book points out, if not you, then who else will?In this case, Johnny is that one person, one out of thousands, but the only one who listens and takes on the responsibility of trying to do something. He has no power in the \\"real\\" world; his parents are on the verge of splitting up and he feels like he's just drifting through life. But now he has both power and responsibility, as little as he thinks he wants either.It's always been just a game to him; kill the aliens and advance to the next level. But what happens when the aliens surrender? When they place their lives in his hands, ask for his protection? They just want to go home, to escape the strange humans who attack them without provocation. Johnny has the challenge of not just helping them, but learning to see them as people instead of just \\"things.\\" Because it's all too easy to kill a thing. When you let that \\"thing\\" become a person to you, become real instead of an object, then it's not easy anymore.And that's the lesson here, in a story where the first Gulf War is always on the TVs and being discussed in the background. It's all too easy to wage war when you see your opponents as less than human. When they're nothing more than a target on a screen. It's a lesson that Johnny initially fights against learning, but one that he comes to accept, just as he accepts that he's the only one both willing and able to help these aliens who are becoming people to him.Eventually he does have help in the form of a genius with the nickname of \\"Sigourney\\" (good ode to the \\"Aliens\\" franchise). A girl who despite her intelligence, is caught in the mindset of having to win at everything, even if it means killing everything. It's the hardest on her to learn that the ScreeWee are people, and the lesson doesn't drive home until it's nearly too late. Her character is a good commentary on the entire \\"kill 'em all!\\" mindset and the way high intelligence doesn't always negate prejudice or massive blind spots in morality.As always with Terry Pratchett, I have the distinct feeling that a great deal of the humor is going far over my head in that British way that, as an American, I just can't grasp. However, the story itself is so solid, as are the characters and the messages, that it doesn't matter much. There are plenty of jokes that I did get and I enjoyed the rest of it for what it was. I'll be looking forward to seeing the other two books published here in the states."},{"Title":"Only You Can Save Mankind","review":"Best known for his &quot;Discworld&quot; series, Terry Pratchett actually penned several books prior to starting that. One of those is &quot;Only You Can Save Mankind,&quot; the first book of a young adult trilogy, which shows some of his initial roughness but is still convincing and enjoyable.Johnny Maxwell is an extremely smart but otherwise ordinary English boy, who enjoys hanging out with his friends Wobbler, Yo-less, and Bigmac (their respective nicknames are all explained in the book) and exchanging pirated video games. One of these, &quot;Only You Can Save Mankind,&quot; focuses on defeating reptilian aliens called ScreeWees.But suddenly the ScreeWees surrender. Johnny is, unsurprisingly, quite taken aback: video game enemies are supposed to continue fighting, not surrender and ask him to stop firing. Then the game shows nothing but empty space. Johnny assumes that there is something odd about it, but nothing can prepare him for what it turns out to be: The ScreeWees are real aliens, who are attacked when someone uses the video game.Though very different from his Discworld series, &quot;Only You Can Save Mankind&quot; has the stamp of a Terry Pratchett book. From the quiet hero who sees it all, to supporting characters called &quot;Wobbler,&quot; it's all Pratchett. The conversations are Pratchett's usual slightly rambling, nuggets-of-wisdom dialogue. The narrative style is much rougher and starker than in this later books, without the polish to be found in his later books. However, he also adds in some swsssh and fplatfplatfplat sound effects whenever the video game is dealt with.The ScreeWees are interesting and original, although I hope Mr. Pratchett has since learned that amphibians do not have scales. The humor is very unique and original, such as when the Captain tells Johnny to order Jumboburgers for an entire spacefleet, or the long-running Sigourney Weaver joke. On the other hand, he also provides some intelligent questions that are left for the reader to ponder, and an enjoyably whimsical plot: &quot;What if video games were real acts of war?&quot;Johnny is an endearing hero in the mold of Pratchett's Discworld character Teppic, a young and slightly naive young boy with a quick brain and a very difficult situation. His supporters Kristy, Wobbler, Yo-less and Bigmac are all set apart by individual quirks like Wobbler's endearing lack of ethics, Yo-less's conscientous attitude, and Bigmac's appetite. The Captain doesn't appear much, but she is tough and easy to sympathize with.Though hard to find in the United States, the Johnny Maxwell trilogy is well worth the read, especially for Pratchett fans."},{"Title":"Only You Can Save Mankind","review":"What would you do if you were set to win a space simulation shooter and the enemy starship suddenly surrender? At first, Johnny Maxwell figures he'll shoot them anyway. He wants the end of game screen, wants to know that he, in the last experimental spaceship, actually did save mankind. But the alien starships have stopped shooting--and really seem ready to surrender to him. Accepting their surrender isn't easy--as Johnny discovers when he learns that he's abruptly become responsible for the safety of a huge fleet of starships--torn by internal dissention but needing food, protection from other starfighters, and hoping for a distant dream of safety and a homeworld of their own.Johnny has a lot going on in his life--he's a 12-year-old kid, after all, so he's got school, friends, and 'The Troubles' at home (as his parents' gradually break up). The last thing he needs is a bunch of aligator-shaped space aliens depending on him. Still, he's given his promise--and other computer gamers keep hunting down the fleeing fleet and hammering away at it.Author Terry Pratchett sets his book during the Gulf War and very real smart-bombs, joystick-launched killing, and anti-different propaganda form a highly serious backdrop for a story that manages to be simultaneously funny and thought-provoking. Shattered remains of ancient and extinct 'Space Invaders' add a poignant touch. Johnny's relationships with the alien captain, his friends, and especially Kirsty/Sigourney seem real and troubled, further adding to the story.ONLY YOU CAN SAVE MANKIND is targetted at the grade 5-8 market and the writing is certainly accessible to that group. I wonder, though, whether Pratchett's concepts are a bit subtle for that age group. Older and adult readers will find a lot to like in this thoughtful story."},{"Title":"Only You Can Save Mankind","review":"This is the first of Pratchett's two books about Johnny. The second is Johnny and the Dead. Johnny hides in his room playing his favorite video game, a game at which he has become an expert. When he receives a call for help...from the video aliens he has been blasting. Johnny ends up entering the game itself to become their defender, but how will he convince the other champion player to let them live?"},{"Title":"Only You Can Save Mankind","review":"The Johnny Maxwell trilogy is a great deal of fun. Pratchett's different perspective of the way the world works is thoroughly entertaining. It's not part of the Discworld series, but the same sense of humor pervades it. If you like Pratchett's other works, give it a read."},{"Title":"Only You Can Save Mankind","review":"Johnny Maxwell is playing a video game called \\"Only You Can Save Mankind\\" when a strange message flashes on the screen: \\"We wish to talk.\\" HUH? There's nothing in the manual about messages. The player is just supposed to shoot down the ScreeWee ships. When Johnny fires again, another message appears: \\"We surrender! PLEASE!\\" Johnny quits playing for the evening.The next day, the ScreeWee captain appears on the screen and tells Johnny that they surrender. The ScreeWees want to go home, and they ask Johnny for safe conduct. He agrees even though he's not sure what he's complying with.Meanwhile, Johnny's family is going through a very difficult time. His parents may be splitting up; they're certainly unhappy. Johnny mostly fends for himself and watches tons of television, especially news coverage of the war in progress in the Middle East.Johnny starts waking up in the middle of the game --- actually sitting at the star fighter controls. It's just a dream. Or is it? It doesn't feel like one, or smell like one, either.The ScreeWees vanish, leaving only space in all \\"Only You Can Save Mankind\\" computer games and in Johnny's nighttime adventures. Where are they? When he sees the ScreeWees again, other human players are attacking them. The humans die and they return to play again, but when the ScreeWees die, their lives are over.The war images on TV are not all that different from what Johnny sees in the game. Which is reality? Which is a game?This first book in the Johnny Maxwell Trilogy has literally everything to make it an amazing read: breathless adventure, humor that causes the reader to laugh out loud, a main character who anyone can relate to, unexpected friendships, plus huge dead-serious ideas to sink one's teeth into. It just doesn't get any better than this!"},{"Title":"Only You Can Save Mankind","review":"Twelve years old Johnny Maxwell loves to play computer games especially those with alien battles. His favorite game at the moment is ONLY YOU CAN SAVE MANKIND in which he battles the ScreeWee.However, something weird out of virtual reality happens when a ScreeWee Captain announces to him that she and her troop surrender and ask for safe passage back to their sector of space. She explains that this is no game for when a ScreeWee dies they really are dead. A stunned Johnny does not know what to do with all these prisoners of war as he is only a preadolescent. Adding to his burden is when he sleeps he seems to enter the computer world in which he can only wake when he dies as the Americans bomb Baghdad in Gulf War I.Written during the first Gulf War, ONLY YOU CAN SAVE MANKIND is a powerful condemnation of war as a means to solve disputes. The story line targets the preadolescent crowd, but adults will enjoy the action-packed tale as the bewildered hero makes a plea for peace. Making no apology with his in your face claim that we are all humans whether we live in America, Darfur, Iraq, North Korea or ScreeWee, Terry Pratchett argue we need to live together in peace and harmony instead of sending our young (that is someone else's children) to fight when we ought to seek respectful peaceful solutions to a crisis.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Only You Can Save Mankind","review":"I read Only You Can Save Mankind with my 9 year-old daughter. We both loved it. Being a huge Diskworld fan, I was thrilled to find another line of books by Pratchett that were geared towards younger readers. This book is the first of a trilogy. The first thing my daughter did after reading it was check out the other 2 books from her school library!This book was a great introduction to science fiction for my daughter. The story is about the boy more than it is about the fantasy environment he is in. She was able to relate to him and be amused by the classic Pratchett descriptions of the video game alien world.Those who are already very familiar with historical sci-fi and video game culture will find the constant references entertaining."},{"Title":"Only You Can Save Mankind","review":"Johnny Maxwell, an ordinary boy who has to deal with a possible divorce of his parents, is thrust into an adventure where he has to save an alien race. Not only does he have to deal with the divorce, but he also has to save the aliens while he is sick. Johnny's friend Wobbler, a computer hacker, gives Johnny a copy of the game, \\"Only you can Save Mankind,\\" a game where you are the last person left to kill of the alien Scree Wee fleets. After nearly beating one of the hardest levels, a message appears on the screen, apparently sent by the attacking aliens. They surrender and ask for safe conduct. Johnny agrees having no idea what he is getting into.This book is a very interesting with apt humor and it nicely explains Johnny's school life and his likes and dislikes. I also think that Wobbler is represented well. Another thing this book does is show what kids really do instead of what their parents think they do. Terry Pratchett does a good job with this aspect and handles how Johnny matures in the end of the book and does what he has to, not what is easy."},{"Title":"Only You Can Save Mankind","review":"Tbest of the &quot;Johnny&quot;-series"},{"Title":"Only You Can Save Mankind","review":"The moral didacticism was tedious; the predictable PC plot twists made me wince.

A great read-aloud, a fun read for YA's, not half bad for the most jaded adult fan."},{"Title":"Only You Can Save Mankind","review":"From NerfreaderOnly You Can Save Mankind is a children's book from Terry Pratchett, master of humor fantasy. This book is a little different from his usual fare, being neither fantasy nor very humorous. I'm still not sure what to make of it.Johnny Maxwell spends his free time playing video games, but what should he do when the game's aliens want to surrender?I had high expectations for this book based on its author but was disappointed. I can't decide if it was the book or my expectations that are to blame. I think a little of both. The characters are well-defined and interesting. I liked Johnny and his friends, especially their nicknames for each other. The premise is similar to Ender's Game and The Last Starfighter, but both of those properties handled the story better. I have special objections to some of the sci-fi logistics which probably wouldn't bother an actual child but drove me crazy. I also expected the book to be a lot funnier than it is. There's nothing offensive, and there are a few chuckles, but it's not laugh out loud. The second and third Johnny Maxwell books bring Johnny back to Earth, so I'll give them a shot and see if the trilogy gets any better.Reading - I wasn't familiar with Richard Mitchley before listening to this book, and I found him a very energetic reader. I really liked his Welsh accent. He does an especially good job with the video game sound effects.Final thoughts - Not a bad kid's book, but adult listeners of children's fiction might want something better."},{"Title":"Only You Can Save Mankind","review":"In the beginning, there was an Idea: 21 first century war is very similar to a video game.And on this, he has built a book.

And the story contains at least one interesting character - the side-kick."},{"Title":"Only You Can Save Mankind","review":"I've always liked Pratchett's Disc World stories and bought this solely out of curiosity. It has the Pratchett humor all through the book. The story is understated and has a somewhat Douglas Adams flavor to it also. We see the world through a 12 year old's eyes, and those eyes are somewhat jaded due to circumstances that he is involved with and are totally out of his control.A lot of YA novels are wholly suited for adult readership and this is definitely one"},{"Title":"Only You Can Save Mankind","review":"Terry Pratchett has created several fascinating worlds, most famously in his Discworld series, but also in his works for children and young adults. In \\"Only You Can Save Mankind\\", the first of the Johnny Maxwell trilogy, Pratchett takes real world and virtual reality to an all new level. On par with Douglas Adams and Daniel Pinkwater, Pratchett is at the top of his game in the first novel of this series.Johnny Maxwell is a twelve-year-old boy experiencing some Trying Times; his parents are divorcing and he's a dweeb/nerd who plays computer games for fun. To make matters worse, there's a real war going on in the world that almost seems too game-like. It all starts out as fun and games when Johnny is playing the title game; but then the aliens he's been shooting at start communicating with him and tell him that they wish to surrender. Pretty soon Johnny finds out that what may be a game to him is real life to these alien ScreeWee and he must take their side to ensure their safety. Or is all of this just some strange dream?\\"Only You Can Save Mankind\\" was first published in 1992, during the first Gulf War, which may have made it dated if there weren't a second war going on right now. Pratchett brings his unique sense of humor and outlook on the world to write a fast-paced story that makes readers question good and evil, reality and illusion. That may sound like a tall order for a young adult novel, but Pratchett delivers a totally believable universe with this fictional creation. Really vode."},{"Title":"Only You Can Save Mankind","review":"Only You Can Save Mankind is a solid Pratchett book, aimed at the young adult set. While a tiny bit dated (it's set during the First Gulf War, as noted in the preface), it ages pretty well. There were several laugh out loud moments - which is a rarity for any book, particularly one that's not explicitly set out to be comedy. Even for those young-at-heart, it's a great way to spend a lazy morning (or evening) instead of, well, playing video games."},{"Title":"Only You Can Save Mankind","review":"well what can I say it's a Terry Pratchett book and I have always enjoyed his books. This book certainly holds your interest"},{"Title":"Only You Can Save Mankind","review":"This selectiion is a little juvenile, but Pratchett is such a talented writer that he carries it off for adults, too. The three books of the &#34;Johnny&#34; series are worth a read."},{"Title":"Only You Can Save Mankind","review":"Johnny is an open minded young man who isn't afraid of anything. He is a shining example of the &#34;not cool&#34; kids. However, Johnny and his friends find ways to fix problems in their world that others would have never noticed. Problems that require all of the characters to look outside themselves, problem solve and move beyond their lives and problems to help others. I recommended this book to my grandkids. I hope they take away from these young men the hope, joy and willingness these fellos show to move heaven and earth to help without fanfare, and fame. i also hope that whomever reads this book will see the respect these young men show each other and adults in their lives. Happy reading."},{"Title":"Only You Can Save Mankind","review":"As I started reading Terry Pratchett's \\"Only You Can Save Mankind,\\" I felt very optimistic. The writing seemed decent and the concept behind the book (the existence of a persistent, mutable game-space) was tremendously interesting. Unfortunately, the book quickly petered out. Instead of focusing on the game-space aspect of the plot, Pratchett spends most of his time discussing war and social injustice. I suppose he was trying to get his target audience (young adults) to think about things. But, he did so at the expense of the story. So, I'm rating the book at a merely OK 3 stars out of 5."},{"Title":"Only You Can Save Mankind","review":"I downloaded \\"Only You Can Save Mankind\\" because it is a Terry Pratchett book, and I am one of his greatest fans. I knew it was not a Discworld series, but was willing to chance it. I know this is touted as a children's/young adult book, but honestly, I loved it.Johnny Maxwell is a typical kid, experiencing a typical life, except his parents are going through a separation and are 'being sensible' which Johnny hates. He spends most of his spare time playing video games and lets the adults get on with it. Wobbler, Johnny's friend and master hacker, gives Johnny a game which suddenly doesn't play the way it's meant to. The game starts sending him messages and at first he thinks he has lost his mind, but later discovers that someone else is in the same boat (or game) as him.Pratchett has created another winner with this book. All of the characters are true to life. The theme that war has become a bit like a video game is there, but not overtly so.Definitely a good read, whether you're 10 or 100!"},{"Title":"Only You Can Save Mankind","review":"I'm a read-aloud Mom with a family of boys. We enjoyed this book: it was fun to read, the secondary characters were a joy, and it was fast.I get tired of main characters suffering through the divorce of their parents in children's books. I understand why authors put their Important!Thoughts!About!Divorce! into books, but it was so meaningless to the story.What we really liked were some of the puns and wordplay between the characters, and the insights into warfare and human nature. Why does war have rules? This is a uniquely human philosophy.I'm glad we read it, and I would recommend it for other families."},{"Title":"Only You Can Save Mankind","review":"I want more of these books.

What can he do? What must he do?Though this book has apparently been updated (in 2004) from the original story (published in 1992), it probably needs to be updated again.

OK quick read, but far from the rich multi-level depth of The Wee Free Men and all the books relating to Tiffany Aching. Go there."},{"Title":"Only You Can Save Mankind","review":"I enjoyed this book a great deal. It was an interesting \\"reply\\", in a way, to Card's \\"Ender's Game\\". In EG, Ender thought it was a game and killed all the aliens, and then felt really bad about it for a long time. In OYCSM, Johnny knew for a fact that it was a game, and then found out that maybe it wasn't, and helped the aliens escape, and felt pretty good about it.OYCSM explores some interesting themes. Game vs. dream vs. reality. Friend vs. foe. Alien vs. human. Many of these it twists inside out and makes you look at them differently than most of us do day-to-day (though admittedly this is kind of the point of sf).I dunno, I've read OYCSM and I've read the Tiffany Aching books, and frankly can't see that they're any more \\"children's books\\" than anything else Pratchett has done. I highlighted 24 lines in my Kindle edition, starting with the ad for the titular computer game, \\"Only You Can Save Mankind\\", whose ad copy says \\"suitable for IBM PC [etc]. Actual game shots taken from a version you haven't bought.\\" Funny and endearing all the way through."},{"Title":"Only You Can Save Mankind","review":"This is the best of his Johnny Maxwell Triology definitely. (Others being Johnny and the Bomb, and Johnny and the Dead) It is very imaginative and great fun to read. Another great Terry Pratchett book."},{"Title":"Only You Can Save Mankind","review":"There's no familiar Discworld in this Terry Pratchett book, but the thought-provoking way of looking at the world still remains in Only You Can Save Mankind, book one of the Johnny Maxwell Trilogy. Surprisingly enough, this book, geared towards young adults, proves to be one of Pratchett's most political and moralistic work yet. There is discussion about divorce, socio-economic conditions, race, class, and finally war. War seems the main focus, with the message of the book being quite anti-war, even in video games. Based around the Gulf War (the first one), there' s a strong message aimed at kids to remember that war isn't a game, despite all the new technology and media that makes it seem like one.Regardless of the books morals and messages, it still retains Terry Pratchett's humor. While not one of his funniest, it still manages to keep his messages wrapped in pleasant packaging. Overall, this is a surprisingly different book, but a very nice display of Pratchett's writing range."},{"Title":"Only You Can Save Mankind","review":"The Johnny Maxwell books are not Terry Pratchett's usual Discworld books. They are set in a very ordinary run down town in England, centering around Johnny Maxwell and his three friends.In this book, the first of the trilogy, Johnny, whose parents are going through Trying Times, is playing his favorite video game when the aliens suddenly surrender to him instead of fighting back. He and his friends suspect a computer virus but things get even stranger when Johnny finds himself in incredibly lifelike dreams piloting a star fighter, leading the alien fleet home where they will be safe from mankind, and communicating with a girl who also is dreaming of the alien fleet. Pratchett adds those extra touches that regular readers love such as when they go by the ruined hulks of Space Invader ships tumbling in space and the aliens then use them as examples to show each other what happens when you take a stand against the humans. His special genius, to my way of thinking, comes in how he treats the conversations and thinking of the kids, along with those little unexpected twists. There is no one for Pratchett at reminding us what it is like to be young like Johnny and his friends, as well as commenting on the human condition and our mindless attitudes at the same time. As we can see in this excerpt:----------------------It was a very small ScreeWee. Most of its scales were grey. Its crest was nearly worn away. Its tail just dragged behind it. When it opened its mouth, there were three teeth left and they were huddling together at the back.It blinked owlishly at them over the top of the trolley it had been pushing. Apart from everything else, Kirsty had been aiming the gun well above its head.There was one of those awkward silences.\\"Around this time,\\" said the Captain behind them, \\"the crew on the bridge have a snack brought to them.\\"Johnny leaned forward, nodded at the little old alien, and lifted the lid of the tray that was on the trolley. There were a few bowls of something green and bubbling. He gently lowered the lid again.\\"I think you were going to shoot the tea lady,\\" he said.\\"How was I to know?\\" Kirsty demanded, \\"It could have been anything! This is an alien spaceship! You're not supposed to get tea ladies!\\"The Captain said something in ScreeWee to the old alien, who shuffled around slowly and went off back down the corridor. One wheel of the trolley kept squeaking.Kirsty was furious.\\"This isn't going right!\\" she hissed.\\"Come on,\\" said Johnny, \\"Let's go to the bridge and get it over with.\\"\\"I didn't know it was a tea lady!\\" That's your dreaming!\\"\\"Yes, all right.\\"\\"She had no right to be there!\\"\\"I suppose even aliens get a bit thirsty in the afternoons.\\"\\"That's not what I meant!

She traces the history of the war in a series of two-page chapters entitled The Road to War, Blitzkrieg, Battle in the Sky (Battle of Britain), New Battlegrounds, Wolfpacks and Warships, War in the Pacific, etc. Events, personalities, tactics, strategies, policies and so on are very briefly described. I was glad to see Butterfield didn't shy away from topics such as the Gestapo, the Holocaust, POWs and the human cost of the war. The text is complimented by b&w; and color illustrations, photographs and maps.Given the text limitations, GOING TO WAR IN WORLD WAR II is a very, very basic introduction to World War II.

Tryone Sawyer, young musician, Lyle Stuart, soap opera hunk, Judd Webster, U.S. Senator, Eileen Matthews, super model, Meg Armstrong, romance novelist, Doug Simons, ace reporter for the NY Times, Mary Hargrove, assitant manager of an upscale fashion boutique, and Steve Bass, business man, all exhibit short fuses and violent behaviors. Though required to divulge all their volitale episodes before entering the group, each hides incriminating secrets. One Monday Tyrone is a no show enducing nervous angst among the patients. And for good reason; Sawyer is lying dead on an abandoned street, the apparent victim of cardiac arrest. Two days later Judd Webster dies of the same malady, and a day later Eileen Matthews befalls the exact fate. Who is next? Why are all these seemingly healthy people dying of suspicious heart failure? Who in this group is the next to die? And who is decimating these associates one by one? The FBI's suspicions mount when small bullet wounds are discovered in each corpse. Unfortunately, their field agent sent to decipher the unexplained contusions becomes the next victim. Now anal retentive, fear-riddled Dr. Mort must search for answers. With the aid of loving Millie, the duo hunt clues to these mysterious deaths, endangering their own lives in the pursuit. Bruce Forester, author/pychiatrist, pens a taunt, suspenseful, sometimes humorous tale that keeps the pages flipping and the adrenline pumping. Knowledge of forensic procedures, medical agendums, and opera are intertwined into the supsense. The dialogue rings true, the plot doesn't bog with too many suspects, the level of suspense consistantly mounts, and a spine-tingling conclusion ensues.

I have had this book for awhile, and I decided to pull it out because I wanted to read something different.I had actually never read Little Big Man or saw the movie with Dustin Hoffman, so this was my first experience reading about old Jack Crabbe.I have to say I was taken with his portrayal of history. Quite a nice entertaining story he weaves especially of his meeting different famous people such as Bat Masterson, Doc Holliday, Libby Custer, and of all people the Prince of Wales.I found myself laughing throughout the book, and I cannot recommend it enough for the comical element. I would say that anyone interested in history especially of the American West with a touch of comedy thrown in would really have great time with this one."},{"Title":"The Return of Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"Thomas Berger, the author is able to use his comic charactoer Jack Crabb, the 112 year old man to desribel more of western history. The beauty of this book is that, Mr. Berger is able to take away all of the hype to a lot of the most famous historical events and describe, realistically what happened. The OK Corral is one of the best examples. The actual fight was less dramic than described elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Return of Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"The only thing that Return lacks from the original is the cast of fictional characters that make that story so rich,i.e. Old Lodge Skins, Younger Bear. Berger's writing style, and his knowledge of history, once again creates the aura of authenticity that makes the character Jack Crabb seem beleivable. At the end or Return, Jack's allusions to Roosevelt and the Roughriders in Cuba leaves me hoping for a further continuation of this remarkable story."},{"Title":"The Return of Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"Have you read LITTLE BIG MAN and seen the film? Then you'll probably want to read this sequel. I loved the original and this book as well. The narrative begins where the first book left off.Jack Crabb meets many famous folk from the old west and witnesses historic events. I'd hate to ruin the surprises by revealing who and what here. His youth spent with the Cheyenne is very important to how he relates to everyone.The book ends with his stating that there is more tale to tell. Where is part three?"},{"Title":"The Return of Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"This novel continues Jack Crabb's adventures throughout the late 19th century as his knack for running into virtually every notorious figure from the Old West (and almost everywhere else he travels)persists. He also continues to provide his rustic, illiterate yet eloquent, unique perspective on the world that he knew. It is certainly readable and sustains interest. However, like most sequels, it lacks the impact of the original and, like a continuous soap opera, one senses that it could continue indefinitely as the chronicle of this unique and eccentric observer, the little anonymous man who happened to witness many of the seminal events of the Old West and lived to tell the tale to an audience of the future, necessarily posthumous as he explains circumstances that rendered the telling of his tales to his contemporaries impossible.There could conceivably be more tales of Jack Crabb in a third novel, provided Thomas Berger is still living and up to the task. However, one was enough to make the point and the second is a worthwhile yet unnecessary bonus. A third, while probably readable, really would be outstaying Jack's welcome and, if he has a knack equal to his uncanny ability to be at the right moment in history, it is his ability to know when to get off the stage.For all fans of Little Big Man, The Return is worth your time. Just don't expect something that remotely equals the first novel."},{"Title":"The Return of Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"Jack Crabb, did not, after all, die miserably in an old folks' home after describing the death of his father-figure, Old Lodge Skins, to a sissy interviewer. Crabb lived on to relate the story of the next fifteen or so years of his life. He had a lot still to get off his chest--or Berger did. He continues musing over the gulf of misunderstanding apparently inevitable whenever race meets race or man meets woman. But in addition, we get the chance to hear him out on other topics--Catholicism, the French, women's rights and Queen Victoria, to name a few. I was afraid this book would be a downhill ride, both because I enjoyed LITTLE BIG MAN so much, and because the fate of the Indians involved was a foregone, depressing conclusion. There are sad bits, notably the murder of Sitting Bull and his son. However, this book surprised me, and I turned heads in public a few times by laughing out loud while reading it. Berger leaves Crabb in as happy a state as one can imagine him. This relieved me of a years-old sadness for the old codger, for I liked him a lot, and like him more now."},{"Title":"The Return of Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"But it's still worth a look.

It's tone is less active, more somber and slightly less fun than &quot;Little Big Man&quot; but the revisionist look at the events depicted in the novel are worth the time spent in reading. I suspect that Mr Berger will give us another volume, but hope he will put more of the original spark in the tome."},{"Title":"The Return of Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"A great sequel to the first, which is an American standard.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Return of Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"As a high school freshman the good sister took Little Big Man from me because she said it was trash. Naturally I couldn't put it down. What a great way to get a student interested in history. Since then I have read countless history books while awaiting this sequel. It is not disappointing at all, it's still &quot;trash&quot;, the kind of trash that will encourage countless students to read more about our history. Crabb is back and as wiley, scatalogical and hyberbolic as ever. With humor, pathos and drama Crabb bounces around to the historical high lights of the late nineteenth, early twentieth century with agility and keen observation. Right up until the final tragedy of Sitting Bulls death Berger delivers great entertainment."},{"Title":"The Return of Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"&quot;Little Big Man&quot; is easily one of my top ten all time favorite books. I also enjoyed the movie with Dustin Hoffman. Without a moments hesitation, I scooped up this book and settled down for what I hoped was another wild adventure with Jack Crabb. Sadly, I think I would have been better off having left the book in the remainder bin where I found it and watched the original on DVD instead.Without rehashing the plot that other reviewers have already gone over, I would describe RoLBM as &quot;more of less&quot;. More of the Old West stories without the compelling drama. Famous names wander into view from stage left and exit stage right without giving the reader any sense of awe. &quot;Oh look, here comes Sitting Bull. There he goes. How nice.&quot;It is my personal opinion that the main reason an author waits 35 years to publish a sequel to his most famous work is due less to need for creative outlet and more the desire for financial gain. That the author broadly hints at yet a third book tends to back my theory up. Not that authors aren't entitled to make money but art should fall in there somewhere."},{"Title":"The Return of Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"I LOVED the original Little Big Man. The Return, not so much. Jack Crabb is still doing what he does, insinuating himself into the lives of famous people of the period and having wild, unbelievable adventures in the Old West.Unfortunately, in this case the adventures aren't all THAT wild or adventurous and there doesn't seem to be any real cohesive plot. It does a good job of giving a glimpse into various aspects of life in the late 19th century and that's about it.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone but hardcore fans of western novels."},{"Title":"The Return of Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"Even in this technological age, North America frontier mythology remains strong. Star Trek, that manifestly American idea, proclaimed space as the 'final frontier'. As Berger states, the North American frontier experience was unique and permeated popular thinking. No other culture has so staunchly believed in the ideal of expansion into 'empty lands' and 'development' of physical resources. However, as Berger's two part story of Jack Crabb reminds us, the land wasn't empty. An indigenous population vainly resisted European encroachment for over two centuries. Failure to hold their territory left them scornfully dismissed as 'backward'. Film, radio, books and finally, television combined in reinforcing the image of 'savages' being replaced by triumphant civilization.Berger's Little Big Man probably did more to disabuse the North American public of its misconceptions of Native Americans than any other single work. Assigning this book to students in the 1960's resulted in shock and not infrequently, resentment, at the distruction of closely held myths. Berger's depiction of the Cheyenne made them truly 'human beings', not hostile savages. The Washita and Sand Creek massacres were big news to students of the '60s who ardently believed Indians 'got what they deserved' after the Little Big Horn.The Return of Little Big Man takes us beyond the slaughter at the Greasy Grass [Little Big Horn] into that era when North America was realizing the frontier was closing. With the Indians driven to reservations or into Canada, Jack finds himself moving through such notorious sites as Dodge City, Deadwood and Tombstone. Berger uses Crabb's wanderings to move the focus from Native Americans to the 'gunslingers' and opportunists who provided the foundation of the frontier myth. Crabb encounters Hickock, Cody, the Earps and others any North American will readily identify. Skillfully keeping Crabb merely an observer of the Western scene, Berger's careful research begins to peel the patina of sanctity held by these figures for several generations. He condemns none, but paints them in more realistic hues, even modifying his earlier opinion of Custer.Berger employs Cody's Wild West show as a vehicle for broadening Crabb's views of people and places. In an era when noveau riche Americans were taking Grand Tours of Europe, the show paralleled those journeys while introducing an image of frontier life. The validity of the image is irrelevant, the show was a huge success. Crabb acts to typify American attitudes about Europeans. Berger adds the Sioux for still another viewpoint, and the visit with the Pope is a high point of the book. This aspect alone should give this book greater appeal with readers in Europe. More to the point, these same readers may finally glean a clearer knowledge of the North American frontier. The judas kiss given the Native Americans by Hollywood and television will not be an easy stigma to erase without extensive research. Clearly, Berger has done the research, presenting the results in his usual lively manner.There is no doubt that The Return of Little Big Man fails to equal the novelty value of the first volume of Crabb's biography. While the Sioux somewhat replace the Cheyenne of the earlier work, clearly their life has been changed by the closing of the frontier. The episode of Sitting Bull points up many facets of these changes. The focus on legendary white figures of the post-Civil War era is extensive. While a good background in frontier history enhances the reading of the story, it isn't a requirement. The story of Jack Crabb stands quite alone in itself."},{"Title":"The Return of Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"I read &quot;Little Big Man&quot; years ago and adored it. My boss at the time said &quot;Why don't you just see the movie&quot;. Well, sure I did but books you can carry around. However, this book didn't appeal to me as much. I read only to the part where Ed Masterson died. Maybe it was because it was a big heavy book and the print was small, but the historical stuff was a bit much as was the speech pattern of Jack Crabb. I've read too many historical accounts to appreciate JC's version of history. Maybe I'll give this book another whirl when I can carry it on my camping trip and read it beside a crackling fire. Otherwise, I think it's a fine book and great for anyone who hates dull historical facts (like me - ha, ha). After all, it was Little Big Man who was responsible for killing my hero &quot;Crazy Horse&quot;. That's the true historical fact, and if you want to read a truly great book about him there's &quot;Crazy Horse&quot; by Maria Sandoz."},{"Title":"The Return of Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"&quot;little, Big Man&quot; was undoubtoubly one of the seminal novels of the later half of the twentyith century.

If Berger(and all his many great works) and Jack Crabb are not a national treasure. Then I am hard pressed to make a case for much of anything in American Lit. These two books speak more than volumes........much more. Gary Hill Manditra@aol.com"},{"Title":"The Return of Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"Thomas Berger's LITTLE BIG MAN (1964) was one of the great American novels of the 1960s--indeed, it's probably one of the great American novels of the twentieth century. It is the putative memoirs of Jack Crabb, who--many years later--would have us believe that he, traveling west in a covered wagon with his family, survived an attack by the Cheyenne, was adopted into their tribe, returned to &quot;civilization,&quot; and survived both a gunfight with Wild Bill Hickok and the Battle of the Little Bighorn--and all sorts of other wackiness in between. The novel is funny, wise, sad, surreal, and wonderful. Readers who know the story only through the inadequate and incomplete film with young Dustin Hoffman should scurry to the local library and check out LBM (before the rush that publication of a sequel will surely engender)--or order a copy online"},{"Title":"The Return of Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"36 years is an astonishingly long time for a sequel, and there are siginificant differences between Berger's 1964 original (which inspired a movie of the same name, starring a young Dustin Hoffman) and the Return. The Return of Little Big Man, as entertainment, is as entertaining as the original: what I am concerned about here is situating the two books in MODERN American history, and a flaw in character development.Although historical romance can be a good guide to real history (and George MacDonald Fraser, whose Flashman series bears more than a passing resemblance to Lttle Big Man, has pointed this out in Fraser's Hollywood History of the World), it is in a sense impossible to extricate the historical romance from its own time.The original book and the movie appeared at a time, the 1960s, in which the American story of the frontier was undergoing a rapid change as a consequence of the Vietnam war. In a sense, our adventure in Vietnam was a continuation of our Western adventures which attempted to transfer Manifest Destiny across a rather large ocean...and which failed.There are echoes of these concerns in the book and the movie Little Big Man (which came out about 1969) made a conscious comparision of our Western policies with our Vietnam policies.Thirty years on and partly as a consequence of the many social changes that occured in the 1960s, a sort of Victorianism has returned to the USA: for one thing, sheer hypocrisy is no longer laughed out of court...as evidenced by the Starr investigation of Clinton.As a result, Berger's latter-day Jack Crabbe, the &quot;sole white survivor of the Battle of Little Bighorn&quot;, is a different persona than the picaresque individual of the first book [parenthetically, and judging from Berger's first novel, George MacDonald Fraser's &quot;Flashman and the Redskins&quot; and many other works, Greasy Grass was quite crowded with white survivors. Apparently there were dozens of unaccounted scouts, 'breeds, British officers, mad bishops and perhaps a German band present at the battle :-).]A &quot;picaresque&quot; novel, which the original novel was and the sequel isn't, is at least supposed to be the comic adventures of a character of lower morals than ours. Fraser carries this off quite nicely in Flashman, and has an attractive breeziness with regards to his character (the bully of the 19th century book by Thomas Arnold who in Fraser goes on to be present at most military disasters of the 19th century British empire.)Fraser does not judge Flash Harry and Flash Harry, speaking through Fraser, does not try to be better than he is. Flashy honestly loves, lusts, and sees the dawn &quot;come up like thunder outer China 'crost the Bay.&quot;But the latter-day Jack Crabbe seems to strain away from the Wild West towards something finer and to at one and the same time want a more gilded and virtuous existence...yet betray himself at the critical point.The original Jack Crabbe &quot;knowed Custer for what he wuz&quot; and knew hisself for what he wuz. The latter day Jack Crabbe is much more ambivalent about his existence on the frontier and somewhat contemptuous of men like Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday. He judges them harshly, when he himself gets drunk in New York when he thinks his inamarota (Amanda Teasdale, a defender of the Indians and a precursor of the Politically Correct) has gotten married.I cannot tell Mr Berger, who has written an excellent and entertaining book, how to build a character. But I do notice that whereas the first Jack Crabbe reserved his judgement for societies that exterminated the native peoples of this continent, the latter day Crabbe tends more to judge people. This is less an artistic flaw than an indication of how America has changed from 1964 to 1999. It does deprive us of the pleasure and scandal of the picaresque, and, in Victorian terms, The Return of Little Big Man is less titillating and more of an Improving Moral Tale.I am old enough to have lived in certain dying embers of the Victorian age: my grandparent's parlor was in that style. This is probably why I am titillated by the picaresque in the first place. To relate to Flash Harry, one has to have, like Clinton and I, scuttled for cover during the Vietnam war. Berger's first novel constructed, in the figure of the Hehmaneh, an alternative to the modal midcentury American male. Nowadays, absent the military draft, this is probably not as attractive to younger readers...and it seems that Berger is at pains to tell us in this book that the Hehmaneh were uncommon, and to have Jack Crabbe be positively contemptuous of &quot;queeries&quot; (Crabbe's hilarious mispronunciation of the Prince of Wales' &quot;equerries&quot;) who Jack thinks are tutti-fruity. Here there is a shift back to intolerance.It is my view that a novelist, if the novelist is constructing a non-picaresque role model character, should not in any way have that character, at the end of the day, have unattractive personal traits...but Crabbe's limitations are just these. Shakespeare's Hamlet says, use every man according to his deserts, and none of us should 'scape whipping...not Flash Harry, nor Wyatt Earp. In the great desert of American fiction, in which unattractive-but-cool characters are more or less force fed to the reader (as in the unspeakable Tom Wolfe) one does look in vain for Flashman, or Hamlet, or even Captain Ahab."},{"Title":"The Return of Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"Thomas Berger is versatile and brilliant. He has written many wonderful books, starting with &quot;Arthur Rex,&quot; one of the Arthurian cycle books to be recommended to those who love that. &quot;Robert Crews&quot; was a take-off of &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; and of course, &quot;Little Big Man&quot; was one of his all-time greats.This book is written for VERY INTELLIGENT PEOPLE. If you do not have a great grasp of history, you are not going to be able to truly appreciate the book. On the other hand, for those who do know a lot about world events during the period this book covers, there are delightful nuggets to be found everywhere. For example, near the end of the book, at the Chicago World's Fair, our protagonist meets a guy who says he will be the one who builds a &quot;horseless carriage,&quot; but then says something which is disturbing to Jack Crabb, about his &quot;worry that his work on the horseless carriage might be stole by an international conspiracy...trying to take over the world.&quot; You have to be aware of a lot to GET a lot of this book.One more thing: this book made me want to read &quot;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee.&quot; What that means, only those who read the book will know.It's good, it's good, but 3 stars is fine, because there are SO many other truly GREAT books out there. Keep reading!"},{"Title":"The Return of Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"In Twain's footstepsCritics tend to gush over Thomas Berger. He's been called the new Mark Twain. One of the most important writers of this century. Read &quot;The Return of Little Big Man.&quot; You'll understand why. In his latest work, the author of 20 novels returns to the story of Little Big Man (a.k.a. Jack Crabb). We first met Crabb in 1964 in the original &quot;Little Big Man.&quot; Thirty-five years later, Berger reprises the character in an effort that brings honor to the tattered reputation of sequels. Again, Crabb, who's well past his 100th year, is reminiscing about his life in the Old West. And an adventurous life it is. In many respects, he is the Forrest Gump of his time. Despite being a lowly bartender, his path continually crosses the biggest names in the West: Buffalo Bill Cody, Wild Bill Hickock, Annie Oakley, Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, Sitting Bull and, for good measure, the Pope and the Queen of England. The result is a personalized, everyman's perspective of the era's legends. The plot is delivered in a series of encounters with such notables. But where Berger truly shines is in Crabb's observations on life. He speaks in the rich, unlettered voice of another time - hence the Twain comparisons. Yet he manages to be insightful, educational and disarmingly funny all at once. Crabb bounds about the West, busting myths, telling tall tales and offering eccentric commentary on the period. This is fiction at its best. Don't let the Western theme put you off. Berger ably meshes biography with comedy, love stories with history, without any one element pushing another away. Best of all, you'll get to see Berger, one of the great craftsmen of our time, at work."},{"Title":"The Return of Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"Those who read and re-read Little Big Man every decade or so over 40 years were probably as delighted as I was when Return of Little Big Man appeared in 1999. Jack Crabbe, the geriatric home resident of the original novel who'd told of his experiences in the West, always peripheral to the events we all know of, returns in this sequel to tell of his life after the Little Big Horn fight.As the only white survivor of Little Big Horn, Jack wanders broke and almost naked into Deadwood, SD, to encounter his old acquaintance from Dodge, City, KS, Wild Bill Hickock, in time to be present for the Aces and Eights scenario. Naturally, Crabbe gives the eye-witness account of the even a bit differently than you've heard before.Thereafter, Crabbe wanders back to Dodge, Tombstone, elsewhere, in time to be present for the OK Corral fight, offering up another side of the Earp brothers, Doc Holliday, the Clantons and Bat Masterson. Then eastward to the Buffalo Bill Wild West Show, Queen Victoria, Bertie, Sitting Bull and Elizabeth Custer.As a grand finale he manages to be with Sitting Bull for the assassination of the great chief of the Souix.A great follow-up book to Little Big Man. Too bad it took so many decades to appear."},{"Title":"The Return of Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"In order to fully enjoy &quot;Return&quot; you'd have to read the original, &quot;Little Big Man.&quot; However, having read Jack Crabb's earlier adventures (living among the Cheyenne, consorting with Wild Bill Hickock and surving Custer's Last Stand) readers will find that there's nothing like the first time. After all, which is more interesting, living in the Wild West or performing with a Wild West show? Living among the Plains Indians on the plains or in late 19th century New York?All that said it's nice to hang out with Crabb again. Author Thomas Berger has created one of American literatures greatest characters. In this chapter of his life (1876 through 1892) our narrator tells of more encounters with famous Americans ranging from Bat Masterson to Jane Addams and including Wyatt Earp and Sitting Bull. Mostly we hang out with Buffalo Bill Cody (a bit too much for taste). Cody's Wild West show is a splendid vehicle for Crabb's further adventures but a few detours along the way would have been welcome.Crabb/Berger hint broadly at a third installment. Reading that I get the same twin feelings of anticipation and dread as I do with the coming of movie sequels. All that said, if you've read and enjoyed &quot;Little Big Man&quot; then this sequel is must reading."},{"Title":"The Return of Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"Return of Little Big Man is not as good as Little Big Man, but since Little Big Man easily ranks among the ten greatest American novels ever written, that is not strong criticism. RLBM is a bit too long - it drags somewhat between the point at which Jack Crabb joins Buffalo Bill and the point at which he witnesses Sitting Bull's death. But otherwise it is superior in every way.There is a change of focus here. Unlike LBM, RLBM is less a revisionist history of the Old West and has changed its focus to the encroaching Twentieth Century. Best of all, it introduces a romantic element in the form of Amanda Teasdale, who will surely prove a match for Jack Crabb. The author promises additional installments of Crabb's life. I look forward to them. I wish he'd produce a nonfiction companion volume (or footnotes a la Flashman) so the reader could determine what is fact and what is fancy."},{"Title":"The Return of Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"This sequel was well worth the wait. Although I found the later chapters to move slow at times this is Berger at his best. The chapters dealing with Tombstone are as charming and witty as the material in the original story. An enjoyable read!"},{"Title":"The Return of Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"I remember quite fondly the movie &quot;Little Big Man&quot; with Dustin Hoffman, so when I discovered that there were further adventures of Jack Crabb I purchased this sequel. It reveals more tales of Jack's adventures with some of the Old West's most colorful characters such as Wild Bill Hickock, Buffalo Bill Cody, Chief Sitting Bull, Annie Oakley, etc.. It's a book that is never dull, and the characters, both real and invented, mesh seamlessly in the narrative. It's not the West that you might remember from the old cowboy shows on television, but it's certainly a more vibrant place, and definitely more true to life. The book only takes us up to about 1893, so I sincerely hope that ol' Jack has more tales to tell, and that we'll see them in book form shortly."},{"Title":"The Return of Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"I was surprised to learn that Little Big Man, in fact, returned. So I dove into this book, after rereading the original, naturally. I was disappointed, only due to the relative brilliance embodied within the covers Little Big Man itself. It may be the change in the fictional editor, but the new, older Jack Crabbe is far more judgmental of his compadres and enemies than the Jack Crabbe who had dictated for us his life experiences just one year earlier. Annie Oakley, Sitting Bull, and Buffalo Bill, both of whom Crabbe gets to know quite well, are far shallower characters than were Old Lodge Skins and Wild Bill Hickok. Indeed, Jack seems to have disengaged himself from his social contacts and become less interesting himself...having settled into the white lifestyle and rejected that of the Native American with the death of Old Lodge Skins.In summary, while the book is interesting in its own right, it lacks the depth of its predecessor and is at best merely an average read, rather than the superb wonder Little Big man was."},{"Title":"The Return of Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"A bit of a let down after the classic \\"Little Big Man,\\" the further adventures of Jack Crabb are, as is true of any Berger novel, so well written you'll be drawn into it.

You'd be better off with nearly any of his others."},{"Title":"The Return of Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"My favorite historical fiction novel of the last year or two is The Triumph and the Glory, but Berger's fine book is a close second.

Great reading, well-developed characters, a solid four star book."},{"Title":"The Return of Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"I first encountered Jack Crabbe about 35 years ago, and later enjoyed the loose and anachronistic film adaptation of the novel, starring Dustin Hoffmann, so I looked forward to finding out what happened to Jack after the death of Old Lodge Skins. Alas, Jack has changed a lot. The latest installment of his adventures (to use the word loosely) runs nearly 450 pages, and to call it plodding and largely eventless is to err on the side of complementary. Bookended by the deaths of Wild Bill Hickock and Sitting Bull, Crabbe's tale this time is largely about his travels with Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. The author succeeds best on the very small scale of specific incident--- Crabbe's interactions with Prince Bertie and Queen Victoria, for example, are priceless. But by and large, the novel is just an &quot;info-dump,&quot; with dozens of pages of fairly undigested research narrated fairly humorlessly by Crabbe, interspersed with episodes of self-pity and a general and well-deserved feeling of worthlessness on Crabb's part--- he never finds work as anything more than a bartender.As in many recent novels, such as THE YEAR THE CLOUD FELL, the plains Indians are given preposterous New Age supernatural powers, which fit incongruously with the totally hum-drum and tedious events being narrated. The novel lacks a villain, other than the odious Wyatt Earp, and he never really gets onstage, nor does he get a satisfactory comeuppance.At the novel's end, Jack threatens either to die in his sleep, or to give vent to yet another 450 pages on events between 1893 and 1950.

Very little new information can be found and the settings requires a suspension of disbelief that becomes unwilling after a few days.In a world full of books, this oneisn't particularly bad but there are so many good ones you won't otherwise get to if you start this one that I advise you not to do so."},{"Title":"The Dark Descent","review":"This sprawling collection will keep the fan of weird fiction (and just plain good fiction) happy and spooked for a long time. The stories are broken into three sections, the boundaries between which are not terribly well explained by the editor (in my opinion, anyway). No matter, the quality of the stories is amazing throughout.This is not just modern gore and sex horror. Victorian stories such as The New Mother show just how frightening a tale told with restraint. Clive Barker's Dread, perhaps his best short work, may have you sleeping with the lights on. The three Stephen King pieces are all career highlights, especially the Lovecraftian Crouch End.I can't tell you how many marvellous writers I discovered in this collection. Robert Aickman, Oliver Onions, Robert W. Chambers, Russell Kirk. In some cases, this is the best source of fiction by these writers, as most of their work is out of print.My edition clocks in at just over 1000 pages. That's 1000 pages of pure enjoyment. Not bad for the price."},{"Title":"The Dark Descent","review":"One is Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural, edited by Cerf and Wagner. The other is The Dark Descent. From Poe and J. Sheridan LeFanu to Stephen King and Shirley Jackson, this anthology covers the horror tradition like few others. The selections in The Dark Descent are a bit more in-your-face than the ones in Cerf and Wagner's elegant anthology--an attribute fans of late twentieth century horror will surely appreciate. At the same time, though, Hartwell has certainly not avoided the classic chillers. Even better, Hartwell has chosen to include some lesser-known tales by some heavy hitters within the genre--so while you won't see Jackson's &quot;The Lottery,&quot; you will find two tales by her that you likely haven't read a dozen times before: tales that will hit you with the same force &quot;The Lottery&quot; did the first time you read it. Also not to be missed is Hartwell's introduction, which does a nice job of laying down a critical framework within which to read horror. It doesn't take the place of Danse Macabre or Dreadful Pleasures, but it's a nicely written piece that seems aimed toward readers who wouldn't otherwise read literary criticism."},{"Title":"The Dark Descent","review":"Disaster! That super-secret hush-hush Project the military was supposed to have under control has torn a rift into another dimension just ten miles from town, and maniacal flesh-hungry monsters are pouring through by the score, tearing their shrieking victims apart and turning the world as you know it into a charnel house. You've got to pack up and get outta Dodge quick---but what to take? Clothes, boots, food, hunting knife, guns and ammo, extra fuel cans, chainsaw---oh, and if you're a horror junkie like me, you've gotta have reading material during the Siege, right? And since you'll be holing up a long time---maybe forever---the tome you choose had better be a good one.Forced to haul one single volume off your horror shelf before you pack everything into the heavily armored civvie Hum-Vee, I would choose David G.

Lovecraft, Poe, Stephen King, M.R. James) and some of their lesser known adepts and apprentices. For such a modest price, having this much shivery, ghoulish goodness stuffed between the covers is nearly an embarrassment of riches.Anthologies are often treacherous ground, and success hinges on an editor's style and judgment. Hartwell demonstrates his impeccable taste and considerable acuity in the selections he makes; best of all he begins the collection with a remarkably astute, entertaining---and mercifully concise---little essay tracing the evolution of the terror and horror tale. Certainly we are treated to the seminal classics of the genre, and a few of the tales are overly represented in many other collections---but as horror crown jewels, they have their place here. H.P. Lovecraft is represented by two ensanguined ambassadors: \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\", a sweeping account of global panic, terror and slaughter spread by the resurgence of a primitive cult of an obscure Squid-God, and the Poe-esque \\"The Rats in the Walls\\". M.R. James has a less auspicious presence, \\"The Ash-Tree\\" being one of his less powerful works and an inadequate introduction to the Master.Hartwell's King selections are slightly puzzling; \\"The Reach\\" is too languid for its own good, while \\"The Monkey\\" is tacky and underawing---but then Hartwell knocks it out of the ballfield with the relatively rare Lovecraftian \\"Crouch End\\" which, serves up a viciously psychedelic and very different side of King, to say nothing of providing a little side-trip to a part of London (thankfully) not on any map.Karl Edward Wagner's \\"Sticks\\" presages by a quarter-century the discovery of liches in the woods by \\"Blair Witch\\"'s unlucky film students, Clive Barker details an experiment in mortal terror gone horribly awry in \\"Dread\\", Joyce Carol Oates proves there is a fate worse than Death in \\"Night-Side\\", and Lucy Clifford chronicles what happens to naughty little children in \\"The New Mother\\".There are at least ten riveting tales of vintage dread here, any one of which justifies the price of admission. If you haven't met late British terror-writer Robert Aickman, you have three opportunities in \\"Dark Descent\\", although \\"The Hospice\\" is by far the most ambiguous---and disquieting. \\"Seven American Nights\\", an apocalyptic travelogue written by a young Turkish man traveling through a wasted and genetically twisted future America, is by turns terrifying, acutely repulsive, and melancholy, a peculiarly potent spiked little horror-potion cloaked as travelogue by fantasy master Gene Wolfe. Taken together with Thomas Disch's disorienting \\"The Asian Shore\\", they might make you rethink getting away from the tour group the next time you spelunk through a strange land.Algernon Blackwood's \\"The Willows\\" conjures up the horror of the spheres that's moved its haunts to remote islands in the Danube; Walter de la Mare's \\"Seaton's Aunt\\" is a rich, deliciously unhinged little crawlfest instantly recognizable to anyone who has forced himself through an unpleasant evening with an unctuous, intimidating in-law.Hartwell includes a number of authors who rarely ventured into the horror genre: William Faulkner does Southern Gothic proud in \\"A Rose for Emily\\", Flannery O'Connor demonstrates the wisdom of never judging a book---even a Bible---by its cover in \\"Good Country People\\", and Edith Wharton whips up a kind of delayed-blast spook in \\"Afteward\\"---to say nothing of writing one of the finest ghost tales of all time.Hartwell makes some missteps, perhaps unavoidable in such a massive collection. Bishop's \\"Within the Walls of Tyre\\" is pretentious and dull, and \\"The Roaches\\", \\"If Damon Comes\\", and Philip K. Dick's time-twisting \\"Little Something for us Tempunauts\\" may give you chills, but they left me cold and bored. But these are forgivable lapses in a collection so varied and rich.One story in particular that I can't stop thinking about is Michael Shea's unexpected, grisly little delight \\"The Autopsy\\", about an aging, cancerous coroner called to a remote mountain town to conduct autopsies on the bodies of miners killed in a mysterious mine explosion---and who rapidly, terrifyingly shifts roles from examiner to subject. It's not a perfect story---not in style, nor even in its final revelation---but that said it's nasty, and remorselessly surgical, and you'll never forget it. Like most of the darksome little nuggets of terror in this vast volume, it's like a tooth you've had removed---you can't stop yourself from digging your tongue into the raw, fleshy gap.So remember---as civilization collapses and the howls of the mutated and deranged grow closer to your hideaway, throw the bolts, load the rifle, and tuck yourself in with \\"The Dark Descent\\"---at least you'll have the ultimate grimoire containing the very finest tales of terror until those crafty army scientists come up with a solution to save the day. And if they don't? Well, you *do* have 1,000 pages to tide you over."},{"Title":"The Dark Descent","review":"The Dark Descent is an anthology of short horror fiction, that spans the full range of the genre from the extremely overt to the quietly subtle. The editor, David Hartwell, has not only ordered the selections in a way that highlights the influences and references inherent in the work, but introduces each story with a brief, but informative foreword.What's most amazing to me about this tome, is that, having been an avid reader of horror short fiction for many years, and having read many such collections of work, this one included so many masterpieces that I'd never encountered before.I believe this to be one of the most, if not THE most, comprehensive collections available, and recommend it to any fan of short fiction, particularly those who appreciate gothic, horror, and psychological thriller genres."},{"Title":"The Dark Descent","review":"Indispensable reading for fans and scholars of horror, and for anyone who wants to understand what all the fuss is about. Hartwell's lengthy introduction provides the most clear and lucid explanation of horror's primary concepts and terminologies that I have read anywhere, the organization of his material makes clear sense. The book contains some of the standard chestnuts that every good horror collection has to have, but also includes brilliant choices from little-known or little-represented writers. Joanna Russ's dreamy, heartbreaking, shuddering &quot;My Dear Emily&quot; is alone worth the price of the book: if you think you've heard or read every possible variation on the over-worked Vampire theme, this one will tear your head off. Every tale in this hefty collection is similarly disturbing, eerie and beautiful. Hartwell has another collection out on horror novellas, and while also superb, it is hard to top or even match this one. (The only one that might come close is Alberto Manguel's &quot;Black Water,&quot; although it has a lot of fantasy in its mix."},{"Title":"The Dark Descent","review":"As collections go, and horror collections in particular, this might be the best. The editor, David G. Hartwell, is obviously in love with the subject, which makes it so much more than just a collection. Hartwell begins by telling about a discussion of dark fantasy, during which he had the realization that &quot;the good stuff is pretty much all short fiction.&quot;Hartwell then traces the evolution of horror from its origins and into the wave of horror novels, which brought some of the best of all time &quot;as well as a large amount of popular trash rushed into print.&quot; Along the way, he peppers his introduction with observations from Sigmund Freud, H.P. Lovecraft, Stephen King, and a slew of literary critics.One reason this collection is essential is that it is so darn huge (1011 pgs.). Its list of contributors includes King, Lovecraft, Ray Bradbury, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Shirley Jackson, Edgar Allen Poe, Michael Shea, Robert Aickman, Clive Barker, Joyce Carol Oates, D.H. Lawrence, and dozens of others. Enough to make this the most-referenced work in your horror library.Hartwell's vast knowledge and esteem of horror will captivate even those who are not fans of the genre. I wasn't.The only reason I didn't give &quot;The Dark Descent&quot; a 10 was that I reserve that rating for works which are entirely the creation of the author"},{"Title":"The Dark Descent","review":"This book was published in 1987 and contained 56 short stories by 47 writers. There were 30 authors from the United States, 14 from Great Britain, plus Ireland's Sheridan LeFanu and Fitz-James O'Brien and Russia's Turgenev. Of all the writers, nine were women.The pieces ranged from 1835 (Hawthorne) to the 1980s (Dennis Etchison, Michael Shea, Stephen King, Tanith Lee, Clive Barker), covering virtually each decade. Three-quarters of the stories were from the 20th century. Nearly a third were from the 1970s and 80s.From the early or mid-19th century, there were Hawthorne, Poe, LeFanu, O'Brien and Dickens. From the late 19th century up to World War II, there were Turgenev, Bierce, Gilman, Chambers, James, Wharton, Lovecraft, Faulkner, Leiber, Bloch and Bradbury, among others. And from England, M. R. James, Hichens, Blackwood, Onions, De La Mare, Lawrence and Collier. Those after World War II included Sturgeon, Shirley Jackson, O'Connor, Matheson, Dick, Ellison, Oates, Disch, Shea and King. And from England, Aickman -- called the best English writer for that period -- Campbell, Lee and Barker. For Aickman and King, three stories each were included.The editor's introduction discussed how horror fiction had been a vital element of English and American literature for at least 150 years. Three great traditional English writers -- M. R. James, Algernon Blackwood and Walter De La Mare -- plus the Anglo-Irish Lord Dunsany were cited; all but the latter were represented. In the 20th century, U.S. influences included Weird Tales, the magazine founded in 1923, which concentrated on the florid and antiquarian; H. P. Lovecraft -- called the most important American writer of horror fiction in the first half of the 20th century; the pulp fantasy magazine Unknown, founded in 1939, which offered more contemporary settings and clearer prose and helped broaden the category of horror by crossing it with SF; a number of anthologies in the 1930s and 40s; and the trend toward SF horror in the 1950s that included Matheson, Sturgeon and Bradbury. The editor said that the dominant form of horror until the 1970s had been the short story and novella, but this had changed thereafter with the success of novels by Ira Levin, William Peter Blatty and Stephen King.The editor argued that in horror fiction there were three types of emphasis, often interlinked but with one usually foremost: (1) the moral allegorical, the most popular type, which involved the intrusion of supernatural evil into reality, through things like haunting, possession, ghosts or witchcraft (typically, Lovecraft and Stephen King); (2) the study of aberrant human psychology, which might be either supernatural or psychological, as in The Heart of Darkness, Psycho and -- though he wasn't mentioned -- Poe; and (3) the fantastic, which generally avoided either a supernatural or psychological cause, emphasizing foremost the ambiguous nature of reality and encompassing the surreal (Poe, Kafka, De La Mare, Aickman). The editor's categories were a useful frame for many of the stories.There were some great stories in the collection. Most enjoyed were the piece by Michael Shea that described a confrontation between two worlds in an original way, and one by Harlan Ellison that showed NYC in a new light. One of these contained the collection's only vampire story, imagined in a new way. There were also tales by Blackwood, De La Mare, Jackson, Aickman and Barker that powerfully suggested supernatural, psychological or other menace (\\"The Willows,\\" \\"Seaton's Aunt,\\" \\"The Summer People,\\" \\"The Hospice,\\" \\"Dread\\"). There was one of Lovecraft's best tales (\\"Rats in the Walls\\"). The best combination of supernatural intrusion and aberrant psychology, for this reader, was the one by Onions (\\"The Beckoning Fair One\\"). And finally, there was a good though non-horrific description by Disch of a stranger's alienation in a foreign land (\\"The Asian Shore\\"). The selections overall made clear the stylistic connections between writers like Blackwood and Lovecraft, and De La Mare and Aickman.On the other hand, many of the stories after World War II, especially the most recent ones, contained more SF than real, atmospheric horror. Nothing was selected from writers like Irving, Twain, W. W. Jacobs, Lord Dunsany, Paul Bowles, Gerald Kersh, William Sansom, E. C. Tubb or Angela Carter. The editors included a ponderous story by Turgenev, claiming him as one of the few masters of supernatural horror fiction outside the English language in the 19th century, passing over writers like Hoffmann, The Brothers Grimm, Pushkin, Merim&eacute;e, Gogol, Gautier, Villiers de L'Isle-Adam, Maupassant and Garshin.Other large anthologies of horror fiction include The Supernatural Omnibus (1931), A Century of Creepy Stories (1934), A Second Century of Creepy Stories (1937), Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural (1944), Dark Forces (1980), The Arbor House Treasury of Horror and the Supernatural (1981), The Penguin Book of Ghost Stories (1984), The Penguin Book of Horror Stories (1984), Masterpieces of Terror and the Supernatural (1985), The Penguin Book of Vampire Stories (1989), The Mammoth Book of Terror (1991), The Omnibus of 20th Century Ghost Stories (1991), Final Shadows (1991), Masterpieces of Terror and the Unknown (1993), The Oxford Book of 20th Century Ghost Stories (1996), The Oxford Book of Victorian Ghost Stories (2003), The Mammoth Book of Haunted House Stories (2005), The Mammoth Book of Modern Ghost Stories (2007), American Supernatural Tales (2007) and The Oxford Book of English Ghost Stories (2008).Smaller volumes -- below 300 pages or so -- include The Ghost Book (1926), Great Ghost Stories (1930), Great Tales of Horror (1933), Best Ghost Stories (1945), The Second Ghost Book (1952), The Third Ghost Book (1955), The Supernatural in the English Short Story (1959), The Pan Book of Horror Stories, Vols. 1-30 (1959-88), The Fontana Book of Great Ghost Stories, Vols. 1-20 (1964-84), The Fontana Book of Great Horror Stories, Vols. 1-17 (1966-84), The Thrill of Horror: 22 Terrifying Tales (1975), Roald Dahl's Book of Ghost Stories (1984), Weird Tales: Seven Decades of Terror (1997) and Haunted Houses: The Greatest Stories (1997)."},{"Title":"The Dark Descent","review":"This huge, (topping out at just over 1000 pages!) collection of some of the finest tales from the masters of horror has it all. It was wonderful to read works I had not encountered over the years, along with some of the classics of the genre. Some personal favorites were the Lovecraftian \\"Crouch End\\" (King), a truly bizarre and unclassifiable tale, \\"The Swords\\" (Aickman), a masterful work of understated horror, \\"The Summer People\\" (Jackson), and a classic ghost story, \\"The Beckoning Fair One\\" (Onions) A one stop shop for the fan of all things scary."},{"Title":"The Dark Descent","review":"I have not read this book, but I gave it to a dear friend and teaching colleague who has been a horror afficianado for years, and who once taught a class on the development of \\"ghost stories.\\" Scott, however, is definitely a more \\"M. R. James - Lovecraft\\" fan, someone who really appreciates the tales and \\"weird fiction\\" of the time around the turn of the century which spawned the modern \\"horror\\" genre. So, apart from the selections of people like LeFanu and Lovecraft which he had already digested ad nauseam, I was honestly not sure he would enjoy the book since much of it is written by more modern authors. Further, he is, like all devoted readers in any genre, more than aware that anthologies can often be real disappointments.I am pleased to report that he absolutely loved the book, especially the short stories from Shirley Jackson and Clive Barker. And Scott is not a man who minces words over fiction he finds displeasing or amateurish. He was especially taken with the two little-known Jackson offerings which, he says, are as frightening as \\"The Lottery.\\" I also asked him about the binding, since books of this size on glue spine tend to fall apart pretty easily, and he reports that he encountered no problems. He did note, though, that any hardback would be \\"well worth shelling out for,\\" and that's about as high a compliment I suppose anyone could pay. He gave it an unequivocal \\"five stars.\\"So, while I have not taken \\"The Dark Descent,\\" I thought it might be helpful for prospective purchasers to know that a true horror fan of many, many years did, and found the trip more than merely enjoyable. It is indeed rare that I would offer someone else's opinion as a review unless I had the highest regard for it. And I hope Scott's thoughts are indeed helpful.As a gift for the horror fan, I can definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"The Dark Descent","review":"This publication rivals most of the horror/ mystery compilations printed elsewhere. Some of the most consequential and prolific ink slingers of the creepy and the dreary are featured here, and they don't disappoint.Here, in this volume, you will find it all. The works of King, Bradbury, Jackson, Lovecraft, Poe and many others are at your reading pleasure. Some of my personal favorites: The Beach (King); The Call of the Cthulhu (Lovecraft); Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper (Bloch)...I could go on for ever."},{"Title":"The Dark Descent","review":"This is one of the best anthologies of horror tales ever compiled. It reflects the period approx 20 years ago when horror novels were becoming prominent for the first time, and so Hartwell compiled a very thorough and thoughtful collection of shorter fiction to survey the field. The range and quality level are both incredible. His introduction now seems somewhat dated, but he does offer some very insightful thoughts concerning styles of horror fiction and the various possible interpretations more careful readers may consider. My only complaint is the sheer weight of the book - at well over 1,000 pages, it is not easy to hold while reading! This should definitely be reissued with an updated introduction, more stories, and divided into two volumes. \\"The Dark Descent\\" is probably the best single introduction to short horror fiction ever issued and it deserves another publication."},{"Title":"The Dark Descent","review":"I don't have much to add to the excellent reviews already detailing the merits of this book, so I'll just say that as far as I'm concerned it is simply the best collection horror stories you can get. So many of my all time favorites stories I read here for the first time: \\"The Willows\\" \\"Seaton's Aunt\\" \\"Sticks\\" \\"The Yellow Wallpaper\\" \\"The Call of Cthulu\\" \\"The Reach\\". The book covers a wide range of styles and eras, so not every story will appeal to every reader. But if you want to see the best that horror has to offer, you can't do better than this collection."},{"Title":"The Dark Descent","review":"Award-winning horror editor Jeanne Cavelos recommended this book to me as the best horror anthology available. She wasn't kidding. Dark Descent is as close to a definitive retrospective on horror from the 1800s until modern day as a single volume can get, and the anthology avoids any of the trashy \\"torture porn\\" stories that helped destroy the market in the 1980s. Most of the pieces are, in fact, quite literary. I remember studying a few of them in school. The book's three sections, The Color of Evil, The Medusa in the Shield, and A Fabulous Formless Darkness focus on moral allegorical, psychological metaphor, and fantastic stories, respectively."},{"Title":"The Dark Descent","review":"A lot of classic and newer short horror stories.

(I also secretly love the gore, suspense, mystery, and supernatural occurrences). Whether as a textbook or simply a good read, The Dark Descent will take readers on a journey, and may keep more than a couple awake at night!"},{"Title":"The Dark Descent","review":"Whenever I feel the need for a horror story fix, this is my go-to book. The collection of stories is eclectic but wonderful, spanning psychological, situational and overt horror themes. Some are old favorites and classics which most horror aficionados have read before such as \\"The Yellow Wallpaper\\", \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\", \\"The Damned Thing\\", \\"The Crowd\\", \\"Young Goodman Brown\\", and \\"Born of Man and Woman\\". This collection also has two classics which are not readily found in print anymore, \\"The Repairer of Reputations\\" by Robert Chambers and \\"The Beckoning Fair One\\" by Oliver Onions. There are also stories here by more contemporary horror authors such as Stephen King, Ramsey Campbell and Clive Barker. \\"Crouch End\\" by King is one of my absolute favorite stories.Because of this anthology, I discovered some great horror stories written by established authors in other genres such as Edith Wharton's \\"Afterward\\" which left me with a real chill of despair at its end and Walter de la Mare's \\"Seaton's Aunt\\", a subtle but unnerving ghost story.One addition which I would not have considered as being of the horror genre (but nevertheless a very horrifying story) is Flannery O' Conner's \\"Good Country People.\\" This story is quite typical in tone of Flannery O' Connors' work, so if you enjoyed it, you will love her other books as well.In addition, there are gems here by authors whose work I was not familiar with prior to this book, such as Fritz Leiber, Robert Aickman, Gene Wolfe, Thomas Disch and Michael Bishop. Their stories are atypical and very original for this genre and some require a second look before their appeal can be fully appreciated. I skimmed through \\"Seven Arabian Nights\\" and \\"The Asian Shore\\" on my first reading but upon re-reading, these are among my favorite stories in this collection.If this included Joseph Payne Brennan's \\"Canavan's Backyard\\", Shirley Jackson's \\"The Lottery\\" and HP Lovecraft's \\"Pickman's Model\\", it would have a complete collection of all my favorite horror short stories. But as it stands, it's a remarkable collection and worth every penny. Although, given its heft, I really wish the publisher would bring out a Kindle version."},{"Title":"The Dark Descent","review":"This Tome has given me hours of Horrific enjoyment.

There are (too) well-known stories from the old masters and a few pleasantly unpleasant shocks in terms of omissions, there are classics as-well-as bizarre choices from the present big-guys. Overall, a massive collection that has something for all. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Dark Descent","review":"I originally ordered this book thinking it was just a small collection of short stories. However, the total in this book is a whopping 56 stories, and only acouple under 10 pages. Keep in mind though, this is no small book. It's more on the size of a dictionary then a novel, weighing in at almost 3 pounds and clocking over 1000 pages.The book contains a massive collection of stories by about 50 authors, everyone from dickens, poe, lovecraft, to king. very few authors have more then one story in the book, with the exception being stephen king who has three (one I've never read before [The Reach], the others have been released in his other collections of short stories [The Monkey, from Skeleton Crew, and Crouch's End from Nightmares and Dreamscapes, i believe]), and h.p. lovecraft with two stories.It also contains a rather interesting introduction to the whole anthology that sheds a bit of light on not only the book, but the history and importance of short stories; as well as very short, interesting and informative introductions to the stories themselves and the authors.If you're a fan of horror stories, and enjoy the oddities that come from the short stories then this book is highly recommended. The stories range from everything horror and spread almost the entire history of the genre."},{"Title":"The Dark Descent","review":"Comprehensive collection of horror stories.

The book nicely summarizes much of economic literature in non-technical terms. I would highly recommend this book to anyone (including non-specialist economists who want a quick introduction to this area).My one complaint is that the book -- as is clear from the introduction -- is very U.S. centric and has only a few references to other countries. For example, the discussion of why shifting powers to the states might limit the size of government (since they can not print money and therefore can not run persistent deficits and can only tax so much before taxpayers move to escape high taxes) seems to go against the experience of some other federal countries (e.g., Brazil) where the states seem willing to be quite profligate (perhaps relying on federal bailouts)."},{"Title":"Do Deficits Matter?","review":"According to the author, &quot;over the past twenty-five years, the deficit debate among economists has grown increasingly discordant, reflecting the issue's increasing prominence, the growing size of reported deficits, and the collapse of 1960s Keynesianism.&quot;Daniel Shaviro is professor of law at New York University and a former legislation attorney with the Joint Committee on Taxation of the United States Congress. There are few lawyers who write like economists (or better) and Shaviro's mastery of the development of economic thought is both judicious and impressive.Nevertheless, if we can judge the state of economic arguments by papers presented at the annual convention of economists, there would seem to be a reduction in papers even dealing with the the Federal budget deficit. At the end of 1997, most policy-makers are celebrating the virtual elimination of the deficit, and the question becomes one of whose taxes should be cut? In this respect, Shaviro's rather conservative position seems to be one of accepting $200 billion deficits for some time.In my view, a great deal of the skeptical view of economists with regard to the Federal deficit has been the result of the heroic writings of the Classical Keynesian, Robert Eisner, former President of the American Economic Association, reinforced by the last writings of Nobel Prize winner William Vickrey.Shaviro treats Eisner's writings with critical respect and even admits a certain renaissance in Keynesian thinking as a result of the prediction failures of the monetarists, including the rational expectations and real business cycle extensions of neo-classical thinking.This reviewer was pleased to see a younger political economist take the views of Abba Lerner seriously, particularly his pathbreaking article on &quot;functional financs.&quot; Shaviro maintains that &quot;Lerner was perhaps the leading early post-World Waw II Keynesian economist in the United States, not a marginal figure or a crank.&quot; If true, how does one explain the endless peregrinations of Professor Lerner searching for tenure?One little-recognized contribution of Lerner was his recognition of what he called &quot;supply-side inflation&quot; in the seventies, something also understood by the British Keynesian, Sir Roy Harrod, and the Canadian economist John Hotson, who labeled the Harrod insight as the &quot;Harrod dichotomy.&quot; Milton Friedman's reassuring claim that &quot;we are all Keynesians now&quot; permitted the eclipse of the Lernerians in theoretical discussions and the continuation of the dogmatic monetarist belief that inflation is always a question of too much money in the system.More importantly, it resulted in the popularity of Paul Volker's &quot;licking of inflation&quot; with a little-noticed jump of real interest rates in the early eighties and the continued fawning approval of his successor, Alan Greespan, despite the fact that Greenspan has given up the use of monetary aggregates to determine his monetary policy decisions.Shaviro seems overly impressed with an &quot;independent&quot; Fed conducting monetary policy (except for Burns in 1972), and it is very difficult for this reviewer to go along with Shaviro's conclusion that &quot;deliberate management of the business cycle should generally be left to the Federal Reserve, acting through monetary policy.&quot;The persistent fears of the Fed concerning demand-pull inflation in the long run have produced passive or cyclical deficits and eventually deflation. It is no accident that the postwar record deficits have all been passive and achieved by Republican Administrations beginning with Eisenhower and ending with Bush."},{"Title":"Do Deficits Matter?","review":"Law professor Daniel Shaviro's Do Deficits Matter? covers just about every issue associated with the topic of public debt, including, say, optimal savings rate, the limitations of fiscal stabilization policy, and generational accounting. The book is meticulously researched, and fair in its presentation of all sides, none of which get short-changed by the author. As a reader you are therefore given the chance to draw your own conclusions. Shaviro comes down against a constitutional balanced budget amendment. This reader finds his considerations of the actual 1995-1997 proposal rather lawyerly and therefore unconvincing (a modern-day lawyer could probably pick the U.S. Constitution itself apart as having lots of holes), but the important thing is that Shaviro's exposition allows you to make up your own mind.For the most part, the book is highly accessible. Occasionally you'll run into a sentence like \\"In short, the Madisonian response to faction involved spatial centralization of government alongside institutional decentralization\\" (p. 289) to describe strong federal government and separation of powers, but those are rare exceptions.It is refreshing to see a prominent thinker from the left concede three points traditionally made by the right.* Debt-driven fiscal stimulus policies are flawed in both theoretical concept and practical efficacy: \\"even most Keynesians now recognize that the case for an actively countercyclical fiscal policy is extremely weak\\" (p. 10).* Public debt constitutes a burden on future generations: \\"younger individuals and future generations will end up paying for government spending on behalf of older individuals and current generations\\", a phenomenon Shaviro labels \\"tax lag\\" (p. 4).* The very fact that government is able to borrow inherently leads to a larger government sector than would be the case without borrowing: \\"tax lag tends to increase government spending by reducing its perceived (and real) cost to current voters\\" (p. 146).Public debt is like a giant redistribution scheme that transfers wealth from future generations to earlier ones. This is okay with Shaviro because future generations are likely to be wealthier than today's, e.g. because of continued developments in technology. Although he stipulates that this is not sure, it is certainly not unreasonable to deem this likely. But the fact that Shaviro has no qualms about this intergenerational redistribution scheme reveals a liberal bias. What makes public debt unethical is the fact that future generations end up facing a financial burden that is the result of spending and borrowing decisions in which they had no participation. Just because someone else is wealthier than you are does not mean you are therefore justified to go ahead and take part or all of that wealth without that person's consent.Still, if you can see past the author's personal view -- and his overall exposition is for the most part so fair, nonpolemical, and accessible that in this case that is not very difficult -- the book is highly informative and worthwhile. Hence, even this libertarian reader assigns it four stars."},{"Title":"The Incredible 305th","review":"It seems to me a real diservice to the men who flew with the 305th that this book was written. These novelized histories, chalked full of unsourced dialogue yet devoid of concrete detail (honor roll, aircraft lost, lists of targets etc.) are basically a useless waste of valuable paper. With a little more effort, Morrison could really have written an interesting study about an American Bombardment Group, one that would not only have provided this and future generations with an understanding of what the war was like for the men of the 305th, but could serve as a reliable historical resource for historians."},{"Title":"Secret Portland (Oregon): The Unique Guidebook to Portland's Hidden Sites, Sounds, & Tastes (Secret Guide series)","review":"Having greatly enjoyed Secret New York and Secret San Francisco from the same series, I was looking forward to reading Secret Portland. But this one doesn't stack up to the other two. I confess that I am a Portland native (now living in San Francisco), so may be more picky than a visitor reading the book, but it does not have the same insider flair that the New York and San Francisco books have. The other two were written by people who live in the cities they wrote about. It is obvious that this author does not live in Portland and has not spent much time there. The information is standard for any guidebook of the city.In addition to only covering the \\"sites, sounds, & tastes\\" that you can find in any hotel room visitors' guide, this book is full of several small, but irritating, errors. For example, while the book includes a truly secret Portland gem, Martinotti's Italian cafe and deli, it misspelled the name as Marinotti's. Another, more confusing example: under \\"Secret Luxury,\\" the author praises the RiverPlace Hotel as \\"small, elegant, personal . . . more like a posh home than a hotel\\" and, under \\"Secret Al Fresco,\\" describes the hotel's restaurant Lucere as \\"European\\" and \\"chi chi.\\" But under \\"Secret Rooms with a View,\\" the author describes the same hotel as \\"a fairly standard, but pricy, modern hotel\\" and misidentifies the restaurant. Even more confusingly, several listings misidentify the neighborhood, for example, listing many downtown locations in southwest Portland as being in the \\"Buckman\\" neighborhood -- a neighborhood across the river in southEAST Portland.The nail in the coffin was the author's tip on how to pronounce the name of Portland's river, the Willamette: \\"Want to sound like a local? Make sure to pronounce it \\"will-uh-met,\\" with the accent on the \\"uh.\\" Wrong-o! As any Portlander will tell you, it's Will-A-mitt, damn it!"},{"Title":"Secret Portland (Oregon): The Unique Guidebook to Portland's Hidden Sites, Sounds, & Tastes (Secret Guide series)","review":"I have to agree with the other reviewer that mentioned too many mistakes. I picked up this book, and it fell open to \\"Secret Dog Friendly\\", with the information that \\"only two city parks allow dogs to run off the leash.\\" Wrong! There are many parks in Portland with off-leash areas, and there were at least 4 at the time this book was published (2003). On the same page, under the heading \\"Secret Driving Rules\\", the author writes, \\"Don't you wonder every time you visit a new place whether you can turn right on a red light?\\" What?? This has been the law in all 50 states since 1980!! Where has she been for the last 20+ years? The fact that I found these 2 errors/bizarre statements on the FIRST PAGE I looked at do not bode well for the accuracy of this book. And then I flipped to the last category, \\"Secret Yurts\\", where the author writes, \\"You'll find them in state parks in the Portland area as far south as Coos Bay...\\" Coos Bay is 220 miles from Portland- a pretty loose definition of \\"the Portland area\\". It's as if she wanted to include this category because it was cute or funny or offbeat, regardless of whether or not it fit in this book.Her definition of \\"secret\\" is mystifying, at best. Let's take a look at \\"Secret Waterfalls\\"- the first one listed is Multnomah Falls. Oh, you mean the MOST POPULAR TOURIST DESTINATION in Oregon?? That secret?? Or under \\"Secret Libraries\\"- Multnomah County's Central Library. The #1 ranked library by circulation IN THE COUNTRY? Do you think maybe this library is not really much of a secret?Finally, again just flipping around in the book, I came across \\"Secret Personality\\", and find this statement: \\"So beneath the ponytails, beards, Levis and tie-dye,...\\" Well, I didn't even want to finish the sentence! Talk about stereotyping- sheesh. Did this author even VISIT Portland? I would love to see a native or long-time Portlander write this book- I think it would be really interesting."},{"Title":"Computers Are Your Future, Introductory (7th Edition)","review":"very kindly customer service. the book i bought was like new as it sadi on the web site. i will be a faithfur customer since my kids just start the college courses. thanks."},{"Title":"Naughty Nautical Neighbors (Spongebob SquarePants Chapter Books)","review":"This book was great motivation to get my 7 year old to read!

It's main purpose is to train the student to write on par with Joseph Addison. It requires The Spectator by Joseph Addison. I found The Spectator in two volumes on Alibris, excellent condition, J. B. Lippincott Company 1890. You're to read a piece by Joseph Addison three times and then you attempt to write what you have just read. Thus it's important to find a copy of the The Spectator that doesn't have any editing by Joe Blow.You're expected to know Latin and it is assumed that you do so. There are interpretations of the Latin at the end of each chapter but it is disruptive.It's excellent. I highly recommend it.

I could not put the book down until I knew just how the advice from one of the devil's hench-men to an underling would turn out. Kreeft is witty, out-right funny and deadly serious all at the same time. I was simultaneously laughing out loud and horrified to recognize my own behavior. How does an author make that possible? How could I not have known about this book earlier? The book is also full of truth and moral lessons, helpful in any age, but particularly difficult to find in the modern world and impossible to find in such an enjoyable manner."},{"Title":"The Snakebite Letters: Devilishly Devious Secrets for Subverting Society as Taught in Tempter's Training School","review":"A second set of diabolical dialog between a senior tempter (Snakebite) and his young protege (Braintwister) in the style of the Screwtape Letters of C.S. Lewis. He captures the tone and insight of the original masterpiece, giving short chapters of very funny and often uncomfortable insight into how easily we can find our best intentions twisted to serve evil ends, while still feeling \\"pious\\" and \\"spiritual.\\"This book more focuses on the institutional strategies - how the church can have its ends twisted, and still profess faithfulness. Such things as bad translations of scripture, bad and vapid worship music, emphasizing half of a truth and missing the whole, and so on. His chapters on the homosexualizing of the Catholic clergy, written 10 years ago, are worth reading in light of today's problems.Much recommended."},{"Title":"The Snakebite Letters: Devilishly Devious Secrets for Subverting Society as Taught in Tempter's Training School","review":"I never thought the day would come when I gave a Peter Kreeft book a poor grade. But the day has come.This book is written in the style of the classic \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" by C.S. Lewis. I don't fault Kreeft for falling short of the brilliance of Lewis, for almost any author is going to miss so high a mark. But I do fault Kreeft for failing to tell a consistent story over the course of this book. In \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" Lewis shows you the life of a young man (from the perspective of his tempters) from the time he becomes a Christian, all the way through to his death. We see him while he is a baby in his faith. We see him fall into sin, and then repent. We see him struggle in World War II and then follow him to his death. Finally we get to see a glimpse of him as he rises into Glory. We can see in this young man our own lives, our own struggles and our own temptations. And we can hope for his reward.\\"The Snakebite Letters\\" fails utterly to imitate this style. The man in this book has just converted to Christianity. Then, out of nowhere, he's sleeping with some girl we never even heard of. Then, just as suddenly, she's having an abortion. Then we never hear about her again! Then there's several chapters about him attending classes at a liberal Catholic university. Then the book just ends. What a disappointment! The chapters don't flow at all. It is as if each chapter was written independently and then hobbled together into a book.Peter Kreeft is one of my favorite authors. I get the feeling that either he didn't spend much time on this book, or that it was heavily edited by someone else. It's a pity. Kreeft is one of the few authors that could pull off a legitimate update of \\"The Screwtape Letters.\\" But he missed with this one..."},{"Title":"The Snakebite Letters: Devilishly Devious Secrets for Subverting Society as Taught in Tempter's Training School","review":"Normally I love Peter Kreeft's works, but this one isn't sitting right with me. I have really thought hard about why it doesn't sit right, why I don't think it warrants five stars, like most of what I read by Dr. Kreeft.There is of course the obvious: by even writing this book Dr. Kreeft opens himself to attacks and comparisons because he is not C.S. Lewis. Yet, I found this book to be at times clear, concise, incisive, and important. That isn't why it doesn't \\"sit right.\\"Perhaps it suffers from weaknesses in content, and form, that will deny it a place like the one reserved for C.S. Lewis' classic original? But that is self-evident. I didn't read this thinking it would outdo what Lewis has already done. This is no classic of English literature, as Screwtape is, but I don't think it pretends to be. It acknowledges the importance of that seminal work by Lewis by paying homage to it through imitation.So why doesn't this book sit right? It feels even like a terrible book in some respects.Many valid criticisms of this book have been raised here: there is no continuity of narrative as there was in Lewis' book. Kreeft is too focused on politics and the culture war and the resultant work is perhaps too myopic, polemical, and hard hitting as a result.Perhaps both criticisms are only somewhat off the mark, even if they point in some way to people's valid discomfort with the text. Kreeft, if anything, arguably had a too ecumenical and \\"liberal\\" agenda when writing this book.I think my biggest problem with the text is that PERSONAL sins, the sort of everyday and real temptations that will lead a soul away from God that Lewis addresses, are almost totally absent from this book. This book is ALL about the \\"culture war\\" and \\"politics.\\" Perhaps Kreeft thought C.S. Lewis had already done that, and his book was designed to be \\"different,\\" but I think our Church in the US is suffering from a such a myopic focus on these worldly political things, and this book perhaps plays into that. Consider, as many priests and authors like Kreeft are so focused on the culture war, what is being lost? What aren't we hearing?This review will look at contraception as one example of what I am trying to get at, however we could substitute almost any other personal sin for it and make the same point.Kreeft portrays contraceptive sex in marriage as basically okay in this book. Its just that unitive and procreative sex is better. In this book, marital sex, even contraceptive sex, is abominable to the demons. The only things that cause the demons pain are homosexual sex, premarital sex, and affairs (the culture war stuff). God's law about marriage and sex seems limited to no sex outside of marriage. That is the only real sin there is. With all due respect to Dr. Kreeft, that is a very protestant and very incoherent point of view.Consider this passage from \\"Snakebite\\" Dr. Kreeft's demon-character who takes the place of C.S. Lewis' :\\"Just think, Braintwister, what a horrible time tempters have who are assigned to faithful married people who time after time enact their disgusting little animal ecstasies within the secure framework of the Enemy's law, like a great painting surrounded by a great frame. Those poor devils have none of the ghoulish glee you had at the two little animals running from the Enemy in rebellion before, and in shame after, the deed. Those poor devils feel nothing but pain at the animals' unmitigated love, especially if they hold nothing back and do not even contracept.\\"This passage is silly, philosophically weak, and not very Catholic. Contraceptive sex in marriage constitutes grave matter, and thus has one of the necessary components of a mortally sinful act. For Dr. Kreeft who has no problem speaking about the evils of gay marriage, to write such a passage as above may even amount to hypocrisy. Those who fight gay marriage, but gleefully accept contraceptive heterosexual marriage (or simply ignore it as a problem), are philosophically incoherent and blatantly hypocritical.Also, if you ever a hear a lay person (or a protestant) angrily condemning someone who is dealing with same-sex attraction, or someone who has had an abortion, but meantime goes home and is using chemical contraceptives, you are hearing (and seeing) the very definition of the Pharisee. Homosexual sex is wrong because it is sex that is removed from the procreative function. The contracepting couple is guilty of much the same thing. And most chemical contraceptives are abortifacients!And, unless one has struggled to stay chaste within the context of marriage by living the totality of the Church's teaching on sex and sexuality, how will one have empathy for those who are stuck in sinful states? So many who struggle to live the Church's teaching have failed time and time again in trying to live them out. The most so many of us can claim is that our failures get less frequent, and we are on the road to someday (God willing) being holy.Here is what bothers me: every time I read a book like this, and increasingly every time I go to Church, I hear a constant message about the evils of our culture. Abortion, gay marriage, etc. etc. etc. These things ARE dangerous and evil and need to be preached on, but we are preaching to the choir. In Church we run the risk of turning the message into something about \\"those people.\\" The Gospel is here to condemn those \\"liberals,\\" those who advocate so-called \\"gay marriage,\\" those who advocate for \\"abortion rights.\\" Everything is \\"them them them.\\"But how many such people are REALLY in the pews? Not many these days. And what do you never seem to hear about?What about personal sin; the way we ALL offend God by our actions? When was the last time you heard a homily on the evils of contraception for instance? Or avarice? Or dishonesty? The average Church has a VERY long communion line, and no one going to confession, and everyone is contracepting. However, the message from a book like this, and from too many pulpits, is that the problem lies with \\"those people;\\" the liberals, the pro-choicers, the homosexuals.And this is dangerous, because it leads to self-righteousness and a judgmental disposition that can lead one to believe that getting to heaven is just about buying into a certain political (or theological) ideology. And that too is protestant. Getting to heaven is NOT just buying into an ideology. We AREN'T saved by faith alone, which amounts to having solid doctrine alone.With Kreeft, and with those clerics so focused on a war with \\"those people,\\" we run the risk of not preaching the truth to the people sitting in our pews. We run the risk of not encouraging repentance on the part of our congregations, but instead encouraging judgement.I think this is my problem with this book, and about all books that focus purely on the culture war. Is the Devil behind abortion? Yes! I abortion evil? Yes! Should our focus be on reaching out to women in crisis situations, trying to show them the truth with love, and standing with them? YES! Is being pro-life only about voting and buying into a political/ideological construct? NO!!! And no, I am not saying it is okay for a Catholic to vote pro-choice. It isn't!! But no Catholic who really understood the depth of what the Church teaches here WOULD! And that is the problem.And if we are judging others for taking innocent human life in the womb, but are popping birth-control pills that often do exactly that, what exactly are we doing? We are acting like nothing but pharisees.Perhaps its because I just left a parish where the only things preached on were political, never personal. It was a sin to vote a certain way, a sin to support a certain candidate, but never a sin to DO anything. Contraception? We'll only mention that at the NFP Mass at 9:00 at night when no one who isn't already in \\"the know\\" is around. When we do present it we won't actually talk about sin or anything... its just an alternative to contraception...But I think its more than that. I think there is a mindset out there that places all the blame on the other, and keeps us from judging ourselves harshly. The Christian however is called to be his OWN WORST critic and to deal with others with charity. C.S. Lewis artfully avoided the trap of making Screwtape polemical in that sense. Kreeft doesn't; and his book just doesn't sit well as a result."},{"Title":"The Snakebite Letters: Devilishly Devious Secrets for Subverting Society as Taught in Tempter's Training School","review":"of the general themes Prof. Kreeft covers in his other, more \\"serious\\" academic works.As a former government bureaucrat (recovering nicely, thank you!), I particularly enjoyed the narrative of what happens to various tempters who fail in their missions - they get assigned to Hell's version of \\"sensitivity training.\\" &lt;Heh.>I am inclined to recommend the reader to stay with Prof. Kreeft's academic work, and leave the related \\"stirring fiction\\" to one of his favorite writers, C.S.

Lewis. While his \\"Screwtape Letters\\" provided a satirical sendup of the woes of modern Christianity in general, Kreeft adopts Lewis' format to address specific problems within the Catholic Church in the post-Vatican II world. Yes, the plot is a little forced and disjointed at points, but when given a little slack in the narrative department, Kreeft succeeds in delivering a witty, acerbic take on the modern epidemic of \\"cafeteria Catholicism\\" and the consequent decline in what had been an ever-progressive development of solid Christian morality.For what he lacks in storytelling ability, he more than makes up for it in erudite observation and delightfully irreverent commentary, taking jabs at everything from liberal theology and the flimsy consciences it forms to \\"constipated congregations\\" who struggle to sit through the mangled liturgy and music programs of many modern churches, but not without taking staunch \\"traditionalists\\" to task, as well. Throughout, Prof. Kreeft's laugh-out-loud satire is spot on, highlighting in a lighthearted way many of the serious issues that face an institution that is increasingly seen, even within its own ranks, as primitive and outmoded. Using his devils to play \\"the angel's advocate\\", he unveils the timeless beauty of the Catholic worldview, obscured by 2 centuries of cultural upheaval in which science has attempted to usurp the role of philosophy and subjective feelings have largely trumped objective values. In this respect, Kreeft's narrative is triumphant: via the satirical correspondence of his demonic antagonists, he demonstrates the insidiously slow manner in which moral relativism folds a society in upon itself, using every day examples that will easily resonate with the experience of the average reader.While \\"The Snakebite Letters\\" may not be a masterpiece of satirical fiction, it is certainly a masterpiece of satirical philosophy."},{"Title":"The Snakebite Letters: Devilishly Devious Secrets for Subverting Society as Taught in Tempter's Training School","review":"My dear Wormwood,Obviously you are making excellent progress. This volume from the often dangerous Dr. K----- is sure to be harmless in the long run. Whenever he speaks in his capacity as a philosopher, writing in a philosophical way about philosophical things, he is sharper than Michael's sword when it was unsheathed against Our Father. In this book the doctor makes the gleeful mistake of copying the work of a man whose insights into the nuances of human nature were far greater than his own will ever be. If you can keep him on the path of imitating a man he can never imitate well, you will easily blunt him as a tool of the Enemy.Ah, how much destruction Lewis' book did to our unholy cause! It was frightening how much insight he had into our methods of temptation, however wrong he may have been on a certain facts. How much better is this book by the current doctor, who has such a mind for abstract truths but such a tin ear for the subtler movements of the human soul. And how wonderfully ironic that at one point in the book he writes, \\"Only scholars can be passionate about abstractions,\\" when he himself spends the entire book writing passionately about abstractions, and devotes almost no pages at all to the methods which our illustrious Spiritual Order utilizes to catch souls in our nets. As if we attack humans primarily in the realm of the mind! Of course nearly everything he says in the book is true, and undoubtedly its light will shine brightly on the few human souls who read past the first chapter, but that light is abstract enough that it will hopefully fade within a short time.As you know, my dear nephew, for some time it has not been your mission to capture the soul of Dr. K----- for our domain (which by now would be almost impossible) but to render him ineffectual in the realm of Catholic apologetics and evangelism. The two best ways of accomplishing this are: (1) to keep him stuck in the realm of abstractions, never understanding human nature the way Lewis did so that he might actually connect with readers on a basic level, and presenting human behavior in the most cartoonish fashion; and (2) to keep him so much in love with Lewis that he compromises the necessity and uniqueness of the Catholic Church (which we happily kept Lewis from entering to the bitter end) in his apologetical works, out of a misplaced desire to be as famous throughout the various schismatic groups as Lewis was.I look forward to your next report.

From bankruptcy to something as simple as how to correct issues the often occur due to our sometimes inaccurate credit system (garbage in, garbage out springs to mind), Credit Repair has some good stuff in it but much of it is common sense (for example one way to rebuild credit AFTER bankruptcy according to the book is to use your own money put into a credit union and then use it as a secured loan. The only problem with this is that they're assuming that those who declare bankruptcy are going to have a large sum of money to do this with anyway and that's not often the case).This isn't a bad book just lacking in creative approaches to rebuild credit union and passes along pretty common sense actions to improve bad information on credit reports.

About eight years ago, I was stung by a credit card rejection. I couldn't understand why. When I checked my credit report, I found an erroneously reported unpaid debt. My fascination with my credit score began. Over the years, I learned quite a lot about credit reporting. As a result, I was fascinated to read this book.The advice in this book is generally good and avoids some common misconceptions about credit scores and credit reporting. I really like that it begins by noting that someone who finds themselves in debt trouble needs to take a hard inventory of what they spend money on. And then, the authors make the excellent point that we can save a ton of money by eating at home, preparing foods instead of buying prepared foods, buying a used car instead of new, or god forbid, leased. Americans tend to view these sorts of choices as horrible indignities, but they really are just sensible moves even if you're not in financial trouble.If you do have problems with your credit report, the strategy is to write to the creditors and then to each of the credit reporting agencies, pointing out any errors or mitigating circumstances and asking for the information to be removed. It's simple and effective.The authors also make a point of cautioning against relying on charlatans who promise quick fixes.Some may find the sections dealing with strategies for postponing foreclosure to be questionable. But I was pleased to see that the authors don't cheaply vilify any parties, instead, as throughout, sticking to a pragmatic outlook.Recommended."},{"Title":"Credit Repair (with CD-Rom)","review":"This is an excellent resource to have on hand when you need to clean up and or really fix your credit!

It even includes a section on budgeting (which if you don't know how to do, you aren't going to be able to repair your credit), and assessing your financial situation."},{"Title":"Credit Repair (with CD-Rom)","review":"I found this book to be very helpful with alot of great pointers.It is quite detailed and I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Credit Repair (with CD-Rom)","review":"If you're looking for a guide on how to repair your damaged credit that focuses on real methods that work within the law then this is the book for you.

Adding to that were the bank bailouts, which makes in harder to get credit.This book offers practical steps on first how to assess your credit problems, then how to fix them, including paying off debt and avoiding foreclosure. After that, a large section of the book is dedicated to things one can do to rebuild their credit. There is also a computer disc included to keep all this infomation.One thing I really liked about this book was it was written in a helpful, not judgmental fashion. many people today are facing these problems who never thought they would be and may find it embarrassing. Unlike some authors or TV commentators who think tough love is the way to approach this issue, this book is straight-forward, easy to read and strictly informative."},{"Title":"Credit Repair (with CD-Rom)","review":"I found this book to be very informative. Even if you do not need Credit Repair, it would be a good book for your library, because you never know when you may need it.Not only does it cover how to get your credit report, it shows you how to read and understand it, how to fix errors and dispute problems. The book talks about all of the other reports out there, that most people probably don't even know exist like your Medical History Report, Tenant History Report, Check Writing History Report and others.The book teaches you about bankruptcy, what the different chapters of bankruptcy are and where to go on the internet to find out more information. It also teaches you about credit counseling, debt management programs and about the scams that are run with these options. It tells you were to go on the internet to find the ones that are legit and the questions you should always ask if you try one of these options.The book also teaches you how to get new credit after you have hit bottom, when it is best to try for new credit, who it best to try with and your rights under the law.The book also includes form to help in many of the situations outlined in the book and a CD-ROM with more forms to help you on your way to a healthier credit life.I felt the book was easy to read, interesting and eye opening. I followed along with it and did several of the things that anyone can and should do, even if you are not repairing your credit. I was given information about my own credit health that I hadn't looked at in years. I recommend this book for everyone.

I knew these things------but I found out the hard way. Why should you have to learn the hard way--when you can have thnis book in your library and read or look up information whenever you need to do so?Another chapter tells you who to avoid when companys say they can help you with you credit ---when they may be out just to get money out of rr you.......They also offer you tips on how to make a little money to help with your bills--things you might not of thought about.The rear portion of the books has all sorts of forms and documents that will help to keep track of you money and bill payments and your monthly budgets.Also , there is a CD-ROM that allows you to work off of your computerby having the forms and doucuments loaded into it.Personally--I think parents should get this book for their teens and college students BEFORE they begin to get Credit Card offers.I wish I had this book when I was 19 or twenty.

It tells you how, and how not to go about fixing your credit. It will show you how and why the quick-fix-it books don't work. How &quot;File Segregation&quot; is a border-line illegal tactic, that is unsafe and doesn't work. It simply and clearly teaches you what does work, and how to put your new found knowledge of the credit laws, and your rights as a consumer to work for you.You will not be disapointed with this book. The only people that will not like this book are the people that are looking for quick-fix tactics that are illegal or questionable at best, and I am not one.

Eventually you will get that slacker who just wants to go to lunch early, and just hits the okay button.Here is another fact: There are tips and tricks you can use to remove anything, and this book doesn't contain any of them. For example, if you have a bankruptcy, send to the court that currently holds the paperwork and ask them for a copy of anything they have provided Experian, Transunion or Equifax. They will reply with a letter stating that they do not provide information to credit reporting agencies. Now dispute your bankruptcy with all three bureaus. They will all claim to have verified it, and list the court as the source. Reply with a copy of the letter, showing them you caught them in a lie, and demanding they remove the mark, which they FAILED to verify inside of 30 days.Having been in the business, I know hundreds of these proven strategies, and none of them are listed in this next-to-useless book and CD on \\"Credit Repair\\".You will do far better getting on a credit repair message board than shelling out your hard earned money on this book."},{"Title":"Credit Repair (with CD-Rom)","review":"This book was so helpful, I just can't uderstand the bad reviews!

Things change so fast from one year to another and I figured that I'm not at the stage in life to make drastic changes on my spending. Plus I was happy with my budgeting. Was I in for a surprise! The book is indeed very up to date for this year, but what stood out for me are the ideas on how to handle budgets and existing debts - with specific options listed. The book has an array of forms you may need to repair your credit, and you can get free updates to keep up with current trends in the field. And in addition to that, you may find simple ways to improve your credit rating for the next time you need to make a major purchase."},{"Title":"Credit Repair (with CD-Rom)","review":"Ok, by now you should know that most of the credit repair books all say basically the same thing: Contact all three credit-reporting agencies, get copies of your credit report and challenge everything that is not 100% accurate until it gets removed. After correcting your reports, then you begin to repair your credit by paying all your bills on time, open a checking account, and do not bounce any checks.You might even open up a savings account and then take out a loan just to pay it back, thus improving your \\"credit worthiness\\" (First, ask the bank if the loan will be reported to a credit agency in order to make sure it's worth your while)Another great thing about this book, which makes it different from most other credit repair books is that it contains PLENTY of tear-out pre-written letters in the back of the book. Just pull-out and mail, very simple.The other book I recommend is: \\"BestCredit: How to Win the Credit Game\\" , written by Dana Neal.It takes some work but Oh what a relief it is when you are finally out from under. In this modern world, if you are living on \\"the Grid\\" then you are going to have to have a good credit score to get by in life.Best of Luck !"},{"Title":"Credit Repair (with CD-Rom)","review":"I was a little disappointed since most of it was information I already new, but it may not be the case with everyone.

Life happens! This book is a wealth of information that will help guide you and assist you with the appropriate available forms on the enclosed CD.What ever your circumstances may be, here is your starting point. You owe it to yourself and/or your family to start living a better life. Don't waste time thinking about repairing your credit, start acting on it. The more time you spend think about doing it, is time wasted."},{"Title":"Credit Repair (with CD-Rom)","review":"Most of the information contained in this book is easily accessible online for free by using Google to search for credit repair, but many noobs will find it more convenient to have all the information in one easy to navigate book. Overall, the book is really well written and information flows in the logical order. I also like how the book has many quotes from experts in the field so you know the information they are giving is accurate. The biggest reason for ordering this book is the included CD which includes all the forms, and letters that you would need for repairing your credit. Again, much of this is available free online but many will find this much easier.Overall, I'd recommend this book if you aren't comfortable using Google and browsing the internet for answers. It's well written and will actually help you repair damaged credit."},{"Title":"Credit Repair (with CD-Rom)","review":"The book is actually very short - with solid advice and lots of sample forms and letter examples. The short story is that there really is no way to repair credit quickly - it just takes time and diligence.This book can help shorten that time and make the turn around faster and less costly. For this reason alone - it is easily worth what you would pay to by it."},{"Title":"Credit Repair (with CD-Rom)","review":"I completely agree, someone said that most of the information in CREDIT REPAIR is common knowledge. I'd suggest using it as part of the process, but not the only process. It helps to explain the credit process, and the different types and calculations of credit scores. It also offers some basic advice on dealing with collection, nothing you can't find on Google. However, the forms are worthwhile.I would NOT advise anyone to follow the advice about calling creditors. It's one thing to deal with the company, but once that company sells your debt, the people holding it aren't looking to make your life easy. CREDIT REPAIR would be useful to people with smaller credit issues or very new credit issues."},{"Title":"Credit Repair (with CD-Rom)","review":"This book contains lots of useful information for those who are new to the credit repair game, and if you haven't done much research on your own, you'll probably find it a valuable resource. However, if you frequently troll credit forums or have any clue what goes into a FICO score, then there's nothing here that you couldn't already find online. Being able to have it at hand while you're going over your credit reports is useful in forming a plan of attack, and the CD-Rom contains some good programs and templates (though I had trouble using some of them on my Mac), but overall, if you know anything about the credit repair game, then this isn't a must-have addition to your library."},{"Title":"Credit Repair (with CD-Rom)","review":"I don't know anyone who couldn't use a little help with their credit rating, and this book can help no matter where you sit with yours. The authors provide a lot of real world advice that can help you recover some of the questionable, or out of date bad marks on your credit report, as well as how to avoid having them happen again the next time. There are rules the credit agencies have to abide by, so leverage them to make the system work for you. You can go hire someone else to take some of these steps for you, but why not stay in control and get it done yourself. This book helps empower you to make this possible."},{"Title":"Credit Repair (with CD-Rom)","review":"This is exactly what I was looking for. It covers all aspects of the debt problem and then gives you practical, doable ways to deal with each of them. I bought one for my daughter and she is also pleased with what she is learning."},{"Title":"Credit Repair (with CD-Rom)","review":"This oversize paperback is over 400 pages long and includes a CD-ROM. All of the useful and pertinent data probably could've been condensed into a 50 page booklet. While the data is useful to some and easy to understand, there is a LOT that isn't covered adequately, if at all. This book is best for someone who knows absolutely nothing about credit or paying bills, such as a teenager about to start attending college and will be making car payments and living off campus -- this book would be very informative to someone such as that.Most folks who have serious credit problems will not benefit from this book. If you are having wages garnished from a 20 year old student loan you cannot afford to pay the interest on, or if the IRS has filed a lien against you that is way beyond the scope of this book (although to be fair that is a bit more serious than \\"credit repair\\"). Another serious problem is that of dealing with collection agencies, many of whom are disreputable and fail to abide by the law. If a collector is trying to collect on a \\"zombie debt\\" that is beyond the statute of limitations or may belong to someone with a similar name other than yourself, they will call you a dozen times a day and fill your mailbox with threatening letters. Only the polite and friendly collectors are addressed here. What to do if a process server comes to your home with a court summons is not addressed either, nor is garnishment of wages or bank accounts. Of course, these topics have little to do with improving one's FICO score, but they are relevant to most debtors, at least as a what if scenario, and should at least get a paragraph or two in a 400+ page book. What to do when TransUnion fails to provide the annual copy of your credit report (as required under federal law) is not addressed either.While this is a good book, it is a very basic book dealing primarily with rather minor matters. Anyone with serious credit problems will need to look elsewhere. At least this book tells those folks to avoid scam credit repair services and predatory loans. Three Stars."},{"Title":"Credit Repair (with CD-Rom)","review":"This is a good book that attempts to cover a lot of material in an easy to understand format. It also has a CD-Rom that has some invaluable forms that make dealing with the credit reporting agencies and creditors and collections agencies easier. I like NOLO Press books and this one lives up to high standards set by past publications.As the title suggest this book helps people repair their credit. I picked up this book because while my credit score is fine I want information on how to dispute what I felt was an invalid debt sent to a collection agency and at the same time protect my credit score. This book helped me do that but the focus is on those who need to help people who have bad credit rather than help people who may have their good credit endangered. It works for both but has much more for those needing to fix bad credit histories.The book starts out in the first three chapters by explaining what credit reporting agencies do how to find out your credit score and how to fix errors in your credit report. This is relevant to everyone regardless of whether a person has a lot of debt or no debt at all. Checking your credit report is important.Chapters four through eight talk about ways for people to get a handle on their debt and figure out how to cut expenses. Bankruptcy is also discussed. This is geared toward people who have money problems and have built up debt.Chapter Nine looks at how to negotiate with creditors and collection agencies. While Chapter 10 talks about how to get help from outside sources to negotiate and manage debt.Chapter 11 looks at ways to build a positive credit history. This is relevant to people who may just want to improve a good credit history as well as rebuilding a bad one.Chapter 12 talks about the correct way to use credit and debit cards. This was more relevant to those who have misused these in the past.Chapter 13 deals with protecting yourself against identity theft. This chapter covers a very important topic in a very short amount of space. It is a good over view. It is important to note that Nolo has a book just on that topic alone called Stopping Identity Theft. Having been the victim of Identity theft I highly recommend that book.The appendixes have a list of resources ranging from Debtors Anonymous to State Consumer protection Agencies.Finally the Forms and Letters which are in the back of the book and on the CD-Rom range from letters requesting credit reports and letters to collection agencies, to forms to chart expenses and also complaint letters about collection agencies. There are 39 all together. These are great because they give a person a form to use to communicate in writing which is critical.This is a great book for those who need to repair their credit and a very good book for those who want to make sure their good credit is not damaged."},{"Title":"Credit Repair (with CD-Rom)","review":"I selected this book from the Amazon Vine Program hoping it had information about removing inquiries from my credit report. The only thing impacting my FICO negatively is too many inquiries. I received these inquiries when I took money out of the stock market and put it to various CDs at many banks. The banks did an inquiry to make sure it is me. It does not seem fair to me that when I give money to a bank that it would/should impact my FICO negataively but it does. A loan specialist at a car dealership told me that the credit repair software available at Office Depot has information about removing these kind of inquiries so I was hoping this book would as well; it did not.Eventhough this book did not have the specific information I am looking for, it seems as good as any other Nolo Press book for which I am a big fan; can't go wrong with NOLO press."},{"Title":"Credit Repair (with CD-Rom)","review":"When applying for a car loan recently I discovered a couple of errors on my credit report (accounts that weren't mine, outdated information, etc). I considered paying one of those \\"credit clean-up\\" company to fix things, but after seeing this book I decided to give it a try for myself first. This book offered very detailed, easy to understand information that made it very easy for me to correct the information on my credit report, and within 3 months my credit file was corrected and my credit score had increased substantially from having the errors removed. The book also suggests ways to keep your credit safe from identity thieves, and is well worth the read for everyone."},{"Title":"Credit Repair (with CD-Rom)","review":"I like this book, because like all NOLO books, it's easy to understand and provides a lot of resources. The pre-made template letters and forms in the back and on CD are great. The only thing I didn't like was that it's geared mainly towards credit card debt. There are lots of people out there without credit card debt who still have bad credit. As for myself, my credit problems come from medical bills, student loans and child support problems. All things that aren't really covered or aren't covered enough in this book. A good starter book but not comprehensive."},{"Title":"Credit Repair (with CD-Rom)","review":"When I started reading CREDIT REPAIR, I had a number of questions regarding credit issues, most related to dealing with debt resulting from long-term, ongoing medical care. I couldn't find answers on the Net, and hoped that this book would sufficiently address my concerns. It both did and didn't - clarifying a few issues but not even addressing others.Much of the information provided I knew already due to extensive Internet researching - but even then I took over 8 pages of notes on information and suggestions which I knew would help me in the future. Readers who have not fully investigated their subjects of interest online are likely to not only save time keeping this book at hand, but also find it to be even more helpful, practical, comprehensive, and readable than I did.CREDIT REPAIR is divided into chapters which focus upon: credit reports and scores, cleaning up credit, assessing financial history, reducing expenses and debt, declaring bankruptcy, raising money, negotiating with creditors and collection agencies, getting help, building positive credit history, using credit and debit cards and dealing with identity help.At least as valuable as these chapters are the 36 forms which Nolo Press provides both within the book and on the included cd. These forms are particularly useful to debtors making agreements with creditors and agencies in writing. They include such topics as: Request Removal of Incorrect Information by Creditors, Request Long Term Lower Payments, Inform Creditor of Judgment Proof Status, Offer (Reduced) Lump Sum Payment, Request for Verification of Debt, and Debt Collector: Cease All Contact.Certainly one benefit of the book is helping you stay clear of all the questionable credit and debt management schemes and agencies that abound, and discover instead recommended, reliable sources - web sites, books, for-profit and nonprofit agencies. Not only does the book help you, for example, discover trustworthy credit counseling services; it also provides guidelines for assessing their services and questions to ask before committing to their services.Just as useful are explanations regarding accounts which are listed or not listed on credit reports, and how to use that knowledge to determine what accounts to open and pay in full monthly in order to build credit.Should you close a credit card account because of its fees or high interest rate, or keep a credit card you do not use? What do re-aging an account and \\"removing the tradelines\\" mean and when, how and why might you want to ask creditors to take such actions? Knowing what impact different actions have upon your credit score is important to know.Other tips indirectly related to credit repair may also benefit you - e.g. how to get your tax return done free or receive additional free credit reports, determining whether you are judgment proof, and dealing with debt issues in regard to mortgage loans and apartment tenancy. The book also provides strategies for negotiating with creditors - contacting credit card companies and stopping harrassment by debt collection agencies.CREDIT REPAIR is, like other Nolo books, reliable, comprehensive and authoritative. Even if you know a lot of the information contained within it, reading it is likely to increase your financial knowledge and confidence, ease your anxiety level, and help you both to save money and improve your credit rating - whether or not it answers all your questions."},{"Title":"Credit Repair (with CD-Rom)","review":"I had just reviewed \\"Your Credit Score, Your Money & What's at Stake\\"another credit book, gave it a 5 star, and then read and concluded this book is superior. \\"Credit Repair\\" offers more details, includes forms, gives more specific and accurate information, and, in the section on collections, provides lots of legal answers that protect the consumer that aren't even in \\"Your Credit Score\\".An outstanding 5 star plus."},{"Title":"Credit Repair (with CD-Rom)","review":"If this book cost $10 or less I would give it 4 stars. I must deduct 1 star because this book is way overpriced. I already knew most of the info provided in this book so it was not a great help to me (plus my credit does not need repair anyway). And other reviewers are correct in stating that most of the info provided in this book is available free on the Internet. But if you want to have it already collected for you and put in one book, this book does that. And I have to add that the title of the book is misleading as a lot of the book does not deal with credit repair at all. It talks about setting budgets, reducing debt, trying to work out agreements with creditors, etc. And I must remind all that if there is negative yet correct info in your credit reports, there is little chance of getting it removed unless it passes the relevant time limit (becomes stale), which for most but not all kinds of negative information is 7 years. This could be a useful book covering the basics for somebody new to the credit game. But for most I suspect it will be just a rerun of the same old movie with a new cover and title. I cannot recommend this book at a price of over $20."},{"Title":"Credit Repair (with CD-Rom)","review":"I have generally found most of NOLO's books rather thorough, enlightening and enjoyable to read. This was not one of them.First of all, the title is slightly misleading, as very little of the book is actually devoted to \\"credit repair\\". The title may help to sell books, but you won't find many legitimate ways to \\"repair\\" your bad credit, in this book or anywhere else. The phrase makes for a good-sounding sales pitch, but doesn't work in the real world, which is firmly under the control of the three major credit bureaus.My main problem with the book is that it skims over what are rather important topics that should probably have entire chapters devoted to them, rather than just a sentence or two. For example, what little information it contains on Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection is now completely obsolete and should have been given much more attention, especially from a negotiating standpoint.I also found much of the book's suggestions more wishful than practical. It's limited discussion on negotiating with creditors doesn't really give one enough information to do any negotiation from a practical standpoint. No real guidelines or special insight into what one should expect is given. Although there are a handful of form letters included on the CD-ROM, the important information (such as how much you can afford to pay each month) is simply left blank, with no suggestion as to how one should arrive upon the figures. You are basically being given a gun with no ammunition in it and told to defend yourself against someone with a nuclear warhead. Other than leading the lamb to slaughter, the forms don't accomplish much of anything.The CD itself seems to just be a gimmick to make to book look as if it has more value than it really does. There are maybe two dozen .rtf (rich text) form letters included on the CD, and that's it. The full text of the CD is also included in the book. In fact, about a third of the book seems to simply be a hard copy of the form letters on the CD.As to the critique about the book containing nothing but information that you could find on the Internet for free... Yes, it is true. Then again, so are quite a number of other non-fiction books. So, I won't use that as a yardstick to measure this title by. What is perhaps more worth mentioning is the fact that there are far, far BETTER and more complete sources of free information on the Internet than is contained in this book. Even the form letters are rather weak when compared to ones I have found elsewhere for free. For example, the website companion for the book \\"Good Credit is Sexy\\" has many letters that are more detailed, practical and up-to-date.Needless to say, I would take a pass on this title, unless you just happen to have every other book available on credit repair and want to complete your collection."},{"Title":"Credit Repair (with CD-Rom)","review":"My credit is on the upswing, but it's still not great, so I was hoping this book would offer some specific information to get credit from \\"fair\\" to \\"good\\".I found that it doesn't provide much specific information at all. It's mostly general, and it's pretty basic stuff. I think it would be most helpful for people with really bad credit, especially if they really don't know where to start to try to rebuild their credit. For those of us who have already gotten the ball rolling, it's just okay.Since it's \\"just okay\\", I would have rated it 3 stars...but it comes with a CD-ROM that contains all kinds of useful forms/letters. Different types of letters to creditors, different types of letters to credit bureaus, forms for creating a budget, forms for creating a repayment plan, etc. Definitely good stuff.So while I can't disagree with some of the reviewers who've said that the book doesn't contain many \\"tips\\" or \\"tricks\\"...I think the general information, plus the forms and letters, make this worthwhile if you're looking for help with your credit."},{"Title":"Credit Repair (with CD-Rom)","review":"I'm a big fan of Nolo books but this one misses the mark. The author's primary focus is on people who have bad credit are still carrying consumer debt. Fair enough. But the solutions offered could be found on any website. There's no in depth information on how credit reporting agencies work and the general advice is along the lines of \\"pay your bills on time\\".

Is it true that you cannot remove an entry from your credit report?The book contains information you already knew, and then builds on it. It goes step-by-step to make taking action make sense. You'll never be lost or confused. It explains in detail what each part of your credit report means, how it affects you and how to make changes if necessary.

This book is excellent. It is well organized, clearly written, and full of lots of practical advice. I would direct the potential buyer to peruse the table of contents (online at Amazon) to see the breadth of its coverage. I found it to be useful as a work to understand credit in all its forms (loans, mortgages, credit cards, etc.). The book also does a good job of explaining what goes on behind the scenes when your credit situation turns south. I found Chapter 9, \\"Negotiating with Creditors and Collection Agencies\\" of particular general interest. In this chapter, I'd like to point out two examples of the kind of practical advice this book supplies.Page 163-164: \\"Pay off more recent delinquencies before older ones.\\" Why? Due to the statute of limitations, older debts may be discharged and drop off of your credit record. Making ANY payment restarts the statute of limitations clock. I did not know that.Page 191: \\"Pay by cashier's check of money order. Paying by personal check is less desirable, because the debt collector will know your account number.\\"There are reasons to do otherwise than those two examples, and this book explains the ramifications. As with a lot of NOLO's books, they offer more specific works should you have more specific problems (e.g.,How to File for Chapter 7 BankruptcyandChapter 13 Bankruptcy: Keep Your Property & Repay Debts Over Time).I don't hesitate to state this would be another MUST BUY for any public library reference collection.Note: The reviewer received a free copy of this book via the Librarything Early Reviewer program."},{"Title":"Credit Repair (with CD-Rom)","review":". . . and that is to collect in one book/CD a large amount of useful advice and usable documents into a single resource book.There is particularly new here, and certainly nothing here that is not available elsewhere -- but one would have to spend a significant amount of time doing research in order to actually assemble what is collected here.I'm not convinced as to how far using this book would actually repair one's credit, but it certainly provides an extremely useful \\"jumping-off\\" point, and I suspect that in an emergency, one could use this book to at least forestall problems long enough to get to an attorney.Useful, even very useful -- but not a \\"be all and end all\\"."},{"Title":"Credit Repair (with CD-Rom)","review":"This is the second Nolo book that I have reviewed. The Credit Repair 9th Edition is the most current for 2009. As usual in the Nolo series, the authors provide a wealth of information about the credit repair process. Everything is explained in clear, easy to understand terms and each chapter is filled with extra information. The book is divided into six major sections. 1. Assessing Your Debt Situation, gives realistic options for dealing with debts including reducing spending, saving and legal options. 2. Avoid Overspending helps you with keeping track of expenditures, budgeting and spending plans. 3. Handle Existing Debts helps to break down debts into categories, deal with creditors and collection agencies including what collection practices are legal and illegal. 4. Clean Up Your Credit Report gives information on what is in your credit report, how to get a copy, review it, dispute inaccurate information found in your report, add information to it and avoid identity theft. Did you know that health and life insurance companies request information on your medical history from the Medical Information Bureau? This is one of the many gems found in this book. 5. How Creditors and Employers Use Your Credit Report tells you who can legally look at your report and how credit apps are evaluated. 6. Building and Maintaining Good Credit gives tips for how to build credit in your name, use credit cards wisely, avoiding credit repair clinics and credit discrimination. The appendix includes contact information on Credit and Debt Counseling agencies and services, online resources and state consumer protection agencies. All of the forms found in the book are available on the included CD. Make sure that you use the Save As drop down list to save them as Word files on your PC. There are also Mac versions available. The Nolo website is also a wonderful resource for clear, helpful information. I highly recommend this book as something every consumer should have. Free updates are available at the [...] website."},{"Title":"Credit Repair (with CD-Rom)","review":"This is one of the bibles on credit repair, published by NOLO PRESS, which offers authoritative information on how to repair damaged credit. These days, companies are quick to report you as a late payer or file erroneous or outdated information that will have a significant, negative impact on your credit score. Perversely, a negative hit, created by one late payment, has more of an effect than, say, a current payment; in other words, you can do almost everything right, but one wrong mistake, one late payment, can decrease your score quickly and immediately. Your only recourse is to know exactly what to do, step by step, to (a) assess your situation, (b) determine what is correctable and what is not, and (c) correct what you can. Over time, your credit score will improve, but it will take months in most cases; there are NO quick fixes, as this book points out. (Also, as this book points out, some credit repair companies use questionable tactics that simply aren't effective.)If you have damaged credit, this authoritative book is well worth its cover price. Its basic message is that you can and should correct WHAT YOU CAN, and then let time run its course. Over time, if you are current, don't overload and max out your credit lines, and make sure any erroneous information is corrected, you'll find the advice in this book to be timely and accurate and well worth implementing."},{"Title":"Credit Repair (with CD-Rom)","review":"As some others have mentioned, most of the information in this book is available for free. However, for the price, having useful, effective information like this in an easy to use format is well worth it."},{"Title":"Credit Repair (with CD-Rom)","review":"I got this book for a friend with a couple credit issues she is wanting to clean up. This is her synopsis:This book is intended for people with basic/recent debt (such as a late utility bill, a late credit card bill, falling behind due to recent unemployment issues), and it deals with basic credit issues. It's really not useful for someone with old debts (more than a year or so), &/or multiple credit issue. This book is almost worthless for dealing with old debt.The problem is that debt is sold from one collection agency to another - and this book offers little to no advice on how to track it down, and make sure the person you are paying is *actually* the owner of the debt. (Yes, this happens a lot - you think you've paid off a card, only to find out they've sold your debt to somebody else, and you've been suckered into paying twice).It's somewhat ridiculous, but they advise that you call the collection agency. DO NOT do this. Save yourself a LOT of headaches - do everything in WRITTEN form, via certified mail. Collection agencies are liars and high pressure salesmen - they will try to coerce you to give your bank account numbers and personal information over the phone. They do not want to settle your debt over the phone - they want to gauge how much they can bleed you.My friend has tried calling these people multiple times, offering to just send them a check - that's not good enough. And then, they have your phone number on caller ID, and they WILL harass you. This is awful advise on the part of the authors - do not ever call a collection agency. Do it all by certified mail.The book offers some basic advice on dealing with collection, nothing you can't find on Google. In fact, there is much better (and much more thorough) advice on Clark Howard's web site. He is a great resource, an it's free.However, the forms are worthwhile, and my friend used several of them. They are in print and also on CD-Rom. But again, these are widely available for free online (including Clark Howard's web site).This book does explain the credit process, and the different types & calculations of credit scores. Once again, though, this is a case where the book is outdated before it gets printed. The credit score formulas are changing, and though this book will help you understand the \\"universal\\" credit score, the three primary credit reporting agencies are changing their formulas to be unique and proprietary.In conclusion, this book would be useful only to a fraction of the people who would be tempted to pick it up. I hope it works for you - it didn't work for us. 2.5 stars."},{"Title":"Credit Repair (with CD-Rom)","review":"This book got me started and slowly and surely my credit reports are getting better and better! We are on our way to buying a house and this is making it happen! It takes time but it is definately do-able!"},{"Title":"Credit Repair (with CD-Rom)","review":"A very solid and supremely practical guide. This is not one of those \\"secrets the industry doesn't want you to know\\" books, which are often the financial equavalent of the \\"natural cures\\" volumes that make bizarre and unrealistic promises to the desperate. This is the straight dope, packed with useful tips that will improve anyone's circumstances. Perhaps most useful are the many forms included that can be customized for individual use in dealing with creditors, credit reporting agencies, and the like. These forms are available on the accompanying CD for very handy, simple use.One thing that might have been nice to have is some more information on how states can differ in relevant laws, but perhaps this was considered outside the scope of the book's key focus, which tightly fixes on what the title suggests: improving credit scores among the big three reporting agencies.Their inner workings and the impact they can have on our lives--our access to credit and even to jobs--is probably too little understood (although the current credit crisis might have been a real wake-up call to many of us), and \\"Repair\\" provides succinct, actionable information on crucial topics related to credit reporting.For a rational, measured, stepwise approach to understanding and improving credit scores, I am not aware of any better resource. Some other books refer to splashy techniques with hyped-up promises, and I don't doubt that such tactics might work for some people...just as radical crash diets work for some people. The healthier, more pragmatic approach is found in books like \\"Credit Repair.\\" I would recommend this book very highly, and remain highly skeptical of any resource that promises more than does this straight-arrow take on credit score issues."},{"Title":"Credit Repair (with CD-Rom)","review":"I always read the personal finance articles about how to raise your credit score, actions that lower your credit score, and how your credit score impacts your personal finances. So, I was happy to sign up when offered the chance to review the latest edition of NOLO's Credit Repair book.Though we've all read about the free credit reports that we're entitled to request from the 3 credit bureaus.I did learn several new things about credit reports that make the book worth purchasing:* You are also entitled to a free credit report from a specialty consumer reporting agency, such as those that specialize in tenant histories, insurance claims, medical records or payments, employment histories, etc. You will likely have to contact each of these companies separately to put in your request.* You can file use Form F-32 in the book, Request for Basis of Unfavorable Credit Offer or Action and put in a request 60 days of the denial of credit/adverse action if a report from a credit agency does result in the denial of credit or an adverse reaction.* One credit card account may have spawned \\"tradelines\\" such as when you report a credit card lost or stolen and the credit card company closes the account and issues a new card. Your old credit card will likely be considered a different tradeaccount/separate account. This might mean that the age of your credit has changed, you have lost the advantage of the old account and have a new, younger credit line.* The list of ways and times that you can obtain your credit report for free that go beyond the 3 free annual credit reports.* Sources of additional information on credit scoring developments and how to understand your credit score.* Aside from the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the FTC also enforces the application of the Fair and Accurate Transactions Act of 2003.* The common errors in credit reports and how best to correct them and combat their effects.* The section on why to Avoid Credit Repair Clinics is particularly important. I have friends that were badly hit by the recession, the decline in housing prices/values in California, and the variable interest rate of their home mortgage. They received calls from credit repair companies and were considering paying a credit repair consultant thousands of dollars to help them with their situation. I wish I had known about the federal Credit Repair Organizations Act (CROA) (15 U.S.C. sec 1679-1679j) when they were going through this process in 2008.* How to supplement your credit report by adding information that shows stability. The book has a particularly helpful form for this in its Appendix B and the enclosed CD-ROM.* The book also helps you negotiate with your creditors to have negative information removed from your credit file.* The Chapter on Building Positive Credit History breaks down the different ways that a person can improve their credit score and does so in a systematic and step by step manner.The Appendixes and the CD-ROM provide resources, additional publications, form letters and worksheets, budget forms, organizational charts for payment schedules, etc. for dealing with creditors, the FTC and the credit reporting agencies.Though I haven't read the previous editions, NOLO's Credit Repair 10th Edition looks like helpful resource for those who want to improve their credit scores, to keep their credit reports accurate, and for those with a particular interest in the subject matter.ISBN-10: 1413314201 - Paperback $24.00Publisher: NOLO; 10 edition (June 6, 2011), 465 pages.Review copy courtesy of the Amazon Vine Program and the publisher."},{"Title":"Credit Repair (with CD-Rom)","review":"This is the best book on the marketing on understanding and demystifying the convoluted world of Consumer Credit scores.

The book says simply on the cover:- Establish Good Credit- Get out of Debt now- Live debt freeThis book is an updated addition and its promotion would make one think that it would provide helpful insights into how to deal with credit and debt in these troubled economic times. Today credit card companies are raising finance rates, reducing credit lines and closing out accounts on those who handle their cards perfectly. If a person owes a mortgage or student loans it is almost impossible to not get into some credit trouble.This book does not handle any severe situations. It merely provides suggestions that are so basic they could be found online in any google search for free or by using common sense. The book tells you how to not overspend by cutting coupons for groceries, getting rid of movie channels on your cable and not going on trips. We need a book to tell us this? Then we are told how to deal with current debt. All we are told is how to ask our landlords to possibly let us ride a couple of months on the rent, set up payment plans with credit card companies and negotiate with collection agencies.The book is most in depth when telling how to view your credit reports and handle having any errors removed. Other than that the best thing it does is tell people situations when to get more serious help than with this book. They give very little info about filing bankruptcy or other alternatives many people use to avoid debt. The books main selling point is that it contains sample and form letters on how to handle different creditors and credit agencies. There is also a cd-rom with these forms. Most of these forms are not legal documents but merely the authors suggestions on how to word a correspondence. They even provide a letter on how to write your landlord about reducing the rent for a couple of months. Not legally binding and certainly not needing a purchased book to know how to write.There are also lists to fill out to establish how you handle spending and you list the costs for food, rent, utilities etc. Again, so basic. What is most troubling is that this book is claiming to have the answers to get a person out of debt and its price on Amazon is $16 and it is retailed higher. And all it provides honestly is basic common sense suggestions on how to keep your budget and spending under control. It also gives suggestions on how to get out of slight debt or credit problems. But for any major credit problems this book provides nothing.In this modern age you can google credit repair, budgeting, bankruptcy, credit companies and get much more detailed thorough info than this book provides. This book is only recommended for those who don't know how to do searches for info on the internet.

It is pretty clear-cut in its instruction and never overwhelms with its language. There are letters and forms to copy, and infomation on when and how to use them.I couldn't make any determination if there is a better way than using this book to repair credit, but I know they had to stick very close to the straight and narrow way of proceeding, so you can be sure if you follow the route they suggest, you are doing it right.

They seem to mentally insert imaginary adjectives in the title, words like \\"miracle\\", \\"instant\\" and such.No miracles or instant cures here. This is a solid book that begins with the basics of repairing your credit. No secrets here either: there isn't a word in this book that can't be found in some article on the web or elsewhere. What the authors do is assemble the information in an orderly way, allegedly vet it for accuracy (they miss the mark a few times) and put it into language most people with a high school education can understand.The authors make it clear that any bad credit situation can be overcome - with effort and time. And those are the things that a lot of people don't want to invest. They want a miracle. They won't find it here.Instead, this is a solid guide to, as the authors state, learning about your credit report and assessing your financial situation; getting your income, debts and expenses into balance; paying and negotiating debts; and rebuilding and protecting your credit profile.For a lot of people, the choices presented here may be unpleasant ones that they don't want to face, such as recognizing that seeking bankruptcy may be the only rational course or that they cannot somehow force credit reporting agencies to remove accurate information about non-payment or compel collection agencies to stop trying to collect legitimate debts.But for people willing to confront reality, even if it is painful, this is a serviceable and useful book.

I am currently well on my way to fixing my messy credit because of this book.Credit Repair includes dozens of forms and letters that will help you spruce up your credit report as easily as possible!The 10th edition is completely reorganized with a focus on assessing your debt situation and then picking the best credit repair strategy for your situation. You'll also get new information on how bankruptcy and foreclosure affect your credit, how to negotiate with creditors, warnings about the latest scams, and much more.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Credit Repair (with CD-Rom)","review":"There is a lot of information on here that I was not aware of to help your credit. I have been doing bankruptcies for 8 years, this is an added bonus to me to help out people after they have filed. My credit was good after a divorce and with this book I think it will be great. You should always check your credit report every year! I found things on mine that we're duplicated and one that was not even mine and all disputed, this book will tell you how to go about disputes. You can get a free credit report from all 3 agencies every year. The book tells you why to avoid repair clinics (scam) This book also goes about ways to reduce your debt. It covers bankruptcy as well. It's a very informative book and useful! You might be surprised on what you DIDN'T know!"},{"Title":"Credit Repair (with CD-Rom)","review":"My wife and I picked this book up as a prelude to getting ready to buy a house. Our credit isn't bad, but it could certainly stand some improvement. We got plenty of advice from a mortgage broker we've spoken to recently and the advice in this book jived very well with the information presented in this book. However, I'll caution those seeking credit repair for purposes of a mortgage to be wary of SOME of the advice dispensed in the book, namely disputing anything on your credit report. Most modern mortgage companies see this as a red flag. However, there are plenty of other strategies presented in the book that are excellent."},{"Title":"Credit Repair (with CD-Rom)","review":"This is just what I was looking for. This book is not only well formatted but it is also easy to read and understand. The writer does not talk down to the reader he simple explains things in a way that makes it easier for someone who does not understand credit repair to comprehend. If you are in need of credit repair but not sure how to go about it the right way then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Credit Repair (with CD-Rom)","review":"Nolo's Credit Repair is a compendium of what you can do to take control of your credit rating, debt, and finances. It dovetails well into Dave Ramsey's planThe Total Money Makeover: A Proven Plan for Financial Fitness. Credit Repair takes on every aspect you can imagine in easy-to understand language and steps to follow. CD-ROM included contains the forms, documents and sample letters to work the steps outlined. Anyone serious about tackling a bad debt rating will benefit from the concepts in this book."},{"Title":"Credit Repair (with CD-Rom)","review":"As always with Nolo books, full of information that every person should know.For example, did you know you can close a credit card by opting for a \\"hard\\" close so that nobody can ever attempt to make a purchase or submit a bill under that number?Even better, the included DVD contains a ton of PDF based forms that anybody can use to get information or make corrections to errors in their credit reports. I would recommend that these forms be reviewed carefully and used accordingly. Don't have a computer handy? No problem, the forms are printed in the book, too.Highly recommended read, especially in these electronic times when information that's flying back and forth over the internet may not necessarily be correct."},{"Title":"Credit Repair (with CD-Rom)","review":"There are many reasons for considering this book, but the primary one is that virtually every step you can take to repair your damaged credit is riddled with pitfalls, pros, and cons. Some of the scams are obvious. The ones you've really got to avoid position themselves as \\"helping\\" you...we've all seen the commercials with the sad mom and dad and depressed kids (because they have bad credit), who become the smiling mom and dad with ecstatic kids, because a kind and wise \\"credit counselor\\" has helped them restore their credit.Time for a reality check.Legitimate debt is legitimate debt. You've missed a payment, you've allowed a loan or credit cards to go into default. You may have a story that, in your mind, is reasonable. You lost your job. You or a family member had a catastrophic injury or illness. Your house got wiped out by a tornado.Unfortunately, in the credit world, justice tends to be black and white. You owe money, you haven't paid it back, guilty. Bailiff, send in the next defendant.Much of the information in this book can be found on the Web, but the problem is that not all of the sources are reputable, and most people wouldn't know how to compile a \\"Credit Repair Bible,\\" for lack of a better term, by assembling a collection of Web articles.Nolo is a trustworthy source, and you've got the whole picture here, from soup to nuts. Maybe all of the information won't apply directly to you (an example being guidance for homeowners...if you don't own a home, there's nothing you can do with the information). But the book covers the entire spectrum, from helping you to understand your credit report, the people to whom you owe a debt, the agencies and individuals they hire to enforce your payment of that debt, and how to protect yourself on every step of the journey to restoring your credit.\\"The lady and the tiger\\"...if you have damaged credit, you have the choice between two doors. Walk through one and you'll most likely be eaten alive. Walk through the other and you're standing in fresh air and sunshine. If you read this book you'll know what's on the other side of either door before your hand reaches for the door knob.It is worth noting the credentials of the authors before going any further. Robin Leonard, J.D. is a Cornell Law School graduate and has written similar books for Nolo on the subjects of debt, credit and bankruptcy. Margaret Reiter was a consumer investigator with the Los Angeles County Consumer Affairs Department, and worked for 20 years as a consumer prosecutor with the California Attorney General's Consumer Law Section, specializing in battling business fraud and drafting consumer protection legislation. You are in good hands with the material presented in this book.The chapters:* Credit Reports and Credit Scores: The Nuts and Bolts* The First Step - Cleaning Up Your Credit Report* Assess Your Financial Situation* Reducing Current Debts And Expenses* Reducing Your Mortgage Debt* Reducing Debt Through Bankruptcy* Finding Money To Pay Your Debts* Negotiating With Collectors And Credit Agencies* Getting Help To Negotiate And Manage Debts* Building Positive Credit History* Choosing And Using Credit And Debit Cards* Avoiding And Dealing With Identity TheftIn addition, there is a Resource section, and all of the forms discussed in the book are included on CD-ROM.In some areas, you are given relatively \\"complete\\" information. In others, you are given an overview, and are directed to resources you can use to educate yourself. As an example, each state has its own set of laws regarding debt collection agencies. You can't protect yourself if you don't understand your rights, and this isn't a five-minute process. You need to take the time to clearly understand what debt collectors can and cannot do. If you let them take illegal action against you because you thought it was legal, it's much harder to \\"fix\\" that action than to prevent it from happening in the first place.Also, pay particular attention to the sections on negotiation. The credit world doesn't offer \\"yard sale / flea market\\" tactics for those in debt to go \\"bargain hunting\\"...debt is debt. But by the same token, Collection agencies, by virtue of the information you provided when signing up for credit cards and other forms of credit, can pretty much know as much about you as you know about yourself. If the rug's been pulled out from under your world and you simply do not have the cash to pay back your debt in a timely manner, they'll take whatever cash you do have. It's the difference between their losing everything you owe them or working with you so that you will commit to some form of ongoing payment. Naturally, they'd rather have it all, and have it now. If that's not possible, it is in their best interests to work with you...but it should not be seen as an invitation for you to avoid your responsibility.In terms of your credit report, you have multiple opportunities to amend the data on file and document any \\"extenuating circumstances\\" or errors in what has been reported. It would be a tragic mistake for you to believe that every agency or individual who posts negative data to your credit report has accuracy, or your best interests, as their first priority. This is why you are encouraged to view your credit report and ensure that each entry is accurate. If you find something incorrect, the book will explain how you can fix it.Regarding bankruptcy, virtually 100% of the legitimate, qualified attorneys and credit counselors will tell you that it should only be explored as a \\"last resort\\" option. But for some, that's exactly what it is...their most reasonable option in light of their circumstances. In most situations, the success of your credit repair is going to be dependent upon your demonstrating, over time, the fact that you took ownership for your situation, you worked with the people to whom you owed money, you began and maintained regular payments to repay the debt, and you incurred no other negative hits to your credit report.You have to look at YOUR individual situation, what you owe, your credit rating prior to falling into debt, a reasonable plan for you to begin your journey back to good credit. You have to choose your \\"traveling companions\\"...the people who will advise you and formulate a plan for your credit repair...wisely.This book can help with that. It is helpful for showing you what do, and for what not to do. Heading down a bad road in good faith still means you're on a bad road. Don't do it. Get this book, educate yourself, and realize that you can turn things around. It won't happen overnight...\\"quick fixes\\" will get you in water that's hotter than the water you're in right now...but the chances are excellent that you didn't get into debt overnight, either. Steady, confident steps in the direction of a goal are what this book is all about. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Credit Repair (with CD-Rom)","review":"This book is informative and should provide at least the \\"basics\\" of dealing with credit report problems. I felt more comfortable getting information out of this book than from doing Internet searches."},{"Title":"Credit Repair (with CD-Rom)","review":"I see this book being useful to two groups of people with credit problems. Those who have some form of mistake in their credit report or those who have had past financial problems and are now willing and able to negotiate with creditors for payment terms or to have bad marks removed from credit agencies.For better or worse, the law has been tough on other types of bad debt situations lately; especially rough depending on the type of debt. If you simply don't have the money, have no valuable resources, or better-off relations, you may need more than a book for meaningful help.Advise for difficult problems such as old student loans is present, but a little light. I could find no coverage of private, non-federally backed student loans.The book will educate you on some current legal matters, the basics of dealing with credit reporting agencies, and give you some resource management tips. There are some sample forms for negotiation letters, budgeting, and dealing with credit agencies on a cd-- which might be useful to some people.If the material fits your problems and the solutions are within your means, you might even consider it excellent."},{"Title":"Credit Repair (with CD-Rom)","review":"I bought this book a few years ago out of desperation, due to a divorce and an ex-husband destroying my perfect credit. This book enabled me to repair my credit and take the proper steps in a very difficult situtation. Things I never knew I was able to learn how to do. I am buying the updated version of this book and I lend it out all the time. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Credit Repair (with CD-Rom)","review":"This book covers a lot of areas of credit repair.It is updated for the modern foreclosure crisis, and the new credit card act.The main topics involve how to deal with the credit reporting agency's, and how to update and correct incorrect information.It details who and why parties might want to access your credit report.It also includes some great suggestions on how to keep your credit clean, along with suggestions of sources to tap to pay your bills.Finally the book comes with a CD-ROM that contains most of the forms that you will need as templates for sending form letters to various reporting or collection agency's.Overall, I would recommend the book to anyone looking to repair their credit, but especially to young people who might need a solid basis for understanding how this can affect their entire lives."},{"Title":"Wood Turning (Art of Woodworking)","review":"This book is a how to guide that explains the fundamentals of wood turning. From the decision to start, through setting up, safety, selecting tools, wood, and basic wood turning techniques. The authors have gone to great lengths to give the beginner, like me, sufficient information to get started. Even the spiral binding is a thoughtful touch that allows the pages to stay open, a real handy feature when you are trying to grind a bevel of turn your first square stick into a reasonably round piece of wood.Illustrations and pictures adorn every page giving visual meaning to the text. Maybe that is not the proper order, maybe I should say that the pictures and illustrations explain the text to the point that I was comfortable with my understanding of what the author was trying to explain and not afraid to try the operation or technique. Grinding a new profile on a brand-new Sorby tools could be an expensive mistake, but I did it and it works just fine.The book is an excellent tool. It explains fundamentals. It does go into several simple projects, but the real value is in the basic fundamental information that a beginner needs to get started spinning wood and having fun. I also found that unlike other books on this subject, the authors did not seem to convey their personal prejudices for various pieces of equipment. This was refreshing, of course, it also doesn't give me any one to blame if I buy the wrong thing.This is a Time life book, with a 1995 publishing date and I know that there have been advances in tools and equipment, however, woodturning started many years ago probably with a stick and a string and a sharp rock. So take the information put forth and seek other sources to determine what is the latest and greatest.In the past month I have visited our local library multiple times, reviewing various books on wood turning and this is one that I will buy. Where others good? Yes, and I have already purchased one, but that was before I found this book, which will complete the information in the book that I have already purchased."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's Ultimate Cake Mix Cookbook","review":"The book, for what it was, is okay. I was looking for ways to make mixes 'kicked up'. I know there is a lady who has exactly that, but I thought I would try from the maker of the mixes. Service from Amazon was great as usual."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's Ultimate Cake Mix Cookbook","review":"I rated Betty Crocker Cake Mix Cookbook with five stars.

I honestly didn't know you could do this much with one! I can't wait to begin trying them out. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's Ultimate Cake Mix Cookbook","review":"There are so many great ideas in this book I can't wait to try! I just got this book and already made the Rocky Road brownies since their so easy. Everyone loved them (and no one could tell it was from a mix either). I brought them to a dinner and there are lots of other ideas for Bake-and-Take cakes that will be perfect to bring to the office or to other friends. What I really like about this book is all the photos as well as the easy instructions."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's Ultimate Cake Mix Cookbook","review":"I love my cookbook. It was in excellent condition and I received it in a very fast time after ordering. Thank you."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's Ultimate Cake Mix Cookbook","review":"This cookbook comes in a handy spiral-bound edition, so there is no propping pages open with bags of flour or pounds of butter (as I have been caught doing in the past). The book is also completely printed in full-color, so the pictures are bright and glossy. About 80% of the recipes include a picture of the finished product.There is an intriguing introduction where the authors take you on a journey through the mystical world of cake mixes. They begin in 1943 in the Betty Crocker labs and kitchens, and move from there through the trends of the 1960's and into the future of cake mixes in the 21st century. The pictures and magazine ads they reproduce in this book are historical and fun. Before the recipes begin, there is a how-to section on preparing your pans, servings per cake, how to cool and split (torte) a cake, frosting and glazing cakes, and even high-altitude baking. Page 15 features a \\"Customer Q&A;\\" about the SuperMoist cake mixes.The recipes are divided into chapters: Bake-and-Take, Wonderfully Indulgent, Special Celebrations, Heavenly Holidays, Come for Brunch, Scrumptious Desserts, Easy Cookies and Bars, and Fabulous frostings and Glazes. The cookbook also adds sections on Helpful Nutrition and Cooking Information, and an alphabetical Index.The Heavenly Holidays sections features cakes for beginning cake decorators. These cakes require no previous cake decorating experience, and look beautiful. There are chocolate heart cakes for Valentine's Day (no heart pan needed!), an adorable Easter Bunny, a Flag Day cake made with fresh fruit, a Jack O' Lantern cake (no 3-D cake pan needed), and even Rudolph Cupcakes which can be made with children.My favorite recipe from this cookbook is on page 18, Chocolate Turtle Cake. If you like the combination of nuts with chocolate, this recipe is for you! The recipe has a full-color picture, a tip for serving, and nutritional information. All of the recipes in this cookbook feature nutritional information. The turtle cake recipe calls for a devil's food cake mix, water, oil, eggs, caramels, evaporated milk, pecans, and chocolate chips. The recipe requires a bit of planning as caramels are not a staple item that I keep on hand. The final product, however, is well worth the planning. The cake is moist, gooey, and a favorite for entertaining, especially when served warm.The Chocolate Graham Streusel Cake on page 20 is a classic recipe from the 1970's. The recipe features an advertisement that was used in the 1970's, a tip for glazing the cake, nutritional information, and a yellow graham variation. The recipe calls for graham cracker crumbs, nuts, brown sugar, cinnamon, butter, devil's food cake mix, water, oil, eggs, and a recipe of glaze (provided on page 242). This recipe was a heavier, denser cake than normal, and as such, it was a little dry. It's a good recipe for a morning brunch or family coffee-style cake.Even without a picture for every single recipe, this cookbook is an excellent value. The recipes are tried-and-true winners, and are family-friendly. The nutritional information for each recipe and the dietary guidelines in the back are an added bonus, it is a feature that most cake mix cookbooks prefer to gloss over. The full-color printing, alphabetical index, and spiral binding make this cookbook easy to use. A winner!"},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's Ultimate Cake Mix Cookbook","review":"I love baking cakes &amp; making sweets. But being a mother of two little ones I don't have enough time (or energy) to make cakes from scratch. This book is a treat for me, because I don't need a lot of planning ahead nor to spend too much time in the kitchen!!A few days ago I made the Peanut Butter Cake &amp; it looked impressive and was delicious!! I felt like a million dollars presenting it.The book is full of appetizing pictures for nearly all the recipes, easy to use &amp; follow directions, and has lots of tips &amp; ideas. It also tells you how many calories are in a slice (for all you gals who want to know, although my advise is to skip that particular line).In the book you will find all kinds of recipes for cakes, trifles, cupcakes, cookies &amp; more.Indulge yourself &amp; your family."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's Ultimate Cake Mix Cookbook","review":"Every recipe in this outstanding cookbook is easy to make and delicious to eat!

I can whip up delightful lemon curds, Sky High Meringue Pies, and shortbread that floats off the plate. BUT....I had NEVER baked a cake, never wanted to BAKE a cake, and didn't even LIKE cake...thanks to the miserable examples that I grew up trying to swallow in the 1960's! Dry, chemical tasting; they were featureless and a sure sign, in my myoptic view, of \\"Lazy Cooks\\", especially where Box Cake Mixes were concerned.Enter 2005: I am asked to cater a British Tea Party...and one of the projects was to bake and decorate a CAKE! I expected to 'job it out' (having a bakery make it) but decided to tackle the Beast Formerly Known as Cake, instead.I signed up for Wilton Cake Decorating Class. The instructor, who runs a famous bakery in Michigan, SWORE by cake mixes and insisted that they \\"had improved since my childhood\\". With her 30+ years of experience, she recommended ONLY Betty Crocker Cake Mixes and also recommended THIS BOOK, as a way to personalize the taste of cakes.Well, in for a penny, in for a pound of butter, I say. I started the classes, I ordered the Betty Crocker Ultimate Cake Mix Cookbook, and four weeks later, I've baked over 12 examples from the book, pulled off the British Tea to accolades, AND...learned that CAKE.IS.GOOD!This book is incredible! It has a history of HOW cake mixes have changed throughout the years; it explains what the ingredients \\"do\\" in a recipe, and it offers ways to make crisps, cookies, bars and other goodies with a mix.Out of my 500+ cookbooks, THIS cookbook has been the MOST used one in the past month! And I've brought it to class, where the other 5 students also ordered it!!!When professional bakers, who are making their mortgage payments and sending their kids through school via cakes, tell me that they use mixes 80% of the time, it's time to listen! You'll LOVE this book!!!"},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's Ultimate Cake Mix Cookbook","review":"I am not a baker nor a cook for that matter and was quite nervous when my sister asked me if i could host my nephew's playgroup last saturday at my house.

The wheel spread is a fair indicator of general trends in one's life, Sophia's method for getting answers to yes/no questions is not effective at all.

I've had friends since tell me that the readings they had also had come true.I've had great success with the two spreads I mentioned. I'm not much of a fan of the Wheel of Life Spread and the one at the end is pretty long and intense, so I stick with the Star Spreads.

Sophia's method is more complete and a bit easier to understand than, say, tarot cards and is much easier for novices to get a grip on the skill of card reading. She explains how to determine \\"your suit\\" by the shape of the face, differing from the tarot method, and also by personality type which just makes sense to me, not all dark skinned people are jealous and devious nor are all blue eyed blondes sweet and loving. She offers various spreads varying in complexity from very simple readings using only a very few cards to more elaborate readings, like the star, the astrological wheel, (my favorite, both for reading and spell casting) and a massive full life spread utilizing every card in the deck. It's a challenge at first to memorize all the meanings of the cards in various spread positions, but with practice, you'll become proficient.What's great about this book is that the authoress teaches you not only how to forecast the future but also how to change it.I've had this book since 1998 and just love what I've learned from it. I don't know why I haven't reviewed it before this except that someone asked me the other day about my method of reading cards and how I learned to do it and that stirred my memory.I highly recommend this book.

All the more amazing is that this barren place was the center of the Anasazi civilization. The Great House of Pueblo Bonito is the largest pre-historic building north of Mexico, counting 800 rooms and constructed about 1,000 years ago.Chaco is mysterious and this book of seventeen essays by authorities in several fields explores those mysteries. One is given the point of view of the scholars as well as representatives of the Pueblo, Hopi, and the Navajo Indians. Good charts, maps, and photos, some in color, support the text. Perhaps the most interesting of all the mysteries is how the Anasazi fed themselves in this unpromising environment and a brief sidebar talks about Chaco agriculture -- although not enough.The most interesting essay in the book is titled \\"The Chaco Navajos\\" and is about the coming of the Navajos, the Spaniards, and the Anglos to Chaco Canyon long after the Anasazi had disappeared. Included is a brief account of pioneer archaeologist, Richard Wetherill, killed in a gunfight with a Navajo in 1910. \\"Richard Wetherill Anasazi\\" by Frank McNitt is a fine biography of Wetherill, a character worthy of legend.\\"In Search of Chaco\\" is an attractive, up-to-date look at current theories and thinking about Chaco. One suspects there's a lot more to learn. One quibble: I despise the politically correct term \\"Ancestral Pueblo\\" used by the scholars for the people who built Chaco. The old and romantic name, \\"Anasazi,\\" is far preferable.Smallchief"},{"Title":"In Search of Chaco: New Approaches to an Archaeological Enigma (Popular Archaeology)","review":"This book was recommended for my new job as a volunteer at Chaco. It is an excellent read, interesting, beautifully illustrated, without being too technical."},{"Title":"In Search of Chaco: New Approaches to an Archaeological Enigma (Popular Archaeology)","review":"This book is a collection of essays written by various archaeologists who have worked on the ruins of Chaco Culture Historical Site as this place is now known. The book bring all kind of different perceptions and historical takes on this isolated area of New Mexico that once housed a great civilization. I brought this book at Chaco and it came recommended by the park ranger there.Only problems I see with this book is that despite of the differences in perceptions and opinions, most of these archaeologists don't go beyond the conventional box that fenced them in. Until the last essay, I didn't read much about how warfare, tribal rivalry and violence played the role in ending this civilization. The writers in most parts, blindly accept that Navajo and Hopi Indians are ancestral heirs to the Chacoans. Isn't it possible that the Navajo and Hopi Indians could have been their conquerors instead? Absent of evidence of warfare doesn't mean, there wasn't any. I mentioned this several times during my southwest vacation and got a lot \\"deer in the headlight\\" looks from these park rangers. There is almost no mention of hunting ability of the Chaco civilization nor their governmental form. In-order to build these Great Houses, centralized control was needed to gathered the resources. Many of the essays also states that many rooms are too small to housed people and thus, they must be storage rooms. Is that a conjecture? I been to these rooms and I have seen smaller rooms where family of four slept and lived. Poor and serfs don't have much of a choice.But overall, the book proves to be very informative and very educational. Its a great introductory book on Chaco and I thought it was too bad that I read the book after my visit to Chaco. I would have gain a better insight to Chaco ruins if I read the book prior to my visit. But yet, the book also showed that how no matter how well educated and how much researched been done, people who wrote this book appears to have a hard time thinking outside the box and in some ways, their view of Chacoan people appears to be bit patronizing. As I told one park ranger in my travels, \\"In all the lands, trade routes are also invasion routes, why not here??\\" Response: Bambi look!! Still, a good reading material for anyone interested in this subject matter."},{"Title":"In Search of Chaco: New Approaches to an Archaeological Enigma (Popular Archaeology)","review":"Situated at least 20 miles from the nearest paved road, Chaco Canyon lies in a desolate plain equaldistant between Farmington and Grants, New Mexico. It is with sadness that I was unable to explore this wonderful place due to heavy monsoon rains that pelted the area during my vacation there in July of 2010. However, this volume edited by David Noble makes up for this shortfall to a small extent by incorporating narratives from archaeologists, national park offcials and various members of Native American tribes whose ancestors once inhabited this area centuries ago.For a 130-page book, it is loaded with numerous illustrations and pictures of the great houses that dot Chaco Canyon including Pueblo Bonito and has information on other related places such as Aztec Ruins, Mesa Verde and Hovenweep in eastern Utah. It contains 17 chapters from people offering their perspectives of what went before. Questions that were attempted to be answered include how the pueblo peoples came to settle there in the first place; how they built the great houses; how did they lived and why they left. Without a written language it is hard to say how these events took place with great precision. In my opinion, I would probably trust the oral tradition handed down among the Native Americans.If anyone is visiting Chaco Culture Historical Park in the future, I would recommend reading this book to get a adequate background on the place. If you visit, make sure you have good struts on you automobile and hope it doesn't rain."},{"Title":"In Search of Chaco: New Approaches to an Archaeological Enigma (Popular Archaeology)","review":"This book has been put together and edited by one person.

I've got the one by Jimmy Gutterman, &quot;Sinead: Her Life and Music&quot;. I can assure you &quot;Sinead O'Connor: So Different&quot; by Dermott Hayes is by far the better book! Dermott Hayes relies on published articles and interviews (as does Gutterman), but Hayes also does his homework, interviewing plenty of people (family, friends, neighbors, ex-band mates) who knew Sinead before she became famous. This is what makes it so interesting and superior. Also, there are many rare photos in the book. Photos of Sinead's childhood home, her birth certificate, her student ID card, her father, brother, and Sinead at age 8. The book gets into Sinead's troubled childhood, her mother's abuse, Sinead's schooling and stay at the home for wayward girls, her first band, first record contract, first taste of fame. People who knew Sinead are quoted throughout. There's a lengthy discography. Keep in mind this book was published in 1990, so it only goes up to her &quot;I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got&quot; release. I don't believe anyone has bothered to write a book on Sinead O'Connor since the early '90's, so this is what her true fans should look for. If you bother to search for any out-of-print Sinead O'Connor book, this is your best bet. It's worth it for all the information and rare photos."},{"Title":"The Fairy Tarots","review":"This deck is certainly a gorgeous deck, mainly the mayor arcana and court cards which were made by the same artist. The rest of the minor arcana cards are scenes made by another artist. I bit hard to read with since the traditional symbology doesn't fully apply. The suits are: hearts (cups), bells (pentacles), leaves (swords) and acorns (wands). The Strength and Justice cards are used in the traditional position, unlike the newer tarot generations after Rider-Waite. The art is very cute, and not to suit the &quot;serious&quot; reader's taste I don't think.

Using the art history \\"hook\\" into the question of women and their roles--as they see their roles, as men see women's roles, and as women search for happiness within these roles--Wendy Wasserstein has written a thoughtful and very funny drama about the Baby Boom generation and the price its women have paid as they have searched for fulfillment.Exploring Heidi Holland's life from the late 1960s to the 1990s, Wasserstein takes us from Heidi's high school and college days, as she grows in her thinking and view of her role in life, to her experiences with women's lib focus groups, the Eugene McCarthy campaign, the rise of AIDS, the gay movement, and ultimately Heidi's realization of what is important to her, not just professionally and philosophically, but personally and emotionally.Wasserstein uses wit and a keen ear for dialogue to create quick, often humorous interchanges which advance the action and the feminist message without polemics. Heidi is, on the surface, a success by all external measurements, but she feels that she is missing something from her life. Professional success is not enough for her, a revelation that made this play somewhat controversial within the women's movement when it was first produced in 1988. Some feminists apparently believed Heidi's desire for emotional fulfillment through love to be a sellout to a male dominated culture.Wasserstein emphasizes that women should be able to pursue both professional success and a personal life, however, and the rounded character of Heidi remains a nice contrast to the more strident and sometimes hostile female characters with whom she interacts on stage. Throughout the action, the play's high humor and absurdity are nicely balanced with scenes of sentiment and sorrowful revelation, and Wasserstein maintains her light touch without trivializing the issues. Winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1989, the play offers insights into significant social issues, gracefully presented so that they do not alienate the audience. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"The Heidi chronicles","review":"The late Wendy Wasserstein wrote this amusing play. Reading it one is reminded of Eugene McCarthy's campaign for President and women's groups consciousness-raising sessions. The play consists of a number of scenes, vignettes, taking place at one or two year intervals, as the same baby-boomer characters meet life challenges. The humor is wonderful and the subject matter is memory-charged.Heidi Holland, an easterner from Chicago, (get the joke?), is attending graduate school at Yale. She has the sometimes interest of a man she met in the McCarthy campaign. The other women in the group feel she is insufficiently liberated, but that she has the potential to be, in the jargon of our time, politically correct. In another instance Heidi and Peter Patrone, her fiancee, a pediatrician, are attending the marriage of Scoop, a former beau of Heidi, and Lisa Friedlander, an illustrator. Scoop tells Heidi that Lisa is not an A plus like Heidi but that Lisa is the best he can do. Heidi's gift, a crock pot, is not to Scoop's liking.In Act II Heidi is lecturing on Lilla Cabot Perry, an American Impressionist painter. Lisa, very pregnant, is having a baby shower. Heidi arrives late. She has been living in England. The friends speak of a family whose child did not get into the kindergarten at the Ethical Culture Society and so the whole family is in therapy. In 1982 Heidi and friends appear on TV. The topics presented include women in the arts and the Sixties. Scoop Rosenbaum is editor of the BOOMER magazine. (The name Scoop, of course, has to do with the fact that he claims he is a journalist.) Scoop remarks portentiously that hearing his own children pulls him out of any \\"me generation\\" residue. Susan and Heidi meet for lunch. It seems that Peter and Scoop monopolized the TV program and we learn that Peter and Heidi didn't marry. In the lunch scene Susan speaks of a boy friend and Heidi does too. Heidi is doing a small show of Lilla Cabot Perry's work. Susan tells her that in L.A. everyone creates his own story, (title, THE HEIDI CHRONICLES).Two years later Heidi is speaking to the Miss Crain's Association as an alumna. Heidi tells of her trip to the gym and how she is embarassed in front of and envious of every woman present. She allows that she hasn't been happy for some time. The following year Heidi accepts a position to teach at Carleton College. Before setting out to the Midwest Heidi sees Peter at his hospital. It seems that the AIDS crisis, having great impact among his friends and acquaintances, has made it seem to him that sadness is a luxury.My review may have made this play seem hopelessly self-referential, but it is not. Wasserstein was too accomplished a playwright to fall into such a trap."},{"Title":"The Heidi chronicles","review":"This play is very good that is why it won the Pulitzer Prize.

He isn't handy with a gun and totally inept at fighting. When forced to do so in this book, he gets his clock cleaned. However, he is very smart and even though he gets placed in some tight spots, he always manages to avoid getting in too deep and solve the crime.The story begins with Bertha being released from a sanitarium where she has lost a great deal of weight and some of her obsession over food. She has even lost a bit of her cynicism, succumbing to the flattery of a client who comments favorably on her looks and personality. The client is wealthy, although a bit duplicitous, in that he hires the Cool and Lam agency to find out what happened to his son's fianc&eacute;, (Corla Burke), although he doesn't really want her found.With few clues to go on, Lam manages to find her, but he runs into a casino scam run by an ex-boxer and his female accomplice, gets beat up a couple of times and is dragged off a train under suspicion of the murder of the ex-boxer. He manages to extricate himself and joins up with a punch-drunk ex-boxer and the woman running the casino scam (Helen Framley). They camp in the desert and rent a house where the boxer is teaching Donald how to box. This section is very well done. Throughout their association, you never know whether Donald is simply continuing to look for Corla, jointly falling for Helen Framley or simply taking some time off. In the end, the best bet is that he is doing all three. However, while there is clearly a lot off affection between them, it is not to be and Helen and the ex-boxer join forces to continue the casino scams.Donald unmasks the murderer and learns the reasons behind the strange circumstances. When the client tries to flatter Bertha into lowering the fee, she breaks out of her softie stage and goes back to being greedy and hungry. At the end, Donald is nearby when Helen and her new companion rig a slot machine, but he makes no attempt to make contact.This is one of the best Donald Lam/ Bertha Cool mysteries, in that Donald is a much more complicated character than he is in the others. He proves to be a softie, falling for a woman that he knows is dangerous and wrong for him. Yet, in the end, he also turns out to be a cynical detective, willing to trust others, but only to a point. Which is why Bertha Cool is the perfect boss for him to have."},{"Title":"Spill the Jackpot (\\"Mapback\\")","review":"Spill the JackpotDonald Lam visited the sanitarium where Bertha Cool had been recovering from flu and pneumonia.

These articles are all of solid scholarly caliber, though they vary somewhat in approachability, attitude, basic presuppositions, and overall quality--if you think of this book as something more like an academic journal than an anthology, the uneven nature of the articles shouldn't distract you too much. Now the geographic coverage is tilted towards East Asia just a bit; this is my primary interest so I'm okay with such a tilt, but anyone more interested in Southeast Asia might feel a tad short-changed...and not having an article on Buddhism in Vietnam is a real lacunae to be regretted. And of course, as with many such collections, a few of the articles seem like they were only superficially modified so as to adapt them to the theme of the book. Somehow this always strikes me as a bit strained and slapdash, but editors have to fill out a book somehow. So it goes in this imperfect world. Still, anyone interested in religion's modern vicissitudes in general or in the Buddhist religion more specifically should find this book intriguing, useful, and quite thought-provoking.So what articles are included in this book, anyway?1. \\"Aniconism Versus Iconism in Thai Buddhism\\" by Donald K.

The Swann family saga will hold you enthralled until the end."},{"Title":"God is an Englishman","review":"God is an Englishman is Victorian historical fiction at its best - I recommend it to anyone who has an interest in the world changing developments in commerce and industry in England in the mid/late 19th Century. I have always been fascinated by tales of the Industrial Revolution when English entrepreneurs, inventors and innovators changed life from an a rural/agricultural system to a modern industrial society in a matter of generations.After a military career, Adam Swann returns to England in 1858 with an intense ambition to build his fortune in the fast changing and extremely competitive world of Victorian commerce. Swann soon meets his soul-mate, Henrietta, the high-spirited daughter of a local mill owner and they set out to build a family business under the Swann name. Along the way they share challenges, setbacks and eventually an immense fortune.As now, the secret of Swann's success is building an efficient and competitive business that is ahead of its time and is essential to the success of others. Swann sees that while railways are a fundamental part of the game-changing industrial revolution, they cannot always provide door to door delivery. He sets up an extensive and complex country-wide network of horse drawn transportation to take materials and goods between the railhead and factories up and down the country, sometimes on appalling roads and gradients.Henrietta, as well as being a wife and mother to an ever increasing brood of small Swanns, is the financial wizard who helps Adam to succeed. While the business is essentially a family one, much of its success is due to finding the right staff in the right place and giving them every incentive to perform and develop the business.This is a fascinating and outstanding novel about exciting times in economic and social development throughout Victorian England. The next novels in the series - -Theirs Was the Kingdom (Swann Family Saga)andGive Us This Day (God Is an Englishman)- - bring the younger Swanns into the business and they face the next challenges as the face of road freight transport changes from horse drawn to motorised delivery.The Swann family saga is only one of several important English family sagas written by Delderfield, including The Horseman Riding By and To Serve Them All Our Days, both of which became popular BBC mini-series.This is a beloved novel by one of my favourite authors. I first read this book (the first in the Swann family saga trilogy) in the UK the early 1970's when it was first published.

The story of how Adam Swan builds that business is fascinating and presented in elaborate detail. At the same time, the book deals with romantic topics but in a way that seems very old fashioned and censored. Lots of odd, symbolic language that somewhat detracts from the overall commercial theme of the book. Those parts make the book a little embarrassing for an old fashioned male reader to be caught with; somewhat like reading part of a Har___ novel from a bygone era. At times the book's treatment of women is patronizing although arguably it does show women in unusual, for the 1860s, management positions. For me, I wish the author had stuck to the story of the development of the enterprise and left the romantic parts to other authors.

He's seen a lot during those years, including a horrific massacre of civilians. When chance places a fortune in rubies in his hands, he's more than ready to make drastic changes. Back to England he goes, the England of a world just prior to the American Civil War, looking for a better way to spend his life. He finds it in two places. First, in a revolutionary business idea sparked by an encounter with a railway official; and second, in a runaway young woman. He marries the woman, factory heiress Henrietta Rawlinson (who's swiftly disinherited by her infuriated father), and he turns the idea into a hauling firm that deliberately fits itself into all the gaps the railway system cannot fill.That's the bare outline. What makes this novel remarkable, though, isn't its plot. It's the characters, and the way author Delderfield lets them grow naturally out of the time and place in which he sets them. Adam Swann is in many ways a man ahead of that time, disgusted by what he's seen in war and determined to make his way in the world without committing outrages against basic human decency. In fact, he's determined to make a difference for the better while succeeding as a businessman. Henrietta, blessed with her enterpreneur father's sharp mind and quick wits for commerce, grows from a willful, uneducated and thoroughly spoiled girl into a worthy and even challenging partner for Adam in the course of the book's 800-some pages. Nothing seems forced, and none of the details of Victorian England ring false, in all of those pages. Some of the best reading comes from secondary characters who weave in and out of the main story, because each is well drawn and interesting - no matter how brief the appearance.A tour-de-force, all in all. One of the best \\"family sagas\\" around, still, nearly 40 years after its publication."},{"Title":"God is an Englishman","review":"I can think of few better authors to take along on a long plane ride than Delderfield. God Is an Englishman is the first of a trilogy that runs a little out of gas by the end of the third book, but not in the first. To Serve Them All My Days got me hooked on Delderfield, and this series continued it. I can also recommend his book Diana. Alot of his works are out of print, although you can find them at liabraries, or Amazon's auction site -- or bookfinder.com"},{"Title":"God is an Englishman","review":"God Is an Englishman is the first book in this wonderful saga about the Swann family. Adam Swann, a 31-year-old cavalryman in the service of Queen Victoria's army, decides to break off with his family's military tradition and gives up his soldierly life in lieu of starting anew in England as a businessman. The road ahead of him will not be easy, as old sentiments still prevail where people making a living in a new, industrial England are looked down on and someone like Adam, giving up his army career is thought foolish. Adam Swann persists in his desire to be his own boss and not spent his life serving somebody else, even if it's the Crown of England. In his struggles to become a respectable and successful owner of a horse-carriage business, he has a few supporters, including his young wife, Henrietta and, surprisingly, his own father. The readers follow Adam and his personal and business lives for nine years. These are very tumultuous years for England as well. It is the 19th century, the country changes from an agricultural one into an industrial empire, with railroads ruling the transportation, mills, mines and factories replacing the farms and Adam Swann takes on a daring project of using horses as his road to success.I thoroughly enjoyed God Is an Englishman, so much so that even before I finished it, I went and got part two (Theirs Was the Kingdom). It's not an easy read by any means, but very captivating and really a requirement for anyone who wants to read more about one of the most important periods in England's history. Some might say that it's reminiscent of Dickens's books but I should say that probably only in the time set. Through Delderfield's book I got a hopeful outlook, not a grim one. True, it's still England where poverty is on the rise, where child exploitation flourishes but it's also England where one doesn't have to belong to royalty in order to become well-off, successful and if they're persistent enough, respected. \`Common' people now have a chance to have careers and to be truly in charge of their lives. I must say that I liked this approach and I just was riveted by Adam Swann and by the whole process of him starting from a scratch and, despite unexpected failures and \`bumps \`, holding on to what he believed and never losing sight of what Adam deemed as success.That's one great part of God Is an Englishman. Another one is the multitude of characters, bad, good and just average, but they all change, they all grow and, as a reader, you really have your pick in which ones are going to be your favorites. Mine was Henrietta, Adam's wife. I think she grew the most throughout the novel. She changed so much but still somehow retained her youthful innocence despite some occurrences that would turn many into bitter, prematurely old women. Henrietta and Adam's marriage is not an easy one, some would even say it's doomed from the beginning, but yet again, Delderfield just serves us this happy story, with both parties fulfilling their dreams, among the turmoil of their times. Don't get me wrong, it isn't a \`happily-ever-after Cinderella' story but an uplifting one nonetheless, despite the many problems that could endanger both Adam's and Henrietta's happiness.I say that if you're a \`saga junkie', if you are even remotely interested in the history of England and want to meet people, who in the end you feel are your friends or at least next door neighbors, God Is an Englishman and you will be a perfect match."},{"Title":"God is an Englishman","review":"MY WIFE KEPT TELLING ME WHAT A GOOD &quot;READ&quot; THIS BOOK IS.I FINALLY FOUND ALL 3 SWANN SAGA BOOKS AT A USED SALE &amp; I HAVENT LOOKED BACK.THIS AUTHOR HAS THE KNACK TO RELATE TO THE READER EVERY BIT OF WHAT ADAM 'N HETTY WERE EXPERIENCING IN VICTORIAN ENGLAND.I HAVE BEEN IN WHEELED TRANSPORTATION 40 YEARS AND I FELT LIKE I WAS WALKING STEP FOR STEP WITH ADAM SWANN FROM THE TIME HE FOUND THE RUBY NECKLACE TO THE 1ST MAXIE 10 TRK ORDER.I LAUGHED N CRIED THRU OUT EACH VOLUME.I AM NOW IN A SEARCH MODE FOR ANY N ALL OF DELDERFIELD BOOKS I HAVENT READ.I'D LIKE TO SEE A FAN CLUB...."},{"Title":"God is an Englishman","review":"This book is a must read for any Anglophile.

While I read it, I had no idea that it had been written 30 years ago. The historic details are magnificent, as is Delderfield's sense of English geography.

No character is this book is ever in danger of knowing failure, and to me, that detracts from their depth."},{"Title":"God is an Englishman","review":"It's a very good story. Very informative, however, the author gets too carried away with description. The story could be told very nicely with about 20% less descriptive words.

Mr. J.N.Dixit one of the most prominent figures of Indian ThinkTank today, gives first hand account of Pakistan and it's mindset. Stunning details about the mindset of Pakistani people towards India with facts is something worth reading. If someone thinks that People to People contacts between India and Pakistan can solve the problem of Kashmir think again. It is not about Kashmir. Pakistan's policy is to contain India from getting PowerStatus in the world. Be it Security Council Seat or anything else, it will always oppose India(even after Kashmir is solved), one of the stunning revelations is that it is backed by Japan(I always thought Japan was friend of India and also by Turkey(so called democratic Islamic State)). How US is always acting contary to the facts and it's own policies on Human Rights and Non Poliferation is also shown.

Its a must read to understand what and why."},{"Title":"India-Pakistan in War and Peace","review":"This book is definitely not a unbiased study of Indo-Pak relationship. However, this book is a rather important for understanding the India-Pakistan conflict as it gives a complete detail of the Indian government's view of Pakistani establishment.Mr. J.N. Dixit is probably the most influential bureaucrat in the Ministry of Foreign affairs in India and his account explains why India views Pakistan with deep suspicion. Whether his views are correct or not is irrelevant. The bottom line is that he is probably still playing a critical part in India's Pakistan policy and hence one cannot escape it.A well written book by a policy veteran. Definitely a great resource and a must read."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Java 2 in 21 Days Professional Reference Edition","review":"I bought this book because I wanted to learn Java and I liked Laura Lemay's &quot;Teach Yourself Web Publishing with HTML 4 in 21 Days.&quot; I knew C and a little C++ from doing some game programming and a class I had back in '96. I understand the flow and logic of programming in C and I was hoping I could carry it over to Java (since they are somewhat similar). This book took me step by step, chapter by chapter in understanding the true beauty of this language! It wasn't easy, mind you, but it wasn't overly difficult. If I didn't know C/C++, it would have been much tougher. I'd recommend complete beginner's go with the &quot;Teach Yourself Java 2 in 24 Hours&quot; book as some other reviewers have stated. If you know C/C++, this book is perfect! I'm glad I bought the book and it's going on my shelf for reference :)."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Java 2 in 21 Days Professional Reference Edition","review":"EXCELLENT BOOK!This is a new edition published in September 2000. It is a completely revised, updated and expanded version which covers the latest features of Java 2 including JDK 1.3. I found the Swing classes covered very systematically in the 4 chapters and particularly easy to understand. The book covers the Swing classes which are part of the JFC (Java Foundation Classes library) for adding graphical user interface. The information in Appendix is specially useful, informative and clear. The author seems to have taken special efforts to make us understand setting up of the PC for Classpath and Path, often a source of trouble if not understood and set up properly. The examples in the book are presented in a clear precise manner unlike in many other books on the subject which leave a lot to guess in the absence of supporting comments.Coverage of JavaBeans, RMIs and digitally signed applets is impressive.Overall, I would rate this book one of the best and a great value for your money!Vasant L. Abhyanker, IT Premier, email: itpremier@hotmail.com"},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Java 2 in 21 Days Professional Reference Edition","review":"This is really a good book on 'Introduction to Java'...Teach yourself Java in 21 days is a stretch. The book does a fine of job of covering the basic essentials of the language and object-orientation. It is by no means a reference book. I will read it to get my hands and feet wet with the language structure and do some basic examples and rely on other more focused and specialized books (swing, EJB, JSP, JDBC, Applets, Servlets, etc.) to get the more detailed coverage I need. I guess in a nutshell...get this book if you're getting started in Java and complement this book with others that are more specific to the areas you'll be working in."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Java 2 in 21 Days Professional Reference Edition","review":"I'd only recommend Teach Yourself Java 2 in 21 Days if nothing else is available.First, let me say that a few have eluded to the &quot;cutesy&quot; writing style the authors intersperse throughout this book. It's not as sickening as they claim; in fact, it's actually one of the saving graces of the book, adding enough humor and &quot;down-to-earthness&quot; to keep the reader somewhat interested in it.My beef is the confusing teaching style Lemay and Cadenhead present. It often leaves the reader frustrated and perplexed by jumping around back and forth in the book searching for a clear explanation on how to do anything within Java. Here's what I mean: frequently, new terminology is only briefly touched upon within a chapter (and it usually doesn't tie in directly with the chapter's subject matter), only to abruptly conclude with &quot;We'll get into this topic more tomorrow&quot; or &quot;we'll cover this more next week&quot;. When the topic is reconvened later, you're automatically expected to have a thorough knowledge of it. This leaves you thumbing through previous pages trying to look for any detailed explanation on it. I found that the first seven chapters are especially good (or should I say bad) at this. I can realistically say that at the end of the first week, some beginners still won't know the differences between variables, statements, and methods -- all basic elements taught &quot;in detail&quot;.The examples sometimes include elements that aren't even mentioned until several chapters later. As you're going through lines of code, there's the odd syntax with no details on what it actually does within the example. You're just excepted to accept it. If you're new to Java, and like to know what's going on at all times, this would prove to be quite mind-boggling. While this is admittedly unavoidable, there are so many times the authors could've started out with simple concepts (and examples to match them) and &quot;build up&quot; gradually.Speaking of the examples -- I feel there should have been more in each chapter. Unless you're the type who remembers everything after being told only once, you'd need more examples and sample applications and applets to help the material &quot;sink in&quot;."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Java 2 in 21 Days Professional Reference Edition","review":"I think this is a great book.

As far as I can remember..) Every time I needed to master quickly a subject, I read the appropriate chapter from this book, and if I needed more information, I'd just glance at &quot;Thinking in Java&quot; which contains much, much more information.

For someone like me who was drilled in 'structured programming', this is ideal course in switching the brain to think objects. The examples are great, and they work, unlike many other computer books. If you take an hour a day, you can do this in 21 days; if you are more eager, you can easily cut the time down to a week or 10 days (like the reader from South Africa).

They also use real life situations to explain complex theories (using trees to explain classes and objects, or using LEGOs to explain Object-oriented programming).

The problem I had with the SCJP books, is that I felt like I still didn't know Java after I read them. This book filled in that gap for me. I wish I had started with this one, because it assumes that you will be writing some progams in Java other than just taking an exam.This book is broken into 3 primary sections. The first 7 chapters cover the basics including Java concepts, object oriented programming concepts, basic Java, objects, classes, methods, and applets. These chapters provide a good introduction to Java and serve as a foundation for the remaining chapters.The next 7 chapters primarily cover visual java and programming with Swing including components, containers, user interfaces, and graphics. Threads and sound are also coverd.The next 7 chapters introduce more advanced (actually intermediate) topics including packages and class features, error handling, streams, object serialization, sockets, JavaBeans, and database connectivity.The appendicies on configuring the Software Development Kit (SDK) is very helpful to a new programer. There is a good amount of sample code that all runs as designed and compiles without error. The sample code very helpful for grasping the concepts as they are presented.This book is what it was written to be. It's a solid introduction to Java. It does not cover advanced Java, but it does cover enough to get you started. Those who intend to use Java as a primary programming language would will want to augment this introductory text with other books after these concepts are mastered."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Java 2 in 21 Days Professional Reference Edition","review":"I was just curious to learn a language and had heard that Java was easier than most.

The book was fun and kept me interested, like I said, through the first half. By that time, I was already experimenting and just started skipping to stuff that looked interesting.

I loved it. This book is so much fun, you could almost read to the kids at bedtime, and they'll like it too. I especially like the example about the special kind of dragon that feasts on peasants. For example, { if peasant reviewer below == too critical, dragon = hungry }"},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Java 2 in 21 Days Professional Reference Edition","review":"The material in this book is reasonably good. All the source is set out, (which is a big plus since other &quot;teaching&quot; books don't) Lemay and Cadenhead describe go through the structure of the java langauge so you get a feel of how things go together in a java application. The complexity is low but there is a lot of stuff (876 pages, that's alot of dead trees!!) The SDK (1.2( is upto date. Other current books with SDKs usually go for 1.1.5 or something earlier. These guys have really made an effort to show you stuff. But again like any educational books out there on the market there are no exercises with solutions to help you take java out for a drive by yourself.... But they give you an extra 7 chapters (the authors call it a bonus week) most of which is a bit more advnced. Overall it is worth the buy if your serious about learning Java...."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Java 2 in 21 Days Professional Reference Edition","review":"I have a limited programming background, having completed a couple VB6 courses, and I have some background in C, HTML, and SQL. I'm just now starting my first C++ course. Having had VB prior really helped to prepare me with the object basics, methods, classes, components, and events. I was truly able to understand 99% of the book, including the code examples. Some of the syntax was not explained adequately, but if you do not let it bog you down, most of it you will understand by the time you finish the book.There were alot of calls made to Java methods which are not explained, but the J-Builder v2.01 software which came with my book has a very useful online reference section(go to Help-Java Reference). This reference has an index where you can look up the class heirarchies, descriptions, syntax and usage of all methods and constructors, and much more (Examples of each method and other simple code samples would be nice, though).Most of the book's code samples were challenging enough to be interesting and just long enough to illustrate the concept. There were a number of errors, many of which you can be forewarned about at the book's website. The author encourages personal email questions, but he sends back an automated message saying it will be a few weeks before he can get to your question.I liked that the code samples only had a very limited amount of comment statements, but the author goes over the new concepts in the code line-per-line in the text. For me, the first (7) chapters were the hardest and seemed to cover the essential code basics and object/class concepts, but after that I really felt the material got easier and had a nice flow to it."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Java 2 in 21 Days Professional Reference Edition","review":"This book gives a board, complete overview of the java language.

I suspect that anyone trying to &quot;teach themselves&quot; will run into a world of compiler errors once they strike out on their own with more complex programs or variable usage. To really learn to code, examples on handling &quot;real world&quot; variables (particularly input from a user or even multiple instances of a given class) would be useful. She covers arrays in almost dangerously simplistic terms, and all but ignores the important topic of handling keyboard input, which is especially fussy in Java.Developing longer examples, with a little more complexity and functionality, would have been useful. Her Perl book was much better on this point."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Java 2 in 21 Days Professional Reference Edition","review":"If you are a beginner this book is not complete and sometimes is very confusing.

I disagree with the majority of complaints people had earlier on. This book is very good, and very friendly. It is broken into days, and each new day is a new section which builds upon previous days while improving upon the information you need to know. It repeats some information as you progress thru the 21 sections, but in a clever way. It may be a bit hard for a novice programmer, but programming is not an easy task to begin with. For someone coming from a background in C/C++ or .NET, you can probably get thru half of the book in a week. Overall, this book is very well designed."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Java 2 in 21 Days Professional Reference Edition","review":"I've got this book after taking a very bad course at the university where we had a teacher that never explains a thing..

As you know Java is so big and can never be coverd in 1 or 2 or even 3 books.. however this is a good book to keep cause it talks about a little bit of everything and the way they talk about Object Oriented Programming is very easy to understand...

Because if you already unfortunately bought them, you'll might not want to spend your money more on other Java programming books. I think that it's better to use the resources that we already have, rather than to buy another books about Java, coz' you'll end up just the same. And if I were you, I won't blame the authors, coz' I think that they are just like the rests of us, who have different ways of thinking, and also have unique ways to explain something.WHAT MY REVIEW BASES ON:1. I wrote this review based on my experiences after I read \\"Deitel: Java How To Program 5th Edition\\" and \\"Sams: Teach Yourself Java 2 in 21 Days\\",2. And based also from other reviews which written by other reviewers about both books.WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT PROGRAMMING BOOKS:1. \\"Many programming books out there should not be used alone.\\". And if you are in mentioned case above, let's make it to be an advantage. We'll combine the power of Deitels and the power of Sams together.2. Nobody can learn something new so fast. First the Concepts, then the Practices to make you a master.SOLUTIONS OF THE CASE:Read for the first \\"Sams: Teach Yourself Java 2 in 21 Days\\", and then the \\"Deitels: Java How to Program\\". Deitels explains you more about how to write programs in Java, instead of the concepts of OOP and Java 2. In other side, Sams explains more about the concepts of OOP and Java 2. Or you can read them together, but that would be a paint in the neck.You can forget about what they said for marketing and not based on researches, like: \\"You would be able to write or build programs in Java in only 21 Days\\". And you can ignore about what they said: \\"This book will boost you with Java in no time\\", or something like that. Coz' the fact depends on many factors, such as times, ability to understand, motivation, etc.....And finally, this both books are for Java beginners and self-lerners recommended, who are self-motivated. But in the mentioned Case above, still the decision is upon you, whether you decided to buy another book of Java, or try the solution mentioned above. But I can tell you for sure, it has worked for me, and I am a self-lerner.Hope this help, coz' there are so many confusing positives and negatives reviews about these both books.

To take some examples:&quot;The code doesn't compile&quot; - yes it does.&quot;They teach you deprecated code&quot; - yes they do. This is because if you want to write applets, you have to use deprecated code. This is reiterated frequently throughout the applet section. They also teach you Java 2 code.&quot;They don't explain the examples&quot; - yes they do, often giving line-by-line explanations. There are a couple of early examples that use yet-to-be-explained code, but they tell you this (it would be impossible to write functioning code with all you learned in day 1).&quot;They don't build on a foundation&quot; - yes they do. The class concept is clearly explained, then the syntax, data types, then you move onto applet writing.I suspect most of the negative contributors here are merely venting their frustration.My only problem with this type of book is that it is unrealistically titled - you will only get through it in 21 days if you don't have a day job, don't take notes, and dont' revise.Other than that, it was one of the better tutorials in this series."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Java 2 in 21 Days Professional Reference Edition","review":"An excellent criteria to apply to any book designed to teach a topic is that experienced teachers can find something to use in future lessons. Since I have taught Java for over three years and am currently teaching three sections using the JDK 1.3, I can humbly consider myself experienced in the language. There are two examples in the book that gave me the ideas for additional lessons that I have incorporated into my current classes.However, that does not mean that the material is too advanced for beginners. On the contrary, the initial position and the movement is ideal for someone just learning the language. Some of the material that is new and improved in the JDK 1.3 is examined, although not in detail.If you are in need of a book that will give you a quick overview of a language that you are unfamiliar with, then this book is a good choice if the language is Java. The examples are good, current and expressed in a form that is easy to understand."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Java 2 in 21 Days Professional Reference Edition","review":"As long as you understand Object-Oriented Programming basics, this is a good place to start for learning Java. Good as a primer before you get into a book that covers Java more deeply. Of course, to really learn any language you need about 8 books on it, so don't be surprised if there's some things this book doesn't cover. It teaches you the basics of class structures, etc. and spends a lot of time on applets. I'd say that if you wanted to learn to write applications in Java 2, this is not the book for you. It mentions nothing-to-little about the implementation of data structures in Java (i.e. stacks, trees) and reading from / writing to files. Also, it assumes knowledge of SQL for the later, advanced chapters."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Java 2 in 21 Days Professional Reference Edition","review":"I'd only recommend Teach Yourself Java 2 in 21 Days if nothing else is available.First, let me say that a few have eluded to the &quot;cutesy&quot; writing style the authors intersperse throughout this book. It's not as sickening as they claim; in fact, it's actually one of the saving graces of the book, adding enough humor and &quot;down-to-earthness&quot; to keep the reader somewhat interested in it.My beef is the confusing teaching style Lemay and Cadenhead present. It often leaves the reader frustrated and perplexed by jumping around back and forth in the book searching for a clear explanation on how to do anything within Java. Here's what I mean: frequently, new terminology is only briefly touched upon within a chapter (and it usually doesn't tie in directly with the chapter's subject matter), only to abruptly conclude with &quot;We'll get into this topic more tomorrow&quot; or &quot;we'll cover this more next week&quot;. When the topic is reconvened later, you're automatically expected to have a thorough knowledge of it. This leaves you thumbing through previous pages trying to look for any explanation on it. I found that the first seven chapters are especially good (or should I say bad) at this. I can realistically say that at the end of the first week, some beginners still won't know the differences between variables, statements, and methods -- all basic elements taught &quot;in detail&quot;.The examples sometimes include elements that aren't even mentioned until several chapters later. As you're going through lines of code, there's the odd syntax with no details on what it actually does within the example. You're just excepted to accept it. If you're new to Java, and like to know what's going on at all times, this would prove to be quite mind-boggling. While this is admittedly unavoidable, there are so many times the authors could've started out with simple concepts (and examples to match them) and &quot;build up&quot; gradually.Speaking of the examples -- I feel there should have been more in each chapter. Unless you're the type who remembers everything after being told only once, you'd need more examples and sample applications and applets to help the material &quot;sink in&quot;."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Java 2 in 21 Days Professional Reference Edition","review":"This book does not try to help you if you are a beginner.

This Java book is an excellent source for learning both Java Programming and OOP concepts. All of the code samples were great and the authors explained in detail what the code was actually doing.I was very pleased and would recommend all of the &quot;Sams Teach Yourself...&quot; books especially to beginners. I have also have the HTML and XML books and they are great as well."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Java 2 in 21 Days Professional Reference Edition","review":"I am a beginner in the world of programming. In addition, I know that Java is quite difficult to grasp. Thus, I knew it will take time for me to learn the language. When, I first read this book I had trouble understanding it. I was quite frustrated. However, I stuck with it and read it another time and another time. It took me about 21 days to read the book three times. Meanwhile, the Java light bulb in my head finally lit up. Nevertheless, here is my advice to the beginning Java programmers of the future:(1) BE PATIENT and eventually you will learn the language of Java. (2)Preview the chapters and read their summaries before studying them. (3) Read the parts or chapters of the book that were difficult to learn again and again, until you master them. (4)Try to understand and utilize rather than memorize the concepts of Java. (5) Read more than one related book on Java; you will realize that some books explain certain concepts of Java better than others and cover concepts of Java that some books fail to cover. Afterwards, you will agree that this book deserves 5 stars."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Java 2 in 21 Days Professional Reference Edition","review":"I cannot understand those people writing negative reviews about this book.I believe I can speak on behalf of many programmers new to JAVA. This book is one of the best, because after reading just six chapters, I'm now confident to say I know a lot about OOP, classes and methods. Let me tell you about my story. I bought \\"JAVA How to program\\" by Deitel, and after reading five chapters, I still cannot figure out what OOP is all about, the class and methods too.That book is good too, but the target audience is undefined, because the first couple of chapters dealed with GUI and structured programming a lot, without laying out the foundation of what classes, objects and methods of JAVA is all about. Then I remembered a friend who bought this SAMS book last year, so in desperation, I borrowed it and promised to return it after a few days, but failed to do so because I cannot put it down due to interesting topics and well laid out format. Now at home after coming from the office, even if i'm too tired, I can't help but read the book. I don't exaggerate, I just feel I owe this book a lot to post a comment and do the same good thing to other programmers new to JAVA by giving them this advise - BUY THIS BOOK, don't take my word for it, just try it and see what it can do for you. I'm still surfing the net for other references and would like to try Ivor Horton's book just for supplementary reference together with SAMS."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Java 2 in 21 Days Professional Reference Edition","review":"One would get very tired lifting all of the beginning Java books currently on the market. The combination of weight and numbers can be overwhelming to someone looking for a book to use in their initial study of the language. As more features are added and considered fundamental, it becomes harder for the author of any book based on a time frame to pick the \\"essential\\" topics and cover them in sufficient detail. Therefore, the end result is that all books based on an elapsed time should have the time considered as a guideline rather than as an absolute and that type of book should not be judged too harshly in this area.With that as a precept, the questions to resolve are threefold.Did the authors choose the appropriate topics?Are the starting points in a location appropriate for beginners?Is the coverage sufficient so that the student will have some significant grasp of Java after they complete the book?In this case, all the answers are most definitely affirmative. Cadenhead and Lemay begin with the basics of the fundamental data types, expressions and operators. These concepts are then used to construct simple classes, which are then put together to make other classes via inheritance and interface implementation. Classes are then grouped together to make packages, and the implementation details of import and setting the CLASSPATH environment variable are examined. The first week ends with a lesson covering how to work with threads and exceptions.Week two is devoted to creating GUI interfaces, handling events and drawing objects, with the topic of the final day being the construction and use of applets. Week three is devoted to some additional basic and advanced topics. Day 15 covers input/output, day 16 describes the serialization and inspection of objects, day 17 shows you how to communicate across a network, on day 18 you work with sound, day 19 is an explanation of how to create and use JavaBeans, the coverage of day 20 is how to move data using JDBC and XML and day 21 covers how to write Java servlets and Java Server Pages (JSPs). The coverage of each of these topics is necessarily brief, and the authors do leave a lot of things out. Nevertheless, I am convinced that enough is covered so that the students leave with a basic grasp of how each concept is used to construct programs.Are there things that I would have done differently? Absolutely! I would have moved the coverage of input/output so that it was embedded inside the other lessons. Once classes and exceptions are covered, then sending data in and out of files can be done by adding only a few lines to programs whose primary purpose is to demonstrate other things. I would have made more effort to explain how threads can be used and abused in Java programs, covering them in a separate chapter.In conclusion, this is one of the best beginning Java books on the market. No such book is ever perfect, but this one is much closer to perfect than it is to merely adequate."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Java 2 in 21 Days Professional Reference Edition","review":"&quot;Teach Yourself Java in 21 Days&quot; is a deceptively-named but good tutorial on Java programming (after all, could *really* learn Java in 21 days?). The authors take the reader gently through the major topics of Java: classes, methods, control flow, etc. The examples and the discussions provided are not particularly deep, but for a novice programmer, they are more than sufficient.I would recommend following through the examples and tutorials in the book to get a basic understanding of Java. Decide what areas you want to focus on, and get more in-depth books on those subjects. Don't expect to be a Java expert after reading this book.Two last things: I would recommend this book over O'Reilly's &quot;Learning Java.&quot; That particular book is not a tutorial and novice programmers and is poorly written. Also, the second edition of the book will do just fine if you're just interested in learning the basics of Java. The second and third editions are not significantly different, and you can save yourself some real money by getting a copy of the former."},{"Title":"Tolkien Calendar 2005: The Lord of the Rings 50th Anniversary Calendar","review":"The 50th Anniversary of The Lord of the Rings' publication is being suitably celebrated with this 2005 Tolkien Calendar. All of the illustrations are by J.R.R. Tolkien himself, created while he was working on the book in the 1930s and 1940s. The illustrations have been published before, some in the first few Tolkien calendars in 1972 and 1973, others in Pictures by J.R.R. Tolkien in the late 1970s, and all of them in Christina Scull and Wayne Hammond's classic J.R.R. Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator.Tolkien was a gifted artist and draftsman. Even his doodles, like Shelob's Lair (drawn on a page of manuscript) in October, display a high degree of talent and precision. He was famously finicky about his drawings, insisting that each one should precisely mirror the story. (This led to his cropping some elements of some drawings, like March's Moria Gate, which displays both the full picture and the part that was trimmed off; and totally discarding others, like the abortive cityscape of Steinborg shown for September.) This perfectionism led to some absolutely beautiful productions. I am particularly fond of April's Lothlorien, showing the mallorns in full flower, and of February's view of Rivendell looking east: a tumbled landscape of stone, water, and trees.Those who have become used to the artwork of others in previous Tolkien calendars, and those whose primary view of Middle earth was shaped by the Peter Jackson films, may be a bit put off by these drawings by Tolkien himself. July's Orthanc, for example, provides a rather modest view of Saruman's tower compared to that seen in the movie. Those of us who are true lovers of Middle earth, however, will find that these drawings are especially beautiful, regardless of any intrinsic aesthetic value, because they allow us to see Tolkien's own vision as it unfolded in his mind and flowed from his pen and brush."},{"Title":"Tolkien Calendar 2005: The Lord of the Rings 50th Anniversary Calendar","review":"This is by far the most satisfying of all Tolkien calendars, because it is the most real and personal rendering of Middle Earth by any artist.Alan Lee and others have done some good work, but this was Tolkien's world and these are his images. Sure, Orthanc is less severe in Tolkien's imagination than in Jackson's film, but Orthanc was never intended to be portrayed as an evil fortress? Originally built by Men of Gondor, Orthanc served as an impregnable fortress. In Sindarin, it means \`Forked Height', in reference to the four pinnacles of \`hard, glossy black stone, welded into a single tower five hundred feet high'\\". It was later deserted as the D&#7913;nedain moved north, and Saruman - ever in need of feeding his ego - took up residence there. For those familiar only with the movies, this drawing might seem like a let down. I hope that I've squared this away somewhat. The movie overdid it.I have always admired Tolkien, revered him with a sense of awe. He wrote a classic children's novel (The Hobbit) and another less well known children's book, Letters from Father Christmas (which he also illustrated). He wrote one of the most influential novels of the 20th century, The Lord of the Rings, which was not only a remarkable work of literature but spawned an entire genre (and, unfortunately, some rather poor imitators). Beyond that, he wrote remarkable poetry, much of which can be found in The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, and in The Lays of Beleriand. But wait - there's more. He wrote mythology. Mythology that is to me, at least, more interesting than any existing \\"real\\" mythology. I'm referencing The Silmarillion, of course. As if that isn't enough, Tolkien was an accomplished artist, an Oxford don, translated Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, and held various chairs throughout his illustrious scholarly career. (Where in the world did he find the time to do all of this?)As to the calendar, Rivendell's beauty is captivating; Lothlorien is as it should have appeared in the movie; Fangorn, with its dark, oppressing watercolors is frightening and foreboding, a forest one would be wise to avoid; Helm's deep, while less impressive as a work of art, is unique as it offered Tolkien a visual image from which to work while planning this massive battle; the leaves from the book of Mazarbul were perhaps my favorite inclusion, if for no other reason that it caused me to admire Tolkien even more; Minas Tirith, though unfinished, showed signs of grandeur; and the covers that Tolkien himself drew for the three books are better than any I have seen. The drawing for the Two Towers ends the debate of exactly which towers Tolkien was referring to in the title. He drew Minas Morgul and Orthanc. I think he's the expert on this.Honestly, I'm not sure why The Brother's Hildebrandt bothered to put out a LOTR calendar. I'm sure it had to do with milking the 50th anniversary for all its worth, and that I haven't seen their names on anything of merit in years until the LOTR movies were being made, but their art doesn't come close to depicting the depths of Tolkien's work. They were best served as artists for The Sword of Shannara - which was derivative and shallow. If you're thinking about which calendar to buy, stop thinking right now. This is the real thing - the other is simply Parkay."},{"Title":"Alfie's 1 2 3","review":"My 2-year-old daughter LOVES this book. I've been reading it 3-4 times a day for the last two weeks.

It's a good time capsule that shows some familiar traits inherent in many families."},{"Title":"Wonderful Passaic: Memories and Recollections","review":"Once upon a time, suburban America existed mainly as an adjunct to our older cities. Trolley lines and Model T's allowed former city residents to \\"spread out\\" in greener neighborhoods, while retaining access to the city's employment, shopping and professional services. Eventually, the suburbs grew independent of the urban centers; with mega-malls and edge-city office complexes, today's suburbanites need never tread the \\"Broadways\\" and \\"Market Streets\\" of old.When I was growing up in suburban New Jersey in the late 1950s and 1960s, enclosed malls and glass office buildings existed more on paper than along the highways (although the first ones soon became popular). Instead, there was a city near-by where I was taken whenever I needed a penicillin shot, a suit, a whipped-cream birthday cake, or a pair of glasses. I would spend most Sunday afternoons and every important holiday visiting my grandparents in that city - i.e., Passaic, NJ. Passaic and its namesake river defined the geography and economy of my own neighborhood. All roads led to Passaic; the important ones, anyway. Over time, however, Passaic lost its regional significance. Other than an occasional rock concert at the Capitol Theater, there was little reason to go to Passaic.I now regret that. Passaic was a place with character, home to many interesting characters. Thus, I was delighted to recently come across two books about Passaic and its socio-geographic extension across the river, Wallington. They were written by two fellows who are interesting characters themselves. One is Bob Rosenthal, who writes of growing up during the Depression and WW2 in \\"Wonderful Passaic\\". The other is Bill Michalski, who simultaneously grew up in Passaic and later Wallington, and lived to tell of it. He didn't live by much; certain of Michalski's adventures in his book,\\"Poland on the Passaic\\", are quite harrowing!Both authors flourished within a few miles of each other. Both had grandparents who came over from eastern Europe. And yet, there is surprisingly little overlap between their daily lives. They went to different schools, tended to different religious traditions (sometimes reluctantly), and spent their free time in different places doing different things. But that's the spice of urban life -- all the different possibilities that coexist within a mile or two. You can pick out some referents confirming that both authors were proximate in space and time. E.g., the Main Street shopping district; Rutts Hut, a famous hot-dog joint in nearby Clifton; citronella for mosquitoes; worries about polio; humiliating remedies for poison ivy; visits to anti-aircraft gun batteries (in northern Passaic for Rosenthal, in eastern Wallington for Michalski; obviously Passaic was important to WW2 air defense planners); and the significance to both men of the Korean War.And despite the many differences in their temperaments, interests and family traditions, Rosenthal and Michalski have a lot in common. They were both among the first in their families to go to college, assume professional careers, and serve their county in important ways. Their books both focus on humor, but have their tender moments: Rosenthal recalling his grammar school girlfriend and an incident that ended their friendship, and Michalski reminiscing about the pet crow that he brought up. And they both exhibit a mix of independence, talent and pluck. Enough pluck, in fact, to believe that their growing-up stories were entertaining and find book publishers willing to take a chance on finding a couple thousand interested readers.Bob Rosenthal and Bill Michalski have helped me to understand various things about my parents (who hailed from these same towns). And they provide a valuable lesson on how Americans got by in less prosperous times - and even laughed, in spite of the hardships! I hope that America's robust economy and high standards of living will hold despite a future that promises global warming, oil scarcity, continued terrorism, deepening debt, and intensifying global competition. If not, though . . . perhaps the frugality of Michalski's mother, along with Grandpa Rosenthal's belief in America and education, will be needed once more.P.S. Would love to see a joint effort by these guys with reflections on the U.S. today. Title: \\"America-on-the-Passaic\\"."},{"Title":"Wonderful Passaic: Memories and Recollections","review":"I've been in New Jersey on a couple of occasions, each time just passing through on the way from somewhere to somewhere else. To the best of my recollections, I've never set foot in Passaic. But, after reading Bob Rosenthal's recently published book, Wonderful Passaic, I wish I had.Subtitled &quot;Memories and Recollections,&quot; Wonderful Passaic is exactly that: a charming, understated, wistful collection of closely observed and warmly remembered vignettes. Collectively, they beautifully illustrate what it was like to grow up at the height of the Great Depression, through the Second World War and the Korean War, in the ethnically diverse melting pot that was and is Passaic--a town that could seve as a metaphor for simpler, more innocent times.In its pages, Wonderful Passaic covers the full range of experiences that a boy of any era could expect to encounter in the coming-of-age process. There are lessons to be learned about the importance of familiy ties. There are friendships established that will last a lifetime. There's the discovery of sex. There's the joy and heartbreak of public education. There is a wealth of other meaningful events, trials and tribulations, all of which contributed to the transformation from the naive child of yesterday to the man of today: a well-traveled and highly respected research engineer (among other talents) who influenced America's space program.The common thread among all these waystops of life is, of course, the author's beloved hometown, which witnessed a number of surprising incidents, all filtered through the consciousness of someone who was on the spot at the time. Did you know, for example, that during WW II anti-aircraft gunners in Passaic mistakenly shot at (and luckily missed) a friendly plane, causing fires to spring up around the city? Were you aware that the cathode ray tube, one of television's prime components, was invented and built in Passaic? And what explanation can there be that the master clock at Passaic's Number 11 School stopped at the exact moment of FDR's death?Told in unadorned, straightforward prose, Bob Rosenthal's Wonderful Passaic is by turns a humorous, poignant, heartwarming, and nostalgic paean to a specific place and time. It is highly recommended for anyone who has ever longed to return to the less compicated days of yesteryear."},{"Title":"Wonderful Passaic: Memories and Recollections","review":"Read this book in 2 days great history of the city of Passaic learned alot of history of Passaic I did not know Bob Rosenthal is a great author"},{"Title":"Wonderful Passaic: Memories and Recollections","review":"The book provided an interesting picture that reminded me of the town I knew, but the recollections were quite different from my experiences growing up in Passaic."},{"Title":"Wonderful Passaic: Memories and Recollections","review":"Reading Wonderful Passaic, brought back the happiness of my childhood in Passaic, New Jersey.

I have to agree with the positive tone in the other reviews. This novel's powerful characters and scenes combine to make an unforgettable experience. It is remarkable it was even published given its political ambivalence. Socialist Realism it isn't. If you like this work I think you'll also like Konstantin Paustovsky's Story Of A Life."},{"Title":"And Quiet Flows the Don","review":"Sholokov's most famous work is, as it's heralded to be, an epic, almost complete story of the lives of the Cossacks during the Russian Revolution. This must have been a very daunting topic to cover in a novel. I could not imagine coming to a typewriter and trying to encapsulate so many emotions and nuances from a time of such uncertainty and upheaval. Sholokov, however, was up to the challenge, and carefully shaded scenes follow one after the other, genuinely penetrating the minds of his people in all their complexities. So in that respect Sholokov succeeded with rare precision. However, the book overall was largely clunky and unfocused. The first third, very entertaining, lays out what you think are to be the main characters, and sort of mixes them together with soap opera-esque contrivances. Once the war begins, however, the story gets smudged. Characters are introduced and never fleshed-out, there is a weak sense of cohesion, and the story stops being a story, and turns into a docu-novel without a through-line, or much of anything that the reader can hold onto. The war in all its terror is convincingly portrayed, but it doesn't have a face or a heartbeat. One gets the sense that this is a book to return to every so often, to get a better idea of its intensities, but at the same time the prospect is uninteresting. This is a must-read for anyone interested in highbrow Soviet writers, or the time period in Eastern Europe, but general readers would do better to divert themselves to Solzhenitsyn."},{"Title":"And Quiet Flows the Don","review":"I put off reading \\"And Quiet Flows the Don\\" for a variety of reasons but I decided to tackle it on a cruise earlier this month. I found that the book started well and moved along well. The characters were interesting but not compelling. It was hard to find anyone to cheer for; these folks have more than their share of shortcomings. One of their prime faults is something I come across in a lot of Eastern European novels; battered women. There's a supposed hero in this novel who steals another man's wife and then beats the daylights out of her later on when she has an affair with another man. That was one of the better romantic situations in the book. I've come to accept that it was a cultural thing but it doesn't make for endearing characters.I found out a lot of interesting things about the Eastern Front in WWI although I suspect it was mostly fiction. The Russian presence in WWI was marked by large numbers with minimal armaments. The were a lot more victories in this book that I suspect there were in the War itself. Still, I enjoyed the varying alliances and the detailed examination of the breakdown of morale and support.The Russian Revolution emerges rather swiftly as it did in history. However, we are totally unprepared for the events because Sholokhov gives us next to nothing of the political and economic factors leading to the uprising. There was one scene I recall in which a paragraph was spent telling how a political agitator explained the economic injustices of the existing government. We got no specifics; just a mention that the soldiers and workers were educated to their oppression. I got the sense that Mikhail Sholokhov wrote the books without any politics in it and added some here and there later on to get it through the censors. There are speeches referenced but not much specific dogma given. Personally, I figured that Communism was a hard enough sell so why drag an otherwise decent book down in order to \\"explain\\" it. There are characters that agitate for the cause but there are no Strenlikovs in \\"And Quiet Flows the Don\\". Pasternak had the knack, Sholokhov didn't.I thought the closing section on the Civil War was interesting. To me, the Russian Civil War that lasted through much of the 1920's is one of the most overlooked events of the 20th Century.

The GREAT tragedy in this book is their love affair, the primal. visceral, elemental love of Bunchuk for Anna and the horror of his stunned self negating nether world of mourning, Nothing in the book equals the strength of that narrative in this opinion--and there, the author walked with the greatest of the great Russian Authors despite the Stalionist stench that permeates the attempt at poetry and philosophical substance in the idealistic musings of young Anna.A brutal book to say the least. I think the character dialogues are the best parts of this book and I think the author should have attempted a play here and there--perhaps approaching Chekov. What was missing from this book? ---That was a scene that one thought was definitely going to happen And that was a final visit to the general's mansion by Gregor. You may say he delt with that in the final and rough hewn leaving of a desperate Aksina--I think not because she was ever on his mind even in pitched battles or their aftermath. NOT his wife--always Aksina. The general's 8000 acres and his Czarist officer son whom Gregor beat up---should have played into the end of this novel----perhaps the sequel may have it, but it surely was missing here.There was symbolic mood coloring in pastoral and animal discriptions- and how this author loves the color 'lilac'.A Good read, I hope the sequel is as good----BUT the author was a revered commie---and sooner or latre the party line finds its way in to Soviet era literature--"},{"Title":"And Quiet Flows the Don","review":"A story about village Cossacks who lived through the first world war, followed by the Russian Revolution, it seems to be modeled upon War and Peace.

Life during moments of peace-whether long or fleeting is given exquisite touch through the characters who cannot avoid the war around the corner. This epic story grapples with the blindness of war where people engage in killing each other even after they have forgotten the causes and purpose of the war, regarding instead those close by as the real enemies when in reality they are fighting for the enemy who are those who manipulated them into war. Union Moujik, War and Peace can be seen in this story and go further to compliment this insatiable topic of war, peace and diplomacy. I liked the message these books carry whether consciously or unconsciously."},{"Title":"And Quiet Flows the Don","review":"Mikhail Sholokhov is not a name that rolls of the tongue. It should. He was a brilliant writer from a preternaturally early age. His multi seried novel starting with \\"And Quiet Flows the Don\\" first published in the 1930's is a wonderful, mesmerizing journey into Cossack life on the precipice of the Great War and on to the Russian revolution. Despite it's sympathetic and quite human tone it was both heavily censored by the new Soviet government AND reversed by Stalin who is said to have loved the books.There continues to be questions about whether or not Sholokhov wrote it or copied it. In either case someone wrote a great book! The people of the \\"The Don\\" are extraordinary, indecent, savage, romantic, traditional, loving, violent, spiteful, superstitious and full of intrigue. No one is spared from Sholokhov's pen as men are rapists, opportunists while hard working and sincere. Women have a very short end of the stick but still display a broad range of raw emotion.Sholokhov pulls several interesting ploys. He portrays the calm of the flowing Don to lull the reader into seeing the people as similarly placid and living much as they had forever but they are clearly not. There is much conflict and emotion that boils through. He takes interesting long tangents where a seemingly throw away character will be writing diary entries about life and war only to let us observe through that person what a main character is doing on the battlefield. Then he takes us through some of the same scene from the main character's viewpoint. And finally the two characters; in this case Yevgeny Listnisky and Grigory Melekhov ultimately meet again in a very intense scene.There are so many images stuck in my head of village life, army camps with salty language and lamentable deeds and of course the underlying challenge to Czarist power that creates yet more tension. At it's heart this one seriously messed up romance with heaps of betrayal, denial, anger and of course passion.Loved it. On to book II in 2012."},{"Title":"And Quiet Flows the Don","review":"Mikhail Sholokhov won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1965, primarily based on the writing of this book in 1928. It is an epic novel; the story of the Don Cossacks and the impact upon them of some of the most tumultuous events of the 20th Century: the First World War, the Communist revolution in Russia which ended that country's participation in the war, and the ensuing civil war thereafter, between the \\"Reds\\" (the revolutionary forces) and the \\"Whites\\" (the forces of the old, Czarist order.) The Cossacks were the legendary warriors who had mastered the tactics of the cavalry; and, at one time or another had struck fear into most European armies. (They were also \\"the enforcers,\\" who were often called upon to help quell internal dissent in Czarist Russia). Only once in the book did Sholokhov hint of their origins: they were serfs who had fled their \\"masters.\\" And they settled along the Don River, one of the great ones of Russia, and with the Volga River, flows into the Black Sea. One of the most extraordinary aspects of this novel is that Sholokhov wrote it less than a decade after these cataclysmic events; that Stalin was in power, definitely an \\"enforcer\\" in is own right, with strong views of how the past should be represented; and that Sholokhov is relating the story of those who, in very large measure, fought on the side of the losing \\"Whites\\" in the Civil War (although, for sure, as the book depicts, there were numerous exceptions.)The book starts on the Melekhov farm in the village of Tatarsk, on the Don River. During the last war with Turkey, Melekhov brought back a Turkish \\"wife\\" who genes would be passed into the family line, and there are repeated references to the family's Turkish features throughout the book. The first third of the book describes village life during two years of peace, from 1912 to 1914. If there is a principal character in the book it is Gregor Melekhov. The loves and hates of the village are described, including his adulterous affair with his neighbor's wife, Aksinia, and his ill-stared marriage to Natalia Korshunova. Woven into this section are insights into the economic structure of village life. Perhaps the most impressive aspect is the author's evocative depictions of the natural world, which recalls the nature writing of Joseph Wood KrutchThe Best Nature Writing of Joseph Wood Krutch. Sholokhov only foreshadows \\"the Gathering Storm\\" of World War I on a couple of occasions, and uses the character of Osip Stockman, a dedicated Bolshevik, to foreshadow the coming Communist revolution. I believe this portion of the book is the strongest, and most coherent, and could be a stand-alone book.War does come, and Sholokhov's depiction of it, mainly of the small unit fighting involving the Cossacks, rivalsErich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front (Bloom's Modern Critical Interpretations). As one other reviewer noted, there are some powerful passages, such as: \\"He had no cap, nor had he the upper part of his cranium, for it had been cut clean away by a shard of shrapnel. In the empty brain-pan, framed by damp strains of hair, glimmered rose-coloured rain-water.\\" The larger picture of war is omitted, and although a large portion of this section is devoted to the beginning of the war, the disastrous (for the Russians) Battle of Tannenberg is omitted. This battle is depicted in excruciating detail in Solzhenitsyn'sAugust 1914For many Americans, the classic movie and book about this period isDr Zhivago / Movie [VHS] In the next section, the one of the Revolution, there is a scene that must have inspired one of the more powerful scenes from the movie. This is when the Russian armies are disintegrating, and there is a tense confrontation between the men who want to go home, and the officers who want them to keep fighting the Germans. Sholokhov has the officer standing on a wooden barrel, lecturing the troops, and it was the decisive action of only one soldier which turned the tide in favor of the revolution. Worse is to come, and Sholokhov describes it well: the Civil War, the \\"brother against brother,\\" as whole Cossack villages were literally torn apart.I agree with many of the 4-star reviewers in that there were perhaps too many characters, and too many loose ends. But, for me, that is the essence of the epic novel, as well as real life: the bit parts, the major actions, and life goes on, without any neat summation or redeeming purpose. It was a wonderful re-read, after 43 years, and still merits my original verdict of 5-stars."},{"Title":"And Quiet Flows the Don","review":"This is a book about the Don Cossacks and the end of their centuries old way of life due to the Soviet revolution and the - almost disregarded in the West - long Civil War with the \\"White Russians\\" that ensued immediately afterwards. This is a review of a novel; so, for those prospective readers who haven't the faintest idea as to where the river Don lies or what exactly a Cossack may be, please to consult a map and historical source. This review would be far too long were I to attempt to delve into Cossack history.Maxim Gorki - quoted on the cover of my edition - says that the only book to which this one can be compared is Tolstoy's War And Peace. Unfortunately, he is right. This book, for all that is to be said for it, is simply not of the same calibre as War And Peace. In War And Peace, we have the characters of Pierre and Natasha whom - through Tolstoy's deeply percipient eye - we come to know, suffer along with and love. Here, we have Gregor and Aksinia whom - Be honest with yourself! - we end up pitying, if even that. The problem with this work as a novel is that a wall exists between the modern, Western reader and the characters, the Cossacks, who are given to about as much introspection as the animals they tend. The only \\"character\\" that truly shines in this novel is the Don region itself, for which the reader does develop a sense of the deeply instinctual way in which the Cossacks loved it.Sholokhov paints scenes worthy of a water-colourist or Breughel, differing as the setting and landscape suits:\\"The day declined to its close. The September stillness lulled peacefully and with inexpressible sweetness. The sky had lost its full summer gleam and was a hazy dove-colour...Held down to their huts and their daily round, the people pined in their labour, exhausted their strength on the threshing-floor; and the road, a deserted, yearning track, flowed across the horizon into the unseen.\\"Even in the midst of war, in this description of a decapitated Cossack, Sholokhov retains this water-colourist touch:\\"He had no cap, nor had he the upper part of his cranium, for it had been cut clean away by a shard of shrapnel. In the empty brain-pan, framed by damp strains of hair, glimmered rose-coloured rain-water.\\"The novel eventually becomes more than a bit of a slog, as the same sorts of characters do the same sorts of things under the same sorts of conditions. Nevertheless, I do recommend the book. Flowing beneath all the bestial actions, lilac prose and insufferable characters is a very Russian undercurrent of fatalism concerning a way of life drawing its last breath:\\"The grass grows over the graves, time overgrows the pain. The wind blew away the traces of those who had departed; time blows away the bloody pain and the memory of those who did not live to see their dear ones again - and will not live, for brief is human life, and not for long is any of us granted to tread the grass.\\""},{"Title":"And Quiet Flows the Don","review":"...but a good one nevertheless.Sholokhov's And Quiet Flows the Don provides valuable insight into the culture of the Don Cossacks. The reader is allowed to glimpse how the people of the Don see themselves and their immediate neighbors: Russians, Ukrainians, and (to a lesser extent) Kuban Cossacks. The reader get's a good sense of Cossack village life and the relationships between various social classes.The author doesn't do a very good job of character development: characters seem almost \\"wooden\\" and their passion feels like a construction, not natural. So it is harder to empathize with the protagonist, Grisha Melekhov or the propagandist Ilia Bunchuk. The author's attempt to preach Soviet propaganda to his audience is annoying, but it doesn't interfere with the plot too much. The reader gets a sense at the end of the story that a big change is coming, and that village life in Tatarsk will never be the same again once the Soviet government is established.This is not the best novel out there about the Cossacks or the Russian Revolution. Nikolai Gogol's novelette Taras Bulba is much shorter, but has better character development and does a better job of conveying the passion of the Cossacks in their fight against injustice. For a novel on the Russian Revolution, try Boris Pasternak's Dr. Zhivago. Character development is superb: the audience can empathize with the protagonist Yuri Zhivago, and the author does a masterful job showing the transformation of the revolutionist Pasha Antipov into the new Soviet Man Strelnikov."},{"Title":"And Quiet Flows the Don","review":"The page size is 7.5 x 9.5 inches but the text is centered on each page and measures only 5 x 3 inches, so the book is much larger than it needs to be.

This Don business sounds like jive."},{"Title":"And Quiet Flows the Don","review":"I read Sholokhov's 'And Quiet Flows the Don', Pasternak's 'Doctor Zhivago', Tolstoi's 'War and Peace', and Solzhenitsyn's 'First Circle' in the early 1970s.The others were indeed memorable, but 'the Don' is burned into my mind's eye.It paints a searing portrait of a vast, unforgiving steppe--then tears across it on horseback, leaving great waves of ethnic, political and personal upheaval in its wake.I still smell the wheatfields in the wind and taste the black dust on my lips from the opening chapter.I see villagers storm the home of one of their own and destroy his outlander wife for her foreignness.I see an unhorsed cavalryman struggling to remove his bright blue Cossack breeches before capture in one of the Great War's opening battles with Austria, only to be plucked from danger at the last moment by the young Cossack who had stolen his wife before the war.I hear the stolen woman, now become a fiery mistress, sobbing her heart out when the man whose child she bore leaves her at last for his own wife.And after the firing squad's last volley in the closing chapter, I see a proud, condemned Cossack biting fiercely into his own shoulder, to make no sound as his blood pours out and stains the black steppe red.In a quarter of a century, I still have not read a more powerful novel."},{"Title":"And Quiet Flows the Don","review":"I first read this magnificent epic in 1970 and have reread it at least three times since. Sholokhov captures the breath and sweep of the steppes of Russia as he draws the reader into maelstrom of the First World War, the Russian Revolution and Civil War. It is a time and a land that was caught between the modern industrialized West and the near medieval Russia- Cossack Calvary charging German machine guns, the slash of sabers, and the incongruity of machine guns mounted on ox carts.But more than a story of war, this is a story of people. Sholokhov creates for us characters who we deeply care about. The doomed love affair between the protagonist Gregor and Aksinia is both filled with passion and heartache. We even come to care about Akisina husband, the brutal Stephen, We see them caught up in catastrophic events far beyond their control. Although often cited and an apologist for Stalin, I wondered as I read it why it was published in Soviet Union. Our hero Gregor is first swept up on one side of this conflict to the other- clearly he is not a dedicated revolutionary, but just a man trying to survive in a conflict he cannot comprehend. It is a story of survival, love, and revenge. Since my last reading of this novel probably fifteen years ago, I can still vividly picture in my mind the word images that Sholokhov crafted with his pen. Images as simple as the flies settling on the ceiling of the peasants hut, to Stephen brutally stomping his wife Aksinia. His description of the First World War is brutal, perhaps surpassing Remarques All is Quiet on the Western Front.Russians write great novels and this is one of the best. If you are unfamiliar with Russian literature you would do well to read Quiet Flows the Don as your first Russian novel."},{"Title":"And Quiet Flows the Don","review":"Hailed as the best war novel to emerge from the Soviet, Sholokhov's epic has indeed solidified its position in world literature as a must read for those interested in the art of war. Yet, far more than a mere war novel, And Quiet Flows the Don, just as War and Peace had done, masterfully combines the men's martial vigor with the delicate sentimentalities that question war. The blend of peace fades into this gnawing passion in soldiers' bones as they march off to fight under some cause, a cause that has only become too hazy for name. Dedicated to the Cossacks who have resided by the Don for ages, Sholokhov follows a young Cossack's journey into the unknown terror of war. And Gregor Melekov's personal tragedy, blends w/ an array of Cossack characters: swindlers in love, Red Guards with a faith...the plot may appear too scattered at times, yet following Tolstoy's grand tradition to capture a supreme idea through the chasms of minute details, Sholokhov depicts the anguish of a people too wrapped up in honor, unable to cope with the nascent order of New Russia, regretful about allegiance to the Czar who ensured tensile peace, and ultimately lost to themselves as to &quot;mistake each other for the enemies&quot;. We are taught that war does such to people, is peace to heal the wound then? I have yet to conclude this epic w/ The Don Flows Home to the Sea, but the glimpse of peace and yearning for tranquility have long glittered in the eyes of Gregor and his brothers/comrades, exhausted by struggles. A wonderful folk style book that brings one closer to the true picture of Cossack life--acquaint one w/ their lust, their yearning, their cowardice, and their courage."},{"Title":"And Quiet Flows the Don","review":"Sholokov's \\"And Quiet Flows the Don\\" is one of the best novels to come out of the milieu of the old Soviet Union.

Either it shows that people are too drawn to this magnificent work to leave behind the world Sholokhov created, even for a moment to type, or that not too many people are reading this life changing novel because they are not aware of it. I am very reticent on writing reviews, since I do not find my pen to be adequate enough to motivate fellow Amazonians to give my tastes a chance. Anyhow, since I am so spell bounded by Sholokhov's world, I could not any longer sit in the shadow and silence my voice.I am still reading \\"And Quiet Flows the Don\\" and momentarily I am on Volume 3 of this epic tale (and it cannot get any bigger than this, well maybe Tolstoy, but even the \\"Silent Don\\" is a different caliber than good old \\"War and Peace\\"). I am sure the translator of \\"And Quiet Flows the Don\\" must have spent years performing the task of translation. The sheer amount of detailed description evokes such intense emotions and vividness that the reader cannot but live in the world Sholokhov created. The best way to put it in simple terms is that \\"one is there, or rather the Don is here.\\" How much love, meticulous care and tenderness went into developing, writing and presenting the story of the Don Cossacks in the midst of the First World War, the Russian Revolution and then the Civil War is incomparable to any work I have encountered. Though, while I have to state that Mann is my favorite novelist, \\"And Quiet Flows the Don\\" has to be my favorite novel (so far). Do not be fooled by those who say that this is Communistic propaganda. Serious minded ironists always masked themselves in order to raise sensations and satire of the dominant discourse.Sholokhov's epic is bar none the best narrative I have come across, period. Granted, there are many avid readers who adhere to peculiar authors and works, who will from the first get-go choose to disagree with me on my praise of Sholokhov, I am only exuding my affections and gratitude to Sholokhov for having offered the world an absolute beautiful tale of life. This is Realism at its best. Sure, we can all debate whether an author can depict reality objectively, or purely from a perceived account; but still this does not suffice for me to avoid the Silent Don tale.

Sholokhov won the Nobel Prize for this novel of war and revolution among the Don Cossack host. Although painted across a backdrop of history, it is primarily the love story of Gregor and Aksinya. As much of great 20th century Russian literature, the style harks back to Tolstoy, but the subject matter is undeniably Soviet. Published in 1929, \\"And Quiet Flows the Don\\" was the pinnacle of Sholokhov's career. He never again produced a work to compare, although to be fair to him, his career coincided with the height of Stalinist conformity in the arts. This was an era when simply being a famous writer was dangerous - think of the careers of Pasternak, Babel, and Pilnyak. If Sholokhov descended into the role of a party hack churning out the obligatory Socialist Realist pap, at least he lived to a ripe old age!"},{"Title":"And Quiet Flows the Don","review":"Mikhail Sholokov richly deserved his Nobel prize for literature.

Despite tackling a subject that has been done to death, Adrian Pettifer still manages to bring charm and interest to each subject.This is a very reader-friendly book. Descriptions are bite-sized, so the book can be picked up and put down at a moment's notice. Whole counties can be skipped, or it can be devoured cover to cover, depending on your need and interest. Refreshingly unlike many books of this type, it is logically organized--alphabetically by county, and by castle name within each county. Useful ancillary information includes a short history of castle development, a small but legible map of the counties of England, an extremely informative glossary, an abbreviated bibliography, and a site index to aid in finding locations on the Ordnance Survey grid, just in case you decide to visit.County sections begin with a brief overview and end with a short listing of nearby sites that have not been treated in detail. Descriptions of each castle are typically a page or less, but usually include something about the surrounding geography, style of structure, outstanding architectural features, accessibility, and opening hours.The several monochrome photographs are unremarkable, particularly in light of the fact that many other books on the subject are chock full of color photos.However, the hidden treasure in this book is that in over 3 dozen instances, a plan view drawing of the castle and environs is included. Labeled rooms, land forms, and out-buildings provide a much more intimate idea of what life inside was really like than any number of exterior photos could do.Because I have this book mainly for genealogical research, the information I find most helpful and fascinating is historical: when each castle was built and by whom, who lived in it or conquered it, what its current condition is, and what part it played in history. Dates and historical anecdotes are abundant, and the cast of characters reads like a 'Who's Who' of England in the mid- to late-middle ages.The next best thing to living there, this book should definitely be in the library of every Anglophile, researcher, and castle hunter."},{"Title":"English Castles: A Guide by Counties","review":"Has lots in information but would had liked more pictures so I would be able to tell if worth the effort to find the castleShowed only a few pictures. of them. but I found names in the book and then looked them up to see what they were like and what condition to expect.Was okay for lots of information on each castle. going next year back to see more castles."},{"Title":"Empirical Models for Biblical Criticism","review":"Like the title indicates, this book furnishes empirical models for biblical source criticism. To the skeptics of source critical methods, it seems that the criteria for dating, determining the authorship and possible layers of composition of the bible's books is speculative and fanciful. E.g., as with the Documentary Hypothesis: it is unrealistic, allege the skeptics, for a redactor to have pasted together distinct source texts--a 'crazy patchwork', and a process paralleled by nothing in ancient literature. This book serves to refute that claim by offering analogues (*empirical models*) to similar methods of composition in existing non-biblical ancient literature (and even in contemporary literature). It shows that the methods underlying source criticism, contrary to the skeptics, is feasible and the analogues work as controls to gauge the assumptions of that methodology. As Richard Friedman asserts in the Forward, even if the method of composition suggested for source-critical theories was not paralleled at all, that situation would still fail as evidence against them.That said, the articles by the contributing scholars as a collective force are potent; nevertheless, the contributions are of somewhat lopsided quality and I think this somewhat damages the aim. I'll discuss two examples:Emanuel Tov's first contribution (ch. 3) uses the example of a doublet of David's encounter with Goliath in the Masoretic Text (M) which is lacking in the LXX of 1Sam, and argues the LXX reflects an earlier stage of the composition of the book; that the M redactor expanded the story. On the opposing scholarly view, the Greek redactor abridged the longer text of M, probably to eliminate conflicting details. As Tov points out, there's no reason for the Greek redactor to have excised so much to stamp out conflicting details found only in fractions of the entire excised unit. But I think Tov's explanation as a whole is unsatisfactory. For example, there's a passage later in 1Sam that presupposes the presence of the M doublet. How does Tov solve this? Well, he argues the redactor who added the doublet must have wrote or altered this later passage. 'Problem solved' (p. 120, n. 26)...But the problem isn't solved! Apart from invoking the redactor without citing textual evidence for an insertion or tampering, how do you explain the presence of the passage in the witness to the shorter text? That would prove that M was abridged! In other words, the presence of the passage in light of the background of the longer text demonstrates that the shorter text is *missing* something. Also, if it was the redactor of the LXX's Hebrew Vorlage who abridged the text which was carried over by the Greek translator, Tov's argument from the 'relatively literal' translation into Greek is dismissed as irrelevant. Tov glosses over that fact.Alexander Rofe's contribution (ch. 4) draws his example from a difficult text in Joshua 20. He analyzes the text, assigning portions of it to different strata, namely P and D. The difficult portion of the text, assigned to D, is wanting in LXX(B), which reflects the P version. What does this signify? The alleged 'Deuteronomistic school' must have been active much later than usually thought and inserted a D version of the text cast in D language older than the time of the insertion, effectively hiding its late provenance (a secondary inference made from this is that linguistic data has very limited use in marking the date of passages; see p. 146, n. 29). Needless to say, the argument is not convincing. I find it far more plausible that an editor or scribe would have alleviated the difficulty (seen in LXX(B)) rather than for a late 'Deuteronomistic school' to have introduced it.Overall, the book is valuable, and I especially liked Tigay's earlier articles (chs. 1-2 working with ANE literature, e.g., the Gilgamesh epic), Tov's second contribution (ch. 8, discussing the literary history of Jeremiah) and the lucid Appendix (an older article by G.F. Moore on the relevance of the Diatessaron for Pentateuchal criticism).A 4-star book."},{"Title":"Stendhal Enamorado","review":"Small, in fact - you could almost say petite - this little gem from a mastermind Frenchman proves a savoury sampling of Stendahl's works.

This was a great example of his work.I used to play The Virginian on television for nine years with many great actors. I read the work of many writers, and there are very few as good as Kelton for realism and grit. The only man who can match him is Kirby Jonas, whose books I record on audio. They call Jonas the New Louis L'Amour. But as far as I'm concerned, and I've seen this written elsewhere by other reviewers, you don't need any other writers than Kelton and Jonas. Give the Buckskin Line a chance! You won't be sorry. Then try Death of an Eagle, by Kirby Jonas."},{"Title":"The Buckskin Line","review":"If you want to know why the Western Writers of America have endowed Elmer Kelton with six Spur Awards and voted him greatest Western writer of all time, read THE BUCKSKIN LINE. The main character, Rusty Shannon, joins the Texas Rangers in a time before they were formally organized and glazed with glamour and prestige. Rusty's role with the Rangers takes a personal turn when he's forced to confront Buffalo Caller, the Comanche responsible for the slaying of his family during his boyhood. This encounter, along with the meeting of beautiful Geneva Monahan, casts the setting for another remarkable Kelton tale, character rich and full of Texas history. A must read, not just for fans of Western Literature, but for anyone who appreciates quality writing and a surefire adventure."},{"Title":"The Buckskin Line","review":"It's been ages since I've read a Western. The genre doesn't seem to be very popular these days. The library shelves are filled with Zane Gray and Louis L'Amour, as if they were still alive and pumping out the books. I wish L'Amour were still around - he's one of my favorite writers, and I've yet to read another Western author who enchanted me the way L'Amour did.But I did find this little book at my local library, and decided to give it a try. I had seen other Kelton books but for whatever reason never checked them out. I should have - he's a fine writer.This book is quite good. The subtitle says it's a novel about the Texas rangers, but that's not entirely accurate. The protagonist, Rusty Shannon, is a member of the fledgling ranger patrol, but the rangers aren't central to the plot.The novel begins with a historic raid of a Texas coastal town by Comanches in 1840. A child with red hair is taken captive by a warrior, Buffalo Caller, but is rescued by Mike Shannon. Mike and his wife adopt the boy as his own. His Christian name is David, but everyone calls him Rusty because of his red hair.The book skips forward to 1859, and again to the early 1860s and the outbreak of the Civil War. Mike is murdered, and Rusty attempts to kill who he thinks is the killer, but Preacher Webb talks him out of it and convinces him to join the rangers on a remote outpost. Rusty meets up with a solid family with a babe daughter about his age (you know where that's going), but the family is solid Union, while the local bully is a Confederate determined to rid Texas of Yankee traitors. And there's still Comanches hanging around and causing trouble.I've greatly simplified the plot. This is not your typical shoot 'em up Western, though there is plenty of action. It's a thoughtful examination of duty and loyalty, of Rusty's struggles to do the right thing in a maelstrom of strong emotions and murky moral lines.This is a solid book, well-written and thoroughly researched. It's too early to claim Kelton as a worthy heir to L'Amour, but I'm going to read more of his books just the same."},{"Title":"The Buckskin Line","review":"Elmer Kelton is great. That's all that really needs to be said. Every book he's ever written has been good, even though he'll humbly tell you the first ones weren't that good. He is far more believable than Louis L'Amour, who I grew up reading. His descriptive powers may not be quite as great, but he makes up for it. If you like Kelton and L'Amour, also check out Kirby Jonas, whom critics call the New Louis L'Amour. I think the time will come when he will be the name readers of the western seek out!"},{"Title":"The Buckskin Line","review":"Kelton writes historical fiction that is stripped down to character types and action. He's done his homework, and there's a history lesson under the plotline, but this story cuts quickly and cleanly from one crisis to the next. As a writer, Kelton fearlessly chases his hero up a tree and then throws rocks at him, almost to the last page.This first volume of his Texas Lone Star Trilogy introduces us to Rusty Shannon, a redheaded young man who joins the \\"buckskin line\\" of early Texas rangers during the time of the Civil War, when Comanches and whites still fought with much bloodshed for the right to inhabit the Texas frontier. There's also a world of animosity between secessionists and union loyalists, as young men march off either voluntarily or not to soldier for the Confederacy while others avoid conscription by fleeing westward onto the unsettled plains. The rangers, underpaid, poorly equipped and under-manned, operate chiefly as a ragged group of peacekeepers and law enforcers in the midst of all this turmoil.That's the history. Exciting enough as that is, the adventure of Rusty Shannon and the parallel story of the Comanche, Buffalo Caller, ramp up the urgency of any reader's interest in what happens next and keep the pages turning. Recommended for readers of fact-based Western fiction who also enjoy the celebration of heroism against all odds.For more history, finer character development, and greater emphasis on psychological realism, read Kelton's \\"The Day the Cowboys Quit,\\" which for my money is a worthy successor to Owen Wister's \\"The Virginian.\\""},{"Title":"The Buckskin Line","review":"First \\"western\\" I had read in years.

Mike Shannon is murdered by zealots for his Union supporting views and the family of the woman Rusty loves fairs no better when her father and brother are lynched by the Union-hating Caleb Dawkins. Rusty joins the Texas Rangers, an undermanned and seldom paid lot, fighting Indians in the frontier, which keeps him from picking sides in the Civil War. There is a showdown with the killer of his family, Buffalo Caller, and good tension throughout.

Author Svetolik \\"Paul\\" Djordjevic is a well-known lexicographer with multiple decades of experience as a medical translator for the U.S. Social Security Administration. This dictionary is the fruit of many years labor by Dr. Djordjevic, who set out to create a comprehensive, single-volume reference for medical translators working from French into English. If you are such a translator, or if you are a generalist who deals with medical documents on a regular basis, this book is an absolute must.

Lilienthal is a leading post-war jewish American opponent of zionism, or more exactly, the secular nationalistic variant of zionism had become dominant post-WW2. He sees this movement as destructive to Judaism, the liberal traditions of the jewish people and US national interests. Writing in the 1950s this 'cold war' oriented book seems strangely prophetic, even when it's wrong. The title is inspired from early fifties debates about America's 'loss' of China. Lilienthal is asking whether America will soon see the middle east fall to the reds too. Where did he see the danger coming from? From US policies that pursued Israeli interests at the expense of the Arab nations. Lilienthal sees this imbalance, driven by domestic nationalist zionist lobbying in the US and political opportunism (the desire to win 'the jewish vote') as weakening America's wider geopolitical interests. In this broader sense this 'cold war era' book has relevance in our post cold war age.In particular Alfred M. Lilienthal 1957 book focuses on the issue of the Palestinian Arabs and their dispossession as an ongoing sore point. Lilienthal is sympathetic to Eisenhower's attempt to introduce a more 'even handed' approach but sees it as doomed to failure as 'too little, too late'. Ike wanted to create a wider geopolitical coalition in the Mid East to match NATO in the west and SEATO in the east. CENTO never really got off the ground and the Israel issue was it's stumbling block. In practice Alfred M. Lilienthal's predictions mostly bore out. In the decade following this book's publication the Soviets made major diplomatic advances in the region. A reasonable case can be made for a soviet role in formenting the 1967 war (see Isabella Ginor and Gideon Remez's \\"Foxbats Over Dimona\\" for one explanation). And the highpoint of Soviet regional power seems to have been reached 1967-1977. Still, despite Lilienthal' s apparently justified fears, the Soviets were never able to fully turn the Arabs into puppets. So Lilienthal's prediction was at best half right. In fact under the circumstances you have to have some admiration for the Arab leadership's ability to pursue their own priorities, despite the shifting winds of both external superpowers and the volatility of 'the Arab street'. This tells us something too in an era when the US is now overwhelmingly the main external power and street radicalism has swung from 'leftist' Nasserism to 'rightist' islamism. Lilienthal seems to have gotten the fundamentals right. Following the anti-Soviet turn during the Sadat years, the Arab world has never embraced a pro-US position and it looks like their opposition will long outlast the Bush era. Resolving the Palestinian situation still remains the core of America's alienation in the wider mid east and, what John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt call 'the Israeli Lobby' are if anything more dominant than they were in 1957.Well written and insightful the fifties focus of the book is perhaps mainly of arcane interest today, except where it acts as a reminder of how little progress fifty years has wrought. Indeed by most criteria things have just been getting worse. A viable 'two state' solution now seems a mirage as occupied Gaza has become what could only be described as, at best 'a failed state', or \\"failed proto-state\\" if such a category exists. Anti-semitism, once almost exclusively a european disease with little historical root in the middle east, has now been successfully transplanted to the Arab, and indeed throughout muslim world, and is once more thriving with hybrid vigour. Israel may be able to beat the Arab states on the battlefield but is losing in the maternity ward. At the same time the cost to the US taxpayer of militarizing the mid east is way in excess of anything Ike would have considered balanced or proportionate. Thanks to ballooning deficits, that cost has boomeranged, and fiscal blowback cannot be easily answered by the old political ruse of misdirection. The dream of Israel as both a jewish state and as 'normal nation' at peace with it's neighbours looks like just another nineteenth century utopia.Besides historical curiosity the book provides a few side insights that have managed to fall by the wayside from more conventional accounts. Lilienthal discusses the early, and now forgotten, Israeli flirtation with the USSR. It had mutual attraction. This thread is also discussed more fully by Isabella Ginor and Gideon Remez. Stalin's Russia was the first country to give Israel de jure recognition and arranged shipments of Czech arms. Moscow hoped leftist immigrants, and the ideological traditions of labour zionism, would deliver Israel into their bloc. And Russia's affections did not go unrequited. Tel Aviv dreamed of opening up the immigration pipeline to Russia always kept them coy towards Moscow. The fancy apparently continued, even when the flirtation was over, if in somewhat seedier form, until at least as late as the Jonathan Pollard spy case, when Israel traded secrets it's agent had stolen from the US Navy to the Soviets in exchange for exit visas. Alfred M. Lilienthal also discusses the postwar Zionist movement's unscrupulous and unauthorised exploitation of Einstein's prestige to sell their cause. Even though the professor was never keen on the founding of a jewish state. \\"The State idea..\\", said Einstein testifying before the Anglo-America Committee in January 1946, \\"...is not according to my heart. I cannot understand why it is needed. It is connected with narrowmindedness and economic obstacles.I believe that it is bad. I have always been against it...(It is).. an imitation of Europe, the end of which was brought about by nationalism.\\" He also discusses the blackening of the name of the noted historian Arnold Toynbee as an 'anti-semite'. The cause? His suggestion in print that western guilt over centuries of antisemitism was being expiated at the expense of the Palestinians, and that Israelis were inflicting on \\" ...other human beings, who had done the Jews no injury, but happened to be weaker than they were, some of the wrongs..that had been inflicted on the Jews by their many successive Western Gentile persecutors...\\"Lilienthal's book however fails to provide a convincing alternative to the evolution of postwar zionism into the nationalist movement it became. Perhaps it could have gone no other way. I suppose we have Adolf Hitler to blame for that. All told an interesting read, although Lillienthal's \\"What Price Israel?\\", originally published 1953 with an updated 2005 reissue is perhaps a better single volume option for the modern reader."},{"Title":"There goes the Middle East","review":"Lilienthal's There Goes The Middle East written in 1956 was a must read at the time it came out.

But my lingering impression was that it held nothing of lasting value.Recently I took it down off the shelf after nearly a decade to revisit my notes and see if I still felt the same way.

The authors say \\"tape readers see price movement in relation to the rate of volume and can determine when the footprints of stock action are made.\\" OK. Tell me more. The \\"more\\" is a loosely defined set of rules, guidance, contradictions and day-trading examples of various setups and trades that apparently worked for the authors.Perhaps the most useful part of the book describes \\"the dos and don'ts of trading.\\" Here are a few examples.- Trading should be natural and easy.- Don't fight. Trading is not war.- Do not trade out of revenge.- Understand that risk is inherent and a natural part of trading.- Define what a sucker is.Get the idea?

O'Neil'sThe How to Make Money in Stocks Complete Investing System: Your Ultimate Guide to Winning in Good Times and Bad.Good trading!"},{"Title":"Techniques of Tape Reading","review":"The progression of Vadym from his worst levels to his best levels shows a good trading psychology. The tape principles were informative and usable. The examples (although only Nasdaq and I agree with other reviews that I wish there were listed examples also) were very illustrative of the principles and overall general psychology of the book. Rarely do books have it all. Psych, principles and a system/examples to follow. This is a book I'm sure I'll go back to every once in a while if I am having trouble.Unlike a few reviews, I don't feel this book is solely to push products. And to the individual that said Vadym came to America to live the good life, evidentally this person didn't even read the book. He &quot;fled&quot; to Canada, not America, lost a big part of his capital on a few dumb trades, before finally making it as a trader. That is far from the good life. Clearly just a bush league tactic to put some other advisory service in a review. Who's pushing products now?Anyway, I can recommend this book as one in my top 20 on my trading shelf."},{"Title":"Techniques of Tape Reading","review":"Then clearly you are not a student of the market. You don't like Vad's personal experience recounted in the opening stages of the book? - (full disclosure - I have acquired the principles of trading under Vad Graifer) - then you are not prepared to learn from the experiences of the very small minority that succeed as traders.For those impatient people who want to make money NOW TODAY GIMME GIMME GIMME I suggest you head straight to section 3 of this book and copy the classic setups that work in all time frames. If you succeed straight off the bat - kudos to you. But if you are like the majority and you do not, then perhaps you might be interested to read all those 'boring' words Vad included in earlier chapters. Like the role of a setup; stop placement and the importance of risk management; the psychological and emotional aspects required of a profitable trader.I've been a student of the market for near five years now, burned through a couple of accounts (and no it did not cost me the SEC mandated $25k min. each time; ask a pro how) and have come to realise that trading is like life - it is the longest marathon. The slow acquisition of each piece of the puzzle required to succeed has altered my view of myself, the market and the world around me. Much of this understanding comes from Vad, whose texts plus a couple more are the only trading books that adorn my library shelf.And for heaven's sake, for those that would suggest that this is not a book of tape reading, the only thing that has changed from Jesse Livermore's day is that the tape has been converted into graphical format aka the chart! Repeat after me - price and volume, price and volume, price and volume. It ain't rocket science!"},{"Title":"Techniques of Tape Reading","review":"I've found this and other titles by this author helpful to me in recognizing behaviors in the market. I always value things that are more practical than theoretical and this fits the bill. Easy to understand and apply."},{"Title":"Techniques of Tape Reading","review":"So it's almost 10 years ago since I first read this book.This was the first book I read about scalping and price action trading. Back then there were no other books like this - meaning, I didn't find anything better.Yes, the title is very misleading. This book is not about tape reading per se.Graifer's idea about ticks and the tape is that each tick is displayed on a chart in price, time, and volume.Mike Bellafiore from SMB Capital and author of \\"One Good Trade\\" however claims that charts - real time charts - are lagging the tape. This is because the chart won't show you unfilled orders. On the tape you can see an offer for 10K shares which doesn't get filled because other traders are selling below. So the tape can show you support and resistance levels which may not be apparent on the chart.The first book I read about actual tape reading was \\"Electronic Day trading Made Easy\\" by Misha Sarkovich around 2002. Also, back then they were no other books. This book talks about the actual price movements in a Level 2 ticker. It's okay for some momentum setups.The second book I read about tape reading was \\"The Day Trader's Survival Guide\\" by Christopher Farrell. This book talks about the pitfalls using the tape for trading.Okay, this now was just about Tape Reading for readers who were mislead.Personally I'm not really into using the ticker tape.This book Techniques of Tape Reading is actually about price action trading and scalping using charts with 5 to 2 minute intervals.This book isn't complete, but back then they weren't no other books of this kind. And the term \\"price action\\" wasn't used.It has only about 6 or 7 setups and then many pages with examples on how they were used. This is just fine for a beginning trader. Not too much, not too little information. What the reader should do is to open his own chart with his own stock and see how those setups would have applied there.This is a good and a nice a book for beginning traders who haven't yet an idea what setups are about.This book actually HAS tradeable setups. Many books just haven't.If you want to be a scalper or swing trader using minute interval charts I also recommend to read \\"Technical Analysis in Stock Trends\\" by Robert Edwards and John Magee. Because chart patterns that appear in daily and weekly intervals also appear in daytrading using minute intervals.4 stars really for what it is. I'm giving it 5 because many readers rated it down for being mislead."},{"Title":"Techniques of Tape Reading","review":"A no nonsense book which explains what to look for in trade set-ups.

Well worth the time and money."},{"Title":"Techniques of Tape Reading","review":"If you are serious about trading and want to know what being a successful trader is all about, then get this book. The reviews discounting this book as vendor promotion are hogwash and done out of complete ignorance - IMHO. This book was founded on Vad's desire to help students hone their craft. Yes, a lot of the material has been covered in other books. Yet, Vad found a way to make many previously discussed concepts come to life in a profoundly useful manner, while introducing new concepts and ideas of his own. I consider this book a gift to the trading community and feel fortunate to have read it now three times. The folks at Reality Trader are the most honest, knowledge and powerful educators in the industry. Get this book and be thankful that there are people like Vad, Chris (and other Realitytrader.com educators(like Bo)) willing to take the time to help you through the stages of development. Fantastic work."},{"Title":"Techniques of Tape Reading","review":"I found there to be no actual tape reading. Instead I found a grammatically poor book and the resultant struggling to re-read sentences to pinpoint what the author was trying to convey.I did enjoy his personal background/history. Half the book is taken up by this and the rest examples of his trading setups. The setups I found somewhat informative but that was not the reason for purchase.Going back to tape reading or rather the lack of. Rather than specific examples showing tape reading he merely inserts e.g. '...here we use tape reading to exit a position...' or '...using tape reading principles we look to short here...'.I'm disappointed. 2 stars may be a little generous, perhaps 1.5 stars."},{"Title":"Techniques of Tape Reading","review":"If I could I would give a zero stars, unfortunately it is not possible. I really should say I pissed at myself more. I should have recognize this garbage earlier and do not waist a time. There is NOTHING ABOUT TAPE READING, this book content is empty.I was intrigued by the title, thinking I will be able to apply the techniques. First half or the book is very easily understandable. But there is nothing that you will not find in any other trading book.The second part is feels like it was written in very convoluted way to confuse the reader. I actually spend hours going over each technique and try to understand what the author had to say. NOTHING. It is seems to me that author uses chart and trying to apply the old buy on the bid and sell on the offer techniques. But then all of his explanations do not make any sense. It seems that when an author has nothing of value to contribute.Be skeptical of positive reviews of this book.

I consider the title of this to be false advertising plain and simple. There is no mention of or techniques or diagrams of Time and Sales, which is the tape.

Nothing.I am a trader. I trade every day, and actually read tape. This poorly written, and unedited assemblage of words is virtually worthless for anyone desirous of becoming a student of tape reading. There is simply no real tape reading content, and the content that resides on these pages is not worth reading, especially if your goal is to become a better trader.I was intrigued by the title, as you likely are. It seems that when an author has nothing of value to contribute to the trading community, they try to sell their junk by creating a catchy title. It must work to some extent, because the tactic seems to be used a great deal. Read my other reviews for more information.For some insight into the art of reading tape try, Tape Reading & Market Tactics by Humphrey Neill, and Studies in Tape Reading by Rollo Tape. Both were written long ago, and are valuable contributions to a trader's education. There has been nothing of value written about tape reading in the past 50 years, that I can find.A final word of advice. Be skeptical of favorable reviews of this book. If you are interested in tape reading, there is nothing here. Also, read reviews written by real traders. For insight into the reviewers' sincerity and discernment, scan all of their reviews. Similar to tape reading and market analysis, one can determine which book reviews to believe and which to ignore from the reviewers' history."},{"Title":"Techniques of Tape Reading","review":"I finally got around to reading this book and am happy to say that I can recommend it (not that what I think matters all that much, but there is so little I can find to recommend, I just thought I'd mention it). There's been little of value written on tape reading since Neill's book in the 40s, and before that, Wyckoff's work in the 20s and 30s. Possibly the popularity of &quot;indicators&quot; stole some of tape reading's thunder, since indicators are purportedly &quot;simpler&quot; to use.I had hoped that the book would be a bit more thorough, but after finishing it and giving it a second read, I understood that what Vad and Chris are trying to do is reduce TR to a set of basic principles, easy to explain, easy to understand. The buts and unlesses and on the other hands are left to many specific examples which illustrate just what it is they're trying to get across. In this way, one can come up with his own examples to illustrate the concepts rather than rely on some sort of &quot;blueprint&quot;, in the event that he is trading a different market, a different bar interval, a different timeframe, or even using indicators to supplement his judgement.Unfortunately, the book begins with what has become the obligatory &quot;once I was a loser and then I became a winner&quot; section. Not that it's boring or that there's anything wrong with this sort of autobiographical touch. After all, one would most likely be put off by someone who puts out a trading book beginning with only his successes and giving no hint of the often rocky road one must travel in order to achieve those successes. But those who have read more than a few trading books are likely to find that they could have skipped this and gone right to the meat of the book, i.e., the principles of tape reading, and there's plenty of meat here. No, the book is not encyclopedic, but, contrary to what you may have heard, tape-reading does not require the encyclopedic approach. Keep It Simple.If all you have, then, are Wyckoff and Neill, this should pull everything together for you in a way that will enable you to gain some traction on this tape-reading stuff. The advice on how to create a setup and how to evaluate what you've created should be of particular benefit to beginners who continue to struggle with this and with the misleading notion that the riches lie in finding that one perfect golden setup."},{"Title":"Techniques of Tape Reading","review":"I have read a great many trading books and this has got to be in the top 5, I think it could well become a classic.The book is divided into three parts. The first part is mainly concerned with the development and psychology of a new trader. Now although there are other books which are entirely devoted to trader psychology, &quot;Trading In The Zone&quot; by Mark Douglas springs to mind. The authors have covered this very important topic in a very easy to understand manner.The second part delves into the art of tape reading, numerous set ups are explained, and stops and exit strategies are presented.The final section describes in detail 33 different trades, each with the appropriate chart. These trades help to reinforce the material presented in part 2 of the book.I think this book is not really suitable for the absolute beginner, but once one has got some basic TA down, then this would be an excellent next choice."},{"Title":"Techniques of Tape Reading","review":"One of the best tape reading books available. For any trader new to tape reading, this is a must read.Covers the teachings of Wyckoff and Neill. The author shows various setups combining price and tape with the final section dedicated to charts.

I followed much of his knowledge over there since then. When I read this book for the first time, I found the insights of solutions to the problems he faced and overame to be very close to my own trading. The real life experiences of this book really illustrated for me what a true trader must do to become successful. I am mainly a TA trader. The principles of this book in regards to Tape Reading will definitely enhance my TA skills.The only downfall is that if you are looking for NYSE examples, there are none. Vadym and Chris seem to still be Nasdaq traders. Although, the way the principles are presented, you will be able to apply the Tape Reading ideas to anything you trade. Highly recommend this book and I look forward to reading this one every 6 months to catch things I missed. Thank you Vadym and Chris. - Dan"},{"Title":"Techniques of Tape Reading","review":"The book is clearly written and easy to understand. It is a training manual for traders that first describes the evolution of the author/trader from beginner to accomplished trader, including not only the financial, but psychological challenges and crises he faced as well, which helps the beginning trader realize they are not alone in what they face and experience.All the while, he builds a psychological model of a successful trader and the requisite skills and talents for the individual to develop to fulfill this important aspect of trader development.In the second part of the book he explains his trading system, and the basics of the tactics and strategy he uses in his daily trading, and the market battlefield that the trader will face daily. The third part of the book goes from the theory of part II to the reality of application: It is a catalog of over 30 historical examples from his trading diary that show his system in action.The book provides a solid foundation for those who want to explore the trading profession. As I said, it is clearly written and easy to understand. And for those who decide to stick with it, the book provides a reference touchstone to be revisited repeatedly throughout your career.I need to make one comment about a review written earlier: True, the book is not solely about tape reading, but who trades that way anymore? The tools available to the modern trader, as well as the vasteness and velocity of current day markets, relegate the tape to a position as an arrow in the quiver as opposed to the sole tool available, as it was in the first half of the 20th century. Charts are now real-time representations of the markets in action, and aren't charts visual representations of tape action?Also, it may be true that the information contained in this book can be found somewhere in the myriad publications on the subject of trading, but the point is, if the examples and arrangement resonate with you, or provide the analogy or presentation that aid your development, then, isn't it worth it?Besides, if you're making this your profession, your library should have, at one time or another, every book written on trading. Keep that which works for you, and throw the rest away."},{"Title":"Techniques of Tape Reading","review":"I follow Chris on Realmoney.com through his daily trading track. I don't really trade the same way he does, but his accuracy at predicting and trading off NDX levels was always interesting to me. I figured there must be something to it in his Tape Reading skills. This book seems to describe his partner more, rather than how to really trade off NDX levels, so I was somewhat disappointed in that. However, there are a few gems regarding the progress of a trader, mental preparations and overcoming trading problems that will probably help me. As for the Tape Reading part, the principles were easy to read and understand. One of my hardest problems in trading is knowing how to differentiate accumulation and trend signals. This book helped me to do that as well. I would recommend this to anyone as a solid read and addition to their trading library."},{"Title":"Techniques of Tape Reading","review":"Are you a trader?

The presentation he gave had principles of tape reading and examples. I learned quite a bit from it. This book was very helpful in continuing what he talked about at the expo. I was in the same boat as others that looked at tape reading as watching trades and trying to figure out what they meant. After reading this book, I learned more about what tape reading can do for my trading plan since I position trade, not daytrade.I have tried a few of the concepts such as the capitulation setups and euphoria setups with a fair degree of success when I can watch the volume indications described in the book. I don't daytrade but I do position trade and I'm glad that I see these concepts and principles work in that time frame as well. The psychology part of the book was good also.After reading a few other reviews, I can say that I also wish they had more listed examples as that is my primary market. But I think those that feel there is no tape reading are wrong. There are some fair examples of volume/price indications in several time frames that show what the idea of tape reading is.Anyway, I recommend the book."},{"Title":"Techniques of Tape Reading","review":"The first part of this book is the best part. It talks about Vadym's progression from a losing trader to a winning trader. I would recommend reading the book just for this if not anything else.

It tries to describe some principles behind volume but nothing in depth into how to interpret time and sales information, read tick information or read blocks.

At least he gets the cholesterol message pretty much right, but basically this seems to be a watered down rehash of Ravnskov's material, used to bolster the author's New Age alternative medicine notions of transcendental meditation and vegetarianism. There may be something there, but the scientific proof is lacking.

As a research scientist, I commend the authors' scrutiny of the medical literature. It is evident that they have done their homework. While I do not necessarily agree with each and every one of their interpretations, I find their assesment and conclusions well thought out. I was particularly impressed with their multifaceted approach to \\"Creating Real Heart Health\\" found in the second part of the book.

Those lab report results can seem like raffle ticket numbers and none of us wants the boobie prize. To get the \\"right\\" cholesterol numbers, we are urged to change diet, lifestyle, exercise regimen, etc., and/or take drugs, but the outcome can seem as random as a raffle when the next lab results come in. This book gathers together a wealth of hard research about what the connection may and may not be between cholesterol levels and overall heart health. The Myth of Cholesterol also points toward what may be much more important heart health factors. I felt empowered after reading this book, both because I can now understand my lab report better myself and because I can also participate as an informed patient when I discuss this with my doctor.

It uses the results of many scientists and their experiments to show that cholesterol does not cause heart disease, and then goes on to talk about some of its real causes. The book offers real prescriptions for heart health that are free and bring only good side-effects because they are life-style changes that each person has the freedom to make. We learn that heart disease is more poetic that modern medicine has let us believe.Written in accessible language for the non-medical community, but strong enough to with-stand the pressures of that climate as well, this book will ease the burden of anyone who fears heart-disease or worries about their cholesterol; it will educate anyone who has an interest in true health."},{"Title":"The Myth of Cholesterol: Dispelling the Fear and Creating Real Heart Health","review":"Because of my doctor's insistence on taking medication for my Cholesterol level, I felt a great need for better understanding, and some advice on what I can do about it.

I purchased several books on Cholesterol, and this is the only one that I was able to read through completely and I feel that this book gave me exactly what I was looking for, an understanding of cholesterol, and methods for preventing heart disease (which is the focus of my doctor's advice).I have realized that creating heath for myself and \\"real heart health\\" in particular, is possible and a responsibility. I do know and have observed the effects of stress on my health, and have already seen improvements in other areas of my health from adopting the recommendatons in this book.

My suspicions of the medical industrial complex were completely confirmed. Cholesterol is not even a symptom much less a disease. It is minimally connected to any risk of heart attack. That it can be influenced by drugs seems to have caused the leap to it must be. The \\"magic bullet\\" theory being all pervasive in the minds of the public and the medical community and heavily pushed by Big Pharma's persistent advertising.While I was convinced that statins could do little good, I was not convinced that they would do significant harm in the small doses proposed for me, although the risk of harm does exist.The extreme lifestyle changes suggested in the second half of the book were just unrealistic, at least for me. While I do try to live as stress free as possible, I am not about to take up Transcendental Meditation. I am not going to become a Vegetarian either.

The first in the SUPER CHILLER division of FEAR STREET is boring to no explaination point, the suspense is all padded and muffled, and the ending is stupid. And to top all of this, it's extremely long."},{"Title":"Party Summer (Fear Street Super Chillers, No. 1)","review":"Why would something be put in the back blurb when it wasn't in the book at all? There's an element in the blurb above that just doesn't exist in the story. That's like the non-sequential events on the back of Christopher Pike's Immortal. Very weird. And talk about misleading. It didn't detract from the story any but I can't help but wonder why.Pike and Stine have very similar writing styles although I think Stine is a little more kiddish, even in his YA books. It doesn't hurt the story but I think it hinders the storytelling just a little bit. So much more could be put into it if the aim was a little higher.But it was creepy enough. It had me on the edge of my seat at the end of a lot of the chapters. I didn't want to stop reading when something crazy was about to happen! Damn hour lunches! And it was creepy. It carried that sense of foreboding with it, that anything could happen to anyone. No one was safe.When people start disappearing and strange events started happening, your comfort zone gets destroyed and the more the story gets into it, the more unsure you get of the characters' survival. Will they make it?The supernatural elements are kept to a barely there minimum; yet even more proof that you don't need insanely spooky stuff to be not of this world. Sometimes other humans are all that you need to be totally creeped out.Whether its the short, almost choppy sentences or the fact that nearly every chapter ends on a cliffhanger, Stine's writing is compelling. You'll want to figure out what's going on, and fast. The events are as grounded in reality as a cheesy teen horror book can be grounded in reality and I think that makes it all the more frightening. Who wouldn't want to go fart around a private island in a swanky hotel? The very premise is the start of how many good horror stories? But it's what's done with it that makes it truly horrifying and Stine does an awesome job. The horror is in the helplessness and it'll have you clawing at the pages until you know just how it all ends."},{"Title":"Party Summer (Fear Street Super Chillers, No. 1)","review":"This was one of my favs when I was a kid!As an adult I was excited to see it was on Kindle.

This is an unique aposteriori argument for the existence of God, but unfolds an argument in a manner wholly different from the past, such as Aquinas, for example. Newman is a very persuasive author, who uses his evidence judiciously and validly. People of faith will find this exposition worth the perspective.But, this book can stand on its own as a superlative example of brilliant exposition, using Newman's usually elegant style, and enjoying a journey that seems unlikely from its impetus. The first chapter is particularly difficult, but after that, the reading is engaging and remarkable."},{"Title":"An Essay in Aid of A Grammar of Assent","review":"Cardinal Newman's An Essay In Aid of a Grammar of Assent is a classic of Christian epistemology, and deserves to be more widely read than it is. Unfortunately, the present reprint will not aid in the promotion of that goal. The book is printed on rather large paper, but the text itself has been reproduced photographically in such a way that it is virtually impossible to read it without a magnifying glass. Indeed, it is somewhat strange to open up such a large volume, only to find a tiny text surrounded by two- to three-inch margins of blank space all around. The waste of paper is enormous enough in its own right, but the waste of the buyer's money is unforgivable.Prior to purchasing this item, I tried to examine it using the \\"Look Inside\\" feature available through Amazon.com. Sadly, Amazon rather unhelpfully shows you, not the text of THIS edition, but the text as drawn from a different edition, which appears to be of normal size. So there is no way to know, prior to purchase, exactly what one is getting.I returned my copy for a full refund. It is possible to get the full text of Newman's classic in electronic form on the internet as a PDF file--FOR FREE."},{"Title":"An Essay in Aid of A Grammar of Assent","review":"\\"A Grammar of Assent\\" by J. H. Newman is without doubt the most elegant, eloquent, and persuasive argument yet for the belief in God by any Christian philosopher. Despite its 19th-century origins, it remains one of the most modern of Christian philosophies yet. Gone are all references to Aristotle and Aquinas and their antediluvian methodologies of a priori logic to \\"prove\\" the existence of God and why it is supposedly \\"rational\\" to believe in such a God.In its stead, Newman uses the Humean methodology of a posteriori inferences that lead one to believe that the \\"uneasiness\\" one feels (another Humean concept) about certain disturbances of the mind/soul that are attributable to the indwelling, or natural inclination, of the \\"conscience.\\" From this natural inclination (again Hume) and by rational inference (Hume again), Newman posits step by step, and from different angles, that it is only a natural logical inference to assent to the belief in God. But it is the a posteriori experience of \\"conscience,\\" not some a priori \\"proof,\\" that leads the way.Don't be put off by the rigorous prelude of the first-two chapters; they give considerable detail to the methodology Newman intends to use, which again is empirically oriented, not a priori logically deduced. The reading after that is a breeze, containing absolute wonderment at the level of perspicuity, rhetorical advantage, and logical nuances that infer God's existence from natural inclinations. It was, and remains, a revolutionary approach, and is a worthy work to include in any Christian's library."},{"Title":"An Essay in Aid of A Grammar of Assent","review":"Of great interest for anyone interested in the way in which the debate between rationalism and faith squared up in the early years of the 19th century"},{"Title":"An Essay in Aid of A Grammar of Assent","review":"John Henry Newman (1801-1890) was an English Anglican cleric and a leader of the Oxford Movement; he converted to Catholicism in 1845 and eventually became a Cardinal. He wrote many influential books, such asApologia Pro Vita Sua (An Image classic),The Idea Of A University: Defined And Illustrated,Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine, etc. This book was first published in 1870.He states that \\"These so-called first principles, I say, are really conclusions or abstractions from particular experiences; and an assent to their existence is not an assent to things or their images, but to notions, real assent being confined to the propositions directly embodying these experiences.\\" (Pg. 69) Later, he adds, \\"A dogma is a proposition; it stands for a notion or for a thing; and to believe it is to give the assent of the mind to it... It is discerned, rested in, and appropriated as a reality, by the religious imagination; it is held as a truth, by the theological intellect.\\" (Pg. 93) He asserts that \\"Theology may stand as a substantive science, though it be without the life of religion; but religion cannot maintain its ground at all without theology.\\" (Pg. 109)He argues that \\"by believing the word of the Church... every Catholic, according to his intellectual capacity, supplements the shortcomings of his knowledge without blunting his real assent to what is elementary, and takes upon himself from the first the whole truth of revelation, progressing from one apprehension of it to another according to his opportunities of doing so.\\" (Pg. 131) Later, he adds, \\"Therefore we may be certain of the infallibility of the Church, while we admit that in many things we are not, and cannot be, certain at all.\\" (Pg. 184)He notes that \\"It is the mind that reasons, and that controls its own reasonings, not any technical apparatus of words and propositions. This power of judging and concluding, when in its perfection, I call the Illative sense...\\" (Pg. 276) He adds later, \\"Our great internal teacher of religion is... our Conscience\\" (pg. 304), and observes, \\"retributive justice is the very attribute under which God is primarily brought before us in the teachings of our natural conscience.\\" (Pg. 326)This book is a fascinating production of a still-highly influential Catholic voice, and an invaluable resource for studying Catholic philosophy."},{"Title":"Uncommon Ground: Archaeology and Early African America, 1650-1800","review":"This book provides insight into the physical evidence being unearthed and explored by archaeologists engaged in the study of early colonial African American sites.

I am sure some people dream of the time when their lives are open to scrutiny by legions of readers, when their private confessions are published in neat volumes, and their witty letters to friends have little footnotes explaining the inside-jokes to the uninitiated. But the thought makes me cringe, and in the spirit of the old saying &quot;do onto others&quot;, I have never before ventured into someone's exposed private life.Last summer though, I came across this letter by accident and found myself unable to stop reading it until I was done. The glimpse into someone's vulnerable privacy was intoxicating. Having read (and loved) &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;, &quot;The Ideal Husband&quot;, and other light pieces, or even &quot;The Portrait of Dorian Gray&quot;--a more somber but still very controlled story, I was shocked by this letter--tortured by emotion and so uneven--by the same author.The previous reviewer mentioned that he found the letter somewhat contrived. But the insincerity makes it all the more fascinating ! Not even the insincerity in itself, but the bits where the true emotion bursts through. I could imagine so vividly the great author, the person of wit and fashion, stripped of the glamor, in jail, trying to clear up his name in the public letter to his lover. He starts out with calm and controlled prose, trying to put his Christian-repentance-and-forgiveness scheme on paper... And, I am sure, he believes the things he plans to write. However, as he gets deeper into the narrative, as his pen takes a hold of him, he starts writing what he did not mean--the truth, full of bile and unrequited passion. In a while he notices it and collects himself, and the prose becomes controlled and witty and intellectual. But he is in jail, the time for writing is precious and does not permit the luxury of extensive editing. It lets soul nudity that would normally be edited out remain to seduce shamless readers like me.It is not only the breakaway emotion that I found so compelling in the letter. It is also the very alternating nature of the narrative--from the polished and righteous to the true and base, and back. Is it not how our mind always works: how it thinks what we wish it to think and then breaks away to find something deeper in us, until we catch it and put it back to its proper controlled place...There is a long and intricate novel hidden in this letter. It is a story of the rise and fall of a great man, of the universally human desire and its treacherous waters, of stoicism and weakness, of the fine society and jailed outcasts, and we see it through the eyes of the main hero who actually lived. It is presented fully on meager ninety pages. Wilde was a genius indeed."},{"Title":"De profundis","review":"I agree that this is a book that should be read by all and I do not deny the great emotional intensity with which it is written. For these two reasons and the very nature of the work, it certainly merits a 5 star rating. However, my primary criticism is that I was discomforted with an underlying feeling of insincerity when I read the words Wilde wrote to Douglas. I do believe that the circumstances were as Wilde listed, but I did not feel that Wilde was as forgiving as he depicted himself to be, nor made as independent by the time in prison. I wondered if, after his release, he really was able to be happy without all the pleasures and indulgences he had known in life before his sentence; if his compromised social status was honestly no longer of importance to him. The lesson he claimed in humility were repeatedly contradicted with his own claim to genius and superiority. And though he claimed to have always wanted out of his involvement with Douglas (and I beleive he did) and that he had now found the strength to resist him, I felt quite certain that he wanted nothing more than Douglas' return to him. All of this aside, however, the letter still makes for an interesting study in the human emotion under almost inhumane conditions and should be read for such. Whether his feelings were authentic and carried on into his life, likewise contribute to the intrigue of the expressions. He wrote what he surely believed to be true at the time and that alone is worth the time spent reading it."},{"Title":"De profundis","review":"This is quite possibly one of the most profound pieces of literature ever written. It is, for those of you who do not know, a letter written from prison to Alfred Douglas. It is all about suffering and how in the end we can but love, like Antigone in Sophocles' play Wilde 'must love not hate'. This really does deserve to be more widely read - very few people I know had heard of it."},{"Title":"De profundis","review":"De Profundis is truly Oscar Wilde's best work. Written as a letter to Bosie, it contains his thoughts on his past life, his trial, and his future; it is full of intense emotion. If you are really interested in Wilde and his life, read De Profundis, it gives you a complete understanding of the metamorphosis he underwent while in Reading."},{"Title":"De profundis","review":"One of the most famous - and infamous - letters in all of literature, De Profundis is a strange little piece of work: either much more than it appears on the surface, or much less. It is something I think everyone should read, if only for its insight into the human character, particularly that of one under great personal suffering. Wilde wrote this extraordinarily long letter from prison to Lord Alfred Douglas, his friend, lover, and the man who - by all accounts - was the reason Wilde was in jail in the first place. Despite repeated assertions in the first few pages alone to the contrary, Wilde seems reluctant to blame himself. He clearly blames Douglas to the hilt, and harbors a certain bitter resentment towards him. And yet... he clearly still hold much dear affection toward - and even loves - Douglas. He still seems to be asking for forgiveness - despite the fact that, by all accounts hardly excluding his own, he was the man wronged. It is quite clear from reading this letter that, desite the view history holds of him, Wilde was clearly a man of very high moral character. Certainly, one would not put Wilde atop a pedastal as the zenith of ethics - he himself says that morals contain \\"absolutely nothing\\" for him, and clearly admits - and is proud of - his having lived the high life to the hilt during his youth - but Wilde was a man of principles, and he stuck to those principles to the tragic, bitter end. Perhaps you might say he carried them too far. One gets the sense in reading this letter - or a biography of Wilde - that, not only could he have stopped his immiment imprisonment, but could have severed his ties with Douglas completely - had he wanted to. Apparently, he had his own utterly compelling reasons for not doing so. Whatever the case, Oscar Wilde is one of the most fundamentally and perpetually interesting characters in the whole of history. A self-described man of paradoxes - Wilde was subsequently the true essence of his time, while also being far ahead of his time - De Profundis makes for required reading by one of the most endlessly fascinating individuals you'll ever read about, and also provides a startling - indeed, perhaps too much so - insight into human nature.De Profundis, though long for a letter, is not a long work in the conventional sense. Consequently, as many editions of Wilde's collected works are available, buying this on its own may be deemed questionable. I highly reccommend purchasing a Collected Works of Oscar if you have not done so already - it's well worth the price - but, should you desire to have more compact editions of specific works, an edition such as this will be privy to your needs."},{"Title":"De profundis","review":"However pretty this edition of Wilde's long letter to Bosie from prison may be, it is unfortunately a truncated half-text (popular in the first half of the 20th century no doubt because of legal and literary sensitivities towards Bosie [who survived Wilde by more than 40 years] and the Douglas family); but, that past, I assure you, the full text is the necessary read -- and may be found in a pricier Penguin edition. This is not a letter for a collector of epigrams and opens not with the abridged \\"Suffering is one long moment\\" paragraph but rather with the far more poignant appeal of a man wounded by and starved for the company and the society he in large part created -- \\"After long and fruitless waiting\\" -- and he wants to hear from Bosie (and never will).I have read this letter a dozen times -- each reading leaves me, like Coleridge's Mariner, a wiser and a sadder man the following morn."},{"Title":"De profundis","review":"Written as a letter to Bosie, De Profundis shows an author at the peak of his powers, yet tragically already fallen. Anger, disgust, revulsion, joy, reflection - in many ways a total separation from the glib and cocky literature that made him famous - the full gamut of a humbled man. Even missing the cheeky humor and quick turn of phrase there is still a solid thread of consistency entombed in De Profundis, that of salvation. From the grace evident in his fairy tales to the recognition of inner justice in Dorian Gray, Wilde flirted with the themes of the Divine and of sacrifice. This is one of the finest, and most powerful, personal essays ever committed to paper. No collection, or indeed beginnings of understanding, of Wilde can possibly be complete without it."},{"Title":"De profundis","review":"The version included for the kindle is the 1905 publication - it is very incomplete and brutally edited. If you wish to read this piece, I would recommend making sure you have an edition from after the original manuscripts were released in 2000."},{"Title":"De profundis","review":"This is a very moving account of a heartbroken man who was betrayed by a person he loved dearly. The pain, the trauma, the love, the anger, the frustration is evident in every single well-written sentence.

It is also a timeless lesson on what can happen when one falls in love with someone who doesn't truly appreciate what they have before them. Of course there are other lessons to be learned in this book but rather than point them out here, I'd much prefer you pick up a copy of \\"De Profundis\\" as soon as you can."},{"Title":"De profundis","review":"The best and the saddest book by Oscar Wilde.

It rings true to me, and is very, very moving and &quot;profound.&quot; It ain't summer beach reading.Wilde is still and will probably always be best known as a &quot;Personality&quot;--that and the author of a couple of decent period plays, a short novel, a few stories, and lots of forgettable poems and such.

This was my first major attempt at reading it, and I read it on the free kindle version that I am writing this review on (knowing Amazon it might pop up elsewhere). I found the dictionary on the kindle very helpful in both looking up words and checking people and references I didn't recognize.The kindle version reads very well with none of the weird formatting that sometimes afflicts books you pay for. But this is the expurgated version (you have to pay for the unexpurgated) so most of the personal things are not in this particular edition. Names are starred out and personal references are obscured.I don't know if the unexpurgated version offers hidden depths that this version doesn't have or if it muddies things (based on some of these reviews, I suspect the latter) but as an FYI - the free version is expurgated."},{"Title":"De profundis","review":"This is the kindle version of Project Gutenberg's text and therefore free for anyone to read.

Only after they suffer The Crash. After that, a few of them might become familiar with the legacy of Alice Miller...I am so surprised. Fifteen years ago I read Oscar Wilde's most profound, confessional book. But like the rest of mankind I was blind and did not see the obvious. Today I reread my notes of a 1943 Spanish translation of De Profundis and couldn't believe how much I have changed since 1995.I discovered Alice Miller in 2002. Her books changed my life. These days I reread a newer, albeit identical copy of De Profundis that was at my family's library and a whole new Wildean universe emerged. How could I have read Wilde in the dark before the transforming experience that represented Miller?The real title that Wilde chose for this letter-book was Epistola in Carcere et Vinculis. It is a shame that, although Wilde constantly mentions in this epistle to his former boyfriend Alfred Douglas, \\"Bosie\\", that he would soon make it reach Bosie's very hands, Wilde never dared to deliver De Profundis to him.Wilde's De Profundis is actually two books inside one cover: an accusative and self-accusative epistle and a soul-searching incursion unrelated to Bosie, where Wilde writes page upon page about \\"Christ\\". All of this idealization of Jesus only reflects Wilde's literary and artistic mind, who always strove to look for beauty. But there's something real in his spiritual quest. Unlike the Greek gods the new religion includes pain, the key to open the door to know oneself. It's pain what made Wilde's soul to flower at prison. Wilde met deep pain doing hard labor: it was there where he had to go though the agonies of losing the right to see his children forever (Wilde also lost his personal library; and felt like a zoo animal when exposed, with his prison uniform, at a train station before a laughing crowd). When I hit Wilde's phrase \\"And to mock at a soul in pain is a dreadful thing\\" I couldn't help but remember how, when I was still a minor and lost everything--my family, my career and even my mind--, a high school pseudo-friend mocked at me.What struck me the most in this second, mature reading of De Profundis is that through his turbulent conflict with Bosie Wilde behaved like a pathetic dumb. While Wilde fully acknowledges the dumbness, he fails to confess that the reason for extreme dumbness is Eros, or rather, a sort of pathological Eros. Sex is the giant piece missing in the puzzle in De Profundis.More serious is that Wilde never developed a good amount of hatred. He lived under the sky of regarding as highly sinful the legitimate feelings of hatred. Hence he could never really break away from Bosie, not even after he was released from prison!Thanks to Miller, I realized that hate, not acting-out hatred but legit hate, is the way out of unhealthy relationships and entanglements. Susan Forward has also written books about the legit hatred we must feel toward our abusive parents before being capable of breaking away from a hellish relationship with our partner. Let me quote the words of Andreas Wirs&eacute;n, a Swede lover of literature whose life also was transfigured by Miller:\\"That the author is secretly smuggling out and reworking, often lying about and numbing, their abusive emotional childhood is something Alice Miller tends to imply when dealing with works of art, a mode of thinking we as her readers easily slip into, isn't it? That Kafka's work is basically explainable as artistic dramatization of a child's insecurity about his parents true agenda, that the vampiric women of Baudelaire's poems are in fact his emotionally unavailable and seductive mother... --this is still the only opening to Baudelaire's work I can stand, the only way in which I can read his work with interest. In this way, artistic work after Alice Miller demands a new openness and consciousness in the producer. We can't only chew and chew the unworked-through emotions from our childhood and find creative ways of repackaging them, then call it Art. It's a new game now.\\" (end of Wirs&eacute;n quote)Of course, Wilde lived before Miller was born. Following Miller I surmise that Wilde must have had an abusive childhood. It's the only way to explain why he allowed to be treated so grotesquely bad by his destructive pseudo-ephebe lover (\\"pseudoephebe\\" I say since Bosie was no longer an adolescent when he met Wilde).In a mere book-review I cannot introduce the revolutionary psychological views of Miller. I devoted the third book of my unpublished Hojas Susurrantes series to it. Here I am writing for those who have already read, and assimilated, Miller. Miller readers will readily understand why Wilde's very repetitive phrase in De Profundis \\"your noble father\\" only reflects that Wilde was immersed in poisonous pedagogy.Bosie never had what Miller calls an \\"enlightened witness\\", although he seems to have looked very hard for it in the fatherly person of Wilde. I cannot blame Wilde because very few souls, if any, had an enlightened witness in 19th century England. Had Wilde been Bosie's witness, he would have recommended him to write a long, vindictive letter to his abusive father, just what Kafka would do in 1919 (what Sue Forward recommends to her psychotherapy clients). But throughout De Profundis it is clear that both Wilde and Bosie were absolutely clueless about the nature of the problem. Wilde even reproaches Bosie for trying to expose publicly the abusive behavior of Bosie's father, the Marquess of Queensberry.Wilde himself never had an enlightened witness. In fact, his death was virtually a suicide since, once released from prison, Wilde drank a lot, including absinthe, and died prematurely at forty-six.Likewise, Bosie never found an enlightened witness. In fact, after Wilde died Bosie married and abused his only child, Raymond, so badly that he schizophrenized him. I find it scandalous that psychotherapist Daniel Mackler claims having assimilated Miller and, at the same time, he buries his head deep into the sand as to the schizophrenogenic-parent theory, as I rebuke him in a YouTube video. Coward or pseudo-readers of Miller aside, it's remarkable to what extent deep psychology has advanced since Wilde's De Profundis written in 1897 and Miller's most comprehensive book, Breaking Down the Wall of Silence, published a hundred years later, in 1997.Unlike Andreas Wirs&eacute;n, I am no lover of literature. However, I loved those splendid passages in De Profundis that reminded me Solzhenitsyn's chapter \\"The Soul and the Barbed Wire\\" in his immortal Gulag. Wilde's De Profundis is probably the best in-depth, soul-surfing text that could be written by the end of the 19th century. But there's no question that we need a 21st century writer that advances the Miller paradigm further; for instance, by analyzing the great figures in literature under \\"the new game\\" that Wirs&eacute;n talks about above.At the end of the unabridged De Profundis (the available texts I've seen in the net are censored) Wilde blew up everything by writing to the very one who ruined his life in conciliatory terms, and even suggesting he would met Bosie after leaving prison! Again, the fundamental sin of pre-Millerian humans is the prohibition to hate, say, as I openly hate Teresa.Final note about my first reading of De Profundis:Yesterday I read my 1995 handwritten notes within my old copy. I wrote those notes seven years before my inner transformation took place.It does not cease to strike me my former blindness in psychologicis. During my first reading of De Profundis I didn't see anything of what is crystal-clear to me by now. Fifteen years ago I almost blamed myself, following Wilde's own words, for my former hatred toward those who destroyed my life during my teens. Following Wilde, I also blamed myself for the many soliloquies I had had in my vain efforts to process the pain.Now I know that due processing of the pain can only come with the advent of a true enlightened witness, or, alternatively, when we find that witness after doing an emotional contact with our inner child. This happened to me after reading Miller: a witness that neither poor Wilde nor poor Bosie had."},{"Title":"De profundis","review":"I purchased this item for school and when it came in the mail, I knew I was going to have problems.

Oh,come now. Blinded by Eros, reason flies out thedoor...if ever reason was in control.

Never having met the young man, butonly having the \\"benefit\\" of hearsay (mostly fromOscar's literary defenders) Lord Alfred seems to havebeen calculating, temperamental (using anger to gethis way), manipulative, etc., etc., etc. The bestdescription of him may be Wilde's referring to himwith the lines from Aeschylus' play AGAMEMNON,about the lion cub being raised in a house andbeing let loose to wreak havoc and ruin.But Oscar bears his share of blame -- more than justthat of the \\"sin\\" of weakness which he constantly fallsback upon in his own justification. Even in the midstof what purports to be some sort of penitent cry fromthe depths of hell...Oscar still is ever the poseur:\\"And I remember that afternoon, as I was in the railwaycarriage whirling up to Paris, thinking what an impossible,terrible, utterly wrong state my life had got into, whenI, a man of world-wide reputation, was actually forcedto run away from England, in order to try and get ridof a friendship that was entirely destructive of everythingfine in me either from the intellectual or ethical pointof view....\\" Er, when was the last time that the\\"everything fine\\" had last seen the light of day?Was Oscar an \\"Artist,\\" as he consistently claims?Was he the wronged, harmed Artist? Perhaps only thereader can decide that for himself.

That these ideas can take a full lifetime to explore make this a classical book on the subject.A truly masterful achievement, as this book has synthesized for me what has taken great lengths to learn from multiple sources and has also introduced many abstract concepts into terms that a non-Zen practicing Budoka can understand. Unlike many other books approaching this subject, you need not become a \\"Japanophile\\" or create a super-ego to relate.This book is naturally compatible with genuine materials on the martial mindset from Tukuan Soho, Miyamoto Musashi and Morihei Ueshiba, true masters who also wrote short but deeply meaningful books on the subject of martial practice. So this book becomes an organic extension of these other masterpieces: The book of 5 rings (Musashi Miyamoto), The Unfettered Mind (Tukuan Soho) and The Art of Peace (Ueshiba). All highly recommended.The martial mindset has nothing to do with sports-minded competition. Modern \\"martial arts\\" are most of the time a form of sanctioned violence taught to self-appointed vigilante's. When such idiots confront a situation where emotional breakdowns occur due to overwhelming odds or unfamiliar setups, the results are enlightenment the hard way!The distinction evident from this book is the understanding that when the practice of martial art encompasses a realistic acceptance of life or death with a conditioned acceptance of death through the practice of zen, true courage becomes possible.Other concepts elaborated are the elusive subject of ki and the practical method of practicing zen as it relates to breathing. In this respect, the master Deshimaru ties the tradition of zen to the Buddhist and Hindu practice of Vipassana meditation as it relates to enlightenment. However, whereas the typical descriptions focus on the metaphysical, this book spares you the mystical nonesense and through a simple experiment of following clear directions, the concepts become very real for the reader.This book is an excellent accompanying text to any internal martial arts practice as it does not condone a passive acceptance of ideas or practices, but rather encourages the reader to ascend to a higher calling through worthy reflection, genuine rigorous practice and acceptance of inherent truths about the nature of leadership, combat, life, death and worldliness. The material has great reverance for tradition in terms of principle, not ritual. A must have for the modern budoka seeking a mature approach to Martial Arts."},{"Title":"The Zen Way to Martial Arts: A Japanese Master Reveals the Secrets of the Samurai (Compass)","review":"This book gives the reader some nice mind-training and why the mind, body and spirit has to work together to reach perfection within the martial arts and the way of Zen."},{"Title":"The Zen Way to Martial Arts: A Japanese Master Reveals the Secrets of the Samurai (Compass)","review":"This is the THE BOOK for anyone interested in Zen.

How the author accomplished that is beyond me...but it is undeniable proof that he is a true master and that whatever he is doing works. See what I mean?Now, I don't know much about Martial Arts, per se, and this book doesn't teach you diddly about any specific one. In fact, the title is misleading I believe...or maybe not misleading, but I honestly think that it is keeping a great number of readers away from it, which is unfortunate.So what I'm saying is: don't buy this to learn Karate. Buy this to live life. To do anything.Every human being on Earth should read this book.Zen is life itself...every breath, every step, and yes.....each one could be your last.

Besides the actual physical hands-on training under many martial art masters, my study also included countless books on the relationship between the mind and body. This book, The Zen Way to the Martial arts, was one of the many in my personal collection on the philosophical and psychological aspects of the martial arts. The approach in this book is to cover various Budo topics in a clear and uncomplicated manner so anyone can easily understand the material.The topics covered includes the following: \\"Bushido: the way of the Samurai.\\" This section expains what strength and wisdom mean in the study of the martial arts and Zen It also gives an overview of the seven principles and three stages of learning the secrets of Budo and the Secrets of Zen. It also deals with directing the mind, KI: energy, what is the practice of Zen, the mind and body as one, unmoving wisdom, life and death and instruction of a Samurai.In conclusion, anyone who is a serious student of the martial arts and Asian Budo principles will benefit from reading this book.Rating: 4 Stars.

Unfortunately, he says, the real spirit is going away even in Japan, let alone in the West. He shares some nice stories - he has a preference for cats, it seems :). Cultivating the mind through zazen practice is at least as important as practicing a martial art!These being said, these book is not a practical manual - they are questions and answers from a public event in 1975 - probably Taisen Deshimaru has written better suited for that pupose.

Other statements, like the last one quoted above, probably do not stem from deep personal knowledge and experience. Specifically about Tai Chi, while not being a practitioner myself I am at least humble enough not to make such broad accusations. Maybe such a claim is true for many practitioners or so called masters of Tai Chi, but I know both the head of my Karate style (Okinawan, 10th Dan, and a zen practitioner for many years) and direct Sensei (Japanese, 6th Dan) hold some martial artists who are also Tai Chi masters in high regards.I think the two main problems with the book for people like me (i.e. martial artists who want to expend knowledge of the art and the interconnections between it, zen, the everyday life, and growing as a person) are (a) that the book was not carefully edited and (b) that the writer, which makes a lot of very specific statements about martial arts, is *not* a master in martial arts but a Zen master. According to the details given in the book it appears Zen master TD himself definitely had a personal background in martial arts (specifically \\"old style\\" Judo) and long time connections with highly ranked martial artists, but that is not the same. Thus, I found some Zen terminology new to me, and the discussion about it and its connection to martial arts informative, but I would suggest taking statements and \\"facts\\" regarding martial arts (like the ones quoted above) with a grain of salt.

Thus, a translator (teacher, student, traveler) encounters many pitfalls when navigating the terrain of idiomatic language. Such &quot;faux pas&quot; (lit., &quot;false steps&quot;) may prove to be embarrassing, at the least. &quot;NTC's Dictionary of French Faux Pas&quot; sets out to eliminate blunders from translations and speech as the barriers are broached between English and French.This dictionary is organized alphabetically: words in English form the left column on each page and their equivalencies in French form the right column on the same page. The main English word and phrase headings are in boldface; the subheadings of related English words and phrases and their facing translations in French are in small regular typeface. While a bit hard on the eyes, nonetheless, this arrangement is very handy for memorization purposes; one needs merely to hold one's palm over one side of the page and then recite the translations.Interspersed throughout the dictionary are flagged &quot;faux amis&quot; (lit., &quot;false friends&quot;). These &quot;faux amis&quot; are arranged alphabetically, thus somewhat disrupting the two-column arrangement. These words present special pitfalls in that they &quot;. . . may look similar in French and English but have totally different meanings. For example, &quot;la monnaie&quot; means change and not &quot;money&quot; &quot; (iii). Other examples are: &quot;partir&quot; (&quot;to depart&quot;), &quot;lecture&quot; [f] (&quot;reading&quot;), &quot;fabrique&quot; [f] (&quot;factory&quot;), and &quot;&eacute;ventuellement&quot; (&quot;possibly&quot;). [&quot;Possiblement&quot; is not French.] I would like this dictionary more if there were also a glossary of these &quot;faux amis&quot; because the misuse of these words is particularly egregious in translation and speech. Another useful feature that is not present in this dictionary would be an index of the French words and phrases with page numbers for their English equivalencies.Overall, &quot;NTC's Dictionary of French Faux Pas&quot; is a very good supplement to standard French-English/English-French desk dictionaries, such as &quot;The Oxford-Hachette French Dictionary&quot; (2nd ed.), &quot;Harrap's Shorter French Dictionary,&quot; &quot;HarperCollins Robert French Unabridged Dictionary&quot; (5th ed.) and &quot;Larousse French-English English-French Dictionary&quot; [Unabridged].

There weren't too many things going on all at once and the book was focused on Caroline's family. It made me feel sad when they decided to move away and very excited when the parade and circus came to town. I recommend this book to girls who like the little house books."},{"Title":"Little Town at the Crossroads (Little House)","review":"turn back the time and enter into a world of long ago and see how people survied in day of old i have all th books that are out there so far and all of my grand children are taking turns reading my books its a nice way to spend time together"},{"Title":"Little Town at the Crossroads (Little House)","review":"In this book, Brookfield grows into a regular town.

I find all the characters in the Quiner family cute and enjoyable expect for the oldest sister, Martha.I also admired Caroline's mother's strength as he strives to run her family after her husband's tragic death. Her detirmination, her never ending courage and love really make me fond her and her entire family, particulary at he end of the book when they learn they are going to have to move from their home.

His ability to vividly portray the life that he and The Top Hand and later Mrs. Hobson had in the interior of British Columbia is to have been there. It is hard in today's comfortable way of life to envision the situations and dangers that were simply a part of how it was back then. Having grown up in the mountains of the U.S. West, I can only marvel at the abilities of these adventuresome pioneers in the cattle country of B.C. To have met Rich Hobson was of great interest to me... I simply waited too long and he had passed away. The travels and travails through Hobson's life would make an awsome story for a movie. Note: Make sure you read the three books in sequence... and enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Rancher Takes a Wife","review":"This is a more orderly, \\"together\\" book than the middle one in the series - Grass Beyond the Mountains was excellent; the book in the middle was... spotty and inconsistent; and The Rancher Takes a Wife returns to the neat, sensible storyline, though not meeting the standards of the first book. I've found it hard to \\"know\\" the characters, and really wonder what happened to all the people in the first book, of whom few words are devoted. The characters after the first book are seen through a haze... I wonder if that's due to the passage of so much time before he started to write."},{"Title":"The Rancher Takes a Wife","review":"enjoyed this book very much. read 50 plus years ago when I was in high school. was happy to find it on Amazon"},{"Title":"The Rancher Takes a Wife","review":"An amazing story-a continuation of the previous books.

Linda Wagner-Martin. New Brunswick: Rutgers UP, 1994. 169 p.Those of you who loved Carolyn Heilbrun's Writing a Woman's Life, will find that Linda Wagner-Martin's Telling Women's Lives picks up where Heilbrun left off. Wagner-Martin describes how male writers of women's lives tend to limit their discussion to stereotypic roles like motherhood or homemaking. They neglect developmental events that women see as crucial and show their subject only in relation to the men in their lives, as though their associations with women were not vital. James Joyce's wife, Nora, was castigated by male critics as low class, uneducated, a poor cook (!), and a rampant sensualist. She was in reality educated, of equal class with her common-law husband, competant, and an independant spirit who inspired a lasting devotion in Joyce. Wagner-Martin also describes successful stories of women by women and points the way toward new trends in woman's biography, including several recommendations to direct one's reading. A valuable book for writers and readers of women's lives."},{"Title":"The International Library Of Piano Music (6)","review":"This is a wonderful set of volumes that has just about every piece of music ever written from Haydn and Vivaldi to Ravel and Copland! I like it because it is so wonderful becuase you don't have to search around from the sheet music, you can just look in the index and find the piece that you are looking for and the just play away! A wonderful set that teachers can use for teaching the music of every period like Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and 20th Century Music! This is also a wonderful set for aspiring music educators!"},{"Title":"The International Library Of Piano Music (6)","review":"I, personally having purchased this wondrful set of volumes of piano music and a music student of 17 years, belive this to be one of the finest collections of piano music ever assembled.

A must have for anyone who truly apreciated great piano literature and music."},{"Title":"The International Library Of Piano Music (6)","review":"An excellent collection of piano works.

But just the same, they are a terrific set of books."},{"Title":"The International Library Of Piano Music (6)","review":"My parents bought this set for me when I was getting serious about piano as a freshman in high school. I used it all through high school, through a bachelor's degree in Music Education, a Master's in Vocal Performance, and through a few hours toward a Doctorate in Choral Conducting. Continued use as a piano teacher. The best investment my parents ever made in me and I am now 67 years old and still take it to the piano from time to time."},{"Title":"The International Library Of Piano Music (6)","review":"Motor City Books offered a 16 Volume Library of Piano Music, but only had one book in stock out of the set that they mailed me.

They were, however, kind about refunding me the $100 they charged for one book!!"},{"Title":"The International Library Of Piano Music (6)","review":"I inherited this collection (15 volumes)40 years ago and have carried it with me throughout my moves (to Europe and back).

But make sure it's the entire collection that you are getting (the label \\"International Library of piano music\\" is the title used, regardless of the numbers that are actually being sold to you)."},{"Title":"The International Library Of Piano Music (6)","review":"When I was a young piano student, I received a 12-volume set of the 1945 International Library of Music. I eventually earned a BA in music then slowly drifted away from music into graduate business school and then many, many years in the world of finance. I am now nearing retirement and recently purchased a piano, returning to the instrument after an absence of nearly 35 years. Pulling out the International Library of Music was like returning to an old friend. The volumes are organized by level of difficulty and I'm finding the early volumes exceptionally useful for sight reading. In total, it is a fabulous collection of classical piano music with representative repertiore available across a range of composers from Bach to Debussy. Later editions may have strayed a bit further into the 20th century - although my 1945 edition does not. I would recommend this selection for both beginning and advanced players."},{"Title":"The International Library Of Piano Music (6)","review":"My parents purchased this excellent music library for me when I was a piano student in high school.

Great images though"},{"Title":"Tender Mercy for a Mother's Soul","review":"Call it what you will. I call it Divine Providence. God has spoken to my aching, empty soul through the work of Angela Thomas Guffey. He brought this book into my home and changed my course with the first three chapters and is carrying me home with the last. I cannot wait to read it again.As a mother of four children age five and under, I find myself not only physically exhausted but mentally, emotionally and spiritually exhausted as well. Who could understand how I feel? Who could provide a reason why other than, &quot;your a mom of four small children; you should be exhausted&quot;?Angela has more-than-described the longings of my heart through her own life experiences. In fact, she has answered my question as to why I am so exhausted---my soul is empty. My soul is longing, and it has been left to fend for itself for too long. In the midst of being a mom, the most important job in the world, I have neglected to care for my soul.Tender Mercy for a Mother's Soul provides insight and reason into the importance of a mother taking time to care for her soul so that she can go about the most important work that God has for her--the care of her children. Angela has a gift from God. She is using her passion to reach out to women just like me and just like you who need these words of comfort and strength.More than just comforting or encouraging words, though, Angela provides a creative path back to the Father through her personal journey and through powerful Scripture. She offers suggestions as to how each mom can create her own personal time with God, amidst the chaos of childrearing, and bring her cup to the Lord so that she would be filled to overflowing, and, to quote her, &quot;sloshing out Jesus everywhere.&quot;Read this book. Keep it to read again and again, and get one for your best friend. You will laugh. You will cry. You WILL relate. Fill your dry, empty cup; renew your passion; send your children into the world having lived in a home full of God's grace and mercy overflowing from your nutured soul. God has called you."},{"Title":"Tender Mercy for a Mother's Soul","review":"I cannot say enough about this book. I am a stay at home mom of 3 under 5 and managed to read this in a weekend! I felt like the author came over for coffee and stayed a while. What a blessing. My book club just finished discussing it and it is a favorite for each of us. I mailed a copy to five other friends. If you are in the midst of motherhood, please do your soul a favor and read this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Tender Mercy for a Mother's Soul","review":"This book was a long, warm hug for my soul. Guffey's honesty and warmth made me feel as though I was conversing with a close friend. She knows firsthand the demands of being a Mom and also knows the necessity of Moms taking time to soothe their spirits and nurture their relationship with God. It is beautifully written and in a format that can be read in those 10 minute pockets of time mothers live in. Tender Mercy for a Mother's Soul will encourage and uplift all mothers. It is a must read for mothers with children at home."},{"Title":"Tender Mercy for a Mother's Soul","review":"Angela Guffey spoke directly to me in a gentle but truthful way. What a wonderful reminder to me that to be the best wife and mom I can be, I need to tend to my soul and the growth of it. This book renewed not only my passion for mothering but also my passion for ministering to others as Ms. Guffey has ministered to me through this writing. The style is easy to read for us mom's who are catching a bit during kids naps or late at night, but the content of simply one page gives me enought to think about for an entire day! I can't wait to read it again!"},{"Title":"Tender Mercy for a Mother's Soul","review":"I can relate to this book.

I buy it for all the new moms I know."},{"Title":"Tender Mercy for a Mother's Soul","review":"I loved this book! As a busy mom who still wants to cultivate my spiritual life and become more intimate with Jesus, I drank up Guffey's lyrical prose. She is a talented writer with a transparent heart.

This novel is a must for fans."},{"Title":"Political Russian: An Intermediate Course in Russian Language for International Relations, National Security and Socio-Economics (Second Edition)","review":"Rarely do you find a book that is EXACTLY what you're looking for and EXACTLY what it claims to be. This is a superb book for intermediate Russian students who want to focus their study on Politics and International Relations. I treasure this book."},{"Title":"Political Russian: An Intermediate Course in Russian Language for International Relations, National Security and Socio-Economics (Second Edition)","review":"This is an excellent textbook. Assuming you are already at the intermediate level, it provides a solid grammar review that utilizes vocabulary relevant to political topics. The vocab and grammar build through the book, and the exercises reinforce both. The texts are actual articles, unedited, but picked so that they highlight the grammar and vocab for that lesson. The book is broken into intermediate and advanced levels that proceed concurrently (i.e. - each addresses the same topic at the same time, just in different depths). If you are already pretty strong (or have a lot of time on your hands) you can do both at once. If you are still a little weak, you can just do one, saving the second for later.The only problems I found were the following:The layout is sometimes confusing, particularly in the vocabulary sections, which are poorly formatted. Additionally, there appears to be no index, making it hard to find prior topics if you can't remember where they were located. Finally, the audio portions are now only available on-line. If you are going to be using the book in a place with poor internet service, you should download the files before you leave.Other than those minor issues, this is a solid book that is worth every penny."},{"Title":"Political Russian: An Intermediate Course in Russian Language for International Relations, National Security and Socio-Economics (Second Edition)","review":"I love this book.

Kurkela, an adult, wonderfully and uniquely enhanced with the illustrations of his preschool daughter Cassidy. Lilies On The Moon is a collection of poetry as highly recommended for parents as it is for children. Bugs: Bugs abound in bed/Bugs are in my head/I shall not sleep then,/I'll stay up late again.//Mom and Dad show dismay/They've had a long day/They haven't any smiles/I'll make them stay awhile.//They won't watch the time/As I talk and I rhyme/Soon they'll laugh with me/In nighttime harmony.//Bugs about in bed/So I've already said/They don't stop biting/Until I stop writing."},{"Title":"Lilies On The Moon","review":"The author visited our school today in Sparta, N.J.

Robert's poems are delightfully written from a child's point of view and with a wonderful spirit of play. Cassidy's sprightly colored handpainting matches each one perfectly. They actually brought back many fond memories, which warmed my heart and kept me smiling from beginning to end. I also found it a great way to introduce my grandchildren to poetry and it is easy enough for them to read too!"},{"Title":"Lilies On The Moon","review":"I just received a copy of this wonderful book. Our 20 month old daughter (who rarely sits still for anything), sat completely engaged as I read her poem after poem until we had completed the book. \\"Lillies\\" has instantly made it to the top of her list (and mine)! It truly is a fantastic piece of work by a gifted poet."},{"Title":"A New Way to Cook","review":"Just perfect. If I were to buy a cookbook for ANYONE -- from a college student to a precocious kid to my quasi-pro culinary queen stepmom -- this would be it.How many combinations of ingredients are there, really, especially in the realm of layperson cooking? Not many, it would seem from the popular recipe sites and mags -- but this book comes up with some stunning new combos. What first caught my eye: cauliflower, raisin, pine nut pasta. I don't even care for pasta, but how could one not try out such a stellar new blend of flavors? Similarly ingenious, unusual pairings fill this hefty book. I'm really impressed.At first the format seemed strange to me, but now I adore it. Each chapter (\\"Legumes,\\" \\"Pasta,\\" etc.) begins with a page listing the recipes to follow (which are named usefully and descriptively -- not \\"Sally's Star Seashells\\" or something equally obfuscatory). At first I found this cluttered and unnecessary -- why add this extra busy page when there's a lovely full index and a great table of contents? -- but now I rely on it. Not sure what to make with that 5-lb. sack of lentils? Just flip to the Legume chapter's summary page and skim the recipes for ideas. For my style of cooking, in which I love recipes for ideas but abhor actually following them, this is bliss.Finally, the in-depth sections in the preface about the philosophy of healthy cooking are *gasp* not preachy and, beyond that, actually invaluable. I cook healthy food my way, so have a high-falutin sense of how to cut out fats and so on; but dear Ms. Schneider taught me (even *me*? oh humbling) a thing or two. Like how to sauce pastas lightly yet flavorfully by mixing some of the pasta water into your super-flavorful low-cal ingredients, such as anchovies or soy sauce or even grated cheese; thereby you create a nice thin emulsion to lightly coat your yummy pasta without that gallon of oil for texture and flavor.Ms. Schneider, you have done an immense service to humanity. I'm swept off my feet."},{"Title":"A New Way to Cook","review":"I have many cookbooks but always reach for this one first. It has easy to follow recipes that don't require hours or ingredients that you won't be able to find. It's a real keeper."},{"Title":"A New Way to Cook","review":"If we eat a certain way, why not cook to meet that end? That's about it. This book is not fancy, but it is easy and most of all very practical. It gives cooking a thoughtful and simple perspective. I enjoy thumbing through this book and making plans on what I will try next."},{"Title":"A New Way to Cook","review":"Sally Schneider has super ideas to enhance the flavors of common foods. She uses the makings of intense flavors, made in advance,for cooking. There are new techniques to add variety to your meals. Like Julia Child, there are many details about what to expect as you go along and tips about your own development of recipes. I have cooked for over 50 years and learned many useful ideas from Sally!"},{"Title":"A New Way to Cook","review":"This is the greatest cookbook ever. I read this cookbook cover to cover only to go back and read it again. I love the flexibility and variances of her recipes. I love how she tells the reader about where the recipes came from. This cookbook provides the flexibility to follow a recipe ingredient by ingredient or to adapt it for your tastes or simply for variety. The brown butter and sage artichokes are simply to die for. The variety allows for thousands of recipes.

It goes through many many different aspects of cooking: tools, appliances, spices, rubs, marinades, sauces, meats, veggies...and many other topics. Scheinder doesn't just tell readers about these things she teaches. She talks about whys, hows, and the reasons behind things. This is a good book for people who really want to learn all about cooking. Unlike other cookbooks that just tell you recipes this book will teach readers to make their own recipes and how to cook. I love this book; when it came I sat down and read it like a novel.Keep in mind, this is not a traditional cookbook. If you are looking for recipes this is not the book for you. If you want to learn how to cook and how to do things yourself, this it the book for you."},{"Title":"A New Way to Cook","review":"this book has been a very helpful tool to guide my family to better eating without making life too difficult. The recipes are easy and there is a lot of helpful advice."},{"Title":"A New Way to Cook","review":"I got a copy of this cookbook for Christmas and then bought 2 copies for gifts. If you are in a rut with meals, this is a great way to add some interest to meal prep. The recipes are easy to follow and usually have substitutions for ingredients to allow for taste and what you may have on hand. This has become the first cookbook I check when I want to make something new. Maybe I shouldn't call it just a cookbook because there are ideas on tools and methods included also."},{"Title":"A New Way to Cook","review":"Author Sally Schneider&quot;s latest cookbook, &quot;A New Way To Cook,&quot; might be more appropriately titled &quot;A New Way To Live.&quot; A recipient of two previous James Beard Awards, one for her 1991 &quot;The Art of Low-Calorie Cooking&quot; she is destined to earn a third for her newest release.As a young chef, cooking and traveling throughout the world, Schneider inevitably had to face what all who are passionate about cooking and eating face at some point - weight gain, food allergies and fluctuating blood sugar. She studied nutrition, special diets, and other regimens but came away frustrated by their lack of sensual beauty, taste, texture and well being, which she desired in her cooking and eating. Ten years of research have resulted in this monumental work that could revolutionize the way we cook. Convinced that a diet based on self denial is doomed, she focused instead on cooking techniques based on depth of flavor and lower fat intake. The result is 600 recipes that will get you excited about cooking and eating healthy.&quot;A New Way To Cook&quot; is a serious 739 page textbook that redefines healthy eating, and does away with food taboos. Influenced by the Mediterranean lifestyles of cooking and eating, it is based on core techniques, such as a new way to cook vegetables, a method to stretch the fats used to dress food, dry rubs and marinades, and recipes to make flavored oils and sauces. Your favorite comfort foods are all there, in fact her mashed potato recipe has three pages of variations. Schneider emphasizes basic skills and formulas and then encourages improvisation to keep flexibility and variety. Learn how to make slow roasted tomatoes and then experiment with all the suggestions to utilize them. Find out how to eat pancakes and enjoy the butter without all the guilt! And make room on your bookshelf for this marvelous reference book that will undoubtedly become a classic."},{"Title":"A New Way to Cook","review":"I love this book, and its definitely become one of my bibles, along with How to Cook Everything and (for my pressure cooker) Pressure Perfect. I have a huge collection of cookbooks and I would say that this one falls into the category of creative home cuisine, as opposed to restaurant-based food, ethnic food, or categorized foods (sautes, braises, stews, etc). She has such an interesting and flavor-based approach to cooking that it will be hard to think of food in the same way after you have read a few chapters and attempted a few recipes. The book is designed for people who love to improvise in the kitchen, and its recipes establish the basic building blocks that allow the home cook to pick and choose the ingredients s/he wants to combine. Sally also includes her favorites, for fool-proof results, and recommendations for where to buy some of the more exotic ingredients (after reading her chapter on salads I rushed out and bought a bottle of Vinaigre De Banyuls, a 50 yr old sherry vinegar, and a properly aged balsamic. It makes a huge difference in a salad, and now I know that proper vinegar has as complex a taste as fine wine). Like John Ash's Cooking One on One, this is not a book about convenience or how to use every leftover ingredient in your pantry, but about how to make simple food that is fresh, clean, and tastes great. If its not worth it to you to spend a dollar on a pint of whole milk or cream every once in a while, you won't get your money's worth. But if you want a foundation for flavorful home cooking, this book is fantastic."},{"Title":"A New Way to Cook","review":"While still in our early exploration of this cookbook, it has already become a favorite with my fiancee and me.Sally Schneider brings together the \\"low fat\\" and the \\"good food\\" cooking methods, creating a style which brings the most taste out of suprisingly low fat recipes.She includes both simple recipes and more complex recipes. One of our favorites is the Apple Sage Turkey burgers (they're soooo good: just make alot and freeze some for later!)Sally does have lots of different ingredients such as lemon grass, brown butter, fresh herbs and even black truffles! We love the challenge of finding some of these, which makes cooking the meals all the better!I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a low-fat high flavor cookbook who loves to cook."},{"Title":"A New Way to Cook","review":"I received this book as a Christmas gift and have made main dishes, side dishes, seasonings, accompaniments, and desserts using it.

I've dozens of cookbooks but this is the first lighter cooking one in my collection. What makes me take this one to the kitchen--and to the bed table!--is the myriad flavoring possibilities for, say, olive oil. This book deserves its laurels. It should be on the shelves of 21st century cooks. All of my friends will be receiving a copy."},{"Title":"A New Way to Cook","review":"This isn't about dieting. It's about reinventing the way you put your ingredients together. This is a book for anyone who enjoys cooking and believes in \\"everything in moderation\\".As an avid cookbook collector, this book will keep you coming back to see if it has a recipe to incorporate whatever you brought home from the grocery store. It's jam packed with recipes, with clear and easy to follow instructions. There are 11 variations on common recipes like mashed potatoes alone including \\"basil mashed potatoes\\" and \\"smashed potatoes with crushed black olives\\".The design of the cookbook is one of the best I've seen. Crisp, clear, easy to read. It's inviting and encourages you to stay and browse. Highly recommend and agree with other reviewers who appreciate this book for what it has to offer."},{"Title":"A New Way to Cook","review":"Simply put, this cookbook has recipes that are easy to shop for, easy to cook and tasty to eat. I've tried several recipes so far and each one has been a success. They are not too labor or time intensive. This is a great book for beginners because the author gives variations for many of the recipes. It strikes a nice balance between having many recipes yet not overwhelming with too much information."},{"Title":"A New Way to Cook","review":"i have not yet tested any recipes though i have many i would like to try. the reason i am giving this cookbook a 5 is due to the sheer brilliance of the layout...1.the clear plastic dust cover...no more rips2.this cookbook actually stays open on any given page by itself and given the huge size of this cookbook this is an achievement3.very high quality paper...i spilled some water on the pages and immediately wiped the page-no smearing or rubbing(try that on most cookbooks and the page would have water damage)4.text size and color very easy to read5.good index with cross-referencingfor these reasons alone it is obvious that someone cared a great deal about the quality of this product and it shows. this tells me that they probably didn't drop the ball concerning the quality of the recipes. sorry to go on but my biggest peeve is shoddy cookbooks that were obviously only written to make money and waste perfectly good paper!!! this cookbook does not fall into that category. when i have tested recipes i will update this review."},{"Title":"A New Way to Cook","review":"I love the philosophy behind this book; I always read the introductions to cookbooks and Schneider explains her philosophy of moderation and satisfaction very well.I don't believe that natural fat, animal or vegetable, is the obesity culprit (rather excessive empty carbohydrates combines with too much fat, especially man-made fats, are what'll do you in). So it's lovely to have a cookbook that utilizes a little butter, cream, cheese and healthful oils--and stretches what these delicious substances will do.This book taught me how to cook the most delicious green beans in an emulsion of butter and water--and even if I had never learned another thing from Schneider (I have), this technique alone was worth the entire cost of the book.It is absolutely indispensable in the kitchen of the modern, intelligent cook."},{"Title":"A New Way to Cook","review":"I don't object to any theory that says we should be using real, natural food free of thickeners, emulsifiers, gums and other chemicals, even if they are high in fat or sugar. I believe it's far healthier to eat authentic food in moderation than to substitute engineered, chemical food into our diets. Just look to Europe for evidence that this works -- the Europeans eat good, authentic food that is well-prepared, and because their lifestyles incorporate values like slow eating, portion control and consistent exercise, they don't need things like fake fat or sugar subsitutes in their diet.I bought this cookbook thinking it would be a great way to find some healthy recipes that use real ingredients. I was definitely attracted to the book by its slick modern design and attractive photographs. Unfortunately, the recipes require too much prep, too many hard-to-find ingredients, or cooking skills that are out of my range. I group my cookbooks into two basic categories -- those good for everyday recipes, and those good for weekend recipes, when I have more time to prep the meal and do the cooking. This cookbook is firmly in the &quot;weekend&quot; category, and most of the recipes would probably have to wait for a holiday weekend so I could have extra time to track down the ingredients -- particularly since the author is insistent that only the &quot;purest, freshest&quot; ingredients will do. &quot;Freshest&quot; for me usually means a trip to the grocery store, which is hard to pull off after a full workday and an hour commute home.This is also not a cookbook for the novice. Anyone learning how to cook will be better off with &quot;The Joy of Cooking&quot; or the Betty Crocker Cookbook. There are some advanced cooking techniques required that may be beyond the purview of even cooks who have several years of kitchen experience.There are some great theories in this book that will help cooks make their meals more flavorful and satisfying. The chapters on &quot;flavor catalysts&quot; like dry rubs and broths are excellent. If you can find an inexpensive copy of this book, it's worth reading for those chapters alone.The theory behind the cookbook is great and the design and pictures really make it a joy to read. However, it's probably best used as an armchair cookbook, rather than one that resides in your kitchen. Unless you have an hour-plus each evening to get dinner on the table (and I don't!), there are few recipes in here that can be made in 30 minutes or less on a weekday, and weekdays are when I most need good recipes to help me feed my family. Great concept, execution needs work. Maybe the author could do a revised version focusing on practicality over high-minded ideals."},{"Title":"A New Way to Cook","review":"This book is more of a change of lifestyle book than it is a diet book. The recipes are well written and, so far, every one I have tried has been excellent. There are some really smart, well-conceived methods for reducing fat and calories in each recipe without compromising taste. Schneider makes some very simple suggestions that will change your way of cooking (literally) and thinking without making you feel like you are doing any injustice to your palate. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"A New Way to Cook","review":"This cookbook is absolutely AWESOME. I heard the author on national public radio and just had to own her book. Every single recipe (and there are MANY) is mouth-watering and HEALTHY!!I have recommended this book to every person I know.It really makes for a wonderful gift as well."},{"Title":"A New Way to Cook","review":"I tried the Foolproof Pastry recipe in this book and the dough didn't come together. I did go ahead and use it (it was a topping for a deep dish berry pie). It tasted ok, but I looked at a recipe for pastry provided in a class that I'd taken recently and it was nearly identical BUT it included 1/3 cup of water. I think that that's what's missing from this one."},{"Title":"A New Way to Cook","review":"I picked this up on a whim and haven't tried any of the recipes. It looked so good and it won awards, but every recipe seems so daunting and waay to hard to even try to make. I'll update this if I actually get the nerve to make something. I should have bought the Martha Stewart cooking school like I wanted too."},{"Title":"A New Way to Cook","review":"...regarding buying in food from which perhaps 1-2 tabs may be used.Cream does not come into our house. Low fat milk will have to do. I refuse to buy 5/600ml (pint) quantities when I need only a tablespoon or so. For buttermilk, I use low fat milk with a generous squeeze of lemon juice. I allow them it sit and \\"meld\\" (and make friends) for 30-60 minutes. What were the publishers thinking when they gave the nod to this book?It could *so* easily be adapted into a *really* great and useable cookbook. As a caterer, it frustrates me soooo much to see such good work/talent go to waste or to the \\"bargain bins.\\" There is so much promise in this book but it falls flat on its face. So sad ... such a waste ...Apart from some \\"US\\"/ \\"Canada\\"-*only*-easily available ingredients, the majority of ingredients were largely widely available at my suburban Sydney supermarket(s).I wish the author, who obviously has great talent, and her/his publishers could speak with a few of her audience- the caterers, the Mums and Dads (often caterers, too), the foodies, and the general public who make up that audience of followers (or ...)for a food forum/symposium on \\"what people want AND what they want to eat from cook books.\\"It seems that we constantly are barraged with a plethora of cookbooks. I have thousands (should I be proud or ashamed?). How many do regularly I use (about 5-10). I make up the rest of my recipes from bits and pieces in books. Do any publishers contact us (even in the trade) to ask what we want/ need in a cookbook? I've never been asked.Any publisher with the airfare (Sydney-US-Sydney) is welcome to contact me :-). I will provide as much feedback as you provide hotel rooms, airfares, and test-tastes of US kitchens (have yet to try Chicago!)Bottom Line: This book is not for the average \\"low fat diet\\" family as too much will go to waste (better than \\"waist\\", I guess).It needs a re-write using stocks, water, left-over wine and low-fat milk."},{"Title":"A New Way to Cook","review":"If I had to live with only one cookbook, or were recommending a single volume for any contemporary cook, it would be this. While it does not cover in detail beginning cooking technique such as knife skills, basic cuts, and identification of tools, it provides substantive information and such an intelligent point of view that even a modestly-experienced cook could utilize it. Schneider's approach, not really new to readers familiar with the also wonderful Martha Rose Shulman and Rozanne Gold, among others, is nevertheless a practical way of eating healthy in delicious, sophisticated dishes.Schneider endorses the practice of replacing heavy and often unhealthy fats with herbs and spices. By using wholesome fats judiciously, by highlighting intrinsic flavors, and by using taste rather than slavish adherence to tradition, she presents a mighty range of wonderful recipes. The recipes also turn out fantastically. Her straight forward, first person writing reveals her love of food and is devoid of pretentions. The recipes include informative introductions, exceptionally helpful notes about ingredients, variations and extensions, and guidelines for advance preparation. The book is gorgeous looking, with a beautiful lay out and user-friendly format. The index is complete and detailed, and each section of the book lists its recipes for the convenience of a cook looking for, say, ideas for tonight's soup.The sections of the book include a great Vegetables chapter, Beans/Legumes, a wonderful Pasta chapter, Grains, Seafood, Meat/Poultry, Breads, a fantastic Soups section, Salads, Desserts, Flavor Essences, Broths, Oils, and Sauces. An appendix provides nutritional analyses of the ingredients and each dish (including calories, protein, carbs, fat, fiber, and sodium for dieters.) Large and weighty, the book would make a great gift and addition to any cook's library."},{"Title":"A New Way to Cook","review":"Schneider has spent the time many of us would like to: experiementing with various ingredients and techniques to maintain all the richness of the food we love to cook and eat and write reviews on.She achieves this not so much by abstinence from certain taboo foods or ingredients (e.g. sugar, fat, etc.) but with techniques such as pre-emulsification, glazing, etc.This book is mammoth, over 600 recipes. I look forward to delving more into her approach. What has been attempted to date has delivered what promised: rich food that is healthy: Seared Lamb with Moroccan Spices and Tomato Jam, Country Terrine with Pistachios, Risotto with Red Wine, Rosemary, and Champagne Grapes, Upside-Down Red Wine-Pear Tart, Chocolate Mousee Cake.Broad is the scope of this work, laced with Charts (e.g. one of the best detailed I've seen on rice and grains) and Sections on Rubs and Essences and Marinades. It is exhaustive and well laid out, with pleasing type font that is easy to read and pleasant to the eye. Also covered are techniques, glossary, index, and sources listing.A resource that will be used repeatedly to try out this new flavorful way to cook. Recommended for all levels of cooks."},{"Title":"A New Way to Cook","review":"There have always been 2 different things, when it comes to cookbooks: on the one hand, cookbooks that focus on getting the maximum taste out of food. This usually means cooking rich, high in calories food, that tastes good because of the use of butter, lots of unrefined sugar, cream, etc. My cookbook shelf contains quite a few books focusing on this type of food, &amp; they surely have a place in every cookbook collection. On the other hand, there have always been books focusing on &quot;light&quot; cooking, containing recipes that tend to use &quot;light&quot; ingredients &amp; many vegetables &amp; fruit. There's always been a need for a book that addresses the gap between these 2 types of cooking, &amp; attempts to bridge this gap. &quot;A new way to cook&quot; is exactly this long-awaited book!Sally Schneider has put taste above everything else: she wants her food to look good &amp; taste good. She also realises, though, that this cannot realistically be achieved through the use of lots of oil or butter or whatever else, since most people have health &amp; weight considerations to take into account. So what she has done is this: she's experimented with lots of different cooking methods, trying to get the best possible taste out of a certain food, using the least possible calories. She does not exclude any ingredients: she just uses everything in moderation &amp; proposes lots of inventive methods.Something that is important is that her book never gets anywhere near boring, &quot;light-cooking&quot; recipes. She has a whole chapter on colorful, indulgent desserts, where you can find everything from lighter desserts using fruits to decadent chocolate cakes &amp; tarts. Schneider's basic premise is that moderation, the use of good ingredients, &amp; inventive, creative cooking methods are the key to good, healthy &amp; yes- in the end, light eating."},{"Title":"A New Way to Cook","review":"I love this book. I have to admit, it contains ingredients not normally found in the average low-fat person's pantry, and some ingredients not easily found in a standard grocery, but part of the point is that perhaps we haven't used these types of ingredients enough to get the flavor, instead of cheaper, fattier, more easily obtainable ingredients. In the meantime, I like her use (very much like Julia Child's &quot;Master Recipies&quot;) of guides to improvising many of the basic recipies, techniques, etc. This is another book that focuses on technique, it teaches one how to cook as opposed to how to follow a recipe. I've found myself cooking from it often, substituting and making do when I can't find anchovy paste. (Although when I follow the ingredients to the letter, the food sparkles with flavors). Deceptively easy recipies such as &quot;Red Lentil Stew with Carmelized Onions&quot; are incredibly complex tasting, and filling to boot. Curry crusted shrimp, easy, delicious, nutritious. I've recommended this book to many friends, all have raved."},{"Title":"A New Way to Cook","review":"I agree with many of the previous reviewers comments: beautiful book, a &quot;new&quot; approach to cooking that doesn't totally eschew butter, cream, sugar, but uses them in moderation. I will also be honest and say upfront that I have not cooked any of the recipes in the book. One of the reasons I have not felt inspired or compelled to do so is the complexity of some of the recipes and the types of ingredients you need to have on hand. For example, the Rice Pudding recipe calls for 4 1/2 cups of low fat milk, plus 3 to 5 tablespoons of whole milk. In our household, we don't drink whole milk so it just doesn't make any sense for me to buy a quart of whole milk and use only a few tablespoons. This sort of thing is repeated in other recipes where a few teaspoons of heavy cream, etc. is needed. I think I understand why the author has included these small amounts, but if you're a low-fat household, you usually don't have these items lying around.In another example for Chocolate Mousse Cake, you need to have unsweetened chestnut puree, cognac, superfine sugar, unflavored gelatin, and vanilla bean. In order to make the cake, you need to make a cooked meringue, &quot;which is a little trickier&quot;, according to the author. I suppose if I had a lot of time I might be more apt to consider some of these recipes, but as a mother of two toddlers, I find Joy of Cooking sufficient :-)!Also, I don't really consider this a low-fat cookbook. If you look at the calories from fat for many of the dishes, they constitute 30% or more of the total calories. BTW, the calorie count and nutritional analyses is located in the back of the book. I would have preferred to have them listed at the end of each recipe for easier reference. To sum up, I think this book is great for the right cook. For myself, the recipes are too involved and require too many ingredients that I do not care to stock in my pantry, plus the &quot;low-fat&quot; marketing angle did not fit my bill."},{"Title":"A New Way to Cook","review":"The text on the back of the (unique) dust jacket for this wonderful cookbook says it all. &quot;A new way to cook is a redefinition of healthy eating, where no food is taboo, great taste rules, and the concept of self denial just doesn't exist.&quot;I note that some readers who have reviewed the book on this site appear to be disappointed because it didn't meet their &quot;low fat&quot; cooking expectations. When disappointment sets in, it is often because expectations and reality are out of synch, so buyers should not expect this to be a another &quot;low fat cooking&quot; tome. This book focuses on whole foods, wholesomely and creatively prepared while keeping an eye on using healthy fat sources in moderate amounts. It also has a wealth of instructional text for those who may be unfamiliar with the products or techniques referenced.I've been cooking since my childhood, nearly 40 years, and this is one of the best cooking references I have ever used. The recipes are simple to follow for all but the very inexperienced cook and very reliable. The range of recipes is also excellent...from seared Lamb with Morrocan spices and tomato jam to roasted vegetable soup.If you like this cookbook, you may also want to investigate Nancy Harmon Jenkins' &quot;The Mediterranean Diet Cookbook&quot; which, although not as extensive as this book, is also wonderful."},{"Title":"A New Way to Cook","review":"I love this book and if you like to cook with fresh foods I think you'll love this book too. It's not a no or low fat cookbook. The author instead tries to eliminate as much fat as she can without sacrificing flavor. She uses highly flavorful fresh herbs and spices to boost taste and then uses just enough fat to achieve the desired results. The recipes do call for several ingredients but they go together quickly and I've found the substitutes she often recommends lead to delicious results as well.I've been cooking from this book almost exclusively for the past couple of weeks and everything has been great - the fish section has been my favorite with the tuna steak with coconut-cilantro chutney to the fish baked with fennel and served with orange sauce - I find with this book I welcome the addition of more fish to my diet."},{"Title":"A New Way to Cook","review":"Have you ever sat down to a really fresh delicious meal with nuanced flavor, and then realized that you've been eating bland processed food all week? Has it made you swear to seek better quality food for yourself? If so, this book is for you.I love this cookbook, but I have to agree with the reviewer who wrote that this is not necessarily the best cookbook for the very busy person. Nonetheless, I still give it 5 stars, because the author isn't making a super-speedy meal claim, and with practice her recipes can get a lot quicker. Also, some of the less time-friendly recipes can easily be adapted. For example, I subsituted chicken breasts for the whole chicken in the FANTASTIC garlic & herb roasted chicken. For me, this cut down on prep time and the problems of trying to get anyone to eat dark meat, plus I have chicken for salad toppings and sandwiches. Memorizing some of the simpler recipes also speeds things up. The first time I made 'warm spilling fruit' I was very slow. Now that I know it's fairly simple, I can throw everything into a pot and have it done in 5 minutes, in time to spoon on top of plain oatmeal. I have learned that cooking certain fruit (such as blackberries) makes me much more likely to eat things that I don't normally like.Also, a person can get around the issue of grocery shopping by doing some planning for the week. Buying a few frozen items is a small compromise (in my opinion).Some readers may just be having problems with the lost art of cooking in this country. When was the last time someone you knew planned their meals ahead or focused on using herbs and spices and avoided 'pre-prepared' items? These things used to be common though.I would rate this book on par with any other book that encourages proper sit-down meals. There's nothing \\"boil-in-bag\\" about it, but you can get high quality meals in a reasonable amount of time. Yes, there are some more elaborate recipes, but there are other recipes that are pretty reasonable. Also, if you think of ways to use left-overs, it's possible to cook once every few days, but have the fantastic flavor for a while longer. Normally, I *hate* left-overs, but then normally left-overs are bland and tasteless. I have to fight with my significant other over leftovers when I cook from this book. Left-over chicken can go on a salad, and on a soup -- into which a few left-over vegetables are tossed. True, the author doesn't give you guidance on how to eat left-overs, but I think this is also because her cookbook seems fairly family oriented (as opposed to a single person living alone). Portion sizes are very reasonable and can suit 2 people fine, but cooking for 1 occasionally requires adjustment (ex. chicken breast instead of a whole bird). For the first time ever, I made salad dressing and had zero left-over.This cookbook is great at encouraging improvisation by providing a palette of skills and options centered around basic recipes, as well as the standard recipes. For example, there is a fruit tart recipe that enourages the reader to choose their own type of fruit and their own flavor and mix to preference. It's rare that you can find a cookbook that will give you a 'general' recipe that you can play with to preference. I have made the fruit tarts multiple times (admittedly with store bought pastry) and each time used a different combination. The same goes for the fruit & nut salad (not the exact title) -- which gives you a list of possible types of fruit and possible nuts to use, depending on what's on hand. The salad recipe is particularly handy for when you don't want a boring salad, but haven't got time to buy new ingredients. One time I used left over clementines, dry cranberries, and walnuts bits -- post-holidays.American readers may find there are slightly more recipes for rabbit etc than we are used to. I also wish there was slightly more information about vegetatian meals, but her chapters on legumes and grains are implicitly pretty helpful.I did not find any of her techniques particularly difficult (she has a good glossary of instructions in the back); but I imagine that for many people who are used to 'heat and serve' cooking, it may seem like a lot. You do have to get used to keeping certain things (like lemons) on hand, and getting comfortable with a new recipe. My grandmother was a great cook, so a lot of this stuff slowly is coming back to me. I can't pretend I love spending time in the kitchen, but I appreciate food that isn't boring and for me that means doing more than just 'heat and serve'.The best thing about this cookbook is that you can have a 5 star meal and feel totally indulged without eating anything bad for you. The quality of the flavor in her meals is fantastic. The garlic roasted chicken in particular has won me tons of compliments (to the point where more than one person has said a meal at my house was better than most of the restuarants in the area). Getting something with flavor, breaks the monotony of the usual american diet, and thus cures the tendency to mindlessly munch on things that taste 'good' (chips, chocolate etc).I would recommend this book in conjunction with the \\"Frenchwomen don't get fat book\\" because it really does make a person feel indulged rather than deprived. I actually find cooking from these recipes relaxing because I know I'll really enjoy the meal, wihout having to worry about calories."},{"Title":"A New Way to Cook","review":"This is just an outstanding contemporary cookbook that happens to have an emphasis on healthful eating. And it that vein it is far superior to other &quot;low fat&quot; cookbooks because Schneider eschews use of low or no fat substitute ingedients and instead manages to use real butter, real cream, olive oil, bacon, etc. to enhance her dishes. Some of her techniques are pretty inventive and I haven't seen them elsewhere. This is a comprehensive cookbook with great explanations of various techniques and dishes, and it includes complete nutritional information on each recipe. Some of the calorie counts are hard to believe because the dishes seem so rich!"},{"Title":"A New Way to Cook","review":"Every recipe I've tried from this book has been great. The author's philosophy really appeals to me, since I want to eat healthier but wouldn't be caught dead buying reduced-fat cheese or light margarine. The photos are absolutely gorgeous, and the whole book has a luxurious, elegant feel. I especially like the desserts chapter, but my favorite recipe overall has to be the Macaroni and Cheese--she's right, you'd never know it wasn't the high-calorie original. If you're just starting out as a cook, or tired of \\"diet\\" cookbooks that use all sorts of chemical-laden \\"low-fat\\" or sugar-substitute filled ingredients, get this book and use it often."},{"Title":"Stephen Vincent Benet: The Life and Times of an American Man of Letters 1898-1943","review":"this book was really really really bad.

When used in conjunction with the Answer Key to the primer, prepared by John R. Dunlap, the student has at their disposal all that is required to grasp the basic concepts of Latin grammar and pronunciation. It is also advisable to purchase a good, but inexpensive Latin dictionary. Currently, at least three students at my school of theology are using these resources in preparation for small group tutoring in the Fall semester.

It starts out with partial differential equations (no previous PDE experience needed) and shows where Fourier series comes from, which I found motivating since the purpose of Fourier Analysis was evident from the beginning. It then goes into making solutions of arbitrary functions out of sine and cosine functions as well as touching on other orthogonal sets.The book's main focus is on starting with PDEs and ending with a solution of a Fourier series.The first chapter was the hardest since the approaches to problems were much different than in calculus, but after adjusting to the material and the approaches to the problems, it gets easier!"},{"Title":"Fourier series and boundary value problems,","review":"So you're familiar with my background, I received a B.S. in Astrophysics and now I am a first year graduate student in an Applied Math program. I used this book as a supplementary resource when studying Partial Differential Equations - we got to Separation of Variables and then to Fourier Series. Every Physics student who graduates today has at least seen a Fourier Series (I hope). I didn't feel confident in my abilities so I bought this book to review.Let me tell you, if this is your first time hearing about Fourier Series then this book is simply the BEST book to learn Fourier Series and much of the beautiful underlying theory behind Fourier Analysis! It's so well written and clear that I had absolutely no trouble following the text. I cannot express how clear and beautifully it is written, it is extremely rare for a math book at this level to be so vivid and eloquent! The proofs are easy to follow and the problems ease you into the subject presented in each section; which, in turn, are \\"bite-sized\\" and manageable. I studied the material by myself and walked away knowing Fourier Series.There are plenty of good examples, the problems are great! If you're self-studying (or not) do as many of the problems as you can; if you read the previous two or three sections you should have absolutely no trouble going through the problems. Applications galore!NOTE: This book isn't written at the graduate level, don't shy away from it because I mentioned being a grad student, I just wanted a review of Fourier Series. If I had to rate the level of the book I would say it's at a beginning upper-division level of a typical american university. If you've had a decent multi-variable calculus class, and are comfortable with partial derivatives, this book should be very comprehensible. It's clearer still to physics majors (or the like) who are more familiar with what and where specific equations apply to.This book is beautiful, and I think it should be required reading of every physics and applied math student everywhere (maybe I'm just a little biased).The ONLY caveat is that the Fourier Complex Series is left to problems, we don't get to use them to learn theory and get more comfortable with. This is okay since the cosine and sine series are equivalent to the complex series, it's just that the complex series is more elegant when doing problems or proving things."},{"Title":"Fourier series and boundary value problems,","review":"My first encounter with partial differential equations was out of this book.

Though it would help to have had an advanced calculus course, it isn't necessary to understand the mechanics of solving pde's (namely the variables seperable cases, which is mostly what's in this book).

Dr. Brown proves to be an excellent author once again."},{"Title":"Fourier series and boundary value problems,","review":"I found Dr. Brown, in conjunction with Dr. Churchill, to have written a very dry and non-useful text. It fails to provide the undergraduate student with the resources and background information that more highly touted books offer. There are a few examples that are somewhat helpful, but overall I found myself having to use reference texts to supplement this one. I am not a math major, but am continually searching for good math texts to help me grasp the fundamentals of more difficult topics. I did not find that help here. Too much 'math prose' and not enough to-the-point definitions and examples, which is the cry of every non-math major. Their treatment of the Laplacian is not even worth the bother of placing it in the book. The physical size of the book is small, (9 1/2 by 6&quot;) with 335 pages. Not nearly enough for the treatment of its titled subject."},{"Title":"Whistle: A work-in-progress : a facsimile of the author's hand-corrected typescript of chapter one of his forthcoming novel \\"Whistle\\" : together with ... of this novel to his published work","review":"James Jones seems to have a reputation for being an author stuck on WWII. Whistle is indeed about an aspect of WWII. But like all of James Jones's work, he brings a sense of &quot;truth&quot; to this an all of his other books. Jones knew the difference between a bronze star and the CIB. He also knew the difference between getting &quot;laid&quot; and making love. He also knew the difference between a thesaurus and well woven words.I consider James Jones to be one of the greatest American writers of our time....although Pat Conroy and Beach Music is right up there.No one that I have ever read has been able to render the anger and frustration of the combat veteran into words the way Jones did.He also knew that he was dying as he tried to finish Whistle. Many would say to hell with it, and enjoy the last days of their lives. Jones felt an obligation to get his vision...his memory...down on paper before the grim reaper took its final toll.Anyone who hasn't read Whistle is certainly missing something in their life when they wake up every mornng. It is somewhat like going through life without having read Catch-22. How can one?Suffice it to say that James Jones is one of the finest writers in the 20th century. And while I've read that he felt Some Came Running would be the book that he would be remembered for, Whistle is the culmination of his work...of his life.Anyone who hasn't read it is missing something very important."},{"Title":"Whistle: A work-in-progress : a facsimile of the author's hand-corrected typescript of chapter one of his forthcoming novel \\"Whistle\\" : together with ... of this novel to his published work","review":"This novel was not finished by its author,but it is great bookas it is.I'd read it several years ago and decided that it will be the subject of my professional reserch in the philology. I think that this book by Jones with its mystical ending somehow remines us Melwill's 'Mobby Dick '.The episode with the discription of the death of Strange ( he drawned in the cold water of Atlantic ocean ) is really very pathetic and mystified. The main theme of the book is the 'second lost generation ',becouse the soldiers returned from the war can't find the proper place in post-war world. The novel is reach of different themes ( the relationship between men and women, the soldiers' speculations about their future etc.)I advice averybody to read it and I can say that it will not be just wasting time.wwww"},{"Title":"Those incredible Christians (Bantam)","review":"The follow up to Dr Hugh J Schonfield's controversial bestseller &quot;The Passover plot&quot; does not dissapoint. In fact Schonfield's case is much stronger this time, where the passover plot was largely on informed speculation, we are working with comparitive concrete this time.In &quot;Those incredible Christians&quot; Schonfield explores the &quot;grey area&quot; in time between the Fall of Jersualem and the spread of Orthodoxy in the third and fourth centuries.The first three Chapters are somewhat painful, and Schonfield provides what he admits is a &quot;strange introduction&quot; into the rise and rise of Christianity.Generally speaking Schonfield presumes his audience is well read, often providing a blanket statement that those familiar with critical New Testament scholarship would readily accept, but the average neophyte Christian reader would blink at in untold horror.Where Schonfield treads bold new ground is in the enlightening treatise on &quot;the Christology of Paul&quot;. Schonfield alone seems to understand that in Paul's cosmology Jesus is not God, rather he is GOD's FIRST PERFECT CREATION. Furthermore, he is man in his original unadulterated spiritual state.How did orthodox Christianity end up so confused? This is detailed in the Chapter &quot;The man called John&quot; where new light is shed on the mysterious author of the fourth Gospel.While I agree with Schonfield's hypothesis for the most part, my own interpretation is that1) John Son of Zebedee is simply a red herring, he was executed before the fall of Jerusalem and could not have written the classic Greek of the fourth Gospel2) John the Presbyter/Elder was the last surviving authorative figure who had seen Jesus in the flesh (see Papias) I also tentatively agreee with Catholic tradition the the Presbyter was the author of Revelation3) The author of the Gospel of John was a &quot;third John&quot;. With my tongue firmly in cheek I refer to this person as &quot;John the redactor&quot;. This is the young idealistic Greek Schonfield is looking for as the author. Likely &quot;John the redactor&quot; gained the testimony of &quot;John the Elder&quot; or spoke to someone who had heard him teach, which equipped his own Hellenistic Christianity with an actual firsthand tradition, the perfect blend of historical fact and Greek mystical dogma.Some 30 years after the death of Paul, it was the Johanine tradition that gave Paul's Christology a good dose of Asian Hellenism incorporating the Logos and Gnostic themes, and as Schonfield so aptly notes, other then Paul &quot;John&quot; has provided the greatest influence on the modern Church.If you can stick with Dr Schonfield past his extended &quot;introduction&quot;, the book becomes a real page turner by Chapter Four.An interesting side issue is Schonfield's explanation of the meaning of 666 or 616 in some early manuscripts)tracing it to the value inscribed on coins of Emperor Domitian. (Domitian also placed an imperial Mark on the hand or forehead for trade)All in all, &quot;Those incredible Christians&quot; is a highly recommended introduction to critical New Testament scholarshipStephenhanes@yahoo.com"},{"Title":"Those incredible Christians (Bantam)","review":"Dr. Schonfield has been the recipient of much undeserved flak from those who missed the point of his prior work, The Passover Plot. This volume is more interested in true historical information, detailing the progression of thought in the early Christian church and encouraging the reader to muse for themselves as Schonfield demonstrates the evidence. Might be scary reading for those who want to think Martin Luther and Jesus are the same figure, but that audience doesn't make much habit of reading anything beyond \\"inspirational\\"/\\"Aesop's Fables\\" works anyhow."},{"Title":"Those incredible Christians (Bantam)","review":"This is one of the most exciting religious history texts I've ever read. I first read it as a teenager, and was 'blown away.' Together with Schonfeld's \\"Passover Plot,\\" it was just too much for Baptists and the Catholic League to bear.

It should most definitely be filmed!"},{"Title":"And the Poor Get Prison: Economic Bias in American Criminal Justice","review":"First, a bit of disclosure: I am not a social scientist or a scholar of any kind. Rather, I approach this book from the perspective of an informed observer of the federal criminal justice system. As a full-time Spanish&lt;&gt;English court interpreter I have occasion to observe first-hand the workings of federal criminal proceedings, from arrest through sentencing. I can hardly help but notice that the overwhelming majority of defendants whom I encounter on their way to prison are poor. (Their &quot;crimes,&quot; moreover, are usually victimless -- typically, drug offenses or illegal re-entry, i.e., returning illegally to the US after being deported, usually for a drug offense.)And the Poor Get Prison begins with an anecdote that explains the genesis of the book. Rieman and his students were conducting a thought experiment: how would you design a criminal justice system if your goal were to ensure that there would always be plenty of crime and criminals to keep the prisons full? Their model turned out to be a carbon copy of what we have, a system custom built to fail to achieve its ostensible purpose.Economic bias is built into our criminal justice system and operates at many levels: at the legislative level, where decisions are made as to what will be a crime and how it will be punished; at the enforcement level, where discretionary decisions about arrests are made; at the prosecutorial level, where charging decisions are made; and at the judicial level, where sentences are meted out. At each phase the wealthy and powerful have opportunities to avoid punishment that are not available to the poor. Starting at the legislative level, certain crimes such as nonviolent drug offenses are punished severely, while serious corporate environmental and economic crimes - which, as Reiman demonstrates, are actually far more harmful to society than the sort of street crimes that normally come to mind when one thinks of &quot;crime&quot; - are punished with slaps on the wrist, if at all, and are ! often treated as regulatory rather than criminal matters. In many cases the wealthy never end up facing the justice system at all for their crimes. When they do, they have access to private, retained counsel who, according to studies cited by the author, are more effective than the overworked and underfunded public defenders who are assigned to the indigent.In terms of enforcement patterns, And the Poor Get Prison describes how law enforcement targets the poor over middle and upper class offenders. He treats racial discrimination as a form of economic bias that achieves the same end as racism, since minorities are disproportionately poor.The prosecutorial and sentencing phases have further mechanims to &quot;weed out the wealthy.&quot; The resulting criminal justice system is like a carnival mirror that projects a distorted image of reality, of who the most dangerous criminals are. Media hype and hysteria help futher distort the image. Prisons themselves, having abandoned long since any pretense of rehabilitation, serve to perpetuate this system by turning out thoroughly hardenened criminal graduates with little chance of making a decent living through legal employment after their release.Reiman makes compelling arguments as to how society could greatly reduce crime if it wanted to. He shows, for example, what in my view should by now be obvious to any thoughtful observer who is not brainwashed by conventional wisdom and media/government hype: that drug prohibition causes far more harm than do the prohibited drugs themselves.He also recognizes that there are indeed dangerous violent people who should be locked up, and does not regard everyone who is in prison as the innocent, oppressed victim of the evil rich. Nor does he suggest that our current system is the result of a true conspiracy, where some group of people sits down and consciously, deliberately creates a system designed to fail. Indeed, he allows that most of the keepers of the system are well-intentioned.I would part company w! ith Reiman on this last point. There are undoubtedly a good many executives and stockholders of the Corrections Corporation of America, and members of corrections officers organizations, who genuinely hope crime will boom and ultimately benefit their bottom line. There are also surely politicians intelligent enough to know better who continue cynically to huff and puff about coddling criminals, hoping it will help their poll numbers. Another minor criticism is that the book tends to repeat its main points as much as it develops them - possibly underestimating the reader's ability to get the point. And some of it, inevitably perhaps, is written in the language of social science that can get a bit dense for lay readers. Nonetheless, And the Poor Get Prison reads well on the whole. At times Rieman's tone is angry, and with good reason: social inequalities in American society and our so-called justice system are both disgraceful and cruel."},{"Title":"Louisiana's Award Winning Recipes","review":"Out of all my cookbooks,this is the best organized and the binding makes it so easy to work with.

The recipes are so easy to follow and most ingredients are already on hand. I've tried some of the recipes and they are delicious! This cookbook is a wonderful addition to any kitchen."},{"Title":"Louisiana's Award Winning Recipes","review":"Do you love Southern home-cooked foods? If you have ever been to Louisiana, you know that there is nothing like the flavors that come from that historic State. Cooking in the Louisiana tradition is close to my heart since all of my family comes from Louisiana. That's why I love to collect cookbooks of Louisiana recipes. So it was a natural for me to pick up the \\"Louisiana's Award-Winning Recipes Cookbook\\" by Missy Armstrong, Dottie Brewer and Harrietta Randazzo. If you're looking for simple to prepare, real home-cooking, tasty recipes, you'll enjoy this compact cookbook.Louisiana is known for rich, savory dishes and this collection of award-winning recipes by home cooks presents a good variety of dishes to explore. The \\"Louisiana Award-Winning Cookbook\\" is comprised mainly from a collection of recipes that were submitted to the New Orleans Times Picayune Newspaper for a contest to see who could cook up the best recipes. The authors say this book contains award winning recipes from Louisiana \\"that reveal methods of preparing the dishes that were kept secret for generations.\\"One thing for sure, you have to love rich, high-fat foods to really enjoy authentic Louisiana cooking. The recipes in this cookbook carry on that tradition and do not bend to the rules of any contemporary diet craze. For example, the \\"Everyday Country Cornbread\\" lists Gold Metal self-rising flour and 2 tablespoons of Crisco butter flavored shortening with the option to use plain Crisco shortening in the ingredients. Another example is the \\"Surprise Chicken Kiev\\" that calls for 2 teaspoons of Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning to flavor the pounded chicken breasts. You might need to substitute these types of ingredients with something more accessible or fitting into your diet choices. However, if you can stick as close as possible to the recipe, you will have a great experience of the basic flavor and zest of the authentic Louisiana dish.For the most part, the ingredients used are readily available and I tried several of the dishes in my kitchen as a treat for my family. The \\"Spicy Okra Puffs\\" were easy to prepare and added just a bit of heat on the tongue with the addition of Tabasco Sauce in the mixture. My family enjoyed the \\"Steak au Poivre\\" dish for Sunday dinner that was marinated in a cup of dry Vermouth which tenderized the meat and added to the simple flavors which is another little known tradition of Louisiana cooking.You'll find some dishes for special occasions that you might have wondered how to prepare such as the \\"New Orleans Cajun Fried Turkey\\" with Cajun Injection Seasoning, or the \\"Golden Glazed Rock Cornish Hens\\" with a homemade golden glaze.The cookbook does not have an index which means you have to skim whole sections to find a recipe. But the short chapters make it easy to find what you need. Although the book is not too large, it provides a full range of dishes to try, from appetizers and dips to beverages, vegetables, meats and desserts. I like this cookbook. Good recipes from this region are a treat and it's even better when you find no-frills recipes that come from the home kitchen of cooks from the area. \\"Louisiana's Award-Winning Recipes\\" represents a labor of love that will be a welcome addition to the shelves of cooks who love Louisiana foods.Consuelo S.

However, you should know what you're buying. Download the free version from the website first to check it out. This is not a textbook for a DSP course. Treat it as you would an encyclopedia -- you don't use the encyclopedia to do major research, you use it to get an introduction to the topic and get ideas on what you want to pursue. Some mathematically-inclined people are able to understand what the equations are saying right away, but others may need to learn through different ways. This book offers that alternative way, by explaining in understandable English what's going on. To grasp the real beauty and applications of DSP, you'll still need to eventually use the equations, but this book is a good start to gaining insight in what those equations mean."},{"Title":"Digital Signal Processing: A Practical Guide for Engineers and Scientists","review":"This book gives you all the neccessary tools to understand the fundamental principles that drive DSP. One example would be the chapter on the Laplace Transform. He takes a topic that most other DSP books give a cursory glance, treats it with great care, trying to let you grasp the fundamentals of Laplace transform so that you would'nt have trouble in understanding the significance of poles and zeros.And Steve gives you many ways to look at a DSP topic :- Through carefully selected figures that mesh well with the topic - Through less maths -Third and the most important, simple to understand programs written in Basic to enable you to visualize the algorithm though programs.His style is steeped with practical wisdom and with painstaking attention to details. It is no wonder that this would be one of the most important books for the beginner in DSP that would equally rank with that of Richard Lyons.Where ever the Steve uses maths, you almost always expect him to explain its physical interpretation and its practical significance.I loved his convolution Machine analogy. I hope you will find many more gems in this wonderful book on DSP."},{"Title":"Digital Signal Processing: A Practical Guide for Engineers and Scientists","review":"Even though I already have the predecessor to this book described on www.dspguide.com, I purchased this 2003 version to stay current. What makes this book great are how clear the explanations are to a number of core DSP areas that are often poorly explained like overlap-add fast convolution while still covering some unusual things that are rarely discussed (neural net filter design?!) along with practical cookbook techniques. And all this with charts, graphs, and clear-as-ice examples in BASIC, hoorah! Steven is egoless in terms of presenting the useful stuff - he's not trying to show off his math, he's just trying to help you understand. :D"},{"Title":"Digital Signal Processing: A Practical Guide for Engineers and Scientists","review":"Coming to DSP from a non-mathematical back ground I wanted a DSP guide that would allow me to 'do something' useful, quickly for a biomedical signal processing applicition- but I initally had difficulty finding a good textbook.I painfully struggled through Lathi's \\"Signal Processing and Linear Systems\\" with little to show for it. Lyons' \\"Understanding Digital Signal Processing\\" was very good at explanation (I recommend it) but somewhat lacked a practical focus. In the end \\"DSP a Practical Guide\\" turned out to be even clearer and easier to read than Lyons while being more complete and having a more practical focus.The book is punctuated with practical examples- sonar, audio processing, code optimisation and accompanying BASIC. After literally a few hours of reading I applied some provided algorithms to clean up an EKG signal (with considerable success).I found the chapter on neural networks to be so clear and enthralling it became a 'toilet read'- certainly a first for a book of this genre :) - the sections on image processing, audio processing and data compression are likewise accessible.The only caveat with this book is that those seeking a rigorous 'first principles' mathematical analysis of DSP (Lathi style) may be disappointed by the conceptual focus- a lot of the 'harder' items like Laplace and complex fourier come towards the latter half of the book.Purchasers should also note that there seem to be differences in the composition of the similar hardback versions of the book (I have the softcover)."},{"Title":"Digital Signal Processing: A Practical Guide for Engineers and Scientists","review":"This is a great book. You wouldn't expect to be able to read a DSP text from cover to cover like a novel, but this one makes it enjoyable. The information is presented with basic math, allowing the reader to concentrate on the concepts and the mechanics at a manageable level (no painful derivation type discussions). I highly recommend this text to those that want to get a working knowledge of DSP without having to have a pencil, paper, calculator, etc. to follow through the text."},{"Title":"Digital Signal Processing: A Practical Guide for Engineers and Scientists","review":"This book literally picks up the reader and carries them through an impressive (read: large, scary, and dangerous!) body of information incredibly effectively, smoothly, and effortlessly. You can't help, but feel empowered afterwards!I've been away from my EE background for 15+ years working on embedded real-time software. I picked up this book six months ago in what was a very modest attempt to familiarize myself with DSP and filters only enough to carry conversations with some new ME/Controls co-workers! The book ignited my interest (mainly by giving me a jolt of confidence!) in the subject such that I've spent the last few months delving into more \\"formal\\" DSP and reviewing some college math. In fact, I wanted to write a good review months ago, but it is now that I appreciate S. W. Smith's great work even more.The simple and friendly language of the book is apparent, but the organization of the subject matter - so carefully weaved together - is absolutely nothing like the other pedantic introductory books on DSP. In summary, while it prepares the reader for practical DSP applications, the book is nothing like some other dull cook-book, get-rich, \\"for-the-working-professional\\" books. This one has a heart!"},{"Title":"Digital Signal Processing: A Practical Guide for Engineers and Scientists","review":"My 40 year old MSEE needed some refreshing on digital signal processing, FFT, FIR and IIR filters.

(For these students I also recommend &quot;Signals and Systems Made Ridiculously Simple&quot; by Zoher Z. Karu).In either case, and especially for the practicing engineer, this is just about the finest reference book on DSP that I have ever come across, and I have plouged through quite a few of them.

I cannot recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"Digital Signal Processing: A Practical Guide for Engineers and Scientists","review":"I'm a physicist and have used Fourier transforms in data analysis, and am seeking to use Laplace transforms too. I've been working with 6 texts and various onlne references and class notes about Laplace transforms.The online .pdf version of this book says that, like Fourier transforms treat signals as being composed of sinusoids, Laplace transforms treat them as being composed of sinusoids and exponentials. It also says the Fourier transform is a special case of the Laplace, and appears on the vertical axis of the s plane.These seem to me to be the two first and most important things to understand about the Laplace transform, and I didn't get them out of ANY of the other references. Now that I understand this, I can't imagine why other authors approach the topic in such an obscure way. And so many barely grasped notions are suddenly popping into place!I am buying this book now, in paper form. It's well worth it to have both formats.

Terms are defined and explained well.The book isn't mathematically rigorous; it uses enough math to explain DSP, but for a more complete mathematical treatment, other, more advanced books would be better. Nevertheless, this book is much more than just a beginner's book.Many small computer programs are given to illustrate some of the computation methods. These are very adequate for their purpose of explanation, but since programming is not the subject of the book, the programs are not at all advanced.DSP can be a difficult subject for a non-electrical engineer who did not learn about it in school. There are books on the subject that are complete, but so filled with advanced mathematics that a beginner can easily get lost in the first chapter. On the other hand, there are books that are so simplified that they present nothing but banal generalities about DSP.So I was very happy to discover this book. It has enough math to explain the subject, but not too much. Most importantly though, the author repeatedly ties the DSP concepts to reality, so that I can picture what an algorithm has to do, rather than presenting equations whose meaning I don't understand. The author does a great job of explaining the powerful abstractions of DSP using concretes that I can understand and visualize.Finally, the author's enthusiasm for the subject really shows in the book - and results in a book that is written in a lucid style."},{"Title":"Digital Signal Processing: A Practical Guide for Engineers and Scientists","review":"i like the fact that this book uses examples and narrative to explain things rather than using math stuff everywhere like other books do. From the very beginning this book introduces program examples on how programs are implemented to create the discrete functions that describe signals and processing and explains how they are related with the continuous or analog world. I highly recommend this book for everyone who wants to understand concepts without having to understand all the math that is involved. i have not finished the book but it indicates it also contains the math stuff at the very end for those who like or understand things that way too."},{"Title":"Digital Signal Processing: A Practical Guide for Engineers and Scientists","review":"I have already known this book by its free pdf version available on the web.

Congratulations to the author!"},{"Title":"Digital Signal Processing: A Practical Guide for Engineers and Scientists","review":"I started by reading the PDF versions on Steve Smith's website. That was enough to give me the background for a recently assigned task. Steve graciously returned a few e-mails about fine points that were not clear. I ordered the paperback version with the CDROM to get a version with the most errata removed. My task included some downshifting and upshifting not covered in Smith's book. Lyons filled the gap nicely. The example code in the book is in BASIC, but is very easy to implement in other languages. I used C++ and the FFTW libraries."},{"Title":"Digital Signal Processing: A Practical Guide for Engineers and Scientists","review":"DSP can be a daunting subject at the best of times. To make matters worse, most standard texts such as the definitive \\"Discrete-Time Signal Processing\\" by Oppenheim et al, lean heavily on the mathematical theory behind Fourier analysis, filter design, etc., which can leave most readers dazed and confused. Precious little insight is to be gained from studying page after page of equations which stare blankly back at you.This is where Smith's practical guide steps in. With economical use of mathematics, this book provides clear and concise explanation of all the essential elements of DSP, providing the overall picture so sadly lacking in more technical texts.There are only a few texts that match up to Smith's guide, the next best being \\"Understanding Digital Signal Processing\\" by Lyons. While much of the same material is covered and with the same sensitivity to maintaining your sanity, the real selling point that separates these two is the CDROM that accompanies Smith's book. On it you'll find all the code that is littered throughout the book, as well as the book itself! Simply put, this book is the one all others have to aspire to."},{"Title":"Digital Signal Processing: A Practical Guide for Engineers and Scientists","review":"Steven W. Smith has updated his previous book, &quot;Scientist and Engineer's Guide to DSP&quot;, with a bit more material, better typesetting, and an added section with program listings and also a software CD.I went to the technical section of the best bookstore in my area, and looked through several books on this topic. Without a doubt, this one was the most clearly written and informative.My technical background is that I have a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering, my native language is English, and I have never taken a course on DSP's. I have read a bit about digital signal processors, and used some electronic equipment (lock-in amplifier) that was DSP-based. I am interested in learning about processing video image arrays, and audio and real time instrumentation signals.

I'm done now."},{"Title":"Digital Signal Processing: A Practical Guide for Engineers and Scientists","review":"I was looking for a reference book and read all the rave reviews about this particular book. Once I got it home I was extremely disappointed. It's more of an overview than anything else. This book was definitely written for non-electrical/computer engineers. If your not an electrical/computer engineer and interested in signal processing then this book is for you, otherwise, don't waste your money. There's absolutely no math (derivations) in this book."},{"Title":"Digital Signal Processing: A Practical Guide for Engineers and Scientists","review":"Sorry for the title of the review but this book will not help you with your signals and systems Final or DSP Final. This is not a textbook. There are no problems or examples here. Practically no math at all. What this book is about is the esoteric meaning behind DSP, if you use this during the DSP course you are taking, you will waste valuable time reading this book. Read it over the summer as you get ready for the fall DSP (the real deal) course. This is kinda like a \\"let's forget about the math, no examples, no problems\\"; lets talk about the core DSP principles that only PHDs truly understand sort of book. Sorry but this book is utterly useless for the classroom. Discrete time processing by Oppenhiem is probably your best bet. A lot of times this book is long winded and goes and goes on about simple concepts that could be explained in a paragraph but take 5 pages. If you got a lot of time in your hands and your ready for the big picture with no details at all and you are descendent of 17th century mathematicians then you'll find this book interesting. Don't get me wrong: If you want to understand DSP but are scared of the Oppenheim text book (too much math) then go for \\"Understanding DSP\\" by Lyon.

The book more than met my needs. The explanations are outstanding.

I wish that all technical books were like this."},{"Title":"Digital Signal Processing: A Practical Guide for Engineers and Scientists","review":"I have searched DSP books theoy and practice well balanced.This is an excellent book in practical view, and it also outlines relevant theorys to be studied afterwards by yourself.I studied DSP first with Oppenheim book in my school life, it induces DSP formulas very strictly but somewhat dull. After I met Sedra's DSP book, it was very good book relatively well balanced. Nevertheless I was very happy to meet this book now as an audio DSP engineer. For example, reading chapter 22(Audio processing) was a very pleasant thing. and Chapter 4(DSP Software), Chapter 28(Digital Signal Processors) also helpful. I think it is enough worthy of collection for students and also for engineers."},{"Title":"Digital Signal Processing: A Practical Guide for Engineers and Scientists","review":"The author does a very good job explaining the fundamentals of DSP with some advanced topics. Materials are clearly, concisely, and logically presented with the exception of the section on FFT(Fast Fourier Transform), here the author's presentation suddenly degraded from excellent to (very)poor, and readers have to sort out the details of what the author is trying to say. Besides convolution and discrete fourier transform, FFT is the most important topic for people beginning on DSP, so this kind of spoils the book somehow. But then, this is still a very good book and the author has spent some great effort on it."},{"Title":"Digital Signal Processing: A Practical Guide for Engineers and Scientists","review":"This is a good book, but it lacks the mathematical development necessary to really understand DSP. Richard Lyons' book &quot;Understanding Digital Signal Processing&quot; is better in this regard. Heck, just buy both."},{"Title":"Digital Signal Processing: A Practical Guide for Engineers and Scientists","review":"Never saw such a book, where complicated concepts were described so clear and understandable. For 3 years I was giving a course of lectures in DSP fundamentals at the university and I chose this book as a basis, because from many English and Russian DSP books I read, this one is definitely the best if you want to _understand_ concepts of the field.Moreover it excellently links different part of the course, so after reading it you'll learn how those parts are connected -- FFT with convolution, convolution with digital filters, and even all of them with neural networks. For me it was the first book which described simple neural networks so clear!Great respect to the author for his very rare ability to describe complex things in simple words and with real-life examples. One can tell he has deep understanding in this field. He's a some kind of Feynman in DSP. Thanks a lot!"},{"Title":"Digital Signal Processing: A Practical Guide for Engineers and Scientists","review":"great ! it answers the whole pattern of digital applications.

Thanks to the author."},{"Title":"Digital Signal Processing: A Practical Guide for Engineers and Scientists","review":"Steven Smith does a great job of giving the reader a good intuitive feel for what is going on, especially regarding the mathematics of the convolution and the Fourier Transform. He also provides great diagrams of everything he discusses."},{"Title":"Digital Signal Processing: A Practical Guide for Engineers and Scientists","review":"I took the DSP course in my final year undergraduate study, and it was a more maths-oriented course. While I was able to cope with the maths, I didn't really appreciate all the ideas behind, and I didn't like DSP at that time. The auther has done a great job in writing this book, with ideas clearly presented with the least amount of maths involved. I would strongly recommend this book for students taking introductory DSP and practitioners in the DSP field. I wish I had read this book earlier."},{"Title":"Digital Signal Processing: A Practical Guide for Engineers and Scientists","review":"A book full of practical advice on how to design a digital processing system and insights on how digital processing systyems work.

If you only buy one digital processing book in your lifetime this should be the book."},{"Title":"Digital Signal Processing: A Practical Guide for Engineers and Scientists","review":"This very accessible book, now freely available online, is an excellent book for engineers that need to quickly and painlessly acquaint themselves with the fundamentals of digital signal processing and find programmatic solutions to problems. For example, chapter 16 gives a fine explanation of the windowed sinc filter and gives examples of programs that produce a lowpass and bandpass filter based on this technique, both clearly commented. Also, chapter 12 clearly explains the FFT and shows an actual program that performs the computation - not just the \\"2x2 butterfly component\\" that every DSP book shows and explains. As if you could run down to Best Buy and purchase an arm-full of \\"butterfly components\\" and build an FFT! The book also bothers to show an actual program that calculates the inverse FFT and explains in clear language WHY the inverse and forward FFT's are basically the same operation.I wouldn't recommend this book as a primary source for students however, since it does present material in a somewhat backwards fashion. Filter design and applications are presented first, and at the back of the book the Laplace and Z transform - which is the basis of DSP - is presented. Also, the book never goes very deep into the theory, which can be problematic for students. Especially problematic is the fact that it doesn't explain the concept of linearity or time-invariance very well, which is why DSP works in the first place. However, if you are a student who is already using a good book on theory, such as Oppenheim's \\"Discrete Time Signal Processing\\", this is an excellent supplement that shows you the HOW's of DSP."},{"Title":"Digital Signal Processing: A Practical Guide for Engineers and Scientists","review":"For anyone who wants to get up and running quickly with DSP algorithms without wading through overwhelming quantity of math and theory first, I can't recommend this highly enough. The author did a great job presenting the concepts in an intuitive way, so you gain a good intuitive grasp of what is going on. He also provides actual some actual code and algorithms to help you get up and running quickly, and provides the key math without all the unnecessary proofs. And he does this without sacrificing the beautiful concepts underlying the theory.This book gave me more capability and intuitive understanding for real-world signal processing algorithms than my undergraduate DSP class did. Not that my class was bad; it was... well, academic- a lot of theory without gut-level intuitive understanding. This book is the opposite, and a good compliment to the academic approach.I already had the free version but bought this anyway to support the author and to have a full printed version. It's that good."},{"Title":"Digital Signal Processing: A Practical Guide for Engineers and Scientists","review":"You can read this book on dspguide.com, but if you are like me you prefer to have a printed copy.This book is meant for beginners to the field, but it covers quite a range of material with particular attention to building up your intuition. I havent finished it, but am finding it very enjoyable. The author is a natural born explainer. The sample code is in Basic, sure, but you can easily translate it into your favorite language.The mathematics is rather easy, and may seem long winded to a mathematically oriented person, but such a person should be able to condense the explanation with no trouble.What's also nice it that it covers many aspects of the field, like signal processing by specialised hardware.I have recommended it to people who are interested in digital photography and want to have a deeper understanding."},{"Title":"Digital Signal Processing: A Practical Guide for Engineers and Scientists","review":"I'm a software engineer and my work often involves some sort of signal processing.

It explains very many things with simple math. and some pseudo code.If your looking for a easy book about DSP? This is it!"},{"Title":"Digital Signal Processing: A Practical Guide for Engineers and Scientists","review":"This book is a nice non-mathematical introduction to DSP that stresses on intuitive understanding of the subject as opposed to a formal, mathematical treatment. This book is a kind of reference book for non-DSP people and cannot substitute for a DSP textbook. Most DSP textbooks use a lot of math and leave the reader to fully grasp the underlying concepts. But this book explains DSP concepts using intuition rather than mathematics. There are certain things found here that would not be treated in most other textbooks - like the concept and importance of signal phase. I did not give this book 5 starts since I felt the concept of real valued FFT was unnecessary and confusing when compared to the true or complex valued FFT. The programs could have been written in C, or even more preferably Matlab, instead of FORTRAN. But a few minor flaws does not take away from this very good book. People who want to master DSP can use this book as a primer (a version of this book is even available online) before graduating on to a more conventional textbook."},{"Title":"Digital Signal Processing: A Practical Guide for Engineers and Scientists","review":"Sorry for the unprofessional title of this review, but it really hits home for what this book delivers. Just to note, this book is available free from the author's website, but after reading the first 8 chapters I realized I needed to pay homage and buy the real book. Practical, Illustrative, Clear, Entertaining are all adjectives that describe this book. This book partly inspired me to go back for my Masters degree in EE for Signal Processing (which, turns out now-a-days is more about statistics and optimization theory then anything else). In short, the author does an amazing job explaining a complex subject in clear \\"discrete\\" terms which make it easy for a EE or anyone else with a mild amount of programming experience to understand. Well done Sir!"},{"Title":"Digital Signal Processing: A Practical Guide for Engineers and Scientists","review":"I just finished Steven Smith's book \\"Digital Signal Processing\\". This was the best book I ever read. Finally, a book that explains in detail the difference between Fourier, Laplace and Z transforms! This book did not just dump those transforms on the reader and say \\"There you go good luck!\\" Also the chapter on how to get started with DSPs was invaluable along with the explanations of FIR and IIR filtering. For a beginner in DSPs there is no better book than this!"},{"Title":"Digital Signal Processing: A Practical Guide for Engineers and Scientists","review":"This is a great reference book for signal processing. I only wish I had it as a supplement when I first learned DSP. It avoids using mathematical expressions and equations as the sole method of explaining signal processing, as many signal processing books tend to do, and it does a great job of using examples to illustrate many topics. I find that the math of signal processing can get rather messy to follow, so this book is a great middle ground between mathematical rigor and examples. I highly recommend this book to any student who wants a good supplement for their DSP/Continuous class. I also recommend this to anyone just wanting to brush up on their signal processing or want a basic reference in signal processing.This book is probably intended for people just learning signal processing or who are rusty on the fundamentals. That said, it's not a \\"dumbed-down\\" signal processing book by any means. In fact, he puts some more advanced signal processing topics about filters in chapters 14-21. He has some good chapters with applications in chapters 22-29, and the final 4 chapters provide a very good reference for complex numbers and transformations (Complex Fourier Transform, Laplace Transform, and the z-Transform). The book is available online, but you probably know that if you're at Amazon, because he includes a link to purchase a bound copy. There are no homework problems within the book, but he includes homework problems you can do at his website--Google \\"Digital Signal Processing for Engineers and Scientists\\" to find it--for chapters 2-13 available for download in a .txt file. Overall, this is an excellent book that explains signal processing in an easy to follow manner. Note, there is a cd that's included with each copy, if you buy it new, containing homework problems, source code, and the entire ebook. So, if you get a used copy, that's something to consider."},{"Title":"Digital Signal Processing: A Practical Guide for Engineers and Scientists","review":"While reading this book \\"DSP is fun\\" no longer is an oxymoron. I really had fun reading this book. That factor alone made this the best DSP book ever. The content is great too. The author follows one concept to the next in a manner that is very similar to a typical student's thought process. You will be reading a new technique and thinking to yourself, now how is that useful? Then in the next section, or closely following will be a logical progression that will apply the technique and all the way building up to a good overview of DSP. An overview it is only though, as mentioned in other reviews, don't make this your only DSP book.

Due to no competition they can charge whatever theylike (none of the standard workshop manual publishers have written a book for the Corrado - probably becuase less than 100,000 were built so the market isn't big enough).This extremely large book consists almost entirely of diagrams showing the location of every part that is available for purchase from VW. Note this is different to showing the location of every part (eg. note that specifically it tells you nothing about the interior or how to repair the G-lader since VW only sell it as a complete unit, therefore the manual only tells you how to remove it).The book also only covers the North American models so whilst the book would still be useful to Europeans some sections will not be applicable and others will be missing.Compared to a Haynes manual which holds your hand and carefully guides you through most proceedures you have to figure out most methods yourself with this book as it only gives you the bare bones of what you need to do for a procedure. Or it tells you to use a special VW tool which you are unlikely to have. Having said all this, if you are reasonably competent the book is invaluable when doing repairs and is also fairly good at helping you troubleshoot (particuarly on the electrical side of things).The lack of a decent index is irritating (it has a large index which is totally illogically ordered). I can't help feeling it is also excessively large - partly due to considerable duplication of diagrams.So, in summary, this book is not a Haynes manual equivalent, it is a book that a workshop would use to remind themselves of the order in which to perform a job or how to decide which piece of the car needs replacing. It is not a book that you need if all you are going to do is change the oil yourself.

There seems to be a bit of information lacking for specific bits & pieces and for some OEM features, so I would not say it is 100% thorough but I doubt there is anything else out there that even comes close to this. Besides, some of the missing items seem like no-brainers to me anyway. There is one glaring, very high-tech/complicated mechanical omission that still has me in shock that it's not in there.The book must be viewed in landscape, meaning you turn the book sideways and flip the pages up. There are two shrunken factory pages on each page, so at any point when the book is open you are looking at FOUR shop pages at once. Although somewhat handy, the condensed print is annoying especially when looking at diagrams.If you have a Corrado, nee any VW really, and you prefer to turn your own screwdrivers, a Bentley manual is a must have. I have other Bentley manuals for my other VWs, and they seem a bit more informative than this one and have full-size pages but if they did that with the Corrado book, it would be around 6\\" thick.Bentley - PLEASE port all of your manuals to CD or DVD.

The variety of animals on offer is quite wide (100+ patterns). I have made 50+ of them and am looking forward to the ultimate 'animal' quilt they will become.\\"That Patchwork Place\\" should re-release this as an e-book, with a few tweaks to the format(infinitely variable sizing, ability to pack as many block sections as possible on an A4 sheet, etc) I would buy it again!"},{"Title":"Animal Kingdom : CD- ROM More Than 100 Blocks to Paper Piece","review":"If I'm buying software patterns, I expect to be able to print them at my size, not the author's. Printing a pattern and then having it reduced or enlarged at a copy center is not acceptable. I can understand Ms. Rolfe's concerns, but this is inappropriate for this format.Note that, on the Mac version at least, you can print in only two sizes: 6&quot; and 8&quot; blocks (with reverse image options). And, there is no provision for a thumbnail size to use in laying out a quilt on the computer.As another reviewer pointed out, copy center machines are rarely calibrated correctly so output is sometimes skewed. Paper piecing is intended to be exact-- something not possible in sizes other than the author's."},{"Title":"Animal Kingdom : CD- ROM More Than 100 Blocks to Paper Piece","review":"This software includes all the patterns from _The Quilter's Ark_, pluse some new patterns, including DINOSAURS for your little boy!

It takes forever for the patterns to print, and some, like the flying eagle, will not print at all.I have no problem with the limited sizes, but I do wish that the author had broken the patterns down into sections and included the standard 1/4 inch seam allowances for each one."},{"Title":"Animal Kingdom : CD- ROM More Than 100 Blocks to Paper Piece","review":"This CD no longer works on computers with the latest operating systems.

There are 2 pictures of a dolphin project on the sleeve, and several color photographs of blocks on the front &quot;cover&quot;. The rest of the projects are shown strictly by a small color line drawing.I can't say that I'm very impressed with this CD at all. The patterns are definitely cute, although a lot of the design features come from embroidery, and not from piecing the features in. I haven't tried printing any patterns yet because our printer is hooked up to the other computer, and apparently I can't save any patterns onto a floppy. Not impressed.The patterns should have had the seam allowance included, and the multi-piece patterns should print that way - we should NOT have to cut the pattern apart after printing, and add seam allowance. There should have been WAY more color photographs of the patterns, and suggestions for projects - theres lots of room on a CD for these things. Instead of having an index with all the blocks listed (whereby you could pick which one you want to work with) - you get to figure out which section your block falls into alphabetically:Australian Magpie - Butterfly ... Camel - Cow ... etc. etc. etc.I have to say - that is one ODD &quot;index&quot;. There are some excellent instructions on the CD, but you have to choose from 3 instruction categories, and then use arrows to get to your page - you can't directly access the page you want. Again - this isis an extremely odd and inefficient way to do things.If this CD is the &quot;new wave&quot; of crafting books, then it either needs a LOT of work, or else its going to go the way of Beta video recorders. The *concept* of a book on a CD is a good one, but the product - in this particular case - needs a lot of work."},{"Title":"The Bear Flag","review":"How did the forts work with thousands of people enclosed within stone walls with the untamed wilderness all around? Why did some soldiers dress in rags with no shoes while the generals in charge rode horseback and ate delicacies? How did it feel to be alive during that time in history? How did the flag really become official? This story shows you all the events as if you were living through them. Where on earth did a woman fit into that type of life? Read this and you will have a plausible idea. Fill in the holes in your California or American history while you enjoy this book! I loved it!"},{"Title":"The Bear Flag","review":"If only the author could have stuck to the historical fiction she was writing. An interesting story I'd like to read more on and it could have carried a novel all by itself easily. The audience surrogate, Cat Reilly, is a 20th century woman shoehorned into a nineteenth century event, but she does get around into the compressed events and give a good accounting, not only of the confusing series of incidents that led to the capture of California from Mexico, but also of the day to day lives of the people of that time. For some reason, the author didn't trust this story and threw in a romance between Cat and a Russian spying for the Mexicans. For no reason that I could see, they jump into bed together and continue to lust after each other when they're not involved in the politics and warfare of the time. The book is reminiscent of Dana Fuller Ross' Wagon's West series, but with a fuller historical story. Too bad it had to include the romance."},{"Title":"No Chid Undiscovered: Real Education for the Child in all of us","review":"No Child Undiscovered: Real Education For The Child In All Of Us is a guide to how mind-body methods work, and how they can be used in a beneficial program of self-discovery.

Each chapter questions the status quo and offers ideas and solutions for changing our perception of life experiences. An insightful short poem at the beginning of the chapters adds another level of introspection.

In this wonderful book, Kalberg addresses himself to some of the major issues of interpretation besetting Weber scholarship, among which are: the scope and character of Weber's appeal to what is widely understood to be his &quot;methodological individualism&quot; (in dealing with this topic, Kalberg stresses the crucial role of the socially-situated TRAGER (in English: &quot;carriers&quot; or &quot;bearers&quot; of a social phenomenon, e.g., 'the Protestant ethic')): the exact nature of what Weber intended with his use of the concept of an 'ideal-type' (beautifully exemplified by Kalberg in so many passages in his book): the characteristics of Weber's comparative-historical method of sociological analysis (which Kalberg demonstrates is so much richer than later versions of such an attempt, especially in US social science circles): and so much more besides. This is a profoundly rich, historically informed and textually precise work of scholarship. One of the finest books on the great work of a great thinker yet in print. I recommend this book to all sociology students and professionals, as well as to historians of ideas, philosophers of social sciences and to general readers who will appreciate the true richness of Max Weber's genius."},{"Title":"Max Weber's Comparative Historical Sociology: An Interpretation and Critique","review":"I had to tread through this book for a class at university, but it is one of the most valuable books I read in the past year and was definitely worth the effort. I think Stephen Kalberg made a deliberate effort to be vague and ambiguous, and I suggest he take a course \\"how to write so that the reader can actually follow and understand what you are trying to say\\".That being said, I cannot stress enough how valuable the concepts in this book are. Weber's methodology links the empirical reality as observed by the actions of individuals, via the ideal types, to large sociological and historical structures. In other words, he links agency and structure. The ideal type, which is a simplification and conscious exaggeration of essential features of empirical reality into a unified concept, is the prime tool for any sociologist or historian.I don't know if reading The Protestant Ethic will prepare you for this text, as another reviewer suggested. Take your time to understand the book, and you will be rewarded."},{"Title":"Max Weber's Comparative Historical Sociology: An Interpretation and Critique","review":"Provides the Missing Conceptual Framework to Weberian Comparative-Historical SociologyI can only agree with the comments of the earlier review. This is a great book for those interested in Weber or in social theory in general. I would recommend reading Professor Kalberg's new translation of Weber's classic &quot;The Protestant Ethic &amp; The Spirit of Capitalism&quot; before tackling this book. Kalberg's introduction to PE provides a nice intro to this book as well.Of particular interest to me were the varied uses of Ideal Types and how they are shown by the author to have a &quot;broad-ranging theoretical capacity&quot; besides being useful has a heuristic yardstick in sociological comparisons.All in all I came away with a sense of awe and respect for not only Max Weber's, but also Stephen Kalberg's achievement here -- The former in originating and conceptualizing and the latter in synthesizing and reconstructing Weber's intellectually stunning methodology and structure. In short this is a brilliant work from one of today's foremost Weberian scholars."},{"Title":"\\" We'll Always Have Paris\\": The Definitive Guide to Great Lines from the Movies","review":"You would only be looking at this book if you love the movies, and if you love the movies, this is a book for you. The sheer volume of quotes is quite amazing. From the obscure to the well known and loved. It's a great book for compiling quiz questions or to simply flick through if you have a lazy moment.

David Landau's did an excellent job, reporting in an objective and fair manner, with his personable writing style and touches of humor and warmth. Each chapter is devoted to a different aspect of frum life, which makes the information on such a complex world far easier to digest. Landau's breadth of knowledge about frum communities is most impressive for someone who, as I understand, is not an insider (at the time of writing, Landau was and still may be the chief editor of Ha'aretz).There are two reasons I did not rate this book 5 stars: 1) it is dated over a decade. However, I would still highly recommend its purchase, as the frum community has not changed all that much since, especially not in its philosophy, internal debates and structures, which Landau does a great job of canvassing; and 2) I would have loved for the book to be even more detailed, particularly in the emotional and social aspects of frum life, especially the everyday experiences of women and others who do not quite fit into the communal structure, and how they are taken care of by the community (like the childless elderly, disabled people, disaffected youth, etc). Also, a chapter devoted to frum views on the rest of the world would have been fascinating. However, the book was only designed to be a review.I'd rush to buy a reprint with additions."},{"Title":"Piety and Power: The World of Jewish Fundamentalism","review":"Like Christian, Muslim and Mormon fundamentalists, Ultra-Orthodox Jews marry early and have as many children as human biology allows. Like their non-Jewish brethren, they defer to their religious leaders for most important decisions of their lives instead of making them themselves, who try to isolate them from the modern world: no television, no newspapers. Yet there are significant differences. Roman Catholics and Anglicans have Canon law, and Muslims have Sharia law, but these religions do not ask their adherents to spend much of their lives studying them, the way Orthodox Judaism requires all Jewish males to study the Talmud. The incredibly intricate, and to the outsiders ridiculous, constructions of the Talmud have no equivalent in other religions; King David did not commit adultery with Bathsheba because David required all his soldiers to divorce their wives before going to battle to avoid halachic complications; all David was guilty of was slaying Uriah with his sword instead of bringing him to the Sanhedrin. A great many Jewish men in Israel and enclaves in Brooklyn, London and other places spend many years studying such things instead of working or serving in the military, a much greater proportion than there ever had been in prewar Eastern Europe. This is mostly an Ashkenazi phenomenon, though not entirely nowadays; by a strange coincidence, many assimilated Ashkenazi Jews have built intricate intellectual systems: Freud, Marx, Chomsky, and so on (Derrida was a Sephardi, though). Sephardi religiosity is different: a family in Safed once built a shrine to a North African saint, and one member of the family had a dream about this saint having been transported in a spiritual sense from his grave in Morocco to this shrine; the shrine became an object of pilgrimage. Another family built a shrine to the same saint in Ofakim, and it also attracts pilgrims. I wouldn't want to adopt this lifestyle, since it would involve killing my brain (but not my generative organ), and nobody would let me anyway: a baal tshuva (\\"master of repentance\\") is a second-class citizen in an Ultra-Orthodox Jewish community. Yet I am unconvinced that an average fundamentalist is less happy than an average secular citizen of his host country, Jewish or not. A fundamentalist ignores the sciences, considering the material world unworthy of study; most secular citizens go through the motions of studying science in school and soon forget it."},{"Title":"Piety and Power: The World of Jewish Fundamentalism","review":"This is a thoughtful book about the Charedim and their increasing influence in Jewish Society in general and Israel in particular. The author approaches matters from a non-charedi perspective and clearly sympathises with modern orthodox/irreligious Jews, although he tries hard not to be too judgemental. What the book lacks is a sense that Landau is an insider - he clearly isn't and it shows. Whilst you get interviews with a number of charedi leaders you don't feel that you're entering into the charedi mindset. I can't help feeling that without that inside track, many of the positions Landau records sound worse than they actually are. I stress that I'm modern-orthodox so I'm not beating my own drum here. Whilst it could be argued that the book is a look at charedi attitudes rather than a justification of them, the fact remains that a balanced look demands more identification with the charedim than the author provides. However, the book is a good entertaining read and contains a good (and possibly the only existing) joke about Gerer Hasidim. Worth it just for that!"},{"Title":"A Millionaire's Real Estate Secret: Adriana Dodge's No Cash No Credit Home Buying System","review":"As an experienced investor and Real Estate Investing Mentor, Trainer and Success Coach, I listen to numerous audio packages and read several books a year, to stay current with what is happening 'out there'.

The techniques basically involve finding a seller that is motivated, even highly motivated to sell. This might include people in the middle of a divorce, can't afford the payments possibly because of a lay-off or failing health, etc. Ideally you find someone that is willing to give you the house in turn for you taking over the payments. Once you find such a seller, the basic technique she recommends is to land trust to hold the deed with you paying the seller via promissory note.While this technique may well have worked for Ms. Dodge in the real estate transactions she describes, there are a lot of people looking for great deals in real estate. In depressed markets, you may find people willing to simply abandon their property and taking over payments may suit them just fine. In booming markets, it's another matter.My suggestion: Become a realtor, take the class, pass the test, get a part time job selling real estate. If nothing else you'll learn about the law in your area and you might find just the kind of deal she talks about. As a realtor you'll see a lot more houses for sale than you will outside the biz."},{"Title":"A Millionaire's Real Estate Secret: Adriana Dodge's No Cash No Credit Home Buying System","review":"As a licensed real estate appraiser I buy a lot of books on the real estate market to keep up with trends and schemes. While I have no doubt that Adriana Dodge did indeed make the purchases that she talks about in the book and that she knows of other people that have used her method to buy real estate as a prospective buyer of this book you need to know that the method she promotes is not legal in all states.I am not saying that she is doing anything illegal just that the method used is not recognized in all states. Oregon, the state that I practice in, does not recognize land trusts according to the escrow officer that I contacted. Without the trust aspect of her method the existing lender will be notified by the title company when you attempt to purchase the house thus triggering any prepayment clause.So, if you buy this book be sure and verify that the methods used in the book are valid in your state or you might find yourself out a lot of money."},{"Title":"Jeffrey Allen's Secrets of Singing: Male (Low and High Voice)","review":"I would recommend this book with CD. Every voice teacher seems to have his own philosophy, but only with daily exercises can one develop his/her voice. This CD helps me do my exercises and I've seen a dramatic improvemment. Like a personal trainer on CD! Definately worth it. The whole thing is the cost of one lesson with a professional teacher."},{"Title":"Jeffrey Allen's Secrets of Singing: Male (Low and High Voice)","review":"This is the best instructional book on vocal technique that I have come across. I do a lot of singing at church and I already have many exercises that I do, but the manner in which the author describes how your vocal instrument should feel, the shape of your lips, the imaginary route that the air takes on its way out your mouth, up to the imaginary target for the projection of your voice is outstanding. I feel much more confident of my own voice when I have been practicing the easy to understand techniques that the author furnishes. Novice and pro alike can benefit greatly from this book."},{"Title":"Jeffrey Allen's Secrets of Singing: Male (Low and High Voice)","review":"I'm a singer from The Netherlands. I bought this book in order to sing better. I did all the exercises and read the complete book. I have to say: it gives an answer to a lot of questions about singing. But when I decided to take lessons, my vocal teacher had to begin all over again with me. I thought I was doing things right, yet I had created a lot of tensions in the larynx area instead. So my experience is that you definitely have to have a coach who corrects you. This book is a good manual for experienced and trained singers, but not for beginners! It also speaks to much in imaginary terms like 'singing into the mask', etc. I also think that the yawn-feeling, as described, can be interpreted very quick in a wrong way, so that it causes very easy extra tensions. That sort of things is for beginners very hard to understand by themselves. I was trained in Europe by the Koblenz-method (abspannen = let go of the belly muscles in order to fill with air automatically) and the Pahn-methode (Nasalieren = singing nasal as a tool in order to use the larynx area relaxed). This kind of things I don't find in the book. At the moment I am researching the Speech Level Singing method (SLS) by Seth Riggs and I am still waiting for a good book about the EVTS-method. I heard a lot of good things about it."},{"Title":"Jeffrey Allen's Secrets of Singing: Male (Low and High Voice)","review":"The CDs that come with the book offer excellent vocal exercises that strenghthen and expand the voice and range. The book and the CDs are far less expensive than a voice teacher. There is also a poster with a diagram of how the voice is produced-how it resonates throughout the body. An understanding of this is helpful in learning how to &quot;place&quot; the tones.Also, Mr. Allen's descriptions of where the resonators are and what they will feel like if you are singing properly are very helpful.I recommend this book to any singer who wants to get her chops together."},{"Title":"Jeffrey Allen's Secrets of Singing: Male (Low and High Voice)","review":"I haven't even mastered one of the tens of excercises on the included CDs, (you pick one of two depending on your voice), but already I can tell my singing has improved. Allen takes a scientific approach to singing, focusing on sound flow, breathing and other physical ways to project sound. He also looks at singing from a curiously metaphysical (is that the right word?) point of view. He takes it beyond the mental aspects and talks about &quot;imagining&quot; the flow of sound. Controlling the movement of sound waves with your mind, mentally focusing sound waves-he takes an interesting approach that makes learning to sing intriguing, as well as fun. Once you grasp his ideas, you almost immediately hear a change in your voice. His many pointers and tips and tricks and exercises (vocal, breathing and physical) are often times a lot to remember, but at no point does he rush the learner. Nor does he mince words. Many of these kinds of books are filled with random, useless banter-the reader is left questioning why he or she wasted money on it at all. Not Jeff Allen's book. He is clear and to the point, and his studies are actually based on his experience-techniques that actually work.I highly recommend this book for anyone who really wants to learn how to fine tune their singing voice. From professional singers to those looking for Karaoke confidence it is a great tool to have.There is a lot of info in this book but you won't get better overnight. Simply reading it will not improve your voice. You have to dedicate yourself to the exercises and techniques to see a change.That said, though, I give this book 5 stars. Thanks for the tips, Mr. Allen."},{"Title":"Jeffrey Allen's Secrets of Singing: Male (Low and High Voice)","review":"I have tried a dozen books/audio sources seeking instruction to improve my voice. This is truely the best by far, especially for improving range. The CDs should not become the only source of learning. No book or audio is a substitute for a carefully picked teacher, who should help especially with proper placement of larynx and with getting your swallowing muscles out of singing's way. However the piano accompaniment on the CD along with instructions are valuable to give your throat muscles the workout they need for development of a well anchored voice. I had lost the CD so I ended up ordering another one. My volume, quality and range have improved significantly in the last 6 months of use. If you are consistent with your practice the higher notes that feel difficult at the begining start to fall into place. If you are already a good singer the CDs will be a great source for vocal warm up. The theory covered in the book is also quite good but that can be found in any other book on singing. I have not known Jeffery but he has had an impact on my voice."},{"Title":"Jeffrey Allen's Secrets of Singing: Male (Low and High Voice)","review":"I am a vocal method aficionado, and Jeffrey Allen has put forth an impressive effort. He groups each of the exercises into a section dealing with a different part of vocal technique, along with visualizations. The visualizations are probably the most interesting part of his program, and they actually work. This is a big book, that actually applies to all styles of music from rock to musical theatre. The idea behind this book is that it gives you a solid foundation of technique to tackle any vocal challenge. The appendices that go into detail on the different aspects of the voice are invaluable and explain how the singing voice works in a detailed way. Buy It!"},{"Title":"Jeffrey Allen's Secrets of Singing: Male (Low and High Voice)","review":"I bought this book over a year ago and have regularly used the CDs to practice. Comes in very handy on my way to my teacher to warm up whike driving. Since this book I have bought over a dozen books on singing most of which came with some form of audio. By far this is the best of the bunch, though no book is &quot;Everything you wanted to know but were afraid to ask&quot; level. The two instructional CDs are quite well done and are truely helpful for the right student (assuming you have the ability to match pitch with the piano key). Of course no amature singer who is serious about his/her voice should ever totally rely on printed and/or recorded material to realize his/her pottential. A well chosen teacher can never be replaced by a book. That said the scales on the Cds and the accompanying explanation in the text which is in an every day language can be of a lot of help. For the right person this could work as a whole bunch of lessons in between lessons from the teacher adding speed and confidence to the process of learning."},{"Title":"Jeffrey Allen's Secrets of Singing: Male (Low and High Voice)","review":"The book includes all the usual excersises. A great book for beginners or for those who just want to refresh their memory. It covers nearly every aspect of singing. The visualization analogy is interesting but personally I find other methods more useful.As a heavy rock singer this book was a bit of a disappointment. The word falsetto is mentioned only twice in the book and in negative context both times. Also I find the book a bit boring to read, it has everything in it but it just doesn't inspire that much. The methods in the book aims at bringing out the natural voice of every singer and his/hers vocal caractheristics, that is, if you want to copy a specific singing style or want to develop a voice which is far from what you naturally sound like the book is not very useful. However it teaches the basics very well and yes, even I found a few excersises that I might adapt in my everyday training."},{"Title":"Jeffrey Allen's Secrets of Singing: Male (Low and High Voice)","review":"To keep it simple, I think this book is pretty good, it sure did an excellent job with me, I can sing much longer without getting hoarse, more clarity and so forth. The reason why I am only giving it 4 stars is because it's pretty hard to get a grip on these imaginary stuff, like singing through a hole in the wall, face mask etc., it took me like 3-4 months, till once I grasped the actual method of projection he was talking about. But at least when I got it right I was able to identify it as being the correct way.I did gain much clarity and ease of singing by using the exercises on the CD, and can easily sing a 2-3 notes higher than I used to be able too, and I am still going for more. But you MUST practice if you want to see results, and make sure that you are doing things the right way, and if you feel any stress on your vocal cords, then obviously you are not singing correctly.The book also has many illustrations with a pullout of the complete vocal atonomy, which definitely makes it easier to understand to understand the whole concept."},{"Title":"Jeffrey Allen's Secrets of Singing: Male (Low and High Voice)","review":"Being a non-singer my self and very curious if this Book/CD will help me, I purchased it couple of weeks ago.

It hurt. So I went out and hired one singing instructor after another... spending a lot of money... and still no results. I began to think I was stuck with a bad singing voice. So then I started buying a lot of singing instruction books. I got the Seth Riggs book (I imagine actually taking lessons from Seth Riggs would work) and many other books and still... I was not improving very much. Until one day while on www.amazon.com da... da da daaaaa I FOUND THE BOOK! It is \\"The Secrets of Singing\\" by Jeffery Allen. Then when the book arrived in the mail... stupid me I let the book sit there basically unopened for two months! (I was thinking this book and CDs came out in 1994.... it's probably outdated.)Then one day I opened the CDs and put one of them on. I started doing the exercises. Oo... I'm thinking these exercises are kind of hard. Maybe they're good for me. Then I started highlighting one or two pages a day (the book is 377 pages and very easy to read\\u0003... and there's some blankpages in there... oh got through that page in a hurry :) Anyways the combination of doing the exercises AND absorbing the knowledge has transformed my singing voice! I am so happy! Yet, still feeling kind of dumb that THE SECRETS OF SINGING book has been out since 1994... I could have gotten this book years ago and saved myself a lot of money... but most importantlymy music career would have benefited much, much earlier.The only thing I don't like in the book is where it says something like \\"you'll do your best singing between the ages of 35 and 55.\\" Uh... I'm 53 and I guess I only have a year and a half left. (:The bottom line is if you are a singer get the book. You will be thrilled! You will learn for example: when you are singing in your upper one-third of your register you want to modify (or darken) your vowels a tad. Like on the EE vowel you add a little IH to it. That takes away the shrill-like sound. Try it. Think about it like this. Say you want to paint your room the color WHITE. But if you paint it totally WHITE, it will be too bright and unattractive to the eye. So in your bucket of WHITE paint... you add just a few drops of a different color. Mix it all up and you've got a more rounded comfortable color for your room. Now for your singing voice as you sing the EE vowel in the UPPER ONE-THIRD of your register you add a little IH to it. Your sound on the EE vowel becomes more rounded and comfortable to listen to. Remember to only do this in the upper one-third of your register. Sing the EE vowel pure in your lower registers. That is just one tip from this amazing book \\"Secrets of Singing\\". But remember it takes time to let the flower grow. In other words, you let these concepts gradually infiltrate your body. The author really gave singers a gift with this book!"},{"Title":"Jeffrey Allen's Secrets of Singing: Male (Low and High Voice)","review":"I'm so happy my wifey bought me this book and CD-set.

That's for later!For the beginning singer or the veteran singer seeking to correct current mistakes and move past plateaus, Jeffrey Allen's book is a great start.After your inquiring mind moves forward and you start greedily feasting on the techniques of Bel Canto and the Swedish/Italian School, you'll look back at your well-worn book from Jeffrey Allen and say: \\"That's what was being taught here!\\" Well, not appoggio-style breath management in the exact same manner Richard Miller and David Jones teach, but all of the laryngeal-tilt, vowel modification, soft-palate-lifting techniques to balance bright and dark tones are in Allen's \\"Secrets of Singing: Male (Low and High Voice).\\"The CDs are great, too!"},{"Title":"Jeffrey Allen's Secrets of Singing: Male (Low and High Voice)","review":"This book will help the beginning singer understand the importance of correct breathing, resonance, range, posture and focus. The book is complete with diagrams, poster (which I liked enough to hang on the wall in my voice lesson studio), vocal exercises, descriptions and demonstration CD. It follows a clear path of development and I think most beginners will learn a lot from this book. I suspect that most beginning students will have difficulty mastering any of these concepts or exercises without the assistance of a voice teacher. A more advanced student would likely have already covered this material with their private voice teacher. I would recommend this book as a good source of fundamental knowledge for the beginning student."},{"Title":"Jeffrey Allen's Secrets of Singing: Male (Low and High Voice)","review":"This book has clear text, but much more important is it's valuable CD for daily training and warm up. The CD includes very useful exercises like octave jump's, see-saw's, triple note runs for your ears, a great exercise for your diaghpram, exercises to build vibrato, for breath control, a very interesting best blend exercise, good hints for phrasing and supporting exercises like blending different wovels. Simply from A til Z it has every thing for your voice, it is the best vocal training book that I have, (I really have many but if I would find this before, I would probably have only one). There is two CD's one for tenor's and one for bariton's and basses, so you can choose the appropriate one for your voice (and make a backup copy it's really very valuable, make also a copy for your car...). Simply do these exercises everyday, thinking their purpose and wonder yourself. You will see how it improves your singing within a 3 months. And after this period you will be better and better...Thank you very much Jeffrey Allen"},{"Title":"Jeffrey Allen's Secrets of Singing: Male (Low and High Voice)","review":"This is an excellent companion for the conservatory singing student. I can maximise the time I get with my teachers by concentrating on the fundamentals in my own time with the use of the CD excersizes. I found Jeffrey Allens speaking tone pleasant - and he shows a mastery of his own singing voice. The trouble-shooting guide is both informative and well set out."},{"Title":"Jeffrey Allen's Secrets of Singing: Male (Low and High Voice)","review":"I'm not an expert in singing, so for an expert opinion, I'll have to refer to my voice teacher who looked this over when I started voice lessons with him. He said he was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the instruction and was especially pleased that the book didn't give out any bad advice. I only took voice lessons for a short time and turned instaed to this book, and particularly the CDs that come with it. I think the voice exercise CDs alone are worth the price of the book. So much of learning how to sing is experiencing different vocalizations and letting your brain process what they feel like. The CDs accomplish that admirably by offering a comprehensive variety of exercises. I used them to practice driving to and from work and got much better over time."},{"Title":"Jeffrey Allen's Secrets of Singing: Male (Low and High Voice)","review":"this book covers just about everything you need to know, from theoretical and physiological aspects to practical applications. the exercises for range, tone and placement are results-producing. i like the cd's but you have to play with them to figure out how to best use each one - in some cases it may not be possible to use both; at least not in the short run until you get some added notes to your range."},{"Title":"Jeffrey Allen's Secrets of Singing: Male (Low and High Voice)","review":"After having taught music for over 50 Years, I find this book well written and informative, however, for a person having no musical knowledge, it might be just a bit difficult, but with a qualified teacher its a marvelous method."},{"Title":"Jeffrey Allen's Secrets of Singing: Male (Low and High Voice)","review":"The perfect throat book. It got me from singing in the shower to singing for real, and now singing in the studio with confidence. I found his explanation of using imagery to find one's proper tone, well...flat out profound. The real magic came with sharing these techniques and exercises with friends, who didn't sing at all mind you, and seeing how they've found their voices. ...and I am NO vocal coach.If you've been fortunate enough to hire a vocal coach, you will probably find some of this book rather remedial, but it still makes a great resource to fall back on. Without persistent coaching, anyone can develop bad habits over time. That's when I read those first few chapters again, and it knocks me back into shape.Oh yeah...the CDs. Actually hearing proper technique is crucial! Modern recordings press the \\"rough and whiny is cool\\" style. When I show the CDs to friends, they get the same idea. \\"Oh, this is how a low voice is supposed to sound, and that is how a high voice is supposed to sound.\\"Fantastic!"},{"Title":"Jeffrey Allen's Secrets of Singing: Male (Low and High Voice)","review":"If you are serious about learning to sing great from the bottom up, I will tell you the way this book is written will excite you to read it not just once, but over and over again just to make sure you haven't missed a word. It is so well laid out with tips, guides and illustrations that few books contain. If you apply yourself to the exercises and practice what he tells you to, you will be amazed at the results. Worth every penny!!"},{"Title":"Jeffrey Allen's Secrets of Singing: Male (Low and High Voice)","review":"I'm a beginner to singing but Mr Allen describes how our bodies produce sounds and presents some really simple exercises to progressively target and train each of the parts and techniques involved.

An eye opener."},{"Title":"Jeffrey Allen's Secrets of Singing: Male (Low and High Voice)","review":"I thought vocalknowledge's review was good but I would like to go with one less star. There is nothing secret here, just confusing visualisations and difficult breathing exercises.I bought this book when I was hungry for vocal knowledge and skills when I was starting out singing at 18 years of age.Along with a very ordinary vocal coach at the time, the techniques in this book only helped to add to the confusion I was having. All that I learnt from the book and my teacher was that I didn't have enough breath support and that I should practice more. What happened as a result was more tension and more confusion, resulting in me giving up on ever having the voice I was after.Now, 10 years later, I have thankfully found a vocal technique that works for me. I am finding that some of the concepts discussed in this book are becoming my experience now, automatically (like the reverse megaphone for high notes). This is so much better in my opinion than trying to visualise all sorts of things while trying to sing at the same time (which takes enough concentration already).I hope that anyone reading this keeps looking. Vocalknowledge mentioned that he is researching SLS, well this is working wonderfully for me. I tried a few different sources but eventually caved in and bought the one with the biggest claims (hint: add an octave to your range). It cost a lot more but it has been worth it many times over already."},{"Title":"Jeffrey Allen's Secrets of Singing: Male (Low and High Voice)","review":"This is a very good book for vocal training. The 2 CDs in the book are great help especially if the reader feel the book are too thick."},{"Title":"Jeffrey Allen's Secrets of Singing: Male (Low and High Voice)","review":"First of all, let me address the title of this book. Normally I would notpurchase anything with a title so cheesy as to start with the words, \\"TheSecrets of...\\". There are no \\"secrets\\" here. These are all welldocumented techniques that are known the world over. The wording in thattitle makes the book suspect to begin with and places it in the realm ofscams like \\"Perfect Pitch Overnight\\" or \\"Play Like Hendrix in Three EasyLessons\\". Kind of like the \\"Get Rich Quick\\" nonsense in the financialsection of the book store. I don't know why he didn't choose a title thatsounds more serious and authoritative on the subject. There are plenty of\\"magic potion\\" scam music books out there and this one runs the risk ofbeing lumped in with them based on its title. The good news is that it isnot that type of book. It has some shortcomings, but it is a real text onthe subject and not just useless fluff.I won't get into much detail here about the technical aspects of singingbecause I am not a trained vocalist. This book was my first exposure tothe discipline. However, I can offer the following: if you are a trainedor knowledgeable musician this book may frustrate you. The problem is thateverything is described and approached from a purely mechanical/physicalperspective. Nothing is musical. That is, there is very little referenceto anything like notes, chords, key signatures, intervals, etc. Forinstance, there are two CDs - one for higher voices and one for lower.Nowhere is there any mention of the actual range of notes that differ thetwo. You just have to listen to them and figure out what you're morecomfortable with. It is beyond me why he wouldn't say something like, \\"thelow voice CD covers a range from that is generally an octave and a halfleading up to middle C\\". Or, \\"the higher voice CD is four whole noteshigher than the low voice CD and generally starts at the C below middle C\\".There is no such indication of where anything is. You have to just listenand emulate what you hear. The entire text of the book is like this aswell. There is no discussion at all around anything that would requireeven the most rudimentary knowledge of music theory. To me its kind oflike your piano teacher telling you to \\"press that white key to the rightof the two blacks ones that are close together\\". Sooner or later, you needto know that you're playing an E.Clearly it is beyond the scope of most vocal instruction books to attemptto teach anything around music theory. Unfortunately for this book, itseems that he is either assuming you are well versed in music, or you don'tknow anything at all. For those in the former group, it makes for afrustrating time. For those in the latter group, well, I don't know whatgood it is to know physical technique without some foundation in theory togo with it. For the price of the book and the included CDs, though, youget your money's worth. If you're unfamiliar with warm up techniques, theCDs are pretty useful. And the text will at least give you something towork with before investing big bucks in a vocal coach. I just wish he hadopted to speak in the language of music more than he did. Oh, and shall Imention again that cheesy title..."},{"Title":"Kant's Critical Philosophy: The Doctrine of the Faculties","review":"This is a slim volume, unusual because it operates at a very general level across all three of Kant's Critiques instead of the more usual focus on a single Critique. Deleuze's aim is architectonic: to show how the three Critiques fit together to form a coherent whole. This is a valuable undertaking since it's very easy to get lost in the Kantian thickets, which are arguably the densest in all of Western philosophy.Deleuze organizes the three Critiques around the core notion of faculties and the objects over which they legislate. For example, understanding legislates in the faculty of knowledge, while reason operates over the faculty of desire; taken individually, the study of each makes up the content of the first two of Kant's celebrated Critiques. Their respective functions are shown by Deleuze to culminate in the third Critique (i.e. *Critique of Pure Judgement*), wherein the notion of \\"ends\\", both moral and cognitive, reach synthetic fulfillment. Hence, it is in the third Critique, instead of the first two, in which the capstone of Kant's Copernican revolution is reached. Here in the arena of art and aesthetics, no faculty legislates, nor are generic objects present. Rather aesthetic judgement involves the faculties and imagination in a kind of free play aimed at some type of overall harmony. Rather than knowledge, which can only be phenomenal, culture represents humankind's highest achievement and its measurement; and the highway into 19th century Romanticism opens.Kant is a giant of Western philosophy. This book aids in an understanding of his overall undertaking."},{"Title":"Kant's Critical Philosophy: The Doctrine of the Faculties","review":"Deleuze has long apprehended the *Critique of Judgement* as that rarest of philosophical achievements, a work of hoary old age whose radical and \\"deeply romantic\\"(xi) precepts are somberly misunderstood by students, most of whom pass it off as a clunky, fossilized curio of old-school aesthetic theory. As argued in this text, however, Kant's project is sensible (one might even say consummated) only in the light of this penultimate work, the keys to which are well worth questing for: \\"What is in question is how certain phenomena which come to define the Beautiful give an autonomous supplementary dimension to the inner sense of time, a power of free reflection to the imagination, an infinite conceptual power to the understanding.... It is a terrible struggle between imagination and reason, and also between understanding and the inner sense, a struggle whose episodes are the two forms of the Sublime, and then Genius. It is a tempest in the depths of a chasm opened up in the subject. The faculties confront one another, each stretched to its own limit, and find their accord in a fundamental discord: a discordant accord is the great discovery of the *Critique of Judgement*, the final Kantian reversal...the source of time\\"(xii-xiii).Radically, Deleuze follows De Quincey's *The Last days of Emmanuel Kant* by casting the later Kant as a grizzly King Lear of sorts, exiled from his \\"reasonable\\" philosophical kingdom and stepping precariously to a mad song of Romantic apperception. Hamlet's \\"time out of joint\\" becomes the unhinged temporality of movement subordinated and conditioned by time, or the Borgesian \\"labyrinth which is composed of a single straight line, and which is indivisible, incessant.\\" While Rimbaud's \\"I is another\\" becomes the form under which the I affects the ego, or the mind affecting itself, an interiorized temporality that constantly divides us from ourselves, \\"a giddiness, an oscillation which constitutes time\\"(ix). Kafka's \\"The Good is what the Law says\\" reminds us that there is nothing to \\"know\\" in the law, simply that it *is*, and that we only come across this \\"ism\\" through action and execution, by which we must deduce the Good. Finally, Rimbaud's \\"disorder of all the senses\\" becomes that autopoetic civil war of the faculties pushing themselves to act and cooperate in unique and unprecedented ways, leading one faculty to an achievement or realization it would never have had on its own, pushing the known boundaries of genius and creativity, onward to mutation.This is a \\"brief\\" treatise whose length should not be underestimated. As always, Deleuze's exegetical style is diamond-sharp, tracing an analytical razorline through the architectontic reversals of Kant's ever-burgeoning spiritual maturity, from the brilliant technician and moral demiurge of the first two critiques, to the wild, discordant Kant of old age.For those uncomfortable with Deleuze's controversial approach to Nietzsche and Spinoza, this volume is much more Kantian than Deleuzian. But its originalities are impossible to deny, its exegetical precision a godsend. Deleuze's extraordinary personality is stamped on every page, while the unchained spirit of the later Kant shines provocatively through. This treatise should be special-ordered for all university courses on Kant's philosophy. It is an outstanding 20th-century reaction to a now misappropriated philosophical visionary, the grandeur of whose final work is too often obscured by the first two Critiques, which are merely its prologue or conceptual training-ground."},{"Title":"Metalcasting","review":"If you do not have any other books by the author, C. W. Ammen, then this is a good book. However, if you already have &quot;The Metalcaster's Bible&quot; or &quot;Complete Handbook of Sandcasting&quot; then you already have 90% of this book.Most of the illustrations and definitions are right out of these other two books. I was dissappointed with this book because I already had the other two books and bought this book for the new information it contained. There's a picture of a permanent mold being poured on the cover with no further explanation in the book about it. Just a short definition. I had bought this book because I thought it dealt with this process in depth. It does not. The cover is misleading.There is however, a good section on building your own burn out oven for investment casting which is not in any of his other books.As in his other books, some of the definitions are somewhat sketchy. He refers to &quot;sharp sand&quot; throughout the book with no definition of what it is. He tells of a Nitric Acid test for silicon where you let the mixture boil. Does this mean dissolving the metal (bubbling) or actually boiling the acid over a stove. If you try the latter, it could have severe consequences.If I saw this book in a bookstore and had a chance to glance through the pages, I would not have bought it as it's almost a direct copy of his other books.

The lyrical manner and quiet truth of its telling are a rich and delicious read.

Irish wit never underestimates your intelligence, and this book never does either. Hints and fleeting references always come back to haunt you, and the way each of these short stories seamlessly integrate, you will find yourself smiling in admiration. The Quiet Man really captures the flavor of the time, the idealism of the Irish Republic, the heroism of its defense and the realism of hard choices made for that idealism.

Every story is connected; every story gives a different point of view. Pick up this book and you will become enthralled with the stories of the men and women who lived, loved, and fought during the early years of Ireland's fight for independence. While I realize the book is a work of fiction, I found myself, nevertheless, rooting for each person as he or she struggled with the problems the author put before each of them: alcohol, honesty, familial obligations, moral conscience, the love of country. If you like to read of adventure with your romance(or vice versa), these stories are for you. The cover doesn't do the book justice.

John Ford read it that year, and obtained the film rights in 1936.Author Maurice Walsh had finished four interconnected stories (tentatively titled \\"Green Rushes\\") about the IRA and the Black & Tans in 1920s Ireland. He changed names and made minor additions to The Quiet Man to fit it into Green Rushes (Shawn Kelvin became Paddy Bawn Enright, Big Liam O'Grady became Red Will O'Danaher). The current book (minus the Prologue) mirrors Green Rushes, originally published in 1936.I love the movie, but the book reveals more of the REAL Ireland. Maurice Walsh captures the spirit of the country and her rural folk.

It's difficult to find reasonable discussion of the issue on any side. Back in the mid to late 1980's I involved myself heavily in discussions on the internet (in what is now the talk.abortion newsgroup) with all kinds of people on this topic. I debated back and forth with so many people for so long that, after a few years, I thought I had all the arguments (pro and con) memorized. I read a great deal on the subject. The issue was (and still is) important to me because it lies at the root of our society's values concerning human life and dignity. I think it's important to have a well informed and thought out position on issues like abortion. I think I'm drawn to some controverial issues like this because of the way they test the limits and consistency of a person's worldview. Trying to form as comprehensive a worldview as possible has been my avocation for a long time. I'm still a believer in Truth and that it ought to be pursued passionately. With the abortion issue, that pursuit still leaves me solidly on the 'pro-life' side (though I often disagree with many things that people who wear that label do and say). Rachel Weeping has always stood out among the books I have read as the best general argument against the current license for abortion on demand in our society."},{"Title":"Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul Personal Organizer: 16 Month Organzer","review":"The book helped me work things out in my family and things atschool.

There are 11 sections of recipes, including pasta/pizza, chicken/turkey, fish/seafood, vegetarian main dishes, and grilling, and most (but not all) have full color pictures on the facing pages. Each section also has a list of 10 one-step recipes or variations, such as Honey-Citrus Topping for cookies or bananas, or adding fresh raspberries, almonds, and raspberry vinaigrette dressing to a grilled chicken salad.The ingredients lists are manageable and the steps are simple and written clearly. I have been known to run for McDonald's when I open a cookbook with recipes that require pounding chicken to .78 inch thickness, or long lists of obscure and expensive ingredients.The recipes provide lots of variety for our family, and they really are quick and easy to prepare. There is a nice range of healthy choices, and some indulgent options as well. Nutritional information, including calories from fat/saturated fat, is provided for each recipe per serving, in addition to Diet Exchange information (number of starches, vegetables, meats, etc.). Most of the recipes are marked for 4 servings.The format is also user-friendly. Ingredients are listed at the top in bold, and cooking steps are clearly separated from each other, so you can quickly check directions as you go. Since the book has a 5-ring binder format, you get the benefit of having the recipe lay flat, no matter what page you're on.The section divider pages, which list all the recipes for that chapter, are stored in the back, away from the actual chapters and behind the index, which is rather inconvenient. Fortunately, you can move them if you like, since it's a binder.Also, while this book offers plenty of great family recipes that you could also use for entertaining, it's not about the unique and gourmet.While many other books have similar recipes to these here and there, this is the best collection I've found.

Drucker is the most influential management thinker of the 20th Century. This book was first published in 1955 and consists of five parts plus a proper introduction and conclusion. Drucker, in the Preface, explains that the first aim of this book \\"is to narrow the gap between what can be done and what is being done, between the leaders in management and the average\\".The Introduction - The Nature of Management - consists of three chapters. Within the first chapter Drucker explains that \\"the manager is the dynamic, life-giving element in every business\\" and that management \\"is the organ of society specifically charged with making resources productive, that is, with the responsibility for organized economic advance.\\" In the second chapter Drucker explains that \\"management is the least known and the least understood of our institutions\\" and discusses the three functions of management: managing a business, managing managers, and to manage workers and work. The third chapter states that management faces its first test of its competence and its hardest task in the then imminent industrial revolution called \`automation'. Drucker does explain that automation is not \`technical', but primarily a system of concepts, a concept of the organization of work.The first of six chapters within Part I - Managing a Business - uses the Sears, Roebuck & Company as an illustration of what business is and what managing it means. Based upon this illustration, Drucker concludes in Chapter 5 that \\"there is only one valid definition of business: to create a customer. ... It is the customer who determines what a business is.\\" Chapter 6 introduces Drucker's most famous question: \\"What is our business - and what should it be?\\" This does look relatively simple, but it is not simple to answer and the author provides guidance. In the next chapter the objectives of a business are discussed: \\"Objectives are needed in every area where performance and results directly and vitally affect the survival and prosperity of the business.\\" Chapter 8 discusses the tools that management needs to take make decisions today for the result of tomorrow. But no matter how sound the business economics, how careful the analysis, how good the tools, managing a business always comes back to the human element. This is the subject of Chapter 9, which deals with the principles of production.The first of the six chapters within Part II - Managing Managers - uses automobile company Ford to explain that the \\"fundamental problem or order, structure, motivation and leadership in the business enterprise have to be solved in the managing of managers.\\" But he also warns that managers are its scarcest resource. Drucker also introduces the major requirements of managing managers, which are detailed in the next five chapters.The first of the three chapters within Part III - The Structure of Management - discusses the issue of organization structure. The next chapter is concerned with building the structure. Chapter 18 deals with the small, the large and the growing business, which Drucker breaks down into four stages of business size (small, fair-sized, large, very large business). He discusses the problems and potential solutions for each.The six chapters within Part IV - The Management of Worker and Work - discuss the human elements of business. Drucker uses IBM as an example to show basic problems in managing worker and work, and some of the principles for their solution. He also emphasizes that the management of worker and work is a complex subject. Within Chapter 20 he discusses the worker as a resource, the demands of the enterprise on the worker, the worker's demands on the enterprise, and the economic dimension. The next chapter explains that although personnel management is not bankrupt (\\"but certainly insolvent\\") the relationship between a man and the kind of work he does is known due to the Human-Relations school. Chapter 22 details human organization for peak performance or in Drucker's words \\"the engineering of the individual job for maximum efficiency.\\" The fourth chapter in this section discusses the economic relationship between enterprise and worker. This is followed by chapters on the first-line supervisor and on the professional employee (who is neither management nor labor).The title of the final part - What It Means to be a Manager - gives away the subject for the three chapters. Drucker believes that a manager has two specific tasks: \\"The manager has the task of creating a true whole that is larger than the sum of its parts, a productive entity that turns out more than the sum of the resources put into it. ...This task requires the manager to bring out and make effective whatever strength there is in his resources - and above all in the human resources - and neutralize whatever there is of weakness.\\" This requires the manager to balance and harmonize the three major functions of the business enterprise: managing a business, managing managers, and managing worker and work. Chapter 28 deals with decision making. The five phases in decision-making are discussed. The final chapter discusses the manager of tomorrow. Based upon the new demands required, the manager of tomorrow has to acquit himself of seven new tasks.The book is concluded with a proper conclusion on the responsibilities of management. \\"... the business enterprise must be so managed as to make the public good become the private good of the enterprise. ...To make certain that this assertion does not remain lip service but becomes hard fact is the most important, the ultimate responsibility of management: to itself, to the enterprise, to our heritage, to our society and to our way of life.\\"What can one say about a masterpiece like this? Books by Peter Drucker always deserve five stars since they are eye-openers to most of us, but this one is exceptional and possibly the best I have read by him. Highly recommended to anybody involved with management or working within business enterprise, it provides great insights for employees through to chief executive."},{"Title":"The Practice of Management","review":"What can I say about Peter Drucker that hasn't already been said.Written in 1954 it is as relevant to today's world (perhaps even more so) as it was back then. Fundamentally what strikes me about the Practice of Management is that it advocates a profoundly ethical view of management and the responsibilities of management.If you walk away with a just a few of the ideas he presents, you will be a better manager:1) Management by objectives2) The imporance of having the right \\"spirit\\" in an organisation.3) The need for managers to feel empowered and have all the authority they need to carry out their job.4) Appropriate rewards for strong performance and the need for censure when performance is weak.5) Creating an open culture where mistakes are expected and form a basis for future knowledge.I could go on.As a final note, Peter Drucker foresaw one of the most remarkable changes in industry - a change that allowed the movement from vertically integrated industries to a distributed supply chain model - and that strong managers would be needed to deal with it.I would rate this as one of the best buys I have made this year."},{"Title":"The Practice of Management","review":"Peter Drucker wrote this book at the height of the mis-application of statistics and &quot;science&quot; in areas such as management and economics. Drucker, who had the benefit of experience, saw the flaws decades before the rest of us. I suspect that the reason Drucker was so ahead of his time is that he was able to tap the experience of the great industrialists who probably were unwilling to share the trade secrets of their management knowledge with the general public. It wasn't until the 1980s when the masses began to learn these things.The book is a classic and is just as valid today as it was in the mid 20th century (why wouldn't it be?).Drucker explains within the book the reason for the word &quot;practice&quot; rather than &quot;theory&quot; of managment."},{"Title":"The Practice of Management","review":"Peter Drucker needs no introduction.

Here, gathered together and framed by a thoughtful introduction from the Review's editor Nan Stone, is a priceless collection of his most significant work.One of our leading thinkers on the practice and study of management, Drucker has sought out, identified, and examined the most important issues confronting managers, from corporate strategy to management style to social change. Through his unique lens, this volume gives us the rare opportunity to trace the evolution of the great shifts in our workplaces, and to understand more clearly the role of managers in the ongoing effort to balance change with continuity.Now, these important articles and essays are strategically presented here to address two unifying themes: the first examines &quot;The Manager's Responsibilities&quot; while the second investigates &quot;The Executive's World&quot;. Accompanied by an interview with Peter Drucker on &quot;The Post-Capitalist Executive&quot;, as well as a thought-provoking preface by Peter Drucker himself, a complete picture of management theory and practice emerges, both as it was and as it will be.Infused with a perspective that holds new relevance today, these essays represent Drucker at his best: direct, wise and challenging. Peter Drucker on the Profession of Management, sure to be studied, debated, and enjoyed by everyone concerned with management, everyone concerned with management, is a timely offering from one of the most respected and prolific authors to appear in the Harvard Business Review.At 90, Peter Drucker is, by all accounts, the most enduring management thinker of our time. Born in Vienna, educated in Austria and England, he has worked since 1937 in the United States, first as an economist for a group of British banks and insurance companies, and later as a management consultant to several leading companies. Drucker has since had a distinguished career as a teacher, including more than twenty years as Professor of Management at the Graduate Business School of New York University. Since 1971 he has been Marie Rankin Clarke Professor of Social Science and Management at the Peter F. Drucker Graduate School of Management, Claremont Graduate University in California, where he still teaches in the fields of management and business policy. He is the founder of The Peter F. Drucker Foundation for Nonprofit Management, and has counseled numerous governments, public service institutions, and major corporations.Drucker is a writer, teacher, and consultant with a long-term business perspective second to none. His twenty-nine previous books have been published in more than twenty languages and span sixty years of modern history beginning with The End of Economic Man (1939) and Managing in a Time of Great Change; Management: Tasks, Responsibilities, Practices; Innovation and Entrepreneurship; The Effective Executive; Managing for Results and The Practice of Management. Nan Stone is the editor of the Harvard Business Review."},{"Title":"The Practice of Management","review":"There is a lot of self-centered managers thinking they are very good, but in reality they are below average human beings both intellectually and ethically. There are also many managers that are good people and try to do their best. I think all managers belonging to the latter category should read this 60 year old book. Drucker wanted managers to contribute to humanity by being good managers. I would say that it is inspirational to read Drucker's words knowing that they were written such a long time ago. The book is written in a very engaging manner and is not what you would expect for such an old book. Managers today struggle with pretty much the same issues as identified in this book.

Great insight into the \\"practice\\" of management, as opposed to theory. I highly recommend to all of Drucker's books."},{"Title":"The Practice of Management","review":"This book was written in the 1950's. At the time, the concepts of management espoused by Peter Drucker were revolutionary - the result of study and observation post WW-II and his first hand observation of the failure of pure command and control management.If you are new to the topic, Drucker's work is an important foundation for modern management techniques. His observations and insights are as relevant to the human psychology, the practice of management and the theory of business today as they were 60 years ago.Having said that, the book is merely foundational and background now. The modern manager has largely been trained, thanks to Drucker, in his management paradigm. As a result, the trained manager will find some useful nuggets, some interesting observations, and about 400 pages of what is now \\"common sense management\\". The revolution of the 1950's is largely in the past today. The book is less useful or revolutionary today for a manager than it was 60, or even 20 years ago. And for that, Drucker should be commended. However, it makes it tougher to recommend the book for more than a reader who is more interested in the background/foundation it espouses than someone looking for new ideas or fresh thinking."},{"Title":"The Practice of Management","review":"The multifaceted and dynamic world in which we live obligates the actual management to act and react with leonine fierceness, his capacity for being actually in the multiple areas of knowledge, information, behavior patterns, changing consumer habits, emotional intelligence and the undeniable advances in the informatics technology, require a focused man, concentrated but in the meantime deeply informed about an increasing wave of new advances in this competitive environment where the lesser slip an dictate the irreversible failure.Despite the famous article of Henry Mintzberg in 1993 in Harvard Business Review about the fall of the strategic planning, this text is an important guide in which you will find devices, tools to improve your own skills.The greatness of this book is its actuality and that goes beyond another virtue, in a world that goes forward with giant steps.Go for this admirable book in which you will know important anecdotes, and valuable information about the fascinating and every time much more4 exigent and demanding Management Science (or Art?, perhaps?)."},{"Title":"The Practice of Management","review":"A bit dated, but if this book was followed I still think the work place would be much better."},{"Title":"The Practice of Management","review":"To say that this book is remarkably relevant for a publication dating back to 1954 is little better than pointing out that getting out of bed is a prerequisite to a good day's work, or that the 1920 - 1930 architecture of Mies van der Rohe is still the cornerstone of today's architecture. That said, there are many good things to consider with regard to managing a PRIVATE business.Much is made of management's responsibilities toward society. But this seems to me to be proposed from the context of fear and/or reprisal if management doesn't accept such a responsibility. Furthermore, as the example of \`the mystery of the washroom doors' made clear, the managed are content to axe down a washroom door in preference to spending twenty cents of their own money to purchase a new key to replace a lost key, and let the thousands of dollars worth of repair bills fall to management whose fault it was for making a claim for new keys too difficult. \`That'll learn em!'The biggest impediment to management as advocated in this book, is government. Government in consort with a myriad of non-elected bodies now compels a business, through draconian legislation, to conform to a specified role in society. In Drucker's day, this was more a matter of choice. However, with the politically sound MBA acting as the government's executive we have returned to a situation very similar to that of post-revolution Russia where the business was an adjunct of government. This is why the disparity in executive pay compared to the general labour is so acute today. And why this book is outdated."},{"Title":"The Practice of Management","review":"Having read this book, I really am surprised how many of his ideas have stood the test of time. I'm certain many leading CEO's, CFO's and managers have read Mr. Druckers work.One thing I found somewhat annoying is the that this book hasn't been updated to reflect the management of the 21st century. There are managers today that wern't even born when this book was published, so it would seem natural to revise it for the modern day manager.We can not rely solely on ideas of the past, but must constantly strive to create new and inovative methods in our constantly changing economic climate."},{"Title":"The Practice of Management","review":"This book was published in 1954 and given its age it is still remarkably readable. It is chock full of good advice and thought provoking ideas. One of the blurbs on the back of the book describes Drucker as a &quot;business and management philosopher.&quot; He certainly is that. This book is so completely devoid of anything approaching a scientific approach as to be sickening. He frequently says stuff like, &quot;most companies&quot; or &quot;probably something like 60 to 70 percent&quot;. Seeing as how his figures are completely unsubstantiated they do more harm than good. The book shouldn't be treated as anything more than an extended opinion. As near as I could tell there wasn't a single substantiated fact in the entire book. Kinda scary that this is the best that the &quot;dean of business and management&quot; can produce.

Not much, and that's what you'll find here. The sections on the Beatles are sketchy and padded with over-familiar trivia. The post-Beatles stuff is fresher, but like so many biographers Giuliano seems to have no insight at all when it comes to the music. Instead, he babbles at length about Harrison's Eastern mysticism and hunts for anything resembling a sexual or drug-related scandal, digging up barely enough to justify the exercise. There are some good parts like the useful discography and frequent photo sections. And then there's the thematic, semi-chronological organization, which gives Giuliano room to expound on related themes like Harrison's bizarre country estate. Not the most interesting rock bio in the world, but as the author himself notes, you're pretty much stuck with it if you want to read about John and Paul's sidekick."},{"Title":"Dark Horse: The Life And Art Of George Harrison","review":"Giuliano's book is not particularly well written and has numerous inaccuracies but it's not \\"bad\\" or mean spirited. His intent is to deromanticize the Fab Four, maybe, and he paints a seemingly honest picture of a man who is not a superman nor a yogi but a flawed seeker of his own higher spiritual self. What is exceptional in this work is its insight and research into Harrison's Indian spirituality, detailing the various gurus and teachers whose paths he was drawn to and followed. Far more is revealed in this work about Harrison's relationship to the Krishna Conscousness movement from 1969 through the end of his life. Giuliano met Harrison briefly once in the early 1980's through his own friendship with \\"Legs\\" Larry Smith - ex-Bonzo Dog Band drummer, graphic artist, and alcoholic jester to close friends like Harrison. Giuliano ends a 1997 updated final chapter wondering whether Harrison would ever have the strength to disappear from the material world, to truly leave being an ex-Beatle, and pursue the Krishna devotee's ultimate goal of ending his days wandering among the holy sites in India (which Harrison last visited publicly in 1996, but allegedly revisited in September 2001).

Overall, Giuliano's \\"Dark Horse\\" focuses more detail on Harrison's religious beliefs more than anything else. It is well known (of the very few things that are actually known) that Harrison was a very spiritual man; but the extent to which Giuliano documents Harrison's evolution as a Hare Krishna may stem from the fact that the author and his subject practice very similar religions. Certain readers may get bored reading on and on about the history of some of George's spiritual teachers. I wonder if Giuliano thinks he and Harrison are connected in some way? On the back of the book where the review excerpts are listed, Harrison is quoted as saying \\"This guy knows more about my life than I do.\\" I believe George was being a little sarcastic here, something the obsessed author didn't pick up on.Still, the book is detailed in trying to document Harrison's post-Beatle life; his seclusion, his isolation, and his business ventures. I would Giuliano credit for attempting to investigate a man who successfully remained elusive and out of the public eye for most of his entire adult life, but he didn't have to go the length of describing how women felt he performed in bed. When reading a jealous, envious or overly-critical biography on the Beatles, one only needs to remember that one day these books will be out of print, but the world will ALWAYS have the music of the Beatles."},{"Title":"Dark Horse: The Life And Art Of George Harrison","review":"I came to this book with an open mind on the prompting of an offhand remark from George Harrison about the author knowing more about him (Harrison) than he knew himself.I was quickly disabused of any notion I may have harboured about theis being a more authoritative book than most when I discovered that the early pages were very reminiscent of the Hunter Davies biography. Things looked a little brighter upon consideration of the years that followed after the last concert that the Beatles, as such, played in San Francisco, rather than the rooftop performance in Saville Row in London of which this author says very little.Doubts began to creep in as the story (I wanted to say action but given the nature of what followed that was not a good choice of words) developed in the depths of Oxfordshire at George's little place nestling to the rear of Henley Town Hall.I cannot vouch for the authenticity of much of the description of the secret world of George Harrison but therein lies the main problem with this biography. It is almost the construction of a straw man with the intention of pulling him down shortly afterwards. It reads almost as if the author claims friendship and loyalty to the central figure in the book while at the same time doing him down for apparent breaches of his own ethical code. He makes much of Harrison's Hindu beliefs yet appears so judgemental about the use of drugs or repeated tales of secret relationships which may or may not have any basis in fact.A great deal of prose in the later chapters is devoted to the relationship of George Harrison and the devotees of the Radha Krishna Temple but one wonders why the focus shifts really away from Harrison to this particular group.The sources which are acknowledged in the end are quite extensive which aroused suspicion in my own mind over the degree of closeness to his subject that the author really had. After examining them it does seem that the author did not have as much access as one might think.At the end of it all it was like one feels like one has had a Chines meal - the feeling of being full has already gone and one is feeling hungry again.I must admit it was an easy read where the prose flows well. It has all the ingredients of a soap opera, constructed characters who we learn more about as we proceed through the book, a good sprinkling of titllation and salacious moments to keep our interest and dramatic events at frequent intervals. I was more disturbed by the inadequate treatment of Harrison's throat problems which are mentioned but which one would have expected a more serious in-depth and sympathetic treatment,All in all if it is titillation you want and you have a long bus ride to undertake, you could do a lot worse than read this. If, on the other hand you want to learn more about the quiet one, then you should look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Dark Horse: The Life And Art Of George Harrison","review":"Written and not updated 8 or so years before his death, this rock bio dwells too long on George's mystical fascinations.

In any event, while not a &quot;must read&quot;, I do recommend the book to anyone interested in the subject.

Dark Horse lets everyone in on the man of mystery. In the 1980s, Geoffrey Giuliano lived in the unreal world of Harrison and his friends, and by doing this experienced many interviews that make up the basis for his lively and revealing portrait of George. The book contains descriptive summaries of Harrison's life in a very orderly manner. Its hard to learn and write about a life of such a highly private and religious man whose musical associates were far more interesting than he was, which is why I give this book credit. George Harrison is my favorite Beatle and I thought it would be fulfilling to read about his life. At times the author looked at George in a negative way, putting his bad characteristics at the surface. For this reason, I believe Dark Horse is probably not the most interesting rock biography out there, but is a great addition to any Beatle fans library."},{"Title":"Dark Horse: The Life And Art Of George Harrison","review":"Harrison was a great man.

Instead of being a serious and comprehensive biography, I found this work to be little more than innuendo and hearsay. Mr. Guiliano tends to rely heavily upon cliches such as &quot;the Quiet One&quot; and gives a very surfacy overview of the man's talents and musical contributions. He does not provide substantial facts and many of his statements appear to be more of his subjective opinions rather than objective, factual (and hopefully) informative statements about his subject.Read the Beatles' Anthology instead. You will be glad that you did."},{"Title":"Dark Horse: The Life And Art Of George Harrison","review":"If you want more information about the life of George Harrison, this book is DEFINITELY NOT the place to get it. It reads like something out of the National Enquirer. As is the case in most of his books, the author injects himself into it, in this case, making the most of a very short association with George, which his wife Olivia once described in a letter to a British newspaper as lasting &quot;about 10 minutes.&quot; Because of that, the book has little in the way of solid information on George and actually deserves less than a one-star rating. How about a zero?"},{"Title":"Dark Horse: The Life And Art Of George Harrison","review":"There are whole-hearted Beatles fans, who can't pick a favourite, and then there are the ones who focus only on ONE -- the bassist, the guitarist, and so on. And usually, if that's the case, they pick George Harrison.Very little information is known on George so, when I had read basically every Paul McCartney book, I turned to tracking down this rather elusive book (it took me a few months to finally get it from the local library). And I must say I was rather disappointed.There's no substance here. Basically everything is, as earlier reviewers have stated, from the rumour mill. The only light spots in the book, if you're the nebby type, are of Harrison's affections toward his father, Harold, who died in 1977, and his son, Dhani. Parts of the book also show Harrison's real generosity as a man, not Beatle.The speculations become very irritating in some points -- as in the observance of the possible reasons leading to his breakup and divorce from his first wife, Pattie Boyd. Eric Clapton did eventually fall in love with her, and that's well-documented but Giuliano comes up with his own, unsubstantiated ideas about the &quot;real&quot; end of their marriage: George wasn't allowed to have sex for pleasure according to his devout religious beliefs (which has never been proved), and therefore, Pattie was possibly infertile. Giuliano concludes this after Pattie has had two childless marriages. Has he interviewed Ms. Boyd on any occasion? No. So there's no truth here.Giuliano considers himself the darling of the Beatle book community but, it's interesting to note, the best reviews for his books come when the book is based around the Beatles' word themselves. Avoid this book, and stick to George's I Me Mine or the Beatles Anthology instead."},{"Title":"Dark Horse: The Life And Art Of George Harrison","review":"This book is not worthy of being in any store.

It reads as idle and sometimes nasty gossip. There are glaring inconsistencies, and clumsiness with dates, which, considering it's many reprints, is simply unforgivable. The book concludes with a catalogue of dates that shed extraordinary light on the writer's egotism and ludicrous attachment to the subject of the book. I am grateful to the author at least for curing my interest in biography. From now on I'll just stick to the music.

Clearly, he doesn't really LIKE the group that much, as he is hell-bent on demystifying them.With \\"Dark Horse\\" he's set his sights on George Harrison. As usual, he has little actual primary research, looks to limited press/media accounts for fodder, and then takes his common negative \\"demystifying\\" spin to the proceedings. If there's a negative character flaw anywhere in Harrison's persona, that's the one Guiliano settles on as his thesis. No one would ever assume Harrison to be perfect, but in this \\"author's\\" hands the quiet Beatle is simply a lazy lout.Look folks...really...there is absolutely NOTHING whatsoever of value, historical interest or entertainment on this lightweight piece of junk. It's just designed simply to separate the casual Beatles fan from more of his hard-earned money. You're smarter than that, I just know you are.

I should have figured that Creeleywould not authorize a &quot;traditional&quot; biographer, and Ekbert Faas'sjuxtaposition of different perspectives and inclusion of a hugechunk of (Creeley's first wife) Ann MacKinnon's autobiography/diary as a 100 page coda make the book somewhat non-traditional(although the &quot;life-writing&quot; technique, where the &quot;voice&quot; ofCreeley is present in the narrative, should be familiar toany reader of Nick Tosches' fine biography of Dean Martin).Creeley's pre-1970 poems would sometimes take a seemingly autobiographical moment and view it in intense detail, or takea slice of the persona's stream-of-consciousness and break itdown into extreme close-up (not just to the level of the word,but to the level of the syllable). This biography now providesthe &quot;background&quot; for those works. Many intimate details are given, but fortunately we are spared TOO MUCH intimate detailand Mr. Creeley is able to keep some things private!The book also does a fine job of showing Creeley's complexrelationships with literary figures and the literary communityover the years--RC has always devoted a lot of time to championing thework of his fellow writers (and thus turned me onto many writers who have become important components in my life--thank you, Mr. Creeley!).My only complaint about this book is that right near the end (before the MacKinnon narrative), biographer Faas pretty muchtrashes the 80s/90s career of Creeley. It's as if Creeley'swork (and, as written by Faas, his life too!) has become blandand commercial because RC is no longer as combative and angryand frayed-at-the-edges. This reminds me of the people whoaccuse punk-rockers of &quot;selling out&quot; when they stop cutting themselves with razorblades and smashing their heads againstconcrete walls when they get past age 40. What's wrong withMr. Creeley enjoying life more, settling down, finding theeternal verities in the commonplace, and being a happy person?I admire the man's ability to evolve, and his work still useslanguage in fresh and unexpected ways while leading me to seelife and relationships in similarly fresh and unexpected ways.Faas's inability to see the &quot;whole picture&quot; of Creeley's lifeleads me to question how much he really understood Creeley atANY period in his life.Still, this is a necessary work for any Creeley reader or anyonewho cares about post-WWII American poetry.I also commend Creeley for allowing his biographer such freedom (I'm reminded of Bob Dylan's film DON'T LOOK BACKin that way), although I came away from the book with even morerespect for the man. Poetry is an important part of many people'slives thanks to Robert Creeley (both through his own pioneeringwork and his tireless championing of and providing an entryway into others' works), and this book does give the reader a senseof the man behind the work."},{"Title":"Backyard Bouquets: Growing Great Flowers for Simple Arrangements","review":"This is a very nice book with lots of beautifully styled photographs of common flowers in folksy arrangements. Lovely as a source of inspiration for what to grow next. The text covers about 20 perennial, annual and bulb flowers and their varieties with the chapters grouped by the flower shape. The orientation here is on the &quot;Bouquet&quot; part of the title rather than the &quot;Backyard&quot; part. Pretty minimalist gardening techniques. Here's a sample on how to grow bulbs: &quot;Plant them touching each other, water them and wait for the green shoots to show.&quot; If you see what I mean.The book is beautifully bound in the new soft cover style with attached dust jacket.

They must have been created by another entity, by God himself or through His direct inspiration. The human spirit is not that great.&quot;Darwin was wrong. Men have not evoluted since Dante or Goeth.

A monkey that is going to read Faust for the fifth time in four years and still hasn't got it all, and, probably, never will."},{"Title":"Faust: A Tragedy (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"\\"Vainly in the day time labored, pick and shovel, clink and strike.\\" Goethe worked on Faust for much of his career, but composed some of the best of Part II in a time of life when most are in their rocking chairs or in the intensive care ward of the local nursing home. Goethe in his late seventies and early eighties would rise in the early dawn and compose some of the best poetry written. \\"I would elevate my mind to a kind of productivity which brought all this forth, in a full state of consciousness and which pleases me still, even though perhaps I could never swim again in such a river.\\" It has been said that German poetry is difficult to translate or untranslatable, and this seems true with some translations of Faust, but the Norton contains a superb effort by Walter Arndt which appears always so on the mark that one suspects Arndt actually embellishes the German, but, rather than quibble over accuracy, it is all so good you will hardly care. Goethe builds upon the medieval Faust legend as a skeleton for his own writing in epic-poem style with various meter fashioned to fit the subject. Faust, weary of the ways of the world (one can almost hear the 60s hippy) embarks on a journey of self-discovery, skirt chasing and empire building finally ending in his 100th year in the ultimate trip, with a little help from his friend, Goethe. This composition is remarkable in innumerable ways. One can use a thesaurus of superlatives: wonderful imagery, perfect choice of words, peerless imagination, beautiful poetry, a unity to the whole which is memorable, as well as numerous wonderful scenes and lines, and always an intelligence that seems to absorb and understand everything. Of course, one can differ with Goethe philosophically. There are other angles from which to view life than Faust and his Mephistophelean foil. And Faust, which contains all the universal ingredients, can be faulted at times, dwelling too much on the antique philosophy, politics and literary questions which interested Goethe in his long life. But all this seems irrelevant to Faust as a work of art, permanently canonized for its beauty and writing alone, whatever disparagement or praise one might hold for its meaning or content. The Norton Edition is edited by Cyrus Hamlin whose interpretive notes are scholarly, contain a subtle respect for Goethe, and are in themselves a book worth reading. The selections of Goethe comment and scholarship range from the brilliant to the outer eliptics of literary criticism, and the included illustrations and Goethe letters on composition are a nice touch. The work of Hamlin and the Arndt translation which here frame Goethe as the main event make the Norton Critical Edition of Faust (2000) one of the better books one is likely to pick up."},{"Title":"Faust: A Tragedy (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"Having tried my hand at translations myself, I am awestruck by the performance of Walter Arndt. Faust is rightly regarded as a climax in German letters and,together with Don Quixote,The Divine Comedy, War and Peace and King Lear,in world literature. The nobility of its language, the sharpness of its mockery, the breadth of its subject matter and the beauty of its lyricism all make it unique. And all pose seemingly insuperable problems to the translatorWhat should a translator do? Try to convey meaning as literally as possible? Reproduce rhyme and meter patterns as faithfully as possible? Convey the spirit of the work more than its form and letters? All of these are worthy objectives but they all are competing and, seemingly, mutually exclusive ones.It is a measure of Mr.Arndt's artistry that these conflicts seem to dissolve in his text. From the beautiful and melancholy Dedication that precedes Part I to the mystical and esoteric completion of Part II I was unable to find a single jarring note, even though I love the German text with some fanaticism. Compare the following:Ihr naht Euch wieder, schwankende GestaltenDie frueh sich einst dem trueben Blick gezeigtWag ich es wohl Euch diesmal fest zu halten..Once more you near me, wavering apparitionsThat early showed before the turbid gazeWill now I seek to grant you definition...Or this:Alles VergaenglicheIst nur ein GleichnissDas UnzulaenglicheHier wird's EreignisssDas UnbeschreiblicheHier ist es gethanDas Ewig-WeiblicheZieht uns hinan.All that is changeableIs but refractionThe unattainableHere becomes actionHuman discernmentHere is passed byWoman EternalDraw us on high.One may quarrel with the last line (I would have preferred \\"draws\\" since the chorus is not praying but praising), but what matters much more is that the sensation of \\"Ausklang\\", of a closing chord, is reproduced perfectly without doing (much) violence to the meaning.Mr. Arndt's (or are they the Editor's?) generous explanatory footnotes are a mine of erudition and good sense.

It's ability to withstand the test of time and invade our lexicon is proof enough of its greatness and worth more than anything I could say. However, I would like to comment specifically on the Norton Critical Edition.I was not particularly satisfied by this edition. Having never read Faust before, I was expecting this edition to contain within its copious annotations helpful summaries of what was going on in the play. Particularly in Part II, where things are often quite disorienting, a first-time reader would often be lost without some outside help. Unfortunately, this edition, despite all the extras it added, didn't contain what I was looking for.If you are deeply interested in Faust, and familiar with the story itself, the annotations are amazingly detailed, describing the sources and motivations that guided Goethe. If you are a casual reader, however, they will rarely help you understand what is going on if you get confused. This edition is geared towards the scholarly, not the casual."},{"Title":"Faust: A Tragedy (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"At the beginning of English letters there is Chaucer and then Shakespeare. Everyone else comes after. In the beginning of German literature there is Goethe and Schiller. Schiller sounds great when set to music but he is not worth reading unless you want to round out your knowledge of German literature. His pathetic philosophy of internal freedom is a point on the line that ends in the horrors of world war two.Goethe on the other hand is a master that demands reading not just by German literature buffs but by all those who love literature. The story is not original to Goethe and had seen iterations in many languages as both plays and poems. Goethe takes the story and elevates it into a meditation on life and what the best attitude to approach the possibilities of life is. It started out as a play and indeed part I has a traditional dramatic structure. I have been fortunate enough to see the play performed in Berlin in a larger than life performance. It was fantastic. Part I is the far more approachable part of the book. Part II is not really a play at all but rather a novel like tale. In it we see the true message of Faust. The devil gets it wrong and misinterprets Faust's \\"Verweile doch du bist so sch&ouml;n\\" as complacency when Faust means just the opposite. The message (and I won't spoil it any more for those who haven't read it) still resonates today and is just as relevant to the 21st century as it was to the 19th.This play, especially part two hangs over all of German literature, mocking the pedestrian efforts of those who came after Goethe. It was not until the modern period that Germany produced writers of similar seriousness. The big three of modern German literature, Hesse, Mann and Kafka were all influenced by Goethe. Reading these moderns without knowing Goethe is an incomplete experience.This play/book has inspired me for several decades and I will always go back to it. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Faust: A Tragedy (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"Good book in that it had intrepretive notes for the book , illustration for Faust and writing of Goethe on Faust.

Goethe's references and allusions are clearly explained in detail. Despite what one reviewer said, there is much here to fully enlighten a new reader. Be prepared to fall in love.However, this being said, it must also be said that Arndt's translation is far from helpful. For me, it gives new meaning to the term \`obscure, esoteric erudition'. The Stuart Atkins translation from Princeton is much easier to understand even without the copious footnotes given by Norton. Interestingly, Norton provides a thirteen page review of Faust written by Atkins.I use the Atkins translation in conjunction with Norton's notes. This means paying for two books when one ought to do. But, this is hardly a high price to pay should one wish to grasp the thoughts of a truly magnificent mind - that of Goethe. But if one wishes to experience German poetry translated into English poetry then Arndt is recommended. I am sure Goethe's poetry is outstanding. All those who ought to know say so.

Unlike Shakespeare, there is a moral lesson which sums the human experience regardless of one's actual circumstances. By illusion and yearning are we enmeshed in lifes toils, only to find the simplicity of innocence and life's early beauty, before we possessed, was the greatest of our soul. Though greatly influenced by Shakespeare, Goethe takes the life's tale to another level which is wrapped in other dimensions of past, present, and future, in addition to heavens and hells. The Faustian choice is one made everyday and is weaved into every moment, until death and afterwards.An understanding of Indian philosophy (i.e., Buddhism, Hinduism) and the Sanskrit texts brings a deeper depth of understanding, with their complexity and breadth giving greater meaning to a highly mystical and even transcendental text."},{"Title":"Snipp, Snapp, Snurr learn to swim","review":"Snipp, Snapp and Snurr, the three Swedish boys, learn about safety and precaution in this fun tale.The boys spend the summer at a coastal cottage while their father is on a business trip.

Instead it talks about all the various lessons (treading water, back float, dog paddle, etc.). This is good for children who might otherwise get discouraged if they don't seem to learn as quickly as storybook characters.Each pair of pages has the story on one side and a painted illustration by the author on the other. Check out the other Snipp, Snapp, Snurr books (and the Flicka, Ricka, Dicka books)."},{"Title":"Snipp, Snapp, Snurr learn to swim","review":"I purchased this book with others to prepare and get my boys excited for swim lessons.

I'm very please the entire transaction."},{"Title":"Gettysburg July 1","review":"This book is soooooo good. I read Pfanz Day One and Martin's July 1st back to back, and without a doubt, Martin gets the nod. Pfanz book is wonderful, don't get me wrong, but it reads too matter of factly and there weren't as many of the analytical remarks I was expecting. However, Martin provides many more details, but also a lot of the analytical questions and answers that makes reading about the battles interesting.Maps are excellent and numerous. As usual, a few more wouldn't have hurt, but I'm happy with the ones they had.I read the \\"revised\\" version so I had no troubles with the editorial mistakes like some others. Just make sure you get the revised copy.The flow of battle is a little tricky to handle because you have multiple troop movements, engagements, important orders going on at the same exact time. Martin's style is to stick with one \\"action\\" all the way through. For instance, the action at Barlow's Knoll leads to Kryz's moving in reenforcements, which leads to Union retreat on the right, which leads to Coster's stand, etc. Then he goes back and handles the entire action of Pender's action which was happening at about the same time. I prefer the style that jumps around from section to section so you can read the actions in a chronological order, but Martin handles his style quite well.Simiply put, the amount of research, details, and nuggets of info (i.e. stories of valor, etc.) are excellent and well worth the price, and make an excellent addition to your civil war book shelf and most certainly your GB collection. This book is for the more advanced student, so beginners are better off starting with an entire campaign or battle book (like Trudeau or Sears) before tackling the micro study."},{"Title":"Gettysburg July 1","review":"First off, when you get this book, make sure it's the revised edition. Amazon only carries the revised one now so if you order through them you'll be sure to get it. It has eliminated the errors in the first edition that previous reviews make mention of.As far as the book itself, I have read a lot of Gettysburg books and this one ranks up there with the very best such as Harry Phanz's book on the second day. It is an incredibly detailed account of the event of the 1st day.There are two things about this book that most impressed me. First is the way Martin approached the battle itself. Rather than cover the entire battlefield together in one timeline, he approaches sections of the battle separately. It's almost like the book is a series of smaller books. He will take a brigade such as Cutler's Brigade and concentrate on them rather than try and insert into that narrative what was going on on other parts of the field. Then he will back up and cover in detail other regiments or Brigades that were going on simultaneously that are connected to the previous section and so on.The result is he'll do Cutler's Brigade and then back up a bit and cover the 6th Wisconsin and how they connected to what was happening and then Stones Brigade. It allows the reader not to be overwhelmed with to many units at one time and develope a clear view about how it all fits together.The second thing is Martin goes into details on certain controversies. Rather than say \\"this is definitely what happened\\" he will explain that there were alternate views of the same thing and then explain why he believes one has more merit than the other.The only criticism I have of this book are the maps. I've walked the areas of the battle numerous times so I am familiar with the terrain but not everyone has had that chance. Many of the maps in the book cover the entire Gettysburg area as far south as Big Round Top. Far to wide ranging when you are dealing with regimental level actions on McPherson Ridge. The book would have served the reader better with more maps that covered a smaller area and just a few showing the entire Gettysburg area.In short, this is a book that belongs in the library of anyone who has a strong interest in Gettysburg. It covers the first day in a way no other book does. It will become a prize book of reference for those who own it."},{"Title":"Gettysburg July 1","review":"David G.Martin gives us a detailed look at the first day at Gettysburg. A day usually neglected by most. He has done a good job. He paints the picture without fine brushstrokes. The engagement of July 1 is able to be held in your hand and..(most importantly) it can be followed easily. It is detailed, informative and full of incidents that make up a battle. A battle as important as this needs a good opening. Martin gives me that. Worth the read for the appendix alone. Against all the other books that concentrate on other events at Gettysburg it is good to have one that makes you cross the fields of the first day. He has taken his time analysing and gathering facts and gives good service allowing the reader to see several viewpoints at a time. There is a possibility that a few minor details may be 'here say' but in the smoke of battle who sees the entire picture? David G Martin gives the best picture of the first day at Gettysburg I've read. Glad I have it amongst my collection."},{"Title":"Gettysburg July 1","review":"The battle of Gettysburg (July 1 -- 3, 1863) continues to fascinate scholarly and lay readers alike. The battle can be explored from innumerable perspectives and with a greater or lesser degree of depth depending upon the interests of the reader.David Martin's study, \\"Gettysburg, July 1\\" is a thorough, detailed study of the first day of the battle, of the events leading up to it, and of the impact of the first day's fight on the remainder of the contest. The book examines day 1 of Gettysburg on the macro and micro levels. Martin discusses the strategies of the Army of the Potomac and the Army of Northern Virginia after they stumbled into each other on July 1. But in addition to command decisions, Martin gives great attention to the battle on the division and regimental levels. He also painstakingly describes and analyzes many anecdotes, legends, and accounts of individual soldiers. The detail may make it difficult for the reader to separate the important from the secondary, and it makes the account repetitious at times.Together with his account, Martin offers his own assessment of the course of the battle and of the decisions of the commanders. At times he falls into speculation and into \\"what-ifs\\", but he is clear to indicate to the reader when he is doing so. Martin is critical of the Union 11th Corps, of Union Generals Howard and Slocum, of Confederate commander Robert E. Lee and of Confederate Third Corps commander A.P. Hill. He praises the Union First Corps and Generals Meade, Hancock,Reynolds Doubleday, and Buford. His analyses flow well if slowly from his factual presentation. Martin treats his subject with seriousness and respect.The reader would be well advised to begin this book with appendix 2 which is an outstanding account of the topography of the first day's battlefield and of the road network surrounding Gettysburg. These factors are critical in understanding the events of July 1. I also thought the maps in this book were highly useful in understanding the battle. The maps are of two kinds: a \\"situation\\" map showing the position of the troops at a given point in time and an \\"action\\" map focusing on an incident of the battle -- for example Confederate General Iverson's ill-conceived attack on Baxter's troops early in the afternoon.Discussion of July 1 at Gettysburg almost always focuses on the Confederate's apparent failure to follow-up on their success and attack the heights -- Cemetery and Culp's Hills. Martin does a masterful job of showing how the Confederate decision was in fact a sum of many small decisions. I found his analysis helped me a great deal in sorting out and understanding this controversial issue. Martin concludes that General Lee (not General Ewell, comander of the Confederate Second Corps) was responsible for the decision not to advance on the heights and the attack probably would have been unsuccessful if it had been attempted.As I indicated at the beginning of this review, there are many ways of approaching the Battle of Gettysburg and many levels of detail that may interest different readers. I suggest that this book can best be read by readers who have a good grounding in the Civil War and, more particularly, a good background in the battle of Gettysburg itself. But because of the detail of this book, I suggest the reader also have examined something of the first day's actions before tackling this study. I recommend Warren Hassler's shorter account of day 1 \\"Crisis at the Crossroads.\\" Harry Pfanz's study of day 1 is also a detailed and lucid account, and shorter than Martin's book.This is a thorough account of day 1 at Getttysburg that will appeal to readers with a passion to learn everything they can about this important event in our Nation's history."},{"Title":"Gettysburg July 1","review":"Martin can easily rank up with Harry Pfanz's work. Martin has taken the first day at Gettysburg and offered an absolute, extensive and highly detailed study of the events. Martin rarely misses a regiment's detailed movement that can often be over looked in books that consider only the first day of battle at Gettysburg. It was interesting reading about the 1st Corps movements with General Reynolds and what I liked about Martin's book, was that he was fair and brought myths or otherwise cloudy possibilities to better reasonable conclusion. Events such as where Cavalry was positioned, the death of General Reynolds and even Slocum's slow cautious movements towards Gettysburg where very thorough. Martin also considers the time elements as well. He brings in various witness accounts and has well over 100 pages in references to back up his points.I highly recommend this book for those seeking a very deep understanding of the events on July 1st at Gettysburg. This book may be too deep for novices or people just starting to read about the battle."},{"Title":"Gettysburg July 1","review":"In his book, Martin has done for the First Day of Gettysburg what Harry Pfanz did with his two books on the Second Day's actions. The author has obviously done a great deal of research on the minute details of the movements and actions of many of the regiments involved on Day One. Of special mention is the lead up to July 1 and also the afteraffects, including answering some &quot;What If's&quot; that are intriguing. My only fault with the book is some incorrect information regarding some facts on the 26th North Carolina, which by itself is not crucial, but if the same is true of information regarding other units of which I am not familiar, it could be a problem. But do not let that criticism keep you from purchasing this book."},{"Title":"Gettysburg July 1","review":"As mentioned...get the latest edition you can find.Martin writes a wonderful book. With Pfanz in hand, you will have Day One covered. Each is just enough different to compliment. Martin is more detailed...and hence is prone to some small error...but the pile of information he brings is worth the nit picking shortfalls.I would recommend you read them in tandem. But, Martin jumps around a little more than does Pfanz. Solid book. For the student of the battle."},{"Title":"Gettysburg July 1","review":"This book gives a very thorough breakdown of the many events on July 1st. Very good as a resource for fleshing out any generic overview with nitty-gritty details. Mostly impartial, presenting both sides of various arguments with no apparent bias."},{"Title":"Gettysburg July 1","review":"Gettysburg is a three (3) day battle, but most coach High School teachers focus on the last 24 hours. (Coach history teacher's kill a childs desire to read more about history.) Until I visited the National Battlefield I didn't even realize what I'd been missing. This visit changed me and I started doing two things. Studying Civil War history, something I'd never done before thanks to poor history teachers in High School. (He was also poor at coaching, we never won a game.) I also, started looking for a book detailing the 1st days action and found that one did not exist. Now one does! This is a must for anyone interested in Gettysburg! The author has gone to all the trouble of researching all the various books on the subject bring a spotlight on the conflicting stories and bring the reader as close to the action as can possibably be achieved without actually taking part in the battle itself. (The author also has saved you the time of rearching all those books yourself, now you can sit down by the fire and just enjoy reading about the actual battle.) After reading this book you will probably know more about what actually happened, than the actual participates did themselves. BUY this book and read it. It is a must for anyone seriousally interested in the Civil War! You'll thank me"},{"Title":"Gettysburg July 1","review":"Kudos to David Martin! He has demonstrated a rare talent by simultaneously providing historical accuracy while maintaining a vibrant stream of heartfelt prose. Gently carried into the context of Gettysburg, this author drew me ever closer to the battlefield. A subtle transformation then occured and I soon found myself scurrying for cover (through mud, rivers, blood and cannon fire). I strongly encourage this text for anybody with an interest in the civil war (and even those without!)"},{"Title":"Gettysburg July 1","review":"Martin's book is excellent - so full of facts that would take you years to learn about elsewhere. (I emphasize FACTS, because Martin takes great pains to document everything he says. If there are two or three versions of an incident, he presents all of them for the reader to decide based on the best evidence.) I have been studying and visiting Gettysburg for more than 25 years and I found this book an excellent addition to my library. My sole criticism is that the maps (of which there were many) were still too few in number and insufficient in detail. I hope that this deficiency is remedied in the next revision of the book. Buy it - it's a GREAT book!"},{"Title":"Gettysburg July 1","review":"An extremely detailed overview of the first day's action. However, the book was somewhat disappointing due to the authors occasionally choppy writting style. However, for a study of the first day, there likely isn't a current book that tops Martin's work. There's about 170 pages between the Iron Brigade's capture of Archer and their final defense of Herbst's Woods! If you're looking for practically a minute-by-minute study, I recommend it."},{"Title":"Gettysburg July 1","review":"Not an easy book to read. With most CW books by the time I have read about 1/4 of the way through I sense a flow of words. I never got there with this book.

This book is riddled, indeed swamped, with factual mistakes. Professional historians and guides dismiss it, yet it remains publicized and for sale at supposedly legitimate literature outlets such as the visitors center at Gettysburg National Military Park.

My copy is the only book I own that has as many markings of corrections, completely wrong Generals, and questions marks as this one. A work that strove for greatness, insteads rates the status of &quot;Great Verbal Hulk&quot;. The man who brought numbers to history in a substantive way, should have put as much care in the editing. Complexity is an inherant quality, it cannot be made simple, but can be made CLEAR!. CLARITY - the only true hope of a historian. Thus the lousey editing and errors mage what could have been a great work amuddled confusing mess. Next time, Mr Martin edit, edit, edit - think clarity and hire Mr Pfranz's mapmaker.

The first issue contained numerous errors, the revised is only slightly better. Too much of Martin's writing is superficial andplodding.

This is Rafe's story, and it is a book I've been waiting to read ever since I read The Bargain (the end of The Bargain is reprised from Rafe's point of view at the beginning of this book). In The Bargain, Rafe was presented as a cynical rake with shadows in his past, and I was really looking forward to learning more about him, particularly after meeting him again in Thunder and Roses.I was a little disappointed in this book, however. Rafe shares the limelight here with Robin, the hero of Angel Rogue, and as such we don't learn as much about him as we would like. Minor characters also occupy far more of a centre-stage role in this book than in other Putney novels, to the point of having entire scenes written from their point of view, for example.Maggie, or Margot, is a fascinating heroine, and I enjoyed her relationship with both Robin and Rafe - and yes, she did choose the right man!But I had wanted so much to get to know Rafe properly, and - particularly after reading Thunder and Roses, which is just *so* good - I found this book ultimately a bit unsatisfying. I will no doubt read it again, but by no means as often as I'd re-read Thunder and Roses and The Rake."},{"Title":"Petals in the Storm (Fallen Angels Novels)","review":"Petals in the Storm comes as the second in the Fallen Angel Series. If you pay attention to the time line though, these books are not really in chronological order. Rafe, the Duke of Candover and the oldest of the Fallen Angels, fell in love right out of school. However, this young man that always was an aristocrat and rarely showed weakness let his pride and anger ruin his chances with the girl. When a mission takes him to Paris, much to his surprise his contact turns out to be the girl only she's now in disguise and one of the best spies for England. Margot Ashton is not the same girl that Rafe fell in love with. She has known excrutiating pain at the hands of men and only trusts one man explicitly... Robin, her protector of many years. As Rafe works through his feelings, his jealousy grows towards Robin and his fear for Margot in this dangerous masquerade begins to consume him. In the end, Rafe, Margot and Robin face their greatest enemy together and find an unlikely alliance that leads Margot and Rafe to the love they denied so many years ago. It's worth having for the bookshelf. It's more whodunit than romance. The sensuality is not really there like in Thunder and Roses. But it's still a good read and I really liked Rafe from his other roles in the Bargain and Thunder and Roses."},{"Title":"Petals in the Storm (Fallen Angels Novels)","review":"Well, I must say, this is not one of MJP's better books. The hero is a jerk throughout the majority of the book, and when he finally discovers how wrong and stupid he had been, it is a little too late for me. Thirteen years too late.As a 21-year-old boy, Rafe falls in love with the beautiful Margot. Eyes meeting across the room, two hearts beating as one, etc. Then a man of his crowd, (Oliver), someone he barely knows, someone he characterizes as an \\"oaf\\" boasts that she had sex with him. Never mind that Oliver is not a friend of Rafe's. Never mind that Rafe is supposedly sooo much in love with Margot. He just assumes that this woman he loves is a ... (After all, Oliver went to Eton! He is of the nobility! Such a man would never lie! She must be a harlot!) So Our Hero rushes off to accuse the woman he loves of being a ..., she throws his ring back in his face, and leaves.Thirteen years later. Rafe has turned into a rake who beds every woman he can get his hands on, even if they are married. (But that is all right, he had a disappointment in love, so he can be as sluttish as he wants) Going to Paris to work for England (Although what qualifications does he have, besides jumping the bones of every wife in the foreign service is never made clear) He meets... you guessed it. Margot.Well, he immediately has two goals: to prove her a spy and a traitor, and to get her into bed. She is, after all, a ... She has been living on her own for years in France.One thing that disturbs me about this \\"tormented\\" hero is the fact that he is so bitter and angry about something that happened THIRTEEN years ago. His malevolence towards Margot is nauseating. Even if he had good reason to think the worst of her (he didn't), he should have gotten over it after more than a decade.And how does he finally discover the truth? Another man reveals to him that good 'ole Oliver is a traitor. ONLY THEN does he realize that a nobleman can (gasp!) lie.I mean, it's hysterical. Rafe lives in a society of hypocricy, casual adultery, and promiscuity, but can't get it through his head that a man who has a title could LIE. (\\"Now, really. Oliver is a boor and an oaf, and he beats his wife, but do you expect me to believe that he would lie about a beautiful woman having sex with him?\\") No, it is much more logical that your fiance is a harlot than to believe that a man would lie about his conquests.The fact that he convicted her on nothing more than the \\"confession\\" of a man that he KNOWS is a boor and an oaf (HIS description of the \\"honest gentleman\\" who Margot supposedly cuckolded him with) is bad enough. The fact that he uses his long-ago heartbreak as an excuse to behave like a ... himself is the worst part.I have to tell you, the scene where he discovers exactly what the consequences of his actions were (and they were awful) is the best part for me. While he was cavorting with married women, Margot was... well, read the book. Rafe did not grovel nearly enough for me to forgive him."},{"Title":"Petals in the Storm (Fallen Angels Novels)","review":"Contrary to what the person below said, this book had a lot &quot;of intrigue and suspense, and of course, passion and tension and humour.&quot; Saying there was a lack of all of the above makes me want to ask, &quot;Did you READ THE BOOK?&quot;The book was really good, and it kept me interested all the way through. Rafe, the main character had to share the spotlight with another handsome, dashing fellow.. Robin Andreville (who has his own story in Angel Rogue). I liked Robin a lot. Very honorable, amiable guy. And I felt closer to him than Rafe... which is the wrinkle I find with Petals in the Storm. Though I love this book, and I would have to say is one of the better Fallen Angel Series (and trust me, all were exceptional!), I walked away from it not truly knowing Rafe as well as I feel I know the other Fallen Angels. I don't know.. was it because Rafe had the least demons among all of them? He makes appearances here and there in the other books, but he's not as distinct as Nicholas, Michael, or Lucien. The most distinguishing factor about him is his &quot;Duke stare&quot; and that's it. I want to know MORE of him, but alas, his story is over.. and a good story at that.. very suspenseful. Highly recommended! Hopefully it gets back on print so I could get a copy!Suggestion: Have Rafe make a larger appearance in some new book...like Nicholas' role in Shattered Rainbows... something that would give more windows into Rafe's character."},{"Title":"Petals in the Storm (Fallen Angels Novels)","review":"I finally finished the Fallen Angel series. I purposely read them slightly out of order just to save Rafe for last. He is mentioned in all the other angel series with smaller roles and I just could not wait to find out about him. My greatest disapointment was the lack of background, in many of Ms Putneys other series you get atleast 1 chapter or maybe a few pages of background or &quot;flashback&quot; to the hero/heroines past. I basically learned nothing (in the few paragraphs written) of what made Rafe &quot;Rafe&quot;. He is painted to be a very easily led if not somewhat naive person. Maggie/Margot is a believeable character based on her past experiences. I thought that there were too many other characters holding starring roles towards the end of the story that at times it was confusing as to who they were and why they appear in the story. I skipped over many paragraphs in order to hurry up and get to the point and bring this book to an end. If you have not yet read the angel series, I suggest reading Rafe's story first to get it out of the way, it will not &quot;ruin&quot; the plots and twists of the other storys. It actually gives you a better understanding of the roles all of the others played in the war."},{"Title":"Petals in the Storm (Fallen Angels Novels)","review":"If you came to this book, after reading THUNDER AND ROSES (the story of Nicholas and Clare) and THE BARGAIN (the rewrite of THE WOULD-BE WIDOW) in which Rafe, Duke of Candover plays an important part, you will find this book to be a let-down in many ways. I suppose it is hard to satisfy all persons, and much in the way that many Jo Beverley fans felt let down by Rothgar's own book (DEVILISH), many of Putney's fans felt disappointed by this book. Why? Well, the Duke of Candover somehow does not seem the same man that he appeared to be in the other books. The heroine is certainly right for him, but unfortunately there are two problems. For one, the political/intrigue part of the story is so strong that it completely overwhelms the romance, both in terms of space allotted in the book and in terms of interest level. Quite frankly, I spent more time trying to follow who was duping whom, rather than worrying about the love triangle in this book. Which brings us to the second problem. The love triangle. Is Margot really in love with Robin and he with her? Why does Robin get such a major part in this story? Yes, he is an interesting character (and I look forward to reading his own story ANGEL ROGUE). But alloting so much time to him and his complicated relationship with Margot means all the less time spent on the relationship between Margot and Rafe.Like another reviewer, I have no doubt that she chose the right man. I only wish that the book had been more about the couple. I also wondered how their love as teenagers (virtually) was sustained well into adulthood. I find the theme of separated young lovers sometimes hard to believe, given that people change over time. If Rafe and Margot had been allowed more time together in the story, this theme could have been developed more - especially how Rafe adjusted to the new Margot, and not just her &quot;dark secrets&gt;&quot;"},{"Title":"Petals in the Storm (Fallen Angels Novels)","review":"PETALS IN THE WIND is one of several novels that together make up Ms. Putney's FALLEN ANGEL series. As a whole, the series is thoughtful and mature, yet passionate, without losing the sense of wonder that draws the reader to romance novels. The hero and heroine of the story are strong-willed, compassionate, and prideful ex-lovers, who after many years of separation and tragedy, must learn to forgive each other and themselves. The background for the lovestory is the political intrigue that took place during the peace talks following the Napoleanic Wars, and the story introduces the hero in Ms. Putney's later novel ANGEL ROUGE. This novel deals with mature themes while being entertaining, and without becoming morose or preachy.

Our author also manages to sneak in several warm messages of a woman's resilience and ingenuity.Unfortunately, I could never quite come around to the hero after seeing him in all his wondrous arrogance and self-centeredness. It was a little like watching a romantic movie when there's no chemistry between the two lead actors."},{"Title":"Petals in the Storm (Fallen Angels Novels)","review":"Mary Jo Putney is very fond of number 12. Often, her heroes are separated for 12 years. And often, the reasons for such a long separation are not very convincing. ***spoiler warning*** The same is true for this book: because of Rafe's jealousy and Margot's pride they separate, and the consequences are - in her case - absolutely horrible, and - in his case - saddening. 12 years later they meet again and try to uncover the plot to assassinate one of the lead figures in Paris peace conference. What follows is a boring, detailed struggle to find out who the assassin is, with some romance to spice up the story. I didn't like the way all the European countries were portrayed - as greedy, vengeful countries without honor, while England was the sound of reason, sportsmanship, fairness etc. Come on! There was not much romance in the book, and I really disliked the way - and the reason - they made love for the first time. I don't find it believable to still be in love after 12 years of separation. After such a long time, anyone would get on with his or her life, no matter how special and disappointing first love was. I would like this book much more if they separated for 2, 4 or even 5 years, but 12 years is simply too much. And I doubt she would choose Rafe over Robin, because she knew the other man very well and loved him a lot, while she and Rafe were practically strangers. I usually rate the book according to how many things in the story I would like to change - and in this book, I'd like to change many, many things. However, this is still a nice, flowing, easy-going book, and even though it's not Mary Jo Putney's best, it is still so much better than other author's best efforts."},{"Title":"Petals in the Storm (Fallen Angels Novels)","review":"When we first met the Fallen Angel Rafe, Duke of Candover, in Thunder and Roses he was a decent though decadent chap. He had wealth, power and a different blonde mistress every season. His friends said he had once loved a girl in his early seasons and her loss jaded him. So now it is time for him to find romance and a lifetime of happiness.So what does Putney give us? The story of Margot (aka Maggie), the girl Rafe loved and lost. She turns up a dozen years later as a French countess embroiled in a plot to sabotage the peace negotiations to end the Napoleonic War. Rafe is immediately drawn to her and yet still distrusts her. After all, she supposedly slept with another man just before their wedding a lifetime ago.The trouble with this novel is the melodrama surrounding Margot's secret past. She was innocent of betrayal a dozen years ago but Rafe was the guilty one. While he brooded in his opulent mansions she was off in disgrace in war-torn France with her father. Wanting to describe the terror of the period and explain how Margot came to become a sophisticated spy, Putney gives us the story of what really happened to this betrayed girl. A drunken French mob of soldiers got hold of her and her father. They murdered him in a most gruesome way, which of course is vividly described to us. Then they held her captive for several days and gang raped her while they worked their way through the wine cellar. If not for wandering English spy Robin there to rescue her, she would have died at the mercy of these brutes. Brutes who apparently left to fight another day with no clear description of what became them. There was just a faint hope they had died in the ensuing war.The horror of what Margot experienced was far too real for women of the time. Including it gave her too tragic a back story for this romance. Once you learn what she survived and how it was Robin who had saved her then protected her for a dozen years even becoming her lover and teaching her not to fear sex, you don't want Rafe to be the hero of the novel anymore. He loses all his rights to be a hero. After all, if not for his youthful arrogance, she never would have been at the mercy of the French. He spent 12 years brooding and fornicating while Robin was the one providing a home and love to abused Margot.But in order to cobble together a romance, Putney gives us a very lame setup. Robin steps aside to allow Rafe one last shot at winning her hand. Then Rafe uses some twisted form of sexual healing to help Maggie get over the last of her horrible memories. Of course it is only the magnificent Rafe who would know Margot felt alone because of her rape. As if Robin or any other person with a brain hadn't figured out an orphaned captive girl would feel alone and terrified by what the soldiers did to her? A pain that magically disappears with orgasm. This is Putney's form of purple prose: sex heals all.This novel is painful to read because it literally drowns in melodrama. There is no happy ending. There is only pain and regret caused by the horrors of war. Rafe deserved a better story. Margot deserved a better hero. Skip this one and move on to better. Thunder and Roses (Nicholas' story) and One Perfect Rose (Stephen's story) are the best of the Fallen Angel series. Robin's story (Angel Rogue) is moderately better but again you're haunted by his lost love affair with Maggie. Luce's story (Dancing on the Wind) is plagued by the writer's obsession with \\"twin-ness\\". Michael's story (Shattered Rainbows) is half spent in a man's obsession with a married woman and the other half a hairbrained manhunt. River of Fire (Kenneth Wilding's story) is neutral though unrealistic in how men & women would conduct themselves in historical times after consummation. (It's a brilliant description of the early 19th century artist's world, however.)Putney is an excellent researcher. She portrays this historical time vividly. Her writing is fluid and lyrical. She doesn't use purple prose as much as high melodrama. It feels like reading Wuthering Heights. By the end, you feel emotional limp like a wet rag. The only silliness you find is in the convoluted romance resolutions. Sex becomes too prominent as a tool for resolution when words and deeds would suffice."},{"Title":"Petals in the Storm (Fallen Angels Novels)","review":"A good book that I would recommend highly but only if you like history, especially war history. There was a lot of war/espionage history in the book and Ms. Putney had to have done a great amount of research to which I applaud, but it did take away from lightness and romance just a bit. It is still however a real page turner from cover to last page. I just skipped over a lot of the war paragraphs."},{"Title":"Petals in the Storm (Fallen Angels Novels)","review":"There are 2 things that I really love about this book. The first is Robin. I fell in love with that man at the end of this book, and to this day he is my favorite Mary Jo Putney hero, if not my favorite ever. The second is the back-drop/mystery. I know that a lot of reviewers found the political intrigue too much, but I loved the story. In fact, I would have loved it if THIS plotline (about the traitors and the assination plot) were MICHAEL's story -- he would have shined in this kind of setting, and it's less improbable than the warrior field that he got (in Shattered Rainbows).I'll skip the plot, since you can get that anywhere. What I will say, though, is that if the back story weren't so interesting, and if Robin WEREN'T featured so heavily, this book would be a 2, MAYBE a 3 star read. I really hated Rafe in this book. He was arrogant and overbearing, yes, but he was such a... well, a MORON. He treated Maggie terribly, he was suspicious of and obnoxious to Robin, who was the one person he should have been kind to (other than Maggie), even with his suspicions. If he HAD been nice, maybe the second \\"Big Misunderstanding\\" of the book could have been avoided.That leads me to what I fully despised about this book. I didn't mind Rafe in Thunder and Roses; he was harmless. The Bargain is probably my second least-favorite book by this author (with Dearly Beloved being her worst book ever), and I didn't like Rafe any better in that, even with my own flexible morality. Basically, this book did not manage to endear Rafe to me any more, either.One of the ways in which this author stands out among her peers is her ability to show WHY her love-interests are in love with each other. In that she fell far short. I can see why Rafe and Margot loved each other as young adults. But 12 years is a LONG time, and the reasons change. Rafe was, apparently, a better man at 21, but the intervening years have not been kind to his character. He blames it on lost love, but really, he just isn't all that decent a person to begin with. Why Maggie loved him, I just don't know. As an 18 year old? Sure. As a 30 year old? What did she know about him to love? This is what I expect from other, less talented, authors. With THIS author, I expect and usually receive, better.In MOST ways this book fell short, but there were too many things that helped. One such thing was the underlying romance of Helene Sorel and Karl von Fehrenbach. Again I find myself in the odd position of liking something that is a detraction for other readers. Sub-plot romances are very common in this author's books, and this was an enjoyable love-story. Helene and Karl's story was sweet and loving, a sad contrast to the main \\"love\\" story.So... when I factor Robin, the plot, and the sub-romance in, this book is an above average read, and one I enjoyed. Unfortunately, I had to endure the rest to enjoy the good parts.I do agree that Maggie chose the right person -- quite frankly, she didn't deserve Robin. She deserved a good man, one who would be kind to her, and ultimately Rafe WAS good to her. But to get that she turned away from a man who gave her that... AND so much more. Especially one as amazing as Robin. *sigh* Can you tell that I love Robin?? :D Angel Rogue was a great book, by the way!Ultimately, I rated this book as if I could accept that Rafe and Maggie were in love. I just wish that I'd seen some evidence of that and not just had to take it on faith. Keeping that in mind, the rest of the book was good. Had Rafe been better, the book would have been top-notch. If I were to make a very specific rating, I would say this is a 3 1/2 star, but so much WAS good that I can't round it down to a 3. Read it to meet Robin and to complete the original 4 Fallen Angels books."},{"Title":"Petals in the Storm (Fallen Angels Novels)","review":"This book was terrible. Right from the beginning the characters seemed wooden and lifeless, and they remained that way right throughout the book. The story was too complicated and confusing, and too much emphasis was put on political issues instead of the two main characters. Reading this book, I felt as though I was reading a history book instead of a romance novel. The whole idea of a romance is that it flows easily and that you can relax and enjoy reading it - but for it also to contain a bit of intrigue and suspense, and of course, passion and tension and humour. This book lacked all of the above. A romance book is supposed to have you wishing you were one of the characters. Not this book. I would have hated to have been one of these characters and I was truly grateful when I finished it. And the only reason I finished it was because I kept hoping it would improve. Thankfully I didn't hold my breath.The best thing about this book was the cover!"},{"Title":"Petals in the Storm (Fallen Angels Novels)","review":"It was a good transaction, found a book which the local library didn't have.

Our two &quot;romantic&quot; figures, Maggie and Rafe, by page140, have kissed heavily several times yet each time she pulls back and say &quot;no&quot;! What was the point? She was no maiden. It was a bore. And when Rafe suspects Robin of spying, I was ready to throw in the towel and skim to the end of the book. But I didn't and should have. All this hand gripping and fury with one another laced with latent desire was way overplayed. There was not one line of humor in the book. Passion was negligible because Maggie and Rafe acted so silly. Too many pointless starts and stops don't necessarily add passion or interest, but create an aura of stuipdity and disinterest! I had read The Rake, which I enjoyed and then Robin's story, which was okay. Maybe Ms. Putney does not realize that passion does include humor and also, believe it or not, compatibility. Nothing wrong with having some nice qualities in a hero or heroine! Rafe can take his &quot;Duke's stare&quot; - I prefer Robin! Have to wonder about Maggie letting him out of her bed. Don't bother with this book."},{"Title":"Petals in the Storm (Fallen Angels Novels)","review":"Ms. Putney's Fallen Angels series is worth every penny!

Mind you, this is not a tome of light verse, but rather it is a love song to the Angel of Death, Azrael. Separate poems weave into one beatiful whole. This isn't the kind of book one reads from beginning to end (I don't think any book of poetry is). Eros In Exile entices you to pick it up, read a bit, and then reflect. This is one of my most treasured books, for it really is a great treasure."},{"Title":"Eros In Exile","review":"A fine collection of poetry and prose brought forth by Ms. Wendell. This type of poetry is not for all, but if you are into the darker writings of reality, then this will be for you. Mostly regarding the b'loved Angel Azrael, one will reflect about what they have read. Deep, moving, and not for the &quot;conventional&quot; mind at all. Angelic and Goth poetry at its finest."},{"Title":"Eros In Exile","review":"You can say whatever you want about Leilah Wendell and her quite unusual relationship with Death, as it's laid out in books like Encounters with Death and especially her epic Our Name is Melancholy; but at least she knows how to express herself beautifully in writing. Her passion for what she has decided to be her mission in life can only be admired, regardless of what you happen to think of her choice of Death as her special partner.For people new to Wendell and her unique philosophy, Eros in Exile might not be the best introductory text, however, since it's a collection of poetry. It's true that all poems are, in one way or another, about Death, but since it's a collection of poetry there's nothing specific which deals with her history and background, or how it came to be that she and Death found each other.But, if you're in the mood for some beautiful love poetry and feel like experiencing numerous tributes to love (perhaps an odd kind of love, but a love nonetheless), then Eros in Exile is an excellent choice.Because Wendell sure knows how to write beautiful poetry. It's amazing how she's able to describe something similar in so many different ways with the same honesty running through all of them. Poetry is, in my world, either amazing or worthless, and thus I was pleased to see how the majority of Wendell's work belongs to the former category. However, make sure not to read the entire book from start to finish in one go, because then you'll definitely be bored, not matter how great most poems happen to be.In closing, Eros in Exile is a nice little book about love. The soundtrack to use while reading it is a rainy autumn night when the wind beats your windows and you feel a touch of beautiful melancholy rush through your heart. I haven't tried it, but I doubt it'll work on a hot and sunny summer day. This is love poetry for the darker souls, most definitely."},{"Title":"Eros In Exile","review":"I highly recommend this book to all of you who enjoy &quot;dark&quot; poetry.

Mostly political discussions into what they feel is happening to their country. I found this a little hard to follow; the names were complex,ie everyone had several different names and professions. Most importantly we see the evolution of Hitlers germany through the views of the residents, a family running an industrial business. Later the characters come together and try to influence each other in their way of thinking and what is best for the future of their business regardless of the outcome of the war. They were deciding what is the more important values they wished to retain.The story spans the years 1939 to 1945. Most interesting is how the characters evolved based on things that were happening to their country; changing their minds often to fit the mood of what was happening.It all comes together in the end as the allied forces are approaching the city of Berlin; they must decide what will become of them and how they will be judged for their activities the past few years.A very complex story, yet quite simple.Most of all, this is the first story I have read that actually shows the feeling of the German people who were drawn into a war that they didn't fully understand and feared what would happen to them in the end and therefore were planning what to do after the enevitable loss of Germany."},{"Title":"Joke Book","review":"This oddly titled book is a smash hit with my four year old daughter!

With no detectable trace of ulterior motive, guile or superiority, he became a part of the life of this small (about 350 students) Christian college in the heart of the Bible Belt. The book takes us through his many experiences, including conversations with college faculty and students, chapel services, a trip to the Southern Baptist Convention and a mission to El Salvador. Interspersed with these recollections are his own reflections on faith.He is disarmingly honest, and one would be unusually hard-pressed to rake up evidence that he had any particular axe to grind, or that he set out to do an expose of Protestant fundamentalism: Indeed, he is candid about the inadequacies of his own particular agnosticism, and does not try to set them against the often seemingly naive and foolish world of fundamentalism. What he discovers are real people who don't fit the stereotype, and his genuine intentions towards these people (who became real friends during his time at Criswell) are clearly visible.His most interesting observation is that the apparent distance between these fundamentalists and unbelievers - the former are heavenbound, while the latter are wicked sinners destined for hell unless they repent - is only intellectual; on a deeper, more human and heartfelt level the author finds that most of his evangelical friends and acquaintances are accepting, and there is little sign of any real distance in their relations.Bryan is gifted in that, although he is no Christian, and remained unconvinced by the arguments and claims he was faced with at Criswell, he can see others first and foremost as human beings. Thus, Chapter and Verse is no anti-fundamentalist polemic; rather it is one man's account of what he really found - minus all the trappings of labels and stereotypes - when he got to know a group of fundamentalists for themselves.As is common with books written about theological, biblical or ecclesiastical issues by people who are foremost journalists (I am reminded of Bruce Bawer's far less charitable Stealing Jesus: How Fundamentalism Betrays Christianity), the author reveals himself as something of a dilettante on some religious matters. He makes a number of elementary mistakes: His definition of the Chalcedonian formulation of the two natures in Christ is misleading; He wrongly includes premillennialism as one of the five fundamentals published by the earliest fundamentalists; there were a few others.He also draws one or two puzzling conclusions, such as that fundamentalists (apparently) are uniquely representative of \\"biblical\\" Christianity; that non-evangelicals cannot lay claim to following the Bible as closely and consistently as evangelicals. Such an inference is only true within the fundamentalist scheme of interpretation; nevertheless, Bryan is so transparent and genuine that one can overlook a few errors made in good faith. Chapter and Verse is one of the more nuanced portrayals of fundamentalist Christianity in recent years, and Bryan's compelling manner had me hooked from start to finish."},{"Title":"Chapter and Verse: A Skeptic Revisits Christianity","review":"a short while ago i happened to see this book among the remainders. it sounded interesting so i bought it and read it. what a bargain. this is an excellent book i would think from most anyones view point. i can't understand why it did not become better known. i highly recommend it. dave nelson"},{"Title":"Chapter and Verse: A Skeptic Revisits Christianity","review":"This book is about the author's time spent in a Southern Baptist theological seminary.

The two should be regarded almost as a single (very long) book: only someone already expert on the history of the period would read the second one without the first.The book opens with Charles I having been on the throne for thirteen years. England and Scotland have been one united Kingdom for only twenty years longer than that. There is religious sectarianism of multiple kinds. There is financial pressure from the King's taxes. The King believes he rules by divine right. Parliament, when the King is willing to call it together, disagrees, and will not cooperate with the King. These threads, and others, will inevitably lead the kingdom to war over the next ten years.Wedgwood starts with almost two hundred pages of setting the stage: what was Britain like in 1637? The survey is thorough--science, taxation policy, religion, economics, court politics, education, social conditions, health, trade, the Church, the state of Ireland--and is well enough written. It does feel a bit like doing one's homework so as to be ready for the rest of the book, but it pays off amply in aiding comprehension of the later events.After this opening section, Wedgwood starts the story, beginning in mid-1637. In both books, she takes the slightly unusual approach of sticking very closely to a linear narrative of the events, instead of providing an overview and filling in details. She doesn't jump ahead and tell you how an intrigue is going to turn out, and this greatly increases the interest of the innumerable political twists and turns. Charles was not the cleverest British King, and had a weakness for over-complication and multiple plots; Wedgwood recounts them and the counters to them from Parliament as they happen, day by day, and it makes for fascinating reading.Wedgwood writes clearly and without too much ornamentation, though her style is not at all simplified. It is plain throughout that she loves her subject and knows all the characters intimately, and this enthusiasm and insight easily transmits itself to the reader."},{"Title":"Practical Word Power","review":"Excellent product for home schooled, my daughter was referred by the librarian at her virtual school for this handy guide and reference!"},{"Title":"Garfield and the wicked wizard (Planet reader chapter books)","review":"Jon takes Garfield and Odie to a renaissance faire.

The author is in fact Fiona Cummings who was commissioned to write another series of Noddy Stories under the Enid Blyton trademark. Dame Enid gets full credit on the cover and title page but you have to look on the publisher's details page (ISBN etc) to see that the story is in fact by Fiona Cummings.The story is written 40 years after the classic 24 title Noddy Series &quot;All Aboard for Toy Land&quot;. A good example of the original is &quot;Noddy and Tessie Bear&quot; The fate of the new generation &quot;Mr Plod and the Stolen Bicycle&quot; is very similar to what has happened to Pooh Bear and Tigger in recent years. We have gone from the quaint Edwardian language of the original to the uncomplicated, perhaps, trivialized language of the contemporary versions.We have lost all of the &quot;Englishness&quot; of the original. Strange vocabulary and sentence structures could be off-putting to children used to a cartoon/comic dominated diet. Old fashioned concepts such as manners, politeness and deference have been expunged.The illustrations have also been sanitized. Compared to the pictures in the original series they have lost their bright hard edges and have drifted into a more pastelly palette.Although the original series of Noddy could be heavy going for some of today's young readers, we have seen how JK Rowling has demonstrated that the reading appetites of young readers can include sophisticated content.Look out for the &quot;Noddy Classic Library&quot; and avoid the &quot;Toy Town Stories&quot;, As bedtime stories go, the Classic Noddy will give you a 30-minute passage to dreamland. In contrast the modern versions like &quot;Mr Plod and the Stolen Bicycle&quot; would be lucky to give you 3 minutes of story.

Presuming those that bestowed the Award were correct, and the other reviewers of \\"Innocence\\" are also correct, if I were to rank the 8 novels I have read this is number 8, and is likely to be number 9 when \\"Offshore\\" has been completed.Ms. Fitzgerald often has left a book with the ending open, at times in an initially jarring manner. This is again the case with \\"Innocence\\", and the ending is not alone. This work is lengthy when compared to most of Ms. Fitzgerald's works, and its length allows for more of the wonderful characters she creates, and the usually odd circumstances they create, or are victimized by. In this case, with one exception, even when well done, I generally felt nothing or actively disliked the players.The exception is Barney, one of the most unusual, colorful, and unconventional characters Ms. Fitzgerald created. When a female is described when smiling, as having the perfect teeth for an Ogress you are reading about someone interesting. Barney is overwhelming in everything she does, there are no half measures, and the world of half tones is invisible to her. Snap decisions based upon a handshake suffice to sanction or condemn a marriage, choose a mate, and serve as a basis for her turning her life 180 degrees in less than a moment.There is one other prominent player in the book, and he is the Doctor. However he is as annoying as he is prominent, and there is nothing entertaining or clever about him. He interacts with a variety of people who are all uniformly one dimensional, and are impossible to care about, much less dislike, they, like the story, drift along.But as I said there is Barney. You have to love a woman who asks a pregnant friend, \\"Do you want a girl, or a little teapot?\\" Ms. Fitzgerald is a wonderful writer, and even this book is better than many other writers I have read.

It is the first of those (7) that I've read that I didn't finish in a day. As usual, it is character-driven with a rich assortment of characters, a precisely limned milieu (Tuscany in the mid-50s), and several desultory plots filled with misunderstandings. The focus of this rather Forsterian novel is not on the overconfident, tall young Englishwoman running amok in Italy. I'm not sure there is a focus. What clicks between the romantic leads, Chiara, an Italian countess just back from an English convent school and Salvatore, a hypersensitive-to-perceived slights doctor of Southern peasant origins, remains mysterious. The (not particularly prosperous) noble family throws up no objections, though an aunt's attempt to help the newlyweds nearly has fatal consequences. The doctor's father was an admirer of Gramsci and brought his son, then aged ten, to visit the dying Gramsci (for me the book's most memorable scene)."},{"Title":"Innocence","review":"Penelope Fitzgerald is amazing! Each of her books is unique, and I simply can't decide which I like best. INNOCENCE is splendid. And it is so Italian!"},{"Title":"Innocence","review":"Penelope Fitzgerald did not start publishing novels until she was over sixty, but then she came out with nine compact volumes, amazingly varied in their setting and subject, but all filled with deep human wisdom. Her two best books, in my opinion, areTHE BLUE FLOWER, set in the Germany of the early Romantics, andTHE BEGINNING OF SPRING, set in Moscow shortly before the Russian Revolution. INNOCENCE takes place around Florence in the nineteen-fifties, when the Italian economy was beginning to re-establish itself after the war. Its leading characters, however, the Ridolfis, are aristocratic holdovers from a much earlier age. The family villa, the Ricordanza, is in disrepair due to lack of funds; the present Conte lives a distinguished but precarious life in a flat in Florence, accompanied by his daughter Chiara when she is home from her convent school in England; the family vineyards are run by her cousin Cesare, a man with few words but a good heart.Near the beginning of this wry comedy (whose quality of romantic excess comes closest toTHE GATE OF ANGELS), Chiara announces her engagement to a thirty-year-old doctor, Salvatore Rossi, and the larger part of the book shows how this romance came about. Rossi is from the South, a self-made man of humble origins, whose medical vocation was established at the age of ten when his father took him to visit the socialist Antonio Gramsci on his prison deathbed. Both lovers suffer from a stubborn innocence: Chiara in her impulsive generosity, Salvatore in his foolish pride. Their courtship is a whirlwind of misunderstandings; they seem as adept at making themselves miserable as the other happy. Likeable as they are, one wants to pick them up and shake them!Fitzgerald is extraordinary for her ability to immerse herself in every aspect of Italian life of this period. This is far from the tourist Tuscany of fiction, and it is sometimes hard to recall that the book was not written by an Italian. An Italian, moreover, with an extraordinarily wide range of experience, encompassing people from all walks of life: aristocrats, workers, rich, poor, intellectuals, communists, and Vatican officials. It is so full of observations about history, politics, the economy, manners, and regional customs that it might almost be used as a source book. In some ways the texture of the story is more interesting than the story it contains. Fitzgerald does not make it easy for the reader; she expects us to share her knowledge rather than having her explain it -- several quotations, for instance, are left in the original Italian untranslated (it seems they are modified Dante). Despite its brief length and considerable wit, be warned: this can be a challenging book.[Nothing that I can possibly say here is half so good as A. S. Byatt's wonderful account of Fitzgerald's novels in THE THREEPENNY REVIEW, an indispensable essay for anybody interested in this very varied author. It is available on line; select past issues #73.]"},{"Title":"Innocence","review":"Penelope Fitzgerald's career as a novelist -- she also was a noted biographer and essayist -- divided into two phases: first, novels set in England and relating in some way to her own life (one of which, \\"Offshore\\", won the Booker Prize); and second, novels that were more imaginary and with historical settings, usually foreign to England.INNOCENCE (1986) was the first of her novels from this second phase. It is an offbeat comedy. Set in Italy in the mid-1950s, it revolves around the courtship and early years of marriage between Chiara Ridolfi, a young Italian countess from Florence whose family has lost much of its wealth, and Salvatore Rossi, a doctor from a backwater village in southern Italy. Chiara is a little on the flighty side, and Salvatore is overly sensitive about his plebian background, astoundingly self-centered, and often rude. Other principal characters (and they all are \\"characters\\" as well) are Chiara's father Giancarlo, her aunt Maddalena, her cousin Cesare (who maintains the family farm and vineyards), and her close friend from the convent school Holy Innocents in England she attended, Lavinia (\\"Barney\\") Gore-Barnes. The six of them find themselves in, or get themselves into, all kinds of odd situations which would embarrass, even mortify, most of us, but for them (usually) they prove to be so much water off a duck's back.The novel's genre, I suppose, is \\"social comedy.\\" But INNOCENCE is not really satiric, nor for the most part is it \\"laugh-out-loud.\\" It pokes fun at its characters but more, to borrow a phrase, at \\"the human comedy.\\" The humor is on the droll side, although some of the goings on approach the madcap and zany. INNOCENCE is literate, entertaining, and often witty. It is not much more, although I don't sense that Fitzgerald aspired for it to be much more.At the conclusion of the novel, after tragedy has been averted seemingly through happenstance, Salvatore Rossi exclaims, \\"What's to become of us? We can't go on like this.\\" Cesare, the taciturn one, responds: \\"Yes, we can go on like this. We can go on exactly like this for the rest of our lives.\\""},{"Title":"Innocence","review":"I so wanted to love this book. And I tried. But try as I might, and as beautifully written as it was, I could not identify with the characters. We are given only the tiniest glimpse of the first encounter between a young woman and a cold male doctor, and from this un-rememberable encounter, we are supposed to believe that they are so wildly obsessed with each other that nothing can keep them apart. And yet - the doctor yells at the girl, insults her, chases her away - but feels sorry later, and tells his friend that he cannot be happy without her. And she - somehow presses on (and on, and on) in spite of his frightfully ugly spirit. If only their first encounter had been passionate or even exciting (!) I would have been able to believe the rest."},{"Title":"Innocence","review":"I must agree with the reviewer from California. The author has a wonderful opportunity to show the reader scenes which explain why the protagonist is drawn to her difficult lover. She misses the boat! Not only do we get very little interaction between these two characters, but it is difficult to come to care about them. The setting has so many possibilities, and I was truly disappointed."},{"Title":"Innocence","review":"The book is noteworthy for its fine writing and its elegant Italian setting. Fitzgerald was a genius of a writer. Brother and sister Giancarlo Ridolfi and Maddalena are reunited in old age since their spouses, English and American, prefer not to live in Florence.Giancarlo's daughter Chiara is to marry Dr. Rossi. Chiara wants a country wedding at Valsassina. The Count seeks out his nephew, Cesare, who lives on the estate. Another family holding, the Villa Ricordanza, had been requisitioned three times during the war. Chiara was cooped up there in her childhood.Chiara calls Maddalena Aunt Mad. Salvatore Rossi is a physician, a neurologist. Chiara Ridolfi is accused by an English school friend of being weedy. Her friend from the convent, Barney, visits Chiara. Giancarlo regrets that Maddalena is not present during the visit. Barney worries about the supply of bath water in Florence. Giancarlo claims he isn't used to the straightforwardness of Barney. Chiara doesn't like having Salvatore Rossi inspected by her.The incidents of the story roll on from one interesting locution (and location) and another and another. What a wonderful title, INNOCENCE, is for the book that Penelope Fritzgerald gives us. The author's writing shows deep cultural acquisitions employed in a number of remarkable ways. (There is some resemblance here to the works of E.M. Forster.) The result is sunshine, happiness, joy. The too often used adjective sparkling really does describe the quality encountered in the novel. The clash of Italian and English customs is brilliant, bright, amusing.I have read four other books by this author and would place this one at the top of the list in terms of over-all excellence and reader interest."},{"Title":"Monmouth Courthouse 1778: The Last Great Battle In The North (Campaign)","review":"Throughout my education (even into college), any study of the American Revolution usually started at Boston, talked about the Declaration of Independence, and then skipped over to Yorktown. Trenton, Saratoga, and Valley Forge were some times thrown in for good measure, however none were ever covered in great detail.Most of the major battles of the war have largely been ignored, such as New York, Brandywine, Germantown, Monmouth, Charleston or Camden. This is likely because they all tended to be complex actions and resulted in either an American loss or at very least a draw. Monmouth was one of the largest battles of the American Revolution and was the last major battle fought by Washington's Main Army until Yorktown, yet to date the best book on the subject was William Stryker's \\"Battle of Monmouth\\", which was written at end of the 19th century and time has exposed several flaws.This book does an excellent job of translating this complicated battle, with all of its various stages and political drama, into a narrative of how the stage was set, how the battle unfolded, and what aftermath resulted. Starting in Philadelphia and Valley Forge, the author traces the progress of the two armies across New Jersey and their engagement outside of Monmouth Courthouse. This battle had several stages, which is skillfully articulated and supplemented by full color maps showing the action and how it developed.The author is extremely sympathetic to Charles Lee, which is a point I may disagree with. While Lee may have executed the letter of Washington's orders, he certainly did not execute their spirit. Coupled with his past behavior and track record (being captured in a New Jersey tavern away from his troops, politically challenging Washington with Congress, etc.), I think Lee exhausted any benefit of the doubt by the time of Monmouth.All in all, this book is long over due, and hopefully the author will repeat this success by covering covering the Philadelphia Campaign, Camden, etc."},{"Title":"Monmouth Courthouse 1778: The Last Great Battle In The North (Campaign)","review":"Usually I like Morrissey's work but in *Monmouth Courthouse 1778* he utterly fails to take advantage of hind sight sort out what was a very confused and ultimately significant battle.At Monmouth itself there were two armies with two different agendas. Washington, coming out of the crucible of Valley Forge wanted to give his army a chance to prove themselves. Clinton, newly in command in North America is trying to protect loyalist civilians who, rightly, feared colonial reprisals as the British pulled back their commitment in the North American colonies in response to the entry of France into the war.The American plan was to make a demonstration towards the British to show the flag and exchange a few shots. With the American vanguard engaging the British rearguard rather than just letting the British just walk away. The problem for the Americans was they came too close to the civilians the British were escorting and so to protect them Clinton turned with half his army. Instead of facing a couple of battalions of retreating redcoats, American General Lee found himself facing half the British army and it was on the attack! What followed was a desperate day of fighting as Washington, arriving on the field of yet another colonial collapse, rallied his men and held on.Both sides could claim a victory at Monmouth. By the end of the day the British marched on, having defended the civilians in their care. And the troops under George Washington held the field. For the British this was a regular feature, but for the Americans, this was a turning point. They had stood, toe to toe, in the largest set piece battle of the war, and not yielded the ground. They were no longer a rabble but an army able to stand with pride in their cause.Morrissey fails to mention this important fact which makes the reader question if he understood the true importance of the battle. The other element missing is the heat. He casually mentions the heat and dusty roads but primary sources cite the heat as the single most defining element of the day with both sides losing more men to heat than enemy action.The two other glaring weaknesses with this work are maps and details on the leadership. Pages are filled with pretty paintings of the action and far too many portraits that all start to blur together and while these would be acceptable in a larger work, in Osprey's limited space, these pages could be put to far better use. All too many of the \`maps' are 3D illustrations that straddle 2 pages meaning the bulk of their central action is lost in the fold of the book's spine. This leaves the reader trying to carry a map in their heads. I've spend considerable time on the Monmouth Battlefield and even I was having trouble with it.There is also far too little information on the leaders on the field. Morrissey covers only the 2 senior officers on each side and while that can be acceptable for the more professional British troops, with the Colonial forces, as their command and control degrades individual leaders like Wayne, Lafayette and other step to the fore, without any introduction of their abilities or place. Room could have been made for these small biographies by cutting down on some of the needless details presented on some of the units. While necessary in some books, like Morrissey's excellent work on Quebec, the differences between Hessian, Loyalist and militia from regular do not really affect the outcome of the storey. Since the Order of Battle is given at the very end of the book, unless the reader starts at the back, they have no way to know they are there and so lack even this basic aid in determining who leaders mentioned in the text are.Ultimately the real battle of Monmouth was a confused battle as two armies fed units onto the field in literally killing heat. Unfortunately Morrissey's work does little to clear up the confusion or explore the weather. Instead of grasping and so explaining to the reader the importance of the weather and the significance of the American stand in the face of British troops he spends time on the interpersonal relations between American commanders and the failure of the French navy to show aggression.While Morrissey has to work within Osprey's familiar framework, he must take responsibility for the choices he made within that frame work that results in a poor outing for a usually reliable author."},{"Title":"Monmouth Courthouse 1778: The Last Great Battle In The North (Campaign)","review":"Brendan Morrissey's Monmouth Courthouse 1781 is his fourth addition to the Osprey Campaign series on the American War of Independence. Morrissey has a decent grasp of his subject and he has honed his narrative style in each succeeding volume. However, Morrissey's coverage of the Battle of Monmouth Courthouse suffers from two inter-related problems: an over-focus on the question of American Major General Charles Lee's role in the battle and an ambiguous battle narrative. Essentially, much of this volume revolves around the question - was Charles Lee unfairly relieved of command - rather than a true analysis of the battle itself.Morrisey's introduction and campaign chronology starts out decently, but starts to thin out in the section on opposing commanders, which only covers well-known figures such as Clinton, Cornwallis, Lee and Washington. What about some of the brigade commanders? The section on opposing armies is also decent, highlighting the introduction of brigades and light infantry in the increasingly professional American army. Oddly, there is no section on opposing plans. Morrissey provides five 2-D Maps: North America in January 1778; New England and the Mid-Atlantic colonies; action at Barren Hill 20 May 1778; Two roads to Monmouth; Monmouth Battlefield. Unfortunately, the map of the Barren Hill skirmish adds nothing to the campaign narrative, and this volume is sorely lacking a decent 2-D map zoomed in to the actual battlefield area at Monmouth. After recently visiting the Monmouth battlefield, I found the maps in this volume were not very useful for someone standing on the actual terrain. The three 3-D \\"Bird's Eye View\\" maps are: Lee's advance; Lee's Retreat; and Clinton's withdrawal. The three color battle scenes by Adam Hook are: the capture of Lieutenant Colonel Ramsay; the 42nd Foot in the Sutfin Orchard; the guns on Comb's Hill.Morrissey' campaign narrative meanders through a variety of disparate events in early 1778 until he finally moves into the British withdrawal from Philadelphia that initiated the sequence of events that culminated at Monmouth Courthouse. It is apparent that Washington's pursuit of the withdrawing British army was hardly rapid, even a bit sluggish (Washington had lost most of one field army in 1776 and was probably reticent to risk his main army unless sure of the outcome). However, the Americans were able to catch up with the British army near Freehold, New Jersey on 27 June 1778. After much debate, Washington gave the mission of attacking the British rearguard to Charles Lee. According to most accounts, Lee botched the attack in a half-hearted effort and was relieved by Washington, who was able to turn the battle into a draw. In Morrissey's version of the battle, Lee was unfairly relieved.I think Morrissey has stuck his neck out pretty far in attempting to defend Charles Lee and to base his assessment of the battle in terms of whether or not the America advance guard commander was unfairly relieved. First, what did Charles Lee ever really do for the Patriot cause? At Charleston, he provided advice that the locals didn't need. In the 1776 New York campaign, he managed to disobey orders and then get himself captured, probably collaborating with his British hosts. Morrissey suggests that Lee was court-martialed after the battle due to Washington's \\"popularity,\\" which ridiculously equates the man who almost single-handedly welding together America's war effort in the Revolution to some modern-day celebrity. Morrissey claims that Lee was neither disrespectful nor treacherous, but merely undone by adverse circumstances and unruly subordinates. This is hogwash. Washington was not a capricious sort of commander who acted on whimsy; historians should give him the benefit of the doubt that the reasons were justified. What would Morrissey have us believe - that Washington acted out of rage or petty jealousy?It is also difficult to evaluate how well (or badly) Lee performed his mission of attacking the British rearguard given Morrissey's hard-to-follow tactical narrative. Morrissey writes: \\"[Lee] ordered Grayson to proceed with caution, he sent Jackson to join him at the front of the column and asked Wayne to take charge of those two detachments and a third unit (taken from Scott's command) under fellow Pennsylvanian Colonel Richard Butler.\\" Huh? I can't tell who is doing what here. The American command structure of the advance guard was jumbled, with a variety of units provided detachments of their best troops, but Morrissey lumps them into a potpourri of poorly-identified names, with little attempt to distinguish the size or relationship of these detachments. Morrissey claims that the terrain and the sudden re-appearance of the British rearguard frustrated Lee's efforts to mount a coherent attack. I think the more likely reasons for Lee's discomfiture were simply military incompetence and poor leadership skills. When the Revolution started, Lee was one of several foreign officers who impressed Congress with his resume and secured a commission, but close examination of his record indicates that his command experience at high level was negligible. It is interesting that both Charles Lee and Horatio Gates, who had been majors in the British army, performed poorly on the battlefield and were poor leaders of men. When Lee botched a straightforward attack and let his picked troops rout, it was too much for Washington. Most of all, Morrissey's over-focus on Lee misses much of the significance of the first battle involving von-Steuben-trained American continentals and British regulars. One of Washington's goals was to test the efficiency of these new troops and it must have been galling to see them running away with hardly a fight. As every officer knows, a commander is responsible for everything his troops do or fail to do, and Lee was thus responsible for not only failing his mission, but allowing a disgraceful rout to occur after only minor skirmishes."},{"Title":"Monmouth Courthouse 1778: The Last Great Battle In The North (Campaign)","review":"Brendan Morrissey is an exceptional historian.

The uniform books in the past were pricy items with a few color prints and other assorted details often not amounting to more than 30 pages or so. Now we have the Campaigns and Battles series which has expanded on the historical aspects, but still at under 90 pages they often cut short the information. Over all the series has grown and gott'en better, but it is still pricy for what you get. The main asset to the series is that it often covers esoteric subjects.Monmouth was one of the largest battles of the American Revolution, and the last major encounter in the Northern theater of the war. There has yet to be a recent comprehensive book done on this very complicated, and confusing battle. Perhaps this is the reason why. There have been numerous magazine articles over the years concerning it, several done by Civil War type historians who are kind of out of their element in this earlier period. The controversy of Charles Lee has also always sparked interest and brings up many issues on its own.In this Ospery Title Mr. Morissey presents a decidedly British perspective on the battle. This is rather refreshing because the American Revolution tends to be riddled with so much mythology and legend. Monmouth is no exception in this regard. American readers accustomed to the Spirit of '76 approach by most American historians might be somewhat put off by this work. One of the reviwers above seems to be such an example. Still, this book gives us some much needed perspective of what was passing on the other side of the hill.Details about the British plans and route of march from Philadelphia to New York in the Summer of 1778 were quite fascinating. I have yet to find this information in any other works on the subject. Most are more concerned with Washington's impending confrontation with Charles Lee, and the supposed greatness of Steuben's training of the Continental army. Here the author gives us some needed perspective on these matters. Contrary to most popular views, the Continental infantry did not wisk the British off the field with their new found training under Stueben. As is pointed out here, it was the American artillery that gave the most significant contribution. The use and employment of Knox's batteries restricted Clinton's options of launching further assaults on on at least one occasion. Still, this fire was not as deadly as most popular views would have it. The famous example of a file of British Grenadiers having their muskets shattered by a single solid shot seems mostly apocryphal. Molly Pitcher and much of Washy's tirade toward Charles Lee probably falls into this category as well. Legends and myths propagated by American historians who tend to be great story tellers, but are less strong at discerning facts from fiction!That said Mr. Morrissey has some short-comings as well. The maps in this title are not that clear. They have too much information and not enough clearity. I was on the battlefield recently and I did not find the maps contained within to be all that helpful. The account of the battle is a bit messy as well. Perhaps this can't be helped because Lee had such a hodge-podge of units under his command. The color plates are nice, but selective of detail. The brief bios of the major leaders contained interesting notes, but mostly general information easily available elsewhere. Descriptions of the British army organization and tactics was decidedly more detailed than on the American army. The militia were hardly discussed at all.I didn't find that the author went into Lee's conduct excessively, as at least one reviewer above seems to think. Let's face it, Washy was not a very good battlefield commander. His command control was poor at almost all the major battles he fought. Monmouth was no exception. Washy was good as an inspirational leader, poor as a tactician. Of course this will no doubt be considered heresy by many, but I think we have to take Washy off his great white horse sometimes. Charles Lee had a largely self-made reputation, which proved not to be much when he was finally faced with a real crunch. His poor social skills didn't help matters either! No doubt he turned off a lot of his brigade commanders with his off-hand manner toward them. That said I would agree with Mr. Morissey that the mishap that befell the American advance-guard was not totally of his making. Mixed units, and strong-headed subordinates like Wayne and Lafayette were prone to make matters worse. That the American advance-guard didn't get crushed was due more to luck, and the innate ability of Americans to break formation and leg it through marshes! Clinton should have recalled the Battle of Brooklyn in that regard. Americans got away through the marshes there as well! Same at Monmouth.Washy deserves credit for stopping the retreat and forming a decent line against the British. After that it was relatively easy to deflect several of Clinton's rather half-hearted attacks. Washy responded in kind later in the day. None of this really provided much of an opportunity for the famed Stueben drill to astonish the British. But the artillery did make a good showing of itself. Casualties remain another legend of this battle. Both sides upped the other sides' and lowered their own. The tendency of late has been to say that both lost more than has generally been acknowledged. This means the British did not take staggering losses at Monmouth, the Steuben drill did not astonish them, Molly Pitcher did not save the day, and Washy probably didn't curse until the leaves on the trees shock at Lee's dismissal. Both sides can look at the battle as a victory in their own terms. Which makes it a draw if nothing else. For the British Clinton managed to exicute a very difficult march in the face of considerable adverse circumstances. He even gave Washy a bit of his own medicine with using the camp fires trick to deceive about his withdrawal after the battle. Clinton was probably the best over all strategist and tactican of the war. That does not say very much considering the others out there!Like most Ospery titles this account is brief, but provides some interesting perspectives. It gives a much needed British view, as well as new details about the Americans. Until a full length history is done on the battle, this Ospery title is likely to be the best summation on the subject. This work fills an important niche and provides some new information on a topic often lauded with myth and legend. Much of our perspective of the American Revolution suffers from this problem. We need to have a more detached view in order to seperate fiction from fact. Brian Morissey shows us that our history looks different when seen through a different perspective. American historions need to seperate story from fact when discussing the Rev War."},{"Title":"Islamic Fundamentalism: An Introduction, Revised and Updated Edition (Greenwood Press Guide to Historic Events of the Twentieth Century)","review":"I found this book well organized and very readable.

In addition, there are one or two usual \\"Peanuts\\" strips: one of Linus writing to the Great Pumpkin, a few of Charlie Brown on the baseball team, one with Charlie Brown trying to kick the football from Lucy, etc. There are also a couple of strips in this collection where Frieda gets Snoopy to go rabbit hunting with her; I found these to be of interest because when I first became a fan of \\"Peanuts\\", Frieda was never seen in strips. There isn't anything spectacular in this collection, though it does have some comic strip historical significance (because of Frieda, Woodstock doesn't exist yet, etc.) and fans of the strip should appreciate the book nevertheless."},{"Title":"Sound System Engineering, Second Edition","review":"This book will help you to design a P.A. system correctly as well as solve problems with existing systems.

It will have you going back again and again to find that piece of information you need about horns, direct radiators, crossovers and arrays. His presentation of signal processing starts with basic sampling and progresses through system theory and digital audio.Two of the latter chapters on equalization and \\"putting it all together\\" are true gems. They yield practical information that you'll be using the next time you're faced with the issues covered.Sound System Engineering, 3rd Edition takes all of the knowledge contained in the 2nd edition and augments it with up-to-date interface methods and advances in the field of audio and acoustics since its last publication.

L. Bean. Part of its appeal over the years, of course, has been the range and quality of its products, the world wide reach of its many catalogues and the strength of its customer satisfaction. But another vital element is its implied and real connection with the Great North Woods, the \\"Wild, Wild East\\" and frontier setting of Maine. At the heart of both, lies the life and almost mythic life of its founder, Leon L. Bean. Down East character, savvy entrepreneur and clever merchandiser whose true heart was in the woods and on the waters of his beloved state, L. L. tested many of the products in the wild and invented some of them, including the iconic Maine hunting shoe.He was always accessible to his customers and willing, even anxious, to give his option of both the products and how to hunt and fish. \\"Hunting, Fishing and Camping\\" is his 1942 how-to book, covering such topics as how to hunt deer, moose and black bear, how to use a compass, how to fish for white perch and black bass as well as trout, how to set up a camp, choose a tent and even how to prevent forest fires. Short (100 pages), pithy and practical, the volume is lavishly illustrated and makes a good companion on any camping or fishing trip. Although one can wish for more personal anecdotes from the author, there is a lot of useful advice (some of it obviously overridden by new products and accumulated knowledge over the last 70 years) and interesting material. There is also a well-deserved paean to Maine Governor Percival Baxter, creator of Baxter State Park.But perhaps the most important draw of this work is the delightful dose of nostalgia which reading the book produces for one is instantly immersed in an older, simpler age with clear instructions about life in the out of doors. There is also some tart but good advice for one and all, such as \\"When on your hunting trips do not try to belittle the back woods folk even though you are a college man and your home in a big city.\\"I remember going to LL Bean's Freeport store as a kid when we came to Maine for Christmas. What an exciting time for a young boy to bring his yearly savings to the store and listen to hunters and trappers and Maine guides as they spun tales to impress one and all and I remember buying a wide range of goods - slingshots, leg traps and hunting knives, all seemingly radiating psychic power from the Maine woods.Only once did L. L. let me down in my youthful exuberance. One year I bought a \\"Bean's Special Machete\\" - after being told it was a most useful tool in the Maine woods. To this day, some 50 years later, after spending many, many hours afield, I have yet to ever encounter anyone in those woods with such a weapon/tool. Even more off-putting was finding the same item for sale in the Army-Navy surplus store in New London when I returned home, and at a lower price to boot.Still, there must have been some magic in that old showroom because I eventually became a Registered Maine Guide myself, although by the time I had achieved this lofty childhood goal, the store had greatly expanded and the vast displays of women's clothing and extra large men's pants, bird watching and cross country ski equipment seem to have crowded out the guide's and trapper's corner.

Hedstrom's book is the best example of this type of approach in contemporary sociology. It may not appeal to the likes of H. Gintis who wants grand and speculative theories of the evolution of human societies, but for the rest of us, this is the way to go!"},{"Title":"Dissecting the Social: On the Principles of Analytical Sociology","review":"Once upon a time sociological theory was not an oxymoron. There were Weber and Durkheim and Simmel and Cooley and Mead and more. The was Parsons, who put it all together in a magnificent edifice that exhibited the articulation of sociology with psychology and economics. But, all that has disintegrated, and now there is no sociological theory. The smartest sociologists, Hedstrom being among them, putter around in methodology and the specification of basic building blocks. The only reason sociology remains at all is that there are sociology departments and sociological problems. There is no sociological theory.The most cogent analysis of social interaction is presented by game theory, which is not even mentioned in this book. The most cogent analysis of culture is presented by gene-culture coevolutionary theory in biology, which is not even mentioned in this book. Why does Hedstrom think that sociology can grow its own theory independent from the other behavioral sciences, just when the other behavioral sciences are increasingly recognizing their interdependence? Why does Hedstrom not even mention socialization and the internalization of norms, which are sociology's most salient contribution to behavioral science?Hedstrom is very smart and very cogent, but he cannot create sociological theory on his own, simply because we are in a age of consilidation of the behavioral sciences, not their individuation.The most interesting part of this book is Hedstrom's defense of DBO (Desire, Belief, Opportunity) theory. I learned a lot from his analysis, but what he does not admit is that this is simply the rational actor model in a new suit. Indeed, in my work, I call the same theory the Beliefs, Preferences, and Constraints (BPC) model to make it more palatable to non-economists. But, it is the same theory, and a very very good one. Why does he not mention the many successes of the theory in economics and biology? Rather, he calls rational-choice theory an \\"alternative\\" to DBO theory, which is simply absurd.Hedstrom's critique of rational choice theory (p. 60ff) is simply ignorant of the Savage axioms. The term 'rational' in decision theory means nothing more that consistency (transitivity) over the appropriate choice space. Nothing more. Nor should it mean anything more. Of course, this leaves us with a very strong theory of preferences and a very shakey theory of beliefs, but this is not a sufficient reason for attempting to distance action theory in sociology from standard decision theory.Hedstrom makes a cogent argument for agent-based modeling, but he does not inspire us with examples of successful agent-based models from other behavioral fields. Nor does he make clear that agent-based modeling is a tool of complexity analysis. Moreover, agent-based models are tools, not theories. Where is the theory behind the models? Agent-based models are ways of solving sets of equations that cannot be solved analytically. Since there is no sociological theory, there cannot be a basic role for agent-based modeling, since there is nothing systematic to model.Hedstrom is at his best when suggesting interesting research projects that sociologists might undertake, and by describing important tools for undertaking this research. Ignoring game theory, evolutionary theory, biological theory, and economic theory, however, is not the way to create an analytical sociology, in my estimation."},{"Title":"Dissecting the Social: On the Principles of Analytical Sociology","review":"I was EXTREMELY impressed by this book. It packs a huge punch in content on philosophy of science, methodology, and causation in social science in a small volume and says so many thing I've been preaching for years. I have a few points of disagreement, but the authors position is clearly stated, well positioned in the logical geography, and strongly supported. The example models are simplistic, but they are meant to demonstrate a kind of modeling rather than teach people to become proficient in that kind of modeling...and so for their purpose they are perfect.If you are a scientist (of any kind but especially a social scientist) and you read only one book this year...then there is something wrong with you.

The book builds upon the social mechanisms approach that Hedstrom, Elster, and others have developed.

Bearing in mind the degree to which not just English poetry but English culture is saturated in Shakespeare, this is understandable. But ignorance of Jonson does him an injustice, and our poetry a disservice.Jonson, although remembered as a dramatist, thought of himself as a poet. (The contemporary term for a playwright was \\"poet\\". Indeed Jonson may have been the person who invented the word \\"playwright\\" -- as a term of scorn for those who made plays with no more art than a wheelwright makes wheels.) Fantastically ambitious, he had the unheard-of audacity to include his plays -- considered a disreputable form of writing -- in a large book of his 'Works' (the very title audaciously claiming for his writing a respect due, in contemporary thought, only to more valued genres).A modern theatregoer might be surprised to find out that what Jonson introduced as \\"the ripest of my studies\\" were not his plays, but a collection of poems called 'Epigrams' (printed along with the plays and 'The Forest' in his 'Works'). If Jonson is the forgotten master, 'Epigrams' could be called his forgotten masterpiece. Saturated with the poetry of Martial, Horace and Catullus (\\"for a good poet's made as well as born,\\" as he wrote wrote of Shakespeare) Jonson's epigrams self-consciously and stringently set themselves the task of rebuking and praising the age.'Epigrams' is full of the variety of Elizabethan and Stuart London (Jonson is a thoroughly urban poet): its charlatans, hypocritical creatures, would-be ladies, bad poets, braggarts and moneylenders; but also of its King (James I), genuine poets (two epigrams are addressed to John Donne), and cultured lords and ladies. Both in 'Epigrams' and 'The Forest' (a collection of poems ranging from lyrics to odes to long poems dealing with the \\"virtuous and noble\\") Johnson is keenly aware of, and interested in, problems of authorship and readership. His first epigram implores the reader who holds the book \\"to read it well\\", and there are a number of poems that warn off readers who misread -- who laugh at the wrong point, out of sheer stupidity, or in an attempt to pretend that the poet's satire doesn't apply to them.Jonson's classical style -- free of ornament and wilful obscurity -- isn't immediately appealing. (Shakespeare is both, for instance, and Donne has a famous delight in obscurity.) His poetry, perhaps like Goethe's, isn't great because it of brilliance, but because of its strength, something that becomes apparent only when the poetry has been fully absorbed by a reader. The moral weight behind his deliberate and scrupulous art is embodied in the attentiveness of his poetry to words and syntax. (His syntax, by the way, is one of the most enjoyable and sophisticated features of his poetry.) Perhaps what T.S. Eliot wrote of Landor -- another patently classical poet, but much more limited in his ambitions and achievements -- could be, with greater justice, applied to Jonson: \\"He is ... a poet for those who want poetry and not something else, a stay for their own vanity.\\""},{"Title":"How to Raise a Brat","review":"This is a wonderful book that every parent should read!

The substance of the book, however, is rather lightweight.The author presents a great deal of information and analysis on many subjects, from history to religion to nationalism to corporate governance, etc. So, for your money, you get to read a lot, but all without much coherence and with little depth.Harvey is mildly biased against the United States of America. In some sense his tirades are a good illustration of the adage that your are damned if you do and you are damned if you don't. Harvey criticizes the U.S. military intervention in certain cases, Panama and Grenada, but then he also criticizes the U.S. for not intervening in certain crises, like Bosnia and Rwanda. In fact, there was a \\"lost decade\\", according to Harvey, of not sending our troops to maintain order. His thesis seems to be that if the U.S. flexes her military muscles to protect her interests, it was wrong, she should only put her soldiers in harm's way to pacify ethnic fighting and other regional conflicts where she has no political, economic or military stake. Thanks a lot for that advice!Harvey argued that even though the September 11 attack was the worst single act of terrorism, it was not REALLY bad when put beside of the vast number of people terrorists killed year-in and year-out; in fact it was \\"a drop in the ocean\\" (!) compared with the number of civilians killed in Dresden, Tokyo and Hiroshima during WWII. This is how Harvey asks to put matters in perspective.His bias notwithstanding, Harvey does offer some sobering facts on how America is intensely disliked in some parts of the world, and why, at least according to his reasoning. There is, in fact, not much mystery here. Envy is a powerful human emotion. If the price for not being disliked were for the U.S. to be a loser, I would not care much for it.The redeeming values of the book are the breadth of subjects covered and a lucid writing style. It is not entirely a waste of time as I do want to get a perspective of the U.S. and the world as seen from a Brit, even though I might not be in total agreement."},{"Title":"An only child","review":"O'Connor is rightly famous mostly for his short stories, but his criticism - both The Lonely Voice and A Mirror In the Roadway - along with this volume of his memoirs, well, they're all just really good.

The people that assure that books keep getting read seem to be forgetting about O'Connor a little, but the pages they keep alive rarely seem to stay in the blood and brain like his do."},{"Title":"An only child","review":"The contrast between the \\"mother\\" image and the \\"father\\" image as reflected within a particular culture and the subsequent effect of that contrast on the family dynamic add an interesting dimension to a childhood memoir. Although admittedly a generalization, the Irish mother as the strong, dependable, hard-working individual worthy of near sainthood in sharp contrast to her shiftless, abusive, self-pitying drunkard husband often appears in literary works written by Irish writers. There seems to me to be little argument that the veneration of the Irish mother figure is not surprising in a culture that typically holds the Virgin Mary in higher esteem than her son and that lovingly refers to its homeland as \\"Mother Ireland.\\" Frank O'Connor's An Only Child offers such a contrast, one I find useful to my own writing since it reflects to a significant degree my own experience while growing up in an Irish Catholic household.O'Connor sets up the contrast between the two extremes almost immediately, using his own personality as illustration, since, unavoidably, we are all products of our biological parents. O'Connor indicates that while he has the \\"passion for gaiety\\" as displayed by his mother, he is dismayed that he too often reacts the way of his \\"father's family, which was brooding, melancholy, and violent.\\" He maintains that his mother married beneath her, despite the fact that it was his mother who grew up in an orphanage, and describes at great length how his father, \\"a naturally melancholy man,\\" went on frequent drinking binges during which he would miss work, verbally abuse his family, and spend every cent at his disposal in the pubs while his wife and son nearly starved. O'Connor frequently refers to his embarrassment and disdain for this man whose warped self-image was of \\"a good man and kind father on whom everybody and everything turned\\" and went out of his way to avoid him whenever possible. The Irish father in this memoir somehow still has pride but it is a false, undeserving pride, just as his self-image as the martyr is false, the genuine martyr being his faithful, devoted, long-suffering wife. Unfortunately, the lack of a father deserving of his child's love and admiration results not only in the disillusioned child's greater dependence on the mother but also in a life-long search for and attachment to other men who become the \\"father figure\\" replacements. For O'Connor, the focus rests primarily (though not exclusively) on Corkery, a teacher, poet, and artist whom the narrator admires for \\"his gentle, fatherly way.\\" As everything the biological father is not, Corkery, becomes the mentor, the \\"authority for everything,\\" and loved because of \\"how well that gentle little man understood\\" his protege.In direct opposition to the Irish father, the Irish mother in An Only Child represents the ideal of both motherhood and womanhood and provides the strength to keep the family afloat. In a culture and during a time-frame when \\"(Irish) homes were matriarchies,\\" the narrator turns to his mother for the love and approval his father withholds and, by doing so, only incurs greater wrath from his father. Insults of \\"sissy\\" and \\"Mother's Boy\\" are hurled at the child who even begins to identify himself as such. Naturally, the diametrically opposed mother and father frequently clash, but through it all, the mother (the true martyr) stoically attempts to bear the brunt of the neglect and abuse, stays with her abuser so her own child will not end up on the streets or in an orphanage, and \\"rarely asked anything for herself.\\" The narrator's devotion to his mother becomes so strong that it is only well into his adulthood, and only at her death, that he \\"learned for the first time the meaning of parting and death.\\"As the only child in such a volatile household, O'Connor frequently (even if silently) took sides, and it is not surprising, given the family dynamic (as well as the cultural veneration of the \\"Mother\\" figure), that his loyalty inevitably lay with his mother. Of course the ultimate choice (at least metaphorically) occurs when the narrator decides to forsake his father's surname in favor of his mother's."},{"Title":"An only child","review":"Like Frank, I grew up Catholic, so I greatly enjoyed his account of his childhood and the deftness at which he relayed the characters and situations of his life in early 20th century Northern Ireland. The account of his father's alcoholism and mother's strength in her modesty evokes powerful sentiments that O'Connor is amazingly skilled at.He overly criticizes the adolescent ideations and development out of his youth (bildungsroman), but it gives insight to his development as a writer (kunstlerroman), of which he is a candid and lucid artist.I felt the novel creeping a bit in the middle (otherwise I would give it 4 or 5 stars), and the transition is a bit murky to his engaging recount of actions against the British occupation of Northern Ireland and surrounding religious strife. The ridiculous skirmishes and characters are painted with his masterful brush, however, and truly bring the era to life.It is a story worth the read to the end on many levels."},{"Title":"Chistes xxx / Jokes XXX (Spanish Edition)","review":"Porno stories are normally light reading material which are good for lonesome hearts eager to delve into fantasy excitements.

Without a belligerent France across the Channel, the strength of the navy is slashed to the bone and beyond.Adam Bolitho is still in command of the frigate Unrivalled only now is dealing with ships packed to overflowing with Africans en-route to slavery and with North African pirates. Neither of these opponents are giving much concern to politicians and merchant bankers of Great Britain, except in so far as they are accumulating wealth from the transport and auction of slaves. The man in the street knows little about this and cares less.It is this apathy of the public that the Royal Navy in general and Adam in particular must battle. It might be easy to die for your country when the enemy is French or Spanish, but when it is a slave runner, the concept becomes a little vague. Fighting in the Bay of Biscay is one thing, fighting in the Bight of Benin is something else entirely.Kent creates the atmosphere of these times with great care. You are faced with seamen, tossed onto the beach without thought, after being through tremendous hardship and danger. You are also faced with the families that they had left behind and now must support in some form or fashion. Also, there is the aristocracy, both of society and the Royal Navy that must be maintained. These features never go away. One would think that the needs of the Naval aristocracy would decrease as the Navy shrinks - far from it!Adam Bolitho is a complex man and as I learn more about him, I can see this. From a bastard orphan to a successful naval officer, we have seem him evolve. Yet he is still dogged by his origins - he has never forgotten the days as a youngster fending for himself as his mother became unable to care and support him.This is a book without the flash and thunder of a fleet action. Now it is a series of actions between schooners and sloops and oared launches. Adam's ship is too big and powerful to be of decisive value except as a resevoir from which to draw men to man the smaller ships. It is this type of action that is honing the skills of the men of Unrivalled and preparing them for the ultimate combat with African pirates.Throughout the book, we are reintroduced to charecters of the past, Thomas Herrick, Daniel Yovel, Graeme Bethune and others. We see an appearance by Richard's daughter Elizabeth as she starts to connect to Adam for after all, in spite of birth situation, he is her closest surviving relative and vice versa.This book is a continuation of the Bolitho family saga. It continues to add to what we know of the family, even if it is only in small details, such as the name of Adam's mother. I found it thoroughly enjoyable and a fine addition to my library. I would recommend it to anyone who has read even a few of the preceeding books on the Bolitho family."},{"Title":"Relentless Pursuit (The Bolitho Novels)","review":"This novel is tagged as a Richard Bolitho novel. It's not. Mr. Kent chose to kill Richard Bolitho off two novels ago and left us with his whining nephew, Adam, who annoyed me from the very beginning. I'd been reading of Richard's many and varied adventures for 25 years and Mr. Kent kills him off in one paragraph!? How did faithful, loyal Allday feel? Who knows? Mr. Kent chose to totally disregard his friendship with Richard. I was so disgusted I donated the book to my local library. Adam is a whiner. The women in Kent's latest novels have the men wrapped around their little fingers. Geez! Where's the fabulous comraderie of the earlier novels, the triumphant battles and the agony of defeat? Also, he killed off most of the wonderful characters I so enjoyed (thank goodness dear Allday was spared, the *only* character left I can empathize with). So no. I will not read another Adam novel."},{"Title":"Relentless Pursuit (The Bolitho Novels)","review":"Since Peace has broken out following the final defeat of Napoleon, the British Navy is on short rations. Nevertheless, Capt. Adam Bolitho is somehow kept on to continue his seaborne adventures begun in the previous volume, #24 Second to None. Before confronting the Dey again, he is assigned to the anti-slave patrols off Africa, and also encounters serious trouble while sailing as a courier for the Admiralty.This is the second novel in this Napleonic Wars series to focus exclusively on Adam Bolitho, Adm. Richard's nephew. Adam is not a genius of tactics or leadership like his mentor. Actually, although Richard is gone, Adam and the other characters spend quite a bit fondly moping about him while they go sailing back and forth. Author Kent waxes nostalgic and layers this novel with extended sentimentality about Richard, We Happy Few, Catherine, Herrick, etc. etc. Naval action is relatively perfunctory relative either to the early books or the sentimental involvements here of Adam with his crew of faithfuls, and with another beautiful but troubled damsel. In other words, this book is strictly for people who've read all the others and are willing to reminisce about their leading characters, many of whom make cameo appearances here."},{"Title":"Relentless Pursuit (The Bolitho Novels)","review":"This is the 25th novel in Kent's Bolitho series. I've read them all up to this one, but this will be the last one. The stories have gotten progressively more wrapped up in angst and moral breast-beating, to the expense of the action that characterized the earlier books. This book might have about 25 pages of actual action at sea, along with 340 pages of emotional entanglements, social injustices, and general moaning. I hope later books improve, but somebody will have to tell me about them, because I don't intend to waste any more of my time."},{"Title":"Relentless Pursuit (The Bolitho Novels)","review":"I am not sure what is happening with this series. It started out great and was fun to read with lots of exciting sea battles and situations. While it was never as good as the Hornblower series, it was good enough to make me enjoy reading it as I followed the career of Richard Bolitho as he rose from the rank of Midshipman to Admiral. Now we are in the 25th book in the series; Richard was killed two books ago; and this series is following the adventures of his nephew, Adam Bolitho, who has so far risen to the rank of Captain and commands his own Frigate. The time line of the series has also moved on and we are now in 1815, after the Napoleonic wars have ended and most of the Navy has been discharged.All of these factors should have allowed Alexander Kent to come up with new and exciting situations. As an Admiral, it was kind of hard to keep putting Bolitho on the vanguard of the various ship actions and in the midst of the battles, but as a frigate Captain? Should have been a new and fertile field. This is where my frustrations with this book and the series start from. Rather than going back to what got this series to be so good, this book does not do so. Instead it is full of retrospection and introspection from various viewpoints and consequently drags along. The book is 364 pages long. In the first 200 pages nothing much happens except for a voyage by Adam's frigate to Freetown to play around with patrolling against slave trading ships and some minor action around it. After that, the frigate returns to England and Adam gets a ten day vacation. To take these two sentences and turn them into two hundred pages was done by having lots of passages of people looking at each other and thinking about various items - mostly about what they did in the past and how they did not like their current life. Adam does this, and so it appears does most of his crew. To make it semi more interesting, the author brings back all of the surviving characters from Richard Bolitho's days and they get to mope around and have thoughts about their past glories. Even the writing style becomes different than before. The sentences are short and they are hints at what was going on rather than formed ideas. Maybe this part of the book was written by someone else?Once we are - finally - past this point, the action picks up a bit. There are two major plots within the book and several other sub-plots that intersect. To develop all of these plots and sub-plots takes another 120 pages or so. To those who are mathematically inclined, you can tell that the resolution of everything took all of forty seven pages. Those pages were exciting enough and reminded me of why I used to enjoy reading the series, but also did nothing but whet my appetite! Not all of the sub-plots were resolved, though. For instance, earlier in the book we learn about seaman Ede and there is clearly a backstory behind him and his presence on the ship. However, after he is introduced and even developed a bit, he all but disappears from the rest of the book. This kind of schizophrenic treatment really makes me think that two different people, or groups of people, wrote this book.As you can tell, I am very disappointed in this book which is why I am giving it only a two star rating. Since it is the 25th book in the series, clearly something has changed as this series would never have gotten this long if this was the normal set of offerings. I can only hope that future volumes will return to the style of writing and the excitement that we are used to reading. Please?"},{"Title":"Relentless Pursuit (The Bolitho Novels)","review":"Great!

The characters all seem so introspective. They obsess over everything they hear and even pick apart what they themselves say. The characters appear to be so joyless, even tragic. I don't care for O'Brien's books but at least Captain Aubrey seems to love serving the Navy and regularly expresses joy and delight...whereas Adam (and often his uncle Richard) are so serious and joyless that it begins to affect the reader. Even when Adam is in love, he still over-thinks every word, gesture, and nuance. In a word, everyone seems so miserable. There are many wonderful things I could say about the Bolitho saga, particularly the lessons learned about leadership and loyalty.

There is a Science fiction story where a human encounters a Computer civilization and the Computer demands millions of books to read and then the Human promises to fill the order and runs away. I have been trying to fill that order ever since by encouraging good writers like Alexander Kent.

I've been a perfectionist about diet and exercise and trying to practice positive thinking, and while they may help people who have nothing else going on in their lives but unexplained anxiety with some minor physical reactions, it didn't even begin to touch on the problems that I'm faced with, not just because of the severity of my physical reactions, but because of the complexity of the circumstances in my life. This is really for the people who can manage their panic on their own, without the help of a qualified therapist. If you have severe panic problems, I would recommend a qualified therapist over reading this book. And by qualified, I mean someone who specializes in panic attacks, because the average therapist (and I've been to too many of those) doesn't even begin to know how to manage someone with panic attacks.

That is a classic for revealing how childhood trauma (real or percieved) and disconnects from our parents can lead to defense behavior that becomes a trap in adulthood.

His own Irish-German mixed background, explored in his memoir &quot;The Speckled People,&quot; enlivens each of the three novels. They are not related, but each tackles alienation within, in this case, Berlin around the fall of the Wall. Itbegins with a literally headlong rush, and draws you into a tangle of relationships.It feels as if based on real situations. This may testify to H's skill in inventing fiction out of his life, or his ability to make it seem so! Either way, without giving away too much of the plot, the Irish narrator must become a &quot;surrogate&quot; companion for a woman he falls for, who may or may not have been jilted by her lover. Interspersed with this plot, a Turkish-German woman widens the relevance of how &quot;outsiders&quot; in Germany can become accepted or remain at odds. Often, fiction that concentrates upon such intimate connections leaves me detached, but Hamilton keeps the narrator's development arc convincing while subtle.His prose style, unassuming, uses transparency to allow you to gaze into the character's depths, and he handles the unfolding story well, given the limitations of the first-person that at times slow the action.

I read all the reviews long before I bought the book but I finally decided it was something that I wanted to read despite the negative reviews, being a fan of Scottish fiction. And I've got to say that I was marginally impressed.To address previous reviews, yes, the book is graphic, offensive, contains horrible language, is not a mystery, is hardly a thriller, and lacks a certain amount of character development, as most of it is spent on protagonist Robbie Catto. Having said that, if you don't mind any of the above, I think that Bunker Man is a fine piece of Scottish fiction.This book paints a rather unsettling picture of a school janitor as he sinks into a psychotic paranoia. And yet, the reader can't help but see some good in him even after he's done his best to alienate himself from society and the reader's sympathies. At the very least McLean is gifted at eliciting emotion from the reader.If you're a devotee of Scottish fiction and have a strong constitution, give it a try. I was more than happy I took the time to read it. I guess its because of the presence of the bunker, but I was immediately reminded of Iain Banks' similarly controversial yet brilliant Wasp Factory. McLean's style of fiction fits well into that of his contemporaries such as Banks, Irvine Welsh, Alan Warner and James Kelman."},{"Title":"Devillier delvings","review":"This is a wonderfully written book that does what really good fiction should do: it stays with you and makes you rethink its characters' motives and actions over and over.I write this in response to the reviews which call this book irresponsible and/or perverse and/or glorying in immoral behavior.

If reading books or watching plays about immoral activities is immoral, then let's start with banning Macbeth and move on from there.Yes, this book is creepy, but that's the point. It is extremely effective creepiness."},{"Title":"Devillier delvings","review":"Haunting and disturbing. Not for those who dislike strong language and graphic descriptions of sex activities. I loked the book for the wonderful portrayal of place. The writer catches speech rhythms perfectly--including prolific use of four letter words, commonly used in those parts. The author describes Robbie's descent into insanity while maintaining the readers sympathy for him almost to the end, at the same time rousing pity for his victims. However the book fails at the end --it stops as if the author had got up from his desk one day and never returned. Something else was needed to round off the story without leaving the reader hanging.

I felt violated, not only by the disgusting and horrible actions by the characters in the book, but by the book in general. I was generally unimpressed by the writing, the characters had little to no redeeming qualities. You can see this in the detailed descriptions of various sex acts, most of which are extraneous to the already muddled plot. What about that Bunker Man? How incidental was he? There is the question of whether or not he exists and is just a part of Rob's psyche. I don't know, and frankly I don't give a damn.

It's well-written technically, and the Scottish dialect gives it a certain charm. The first third, at least, was pretty enjoyable. But the subject, this apparently well-adjusted man's descent into madness and jealous brutality, makes it hard to recommend. I tend to try and encourage my wife to read books I've finished and enjoyed, but not this one.One thing that bothers me about the book is that there's no investigation as to what causes Robbie to descend into this madness: apparently he hasn't always been this way, or at least no one else has noticed it, but he sinks deeper and deeper into this ghastly, inexorable schizophrenia. It sort of has the feel of a play in that regard, something from Tennesee Williams or Ibsen.As an aside, I saw the author at a reading shortly after the book came out, and he certainly didn't seem like the sort of person who would have crafted a book so bleak and brutal."},{"Title":"Devillier delvings","review":"Here we have yet another Scottish writer (cf. Iain Bank's &quot;The Wasp Factory&quot;, Irvine Welsh's &quot;Filth&quot;)who seems to have mastered the art of entering the head of a total psycho and writing about it all in a very unsensational offhand way so that the tension sneaks up on you. This is a very short and quick read, and I don't want to give anything away, but I'll just say that it's a pretty disturbing portrait of a man's decent into paranoia. BTW, there's lots of sex--much of it pretty unpleasant. Not everyone is going to like the ending, but I thought it was effective and the best resolution for all that preceded it.

Maybe I've read too many books of this sort, but the plot development and the ending itself were far from surprising. Maclean should have spent more time in developing the characters other than Robbie Catto. Using perspectives other than Robbie's to present story details would leave the reader with a more complete understanding of Maclean's intentions. Is this a story about insanity creeping up on someone? Or is it a story about how accepting modern people are of another's mental instability and their willingness to turn a blind eye? I was doubtful that the Bunker Man character even existed outside of Robbie's head for most of the book. This seems due to Maclean's unintended obliqueness -- and a problem with keeping Robbie's viewpoint front and center all the time. On the positive side, this didn't take long to read and some of the writing is exemplary.

Rob's disregard for everyone, the students he is supposed to protect, and even for his own wife makes him a very unsympathetic character. You almost wish he would be institutionalized if not killed by Bunker Man, as the novel's cover sets you up for. Despite being the title character, Bunker Man is barely present in the novel. This is one of the most offensive novels I've ever read. It overflows with crudity that sinks the weak almost non exsistant plot. It seems at many times that MacLean doesn't care about any of his characters which I find lacks discernment. I fail to see how anyone could praise this fault ladden novel, yet alone publish it.

First published in 1928, certainly it is somewhat dated. Still, the setting is interesting, the mystery at least clever, and the characters range from impressive (Templar himself and Patricia Holm), to stereotyped but delightful ('Orace), to a little ctoo much P.G. Wodehouse/Bertie Wooster in many of the supporting players. That being said, MEET THE TIGER is a rousing debut, and this early Simon Templar is much harder and more resourceful than his later television incarnation, while at the same time his optimistic determination and rakish smile continue to amuse and delight. Charteris followed MEET THE TIGER with some &quot;prequel&quot; Saint short stories, and then perfected his hero in a series of novels about the encroaching war. A couple of other strong Saint novels (and several perfect short stories) followed, before the character lapsed into formula.

This novel from 1968 explores a future society in which men are outnumbered by women five-to-twelve, thanks to advances in birth control, and where women now run the show. This is a simple satirical device used to shed light on the present, in which dominant men act like sexist pigs and women are held back. But Cooper's future is not incredibly creative, with the dominant women merely taking over in the sexism department, using the rare men as objects. It's also rather hard to believe that the novel's hero is the only man in this future world to lament the situation and to strive for a world of sexual equality. Cooper's ultra-hip writing is also an issue, with the people of 2071 using slang terms like \\"grotty\\" or \\"modcons\\" which were popular in London about a century previous. But while the plot is thin and the hipsterisms are dated, Cooper's satire is still pretty funny, with bodacious dialogue that is fun to read, and a hilariously inept manly revolution. There is also a surprisingly effective mood swing with the story's conclusion. Cooper's satire doesn't lead to much that's really unexpected, but it's still fun and it really adds some illumination to the current real world.

While the advent of female rule has led to many positive things such as an end to war and tremendous medical advances, people can now live hundreds of years, it is a largely stagnant society. The rulers, called Doms, are bored with the task and are always looking for new thrills, which often involves the keeping of a man. Female prostitution is almost nonexistent, male prostitution is a booming trade as the Doms try to find that new thrill that will make their world interesting and exciting again.Dion is also a rebel, yet unsure as to what he should do about it. When he contracts himself to Dom Juno, it becomes a love/hate relationship where neither emotion is very strong. Dion proves to be largely uncommitted to the cause of rebellion, although he does manage to execute two dramatic acts of political terror. The book ends with a bit of hope for a more balanced future as Juno takes the semen of the condemned Dion and uses it to sire a line of strong and healthy males.This novel develops the standard themes of the dystopia very well; there are very strong and positive consequences of the societal changes yet there is also a significant loss of human drive and spirit. Rebels arise to try to recapture that loss and yet there is little that they can truly do. It is interesting reading that also depresses your spirit, as it is a description of a lackluster future where even the powerful have succumbed to an overpowering despondency."},{"Title":"Five To Twelve","review":"&quot;Five To Twelve&quot; is a work of Science Fiction that deals with a future society that is ruled by women.

It is a role reversal story where women are in charge, and men are in the minority. This radical change occurs as the result of the pill which liberates women from having to carry children, and causes mankind to mutate. Unfortunately, the world the author envisions is a world of excess and loving cruelty which is meant to parody a world with patriarchal social values. Bored rich women control everything and throw wild parties while men are treated like bond girls and play the part of dutiful squires. Everyone speaks with a sixties sort of jive, and while a little of the interesting dialect is entertaining, too much of it comes off as a bit self indulgent and at times annoying to read. Also, the world is portrayed through the lens of Dion, who is a very unhappy camper and a misogynist, so the good points of life in this future are seldom showcased.The lead character Dion was a difficult character for me to like. He is a typical 60's wastrel, with no real purpose. He is a thief, and verbally abusive to Juno, the woman who loves him. He delights in playing head games, calls her horrible names, and hits her more than once. Although he saves her life, he resents her being a Dom, but sponges off her so that he can get timeshots and access to her bank account. He resents her not assuming her 'natural role' of child bearer and when the opportunity presents itself, deserts her for the woman-child Sylphide- who he sets about impregnating.There is an underlying misogyny to this story which kept rearing its ugly head and lessened my enjoyment. The implication that birth control is wrong, women without children, are dry and lifeless, and women would act like sexist men if just given power and the opportunity was irksome. Dion seems to be championing man's rights, but I kept thinking if he was in charge, he'd be far worse than the Doms.Also, the fact that the lead character is a 'rebel' and not a normal guy working within the bounds of the society is quite common in role reversal fiction and it would be nice to read about a male who was quite happy with the status quo but had issues with something else.In general, I enjoy stories featuring role reversal situations, but this novel became a bit self indulgent with the jive, and Dion's spoiled nihilism. I did like Juno, and I appreciate the author's attempt to raise awareness on gender equality issues, but I didn't much care for how women were portrayed, the dialog or Dion himself."},{"Title":"Anticipation-The End Is Where We Start From","review":"As a scientist, I am intrigued by Nadin's precise and convincing arguments in favor of \\"anticipation\\" as a characteristic of living being.

She describes preparations for the flight, the actual launch, orbital flight with its characteristic weightlessness, and the return to Earth when the shuttle lands like an airplane on a runway.As an example of how she approaches this subject. She writes that at launch plus six minutes: \\"The force pushing us against the backs of our seats steadily increases. We can barely move because we're being held in place by a force of 3 g's--three times the force of gravity we feel on Earth.

The Broken Vase is one of my favorites. The Fox novels are very good. Fox reminds me of the male protagonist in the Thin Man. Fox is very entertaining, suave and wealthy and is surrounded by a coterie of very, funny oddballs. In a sense, he is Archie's elder precursor. Stout somehow communicates his suaveness, sophistication and elegance. Fox is very much a man about the town and a man in charge.I strongly recommend all of the Fox novels to Wolfe fans and anyone who likes a well-written and entertaining 1940's detective mystery. Stout offered us a rich universe of detective fiction. It'd be silly not to avail oneself of hours of reading pleasure.I can guarantee you'll enjoy them each novel and maybe feel as grateful as I did. Discovering new detective novels by Rex Stout is wonderful! They are equally as good as the Wolfe Cannon.FOR YOUR INFOFor die hard and craving Wolfe fans, Stout wrote two special novels featuring detectives from the Wolfe Cannon.

It is really surprising that a young woman, in the restrictive society of the British in India (for more on this, you can always read E.M. Forster's wonderful 'Passage to India'), could have had so free a spirit to write these poems and publish them, even under a pen name.To cut a long review short, this is a wonderful book if your are looking for either romance, the taste of the exotic or both... a must-read!"},{"Title":"The struggle for Tennessee: Tupelo to Stones River (The Civil War)","review":"\\"The Struggle for Tennessee: Tupelo to Stones River\\" is the second of the volumes in the Time-Life Civil War series dealing with the Western Theater of the war after the Battle of Shiloh. Obviously this part of the war has never received the attention of the Eastern Theater where Lee's Army of Northern Virginia dueled the Army of the Potomac, so there is something intrinsically interesting about finding out more about what was happening out West. James Street, Jr. presents his subject as a war of maneuvers in and around Tennessee. After the capture of Corinth, Mississippi in May 1862, a portion of Major General Don Carlos Buell's Union army was dispatched towards Chattanooga, the critical railroad center that was the gateway to Georgia. However, Confederate armies under Generals Kirby Smith and Braxton Bragg moved from Eastern Tennessee into Kentucky to threatened Louisville and Cincinnati. After a drawn battle at Perryville, Kentucky on October 8, Major General William Rosencrans succeeded Buell and that December left Nashville to fight Bragg's reorganized Army of Tennessee near Murfreesboro, on the banks of Stone River.Street divides these events into five chapters: (1) Heyday for Raiders focuses on the guerrilla tactics of both sides, including James J. Andrews stealing the Western & Atlantic Railroad locomotive named the \\"General,\\" and the raids of John Hunt Morgan. (2) Stumbling Towards Perryville covers the Confederates campaign to retake Kentucky, or at least stop the Federals from moving deeper into Tennessee, climaxing with the Battle of Perryville where both sides claimed victory. (3) Clash at Doctor's Creek has Rosencrans' bringing a new spirit to the Army of the Cumberland preparing them for the key battle in the campaign. (4) The Fight for \\"Hell's Half Acre\\" tells the details of the first half of Battle of Stones River outside Murfreesboro on December 31, where the Confederates turned the Union flank in on itself like a jackknife. (5) Across Stones River and Back completes the battle as the successful attack of the Confederates on the left Union flank succeeded in driving the Federals behind the river, where massed artillery fire staggered the Rebels and set the stage for a successful Union counterattack. With this victory, the Union forces could plan their move on Chattanooga.\\"The Struggle for Tennessee\\" is illustrated with the historic photographs, etchings and color sketches that have always been one of the richest parts of the Time-Life series. I appreciate the detail that Street is able to give to the Battle of Stones River, because by devoting two chapters to it he is able to elevate its significance in the Civil War in a way I have never appreciated before. The story of the Western Theater picks up in two volumes, one devoted to Grant's Vicksburg Campaign in \\"War on the Mississippi\\" and the other picking right up on this volume with \\"The Fight for Chattanooga.\\""},{"Title":"One Fish two fish red fish blue fish (Beginner Book)","review":"My son (18 mths) dislikes this book and cant get past the third page. In fact, he gets a little scared as we go further. Some of the illustrations look too weird. The story also loses appeal and focus as it moves on. The Cat in the Hat is still the best work by Dr Seuss."},{"Title":"One Fish two fish red fish blue fish (Beginner Book)","review":"Just as Seuss covered anti-intellectualism in Green Eggs and Ham, and alternate lifestyles in Hop on Pop, the Fish book is a trenchant political analysis. Foreseeing the red vs. blue state deadlock back in the idealistic better-living-through-chemistry early 1960s, Suess contrasts the red (as in communist) fish with the all-American blue fish. This motif weaves through the book, teaching little ones the red vs. blue tension of multiculturalism (in the form of strange animals) and isolationism of Ned in his too-small bed. While most younger children will miss the allusion to Procrustes, they may remember the literary echo in Hop on Pop: Ned joins Red, Ted, and Ed in a more appropriately sized bed, and Seuss shows his support for the UN, or at least the International Monetary Fund.The tension is palpable when the young boy and girl bring home a large, walrus-like pet and wonder how their mother will feel about their deed; no preschooler could miss this reference to the Teapot Dome scandal. Similarly, their advice to get a pet Yink simply because of its fondness for pale red india writing product is a sardonic commentary on rampant consumerism. And the camel-like Wump shows his prophetic realization that our demand for oil would force us to deal with the Saudis on a regular basis.Seuss warns us of the coming divide in these United States in the introduction: \\"From there to here, from here to there, funny things are everywhere.\\" It starts with the fish, red, blue, and black (but not white, showing where Geisel's sympathies lie), young and old, then proceeds up the evolutionary chain to large land mammals, eventually including the aforementioned school-aged boy and girl. They serve as the Adam and Eve as well as the Joe and Joan Sixpak of the book. They espouse embracing what is different while they reinforce doing the same.Seuss knew where we were headed in both 2000 and 2004, and this book shows the way out. The US has plenty of (pale) red ink, so we should get a Yink. I think."},{"Title":"One Fish two fish red fish blue fish (Beginner Book)","review":"Just don't understand why Dr.Seuss's books are so popular!

Eastman or Alison Jay any time"},{"Title":"One Fish two fish red fish blue fish (Beginner Book)","review":"The more Dr. Seuss books I read, the more I wonder why people love his books so much. The original books are WAY to long (buy the board books!) and remind me of the study that shows that kids these days have a shorter attention span than in the past--15-30 seconds, the length of time of a commercial on TV. Maybe it's not the commercials that did it, but rather Dr. Seuss. After about the third page, this book switches from fish to other creatures. This really confused me. From the title, I expected the whole book to be about fish, and opposites, or at least different descriptors. But not only is it not just fish, after the third page, the whole thing falls apart. Each page has nothing to do with the following page. Why were these pages put together to form one book? Who knows. To the reviewer who says he can read it in any order--this isn't Choose Your Own Adventure.

The book revolves around the motto of \\"funny things are everywhere\\", and the fish in different guises are but the welcome mat to this wild, weird world. The creatures and crazy situations in the book (Yink, Yop, Ying, Gack, Zans, etc) are designed to encourage readers to embrace the world in all its quirkiness and diversity, and there are small sentiments peppered throughout the book such as \\"These things are fun, and fun is good\\" and \\"If you wish to make a wish\\".

It's a great book to read to very small children and it can be broken up into little sections to suit short attention spans. There's counting, color recognition and loads of funny illustrations and wacky, wacky rhymes. It's lively enough that parents and kids can play together as they work their way through the silly stories--each just a page or two long.And as kids get older, this is a great book for them to read by themselves. Suess throws in made-up words so you have a book on a hook and on the book is \\"How to Cook\\" and the whole contraption hangs off the head of a creature called a Nook, who can't read so he can't cook.I love this book, which was published in 1960, the year in which I was first learning to read.

But I've discovered this book now that I have a three year-old of my own, and it has become our favorites. Dr. Seuss is exceptionally skilled at playing with words and rhymes and coming up with hilarious, fun, well-crafted sentences. This book contains some of his best work. The books make learning language great fun. I was amazed last night when my daughter started rattling off the sentences in the book from memory as I read it to her, and she had great fun doing it. A children's book that both children and adults can appreciate and one that inspires in children a love of learning language: what more could a parent want?And one other editorial comment...now that I've spent much time scouring the library shelves for good books for my child, I have come to have tremendous appreciation for Dr. Seuss's talent and wit.

The book helps children learn to count to eleven and it increases their vocabulary as you read it along with them the first few times. Young children just learning to read will be able to read this book as one of their first books that they can read by themselves; and the cute illustrations will delight children and even adults everywhere.The book's plot is not entirely deep--nor should it be for this exceptionally young, tender age group. The book helps kids to learn how to count to eleven and recognize the words for those numbers; it also uses pictures to introduce words for basic colors including red, blue, black, yellow and pink. Children also explore the concepts of old and new; fast and slow; high and low; thin and fat as well as here and there. Excellent! The book also introduces the telephone and how two people can communicate by phone. Your child will love that--they'll think that the phone is a toy!The book is nicely bound and the strength of the hardcover binding makes the book tolerate the bending and occasional carelessness of a young child who is learning to read partly by using this book. Great!I highly recommend One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish for younger kids who are just learning to read. This book will increase their vocabulary by introducing words, comparisons and pictures. The child also gets a heightened awareness of the world around them; and the adorable illustrations will delight children everywhere.Great job, Dr. Seuss!"},{"Title":"One Fish two fish red fish blue fish (Beginner Book)","review":"An outstanding book for kids and adults and who want to enjoy a goodlaugh.It also very educational book, we all know reading helps you comprehend words better but this book also teaches you how to rhyme.

The publisher did not think this book would sell because it was so simple. What a genious Dr. Seuss turned out to be because of it's simplicity.

Older children will smile when they see the book years later and make comments along the lines \\"I loved this\\".Like all of Dr. Suess' books, it is both colorfull and whimsical. The book teaches children to read by using nonsensical animals and ryhmes. A child can read one little section and not become bored or lost because the book is not connected with a story. That is the beauty of this book. It is a childrens book written for children and their thinking. No heavy messages here, just plain fun. The colors catch the eye, the rhymes catch the ears, and the shear silliness cathes the imagination. It is truly a wonderfull gift to give a parent of younger children.

Towards the end it tells about people and kids having weird pets who all serve some useful purpose or other towards the owner of the animal.

His wonderful, ridiculous stories brightened my childhood as much as they brightened the antique, polished pine bookcase in the otherwise formal family room in the house where I grew up. Don't get me wrong, I loved that house. My grandfather designed it and my mother painstakingly decorated it. The family room just wasn't used as an every day place. It was unofficially reserved for holidays, special guests, the occasional family meeting, and for my collection of colorful Dr. Seuss books. Even a decade and more after the books moved from my bedroom to the old bookcase in the family room, they remained there. Had my parents not boxed their belongings and moved after I reached adulthood, I suspect Dr. Seuss would still be lining those shelves.That's the effect Dr. Seuss can have on his readers: enduring fondness.

If only the messages in today's music were as positive as Dr. Suess.Kids love rhymes, and parents love reading them to kids. It's like we're all hard-wired to enjoy rhythm which is almost spelled the same as rhyme. All, enough with the deep thinking, I recommend all of Dr. Suess' work to parents to read to kids of all ages. They are all a joy and this book is no exception. The illustrations are original, whimsical and so much fun that knowing how kids like the same books read over and over to them, this book works for me.

This book delivers just that, Dr Seuss had the right idea when this book was written, he combined rhyming with counting and incorporated colors, any child is sure to have fun and learn all at the same time with this clever little book.I read it to my children when they were small, and i will read it to my grandchildren someday, its a classic that will go down in history.Lori Ann LibbyAuthor ofThe Adventures of Henry Hamper and the Flying Fish"},{"Title":"One Fish two fish red fish blue fish (Beginner Book)","review":"The thing I like most about this book is it survives the perpetual-reading test, that is, neither my daughter nor I am tired of reading it after two years.&quot;One Fish...&quot; is really composed of several &quot;short&quot; sections that can be read in any order, so for a toddler, it's perfectly fine to skip around. In fact, this is conducive to a toddler's randomness - one day it's &quot;Hop hop hop, I am a Yop&quot;; another day it's &quot;From there to here.&quot;"},{"Title":"One Fish two fish red fish blue fish (Beginner Book)","review":"Allright ya little PUNKS. You go read your Tom Clancys and your sappy Danielle Steel romance novels and your &quot;Bridges of Madison County&quot;s and we can even go back time to your Mark Twains and your &quot;Catcher In The Rye&quot;s, you go read ALL of that. Then read THIS book, and YOU tell me which one is better. Because NONE of that can match the emotional intensity of reading to your kids at bedtime: &quot;Once there was a little Nook. On his hat he had a hook. On his hook he had a book. On his book was &quot;How to Cook&quot;. But a Nook can't read and a Nook can't cook, so what good to a Nook is a hook cook book?&quot; AWESOME!"},{"Title":"One Fish two fish red fish blue fish (Beginner Book)","review":"Researchers constantly find that reading to children is valuable in a variety of ways, not least of which are instilling a love of reading and improved reading skills. With better parent-child bonding from reading, your child will also be more emotionally secure and able to relate better to others. Intellectual performance will expand as well. Spending time together watching television fails as a substitute.To help other parents apply this advice, as a parent of four I consulted an expert, our youngest child, and asked her to share with me her favorite books that were read to her as a young child. One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish was her pick as the best of the books by Dr. Seuss.One of the appeals of this book is that it is relatively easy to learn to read, yet has much more variety than most other early readers. So your child will feel like she or he has accomplished a lot with reading this book, which is correct.The title gives the key to why this book works well as an early reader. One word is changed at a time, with a clear illustration next to it. Most children will read the illustrations like a rebus and later associate the words with the sounds of the name for the pictures. At some point, they begin reading from the words. Very nice!Here's another sequence: &quot;black fish blue fish old fish new fish.&quot;Then, when he moves on, he uses simple rhymes: &quot;This one has a little star. This one has a little car.&quot;Next, he progresses to substituting &quot;some&quot; for &quot;fish&quot; and adding a single verb to make a sentence as in &quot;Some are read . . . . Some are old.&quot;So almost any child can soon begin to read along with few errors in the first 2 or 3 pages. Whenever the child can go no more, you can just keep going. With repetition, more of the book becomes memorized and the process continues.There is another reward for you and your child: The book also previews many of the wonderful characters and rhyming schemes that appear in other Dr. Seuss books. As a result, it will be easier to get started reading those books. You will feel like you are seeing an old friend again.You can also use each rhyme to take off on your own speculations. Our daughter used to love to come up with alternative rhymes that fit the pictures.Books like this one make it great fun to be either a parent or a child. In some cases, this book will be there for you in both roles over 20 to 40 years!Overcome your mistaken beliefs about how children can start to learn to read by seeing your child start naturally by associating the words with the pictures as you read this wonderful book to him or her!"},{"Title":"One Fish two fish red fish blue fish (Beginner Book)","review":"After reading this book to my 6 month old, I'm convinced it's never too early to read to a child. She recognizes those wonder rhyming patterns and squeals in delight."},{"Title":"One Fish two fish red fish blue fish (Beginner Book)","review":"The book's content will always be wonderful, but this reprint--the physical book (1988)--is a disappointment. It's smaller than the edition I grew up with; smaller than the ones my kids had.The picture shown is deceiving This edition has a big red jagged permanent thing just under the \\"blue fish\\" of the title, nearly as long as the title words \\"red fish\\" and as wide as the space between \\"red fish\\" and \\"blue fish\\". In the red splotch it says, in white, \\"Look inside if you wish for a FREE gift!\\" Boo! Yuck!"},{"Title":"One Fish two fish red fish blue fish (Beginner Book)","review":"Since my 7-month-old still thinks books are for putting in your mouth, I've been buying him bath books. I bought this one sight unseen from Amazon, and as much as I love the classic \\"One Fish, Two Fish,\\" I was a little disappointed. First, the book is small, even for a bath book (about 4x6 inches -- the \\"8.3 x 4.8\\" dimensions in the Amazon description are just plain WRONG). Second, the book was shorter than I expected. It consists only of the first 8 pages of the original \\"One Fish.\\" Of course, the baby doesn't know how abridged the book is, so he enjoys it. And the colors are bright, the printing is sharp, and the overall package is high-quality and holds up to lots of handling. But there's not much there to read to him.Overall, if you're looking for a durable \\"One Fish\\" edition that's good for mealtimes, or bath time, or for taking in the stroller, this is an excellent buy. Just be aware that it's no substitute for the real thing."},{"Title":"One Fish two fish red fish blue fish (Beginner Book)","review":"The copy I had as a child wore out when I was in college (A friend borrowed it to memorize and perform as an acting class assignment.) I have part of the book memorized myself just from having my Mom read it to me 37 years ago. Having just aquired a 5-year old nephew I had of course to buy him several of my favorite Dr. Seuss books and this was one of them. I may have to buy my own copy though. In fact, I may buy two because I am extremely tempted to frame my favorite piece, \\"Look what we found in the dark in the park. We will take it home.

The fun filled fantasy world of Dr Suess has lost none of its charm. &quot;One Fish Two Fish&quot; is one of his best.The theme of this book is &quot;funny things are everywhere&quot;. Dr Suess goes on to prove this by introducing a long list of fantastic but friendly characters. The creatures are at times outrageous looking but they are never frightening. There is no chance of monster-phobia developing in children after reading these books.Anything is possible in this book. You have to love the seven hump Wump with its eight legs. It bears an uncanny resemblance to a camel.Children will get to love the rhyme and rhythms of the words in this book. Children will be encouraged to make their own word play. It is possible new skills in creative thinking and even musical aptitude may emerge in children after having fun in the Suess world. On thing is for sure, a love of reading will certainly be encouraged.Spatial thinking is encouraged with humorous signposts to Near and Far, and Here and There. Young minds will adore taking the advice &quot;if you wish to wish a wish&quot;.&quot;One fish two fish&quot; makes a great bedtime book.

But I always caught her, and made her go back and read it!!Now, I read it to my kids... it doesn't help get them to sleep though. In fact, it only gets them more and more excited and silly. But it's a family favorite, and I'm sure it will be a family favorite for your child. What educational value does it have for children?? Well, it does help teach children to rhyme.

The cover attracted me. I flipped through it and then purchased it. I read it to her every night for some time. Those were good days.

(Ironically, this fit very well with a lesson). And yet there is something incredibly fun about the random creatures trotting themselves out in all their quirky Suessian glory. So no, there is no logical plot, but we get fun pictures and dazzling rhymes that we love."},{"Title":"One Fish two fish red fish blue fish (Beginner Book)","review":"You might think that &quot;One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish&quot; is a Dr. Seuss book about counting or colors (or counting and colors or even counting colors), but that would simply be the hook for something much larger. The thesis of this Beginner Book appears opposite the first page, where we are informed by a small creature with a giant mustache and a yellow star for a belly button that &quot;From there to here, from here to there, funny things are everywhere.&quot; If anything this Dr. Seuss book has bits and pieces from lots of other Dr. Seuss books. You have a series of opposite because fish are not only red and blue but old and new, you have Ned who does not like his bed, there is Yop who only likes to hop from finger top to finger top, and all sorts of strange looking animals. There is even a creature that looks like the Cat in the Hat except he is completely yellow, including his hat, has a polka dot bow tie, and eleven fingers.Consequently, if &quot;One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish&quot; is one of the first Dr. Seuss books that a beginning reader begins reading they should go back and read it again after they have gone through the rest of the good doctor's books because they will then be better able to appreciate some of the familiar faces in this book. However, since this is not a book for early beginning readers, most kids will get to this one after they have covered the basic Dr. Seuss books and become well accustomed to his delightful volumes of rhymed absurdity. This particular book has been inspiring the imagination of beginning readers since 1960 and there is no reason for it to stop with that endeavor at this point in time."},{"Title":"One Fish two fish red fish blue fish (Beginner Book)","review":"An epic, amazing, astonishing tale into true philosophy of the human intellect. The story dives deep down into the bowels of our minds, posing us the question- what if the fish had a car? The thoughts have puzzled me for 75 years, and I am yet to discover the true solution to the problem. Is it freedom? Or truth? Perhaps peace? Yes? No? Could it be for love? Vagaries of perception, although only Dr. Seuss mind could invent something as insipid as love. Truly, one of the most astonishing stories I have read in my life, and without a doubt the greatest, deepest, and most politically influencing novel of all time. With ventures into the intersanctum of the human construct, it's a book for anyone attempting to justify an existence that is without meaning or purpose."},{"Title":"One Fish two fish red fish blue fish (Beginner Book)","review":"This was a really good book.

I remember my Second grade teacher reading this to the class and us having to do a worksheet that had us matching words that rhmey and then teaching us to figure out the syllables by clapping and then dividing words into as many syllables as the word had.

It is composed of short, funny scenes that are strung together to form a certain coherency as the creatures named become sillier and sillier. After nine or ten read-alouds it starts to feel a bit long for adults, but the short scenes make it a good fit both for rambunctious toddlers with short attention spans, and early readers who will benefit from the achievement of finishing each scene. It also comes in an audio version."},{"Title":"One Fish two fish red fish blue fish (Beginner Book)","review":"This book (like many Dr Seuss Books) is a favorite bedtime read and it is one that seems to have been memorized quickly and one that started my child reading.

This book is by Dr. Seuss. Other Books by this author are:1: I Can Read With My Eyes Shut!2: Green Eggs and Ham!3: The Cat in the Hat!The Genre is fiction and the theme is best described as learning about rhyming and counting .The Authors writing style is rhythm and the main characters in this book are two kids a girl and a boy who are learning to count but learning about a strange word at the same time! My favorite character in this story is the Whump it's a moose but longer and more bumps on its back.The back round information for this paragraph is to teach younger kids to count and observe and just to have fun. The seen I think is most important/exciting is when goes 1 fish, 2 fish, red fish, and blue fish. If you want to know the ending you have to read the book.My recommendation for this book is for people who want to teach there kids to count in a fun and easy way.

The rhymes are magically witty and whimsical. Be forewarned. Both you and your child may be reciting rhymes in your sleep.Dr. Seuss stimulated my imagination as a child.

I would have given it zero stars, but that wasn't an option. The book is read MUCH TOO FAST for a child to follow along and turn the pages. The page turn signal is a tiny bell that is hard to hear and so short it gives no time to separate the pages and turn them. By the time a child gets the page turned, the reader is 4 or 5 pages ahead because they are also reading SO FAST! This could have been a really good book for an audio read along because the print is large and the words are simple and rhyming, but it is read so quickly a child just learning to read doesn't even have the chance to determine which word is being read. My 4 year old loves read along books but became so frustrated with this book he didn't want to ever read it again. Extremely disappointing as a parent and discouraging for a beginning reader. The Curious George read along series is so much better, although it doesn't have the large text or simple words. Curious George is read with interesting inflections and gives children sufficient time to follow along and turn the pages themselves.

Rich in clever rhymes and memorable images, this book scores a literary home run on nearly every page.Directed towards early readers, &quot;One Fish&quot; uses simple language in its funny rhymes. Seuss mixes his own created words together with standard vocabulary, resulting in such memorable lines as &quot;just jump on the hump of the Wump of Gump.&quot; And these rhymes are accompanied by a rich variety of images that can only be described as &quot;Seussian&quot;: A mother fish pushing her offspring in a baby carriage, a bed being commandeered by a menagerie of animals, and more.Futhermore, in &quot;One Fish&quot; Dr. Seuss introduces us to a wonderful assortment of Seussian creatures: the singing Ying, the hopping Yop, a truly bizarre creature known simply as &quot;Clark,&quot; and many more. These images are sure to energize the imaginations of both children and adults.Seuss's images range from the joyful to the eerie, from the baroque to the earthy. I give &quot;One Fish&quot; my most enthusiastic recommendation."},{"Title":"One Fish two fish red fish blue fish (Beginner Book)","review":"My kids love Dr. Suess's books.

I have found that even children who are in school will like the book if they are still a beginning reader, because it is so colorful, easy to memorize, and the rhymes are great. If your youngster doesn't have this book already, I highly reccommend that you pick it up for him/her."},{"Title":"One Fish two fish red fish blue fish (Beginner Book)","review":"My two year old really loves this book. It is a rhyming book that introduces smaller words for younger children. I like this book and best of all my child likes it."},{"Title":"One Fish two fish red fish blue fish (Beginner Book)","review":"ISBN 0394800133 - Not my favorite Dr. Seuss, if only because it's a little long.A Dr. Seuss that's long is wrong -My child falls asleep too fast!Too many pages, he can't last.Yeah, Dr. Seuss is always a favorite, but this one was one my kid always fell asleep during. He didn't hear the end of the book for years! As a storytime title, rather than a NAPtime choice, though, it's a great book for little ones. You might get tongue-tied reading it, but that's okay, too - you'll laugh together, reading will be fun and everything will work out perfectly!- AnnaLovesBooks"},{"Title":"One Fish two fish red fish blue fish (Beginner Book)","review":"This book has a special place in my heart. This was the first book I read from cover to cover. It was a proud moment in my childhood. Like most Dr. Seuss books, you don't just read it, you experience it! the illustrations and the simple, yet brilliant text transport you to another world."},{"Title":"One Fish two fish red fish blue fish (Beginner Book)","review":"I read this to my daughters when they were little & plan on reading it to my new granddaughter when she's old enough! ;-)"},{"Title":"One Fish two fish red fish blue fish (Beginner Book)","review":"My Sons Really enjoy it They want to hear the story every night, even as they get older they still listen"},{"Title":"One Fish two fish red fish blue fish (Beginner Book)","review":"I bought this for a Christmas present for my granddaughter and I know she will love it as much as I do."},{"Title":"One Fish two fish red fish blue fish (Beginner Book)","review":"Excellent Dr. Seuss book. Good price. I recommend to anyone with small children. But I hate this word requirement. Won't review other products."},{"Title":"One Fish two fish red fish blue fish (Beginner Book)","review":"This is a great book to read to children to teach them how to pay attention to the books you're reading. You can point out colors and count the fish, and then have them do the same."},{"Title":"One Fish two fish red fish blue fish (Beginner Book)","review":"I used to read and love this when I was a kid and now that i have a 17-month-old child I love reading it to my son. He enjoys the drawings and the sound of the words. It is fun for me to read and give voices too. The weird thing is that I remember some of the drawings line for line from when I was younger. This really must have made a strong impression on me. I hope it does the same for my son."},{"Title":"One Fish two fish red fish blue fish (Beginner Book)","review":"I mainly bought this book to read to my 2 year old grandson and then I saw on Martha Stewart they had a fishing game to go with it. So I made my grandson the fishing game and boy he sure likes it. He doesn't quite get that he is supposed to fish for a certain color of fish but he will when he's bigger. Glad I bought the book and great transaction with amazon!!"},{"Title":"One Fish two fish red fish blue fish (Beginner Book)","review":"I found that my favorite website[...] recommended this book as Top10 counting book. I'd rather said that there're only few places in this book saying about number. The concept of counting is not clear. Anyway, it's my sons' favorite book. They love the rhyme and fell fast sleep before I read the last page every time. But I don't like the weird names of animals in this book."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],D={key:0},W={key:1};function E(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",M,[(e(!0),t(g,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",W,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",D,"See more"))],8,x)):p("",!0)])}const R=d(B,[["render",E],["__scopeId","data-v-fdf3ad54"]]),H=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/2.md","filePath":"quotesmag/2.md"}'),P={name:"quotesmag/2.md"},O=Object.assign(P,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(R)]))}});export{H as __pageData,O as default};
