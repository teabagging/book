Since the nineteenth century, scientists have attempted to understand the complex processes of the Earth's atmosphere and the weather created within it. This effort has evolved with the development of new technologies -- from the first instrument-equipped weather balloons to multibillion-dollar meteorological satellite and planetary science programs. Erik M. Conway chronicles the history of atmospheric science at NASA, tracing the story from its beginnings in 1958, the International Geophysical Year, through to the present, focusing on NASA's programs and research in meteorology, stratospheric ozone depletion, and planetary climates and global warming. But the story is not only a scientific one. NASA's researchers operated within an often politically contentious environment. Although environmental issues garnered strong public and political support in the 1970s, the following decades saw increased opposition to environmentalism as a threat to free market capitalism. Atmospheric Science at NASA critically examines this politically controversial science, dissecting the often convoluted roles, motives, and relationships of the various institutional actors involved -- among them NASA, congressional appropriation committees, government weather and climate bureaus, and the military. -- Kristine C.

As a child, she was an eyewitness to a third awakening of freedom, when her hometown of Birmingham, Alabama, became the epicenter of the civil rights movement for black Americans. In this book, Rice explains what these epochal events teach us about democracy. At a time when people around the world are wondering whether democracy is in decline, Rice shares insights from her experiences as a policymaker, scholar, and citizen, in order to put democracy's challenges into perspective. When the United States was founded, it was the only attempt at self-government in the world. Today more than half of all countries qualify as democracies, and in the long run that number will continue to grow. Yet nothing worthwhile ever comes easily. Using America's long struggle as a template, Rice draws lessons for democracy around the world -- from Russia, Poland, and Ukraine, to Kenya, Colombia, and the Middle East. She finds that no transitions to democracy are the same because every country starts in a different place. Pathways diverge and sometimes circle backward. Time frames for success vary dramatically, and countries often suffer false starts before getting it right. But, Rice argues, that does not mean they should not try. While the ideal conditions for democracy are well known in academia, they never exist in the real world. The question is not how to create perfect circumstances but how to move forward under difficult ones. These same insights apply in overcoming the challenges faced by governments today. The pursuit of democracy is a continuing struggle shared by people around the world, whether they are opposing authoritarian regimes, establishing new democratic institutions, or reforming mature democracies to better live up to their ideals. The work of securing it is never finished.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MCn6DAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Justus","description":"A fresh interpretation of Liebig's stormy career, showing how he moved chemistry into the sociopolitical marketplace.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VugoemP2th0C&dq=Justus&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hawaii's Fishes : A Guide for Snorkelers and Divers","description":"\\"Underwater photographs and informative descriptions of over 240 species, including classification, evolution, and best locations to spot them.\\"--Amazon.com.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5EsWAQAAIAAJ&dq=Hawaii%27s+Fishes+:+A+Guide+for+Snorkelers+and+Divers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Value Players for Rotisserie Baseball","description":"How to Value Players for Rotisserie Baseball will teach readers how to calculate the best player values for their draft or auction.

For nearly a decade, Palley has been on the frontline of fire. He has witnessed homeowners on the worst day of their lives. He's seen puddles of aluminum where cars were once parked. He's watched as 150-foot walls of flame cascaded down mountainsides and crashed into the Pacific Ocean. And he's captured, time and again, the tireless commitment of firefighters as they work to save lives and homes, in terrain where fire always seems to have the upper hand. In this memoir, Palley recalls how he went from a rookie who was a danger to himself and others to a fire-savvy documentarian of wildfire and climate change. He covers some of California's largest, most destructive, and deadliest fires between 2012 and 2020, lugging his gear from the Wine Country Fire Siege to the Thomas Fire and ultimately to the Woolsey Fire in Malibu. And he shows how, in a relatively short span of time, fire season in California has grown into a perpetual crisis, requiring billions of dollars and thousands of firefighters each year. Ultimately, the experiences, the voices, the science shared in the memoir form an urgent call for climate action. Into the Inferno stands alongside Palley's photography to show just what kind of environmental tragedy we can expect if we do nothing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uL8xzwEACAAJ&dq=INTO+THE+INFERNO&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mirror Image (Arabesque)","description":"Marsha Chambers, the country's hottest talk show host, isn't who she seems to be--she's being impersonated by celebrity look-alike Aurora Alexander.

However, many of the tanks were constructed with the static warfare of the Western Front in mind and were thus slow and had short operational ranges. Others were too light to face opposing tanks or the new generation of anti-tank weapons that hadn't existed in World War I. The unsuitability of these tank models for this new kind of warfare was quickly recognized, and the belligerent powers scrambled to create better designs. As each new, improved model came off the assembly lines, the opposing powers rushed to create a tank that could beat it. In that regard, World War II was also a war between rival engineers. At the same time, German military officials were at the forefront of developing new ideologies when it came to utilizing their tanks to maximum effect. Heinz Guderian even published a book on the topic before becoming one of the Third Reich's most effective tank commanders. Moreover, during the German invasion of Poland, Nazi forces gained experience they would use across Europe and in Russia. After all, it was in Poland that the Wehrmacht saw action for the first time, conducting what was not only an invasion but also a trial run of its new equipment and tactics. The Polish invasion proved invaluable in providing the German high command with a low-risk, high-value live fire exercise for their newly minted war machine, while the actual combat experience highlighted the remaining flaws in the system. During the campaign, the Germans honed tactics and weapon systems for the massive struggle with the Soviets, British, and United States that loomed on the horizon. The beginning of World War II found the major powers developing tanks to some extent, but lingering ideas from World War I affected the development of tanks during the Interwar period. As a result, aside from the blitzkrieg doctrine developed by the Nazis, tanks were still used in terms of infantry support, and there were few wars during this period to give strategists the chance to develop better uses for the new armored vehicles before World War II started. Commanders soon found that many of the tanks fielded in the campaigns of 1939-1941 lacked the necessary armor, guns, and designs. The Allies learned from the Germans as well. The first and most obvious lesson was to equip each tank with a radio. At the beginning of the war, most Allied tanks did not have radios and used small flags to signal to each other, an unreliable means under ideal conditions, let alone in the midst of battlefield chaos. The Panzers, on the other hand, were equipped with radios from the very start, providing German tank commanders with far more control over their units. Throughout the war, designers learned how to improve suspension, reorganize the interior to give the crews more room, and incorporate other upgrades that helped with the overall function of the tank. Practical experience from the tank crews was of vital importance in these developments. Inevitably, tactics evolved throughout the war. The Germans were early leaders in tank tactics, as their successes from Poland through the opening phases of Operation Barbarossa demonstrated. The main German tank tactic was the so-called Schwerpunkt (\\"center of gravity\\"), in which a concentration of tanks achieved a local superiority, broke through, and drove deep behind enemy lines, carving up frontline enemy forces that could then be surrounded and taken out by support tanks, infantry, and artillery. This is why German tanks were built for speed while maintaining good armor and weaponry.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=B_aqtgEACAAJ&dq=German+tank+and+antitank+in+World+War+II&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Soulstorm","description":"The twenty-none stories in Soulstorm were originally published in two separate volumes in 1974 A Via Crucis do Corpo (The Stations of the Body) and Onde Estivestes de Noite (Where You Were at Night) and are now combined and sensitively translated into English by Alexis Levitan.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IiyPBYEQG2IC&dq=Soulstorm&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Yuletide Seduction (Xmas) (Presents, 2141)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6UpYAAAAMAAJ&dq=Yuletide+Seduction+(Xmas)+(Presents,+2141)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Near to Nature's Heart","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XhOLswEACAAJ&dq=Near+to+Nature%27s+Heart&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Blood-Soaked Soil","description":"SS: The Blood-Soaked Soil Williamson Subtitled: The Battles of the Waffen-SS.

Ghosts of New York is a novel in which the laws of time and space have been subtly suspended. It interweaves four strands: a photographer newly returned to the neighborhood where she grew up, after years spent living overseas; a foundling raised on 14th Street; a graduate student, his romantic partner, and his best friend entangled in a set of relationships with far-reaching personal and political repercussions; and a shopkeeper suffering from first love late in life. Mixing prophecy, history, and a hint of speculative fiction, its stories are bound together even as they are propelled into stranger territory. And undergirding it all is a song, which appears, disappears, and then resurfaces. Ghosts of New York explores complex lives through indelible renderings of settings-a bar, a night market, a recording studio-that alternate between familiar and unsettling. The work of a celebrated novelist and veteran of the art, film, and music scenes in New York and Austin (described as \\"a rare talent\\" by the New York Times and \\"a powerful literary voice\\" by Jeffrey Eugenides), this novel will immediately absorb readers intrigued by creative people and the places that sustain and challenge them.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tMq_zQEACAAJ&dq=Ghosts+of+New+York&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Letting Go of Debt: Growing Richer One Day at a Time","description":"These meditations offer courage and hope for anyone suffering from chronic debt.

These nostalgic narratives obscure many other histories of postwar childhood, one of which has more in common with the war years and the sixties, when children were mobilized and politicized by the U.S. government, private corporations, and individual adults to fight the Cold War both at home and abroad. Children battled communism in its various guises on television, the movies, and comic books; they practiced safety drills, joined civil preparedness groups, and helped to build and stock bomb shelters in the backyard. Children collected coins for UNICEF, exchanged art with other children around the world, prepared for nuclear war through the Boy and Girl Scouts, raised funds for Radio Free Europe, sent clothing to refugee children, and donated books to restock the diminished library shelves of war-torn Europe. Rather than rationing and saving, American children were encouraged to spend and consume in order to maintain the engine of American prosperity. In these capacities, American children functioned as ambassadors, cultural diplomats, and representatives of the United States. Victoria M. Grieve examines this politicized childhood at the peak of the Cold War, and the many ways children and ideas about childhood were pressed into political service. Little Cold Warriors combines approaches from childhood studies and diplomatic history to understand the cultural Cold War through the activities and experiences of young Americans.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-V5gDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Tent of Abraham: Stories of Hope and Peace for Jews, Christians, and Muslims","description":"The Tent of Abraham is the first book to tell the entire story of Abraham and to reenergize it as a basis for peace.

A NEW YORK TIMES NOTABLE BOOK The remarkable story of James Howard  Billy  Williams, whose uncanny rapport with the world s largest land animals transformed him from a carefree young man into the charismatic war hero known as Elephant Bill In 1920, Billy Williams came to colonial Burma as a  forest man  for a British teak company. Mesmerized by the intelligence and character of the great animals who hauled logs through the jungle, he became a gifted  elephant wallah.  In Elephant Company, Vicki Constantine Croke chronicles Williams s growing love for elephants as the animals provide him lessons in courage, trust, and gratitude. Elephant Company is also a tale of war and daring. When Japanese forces invaded Burma in 1942, Williams joined the elite British Force 136 and operated behind enemy lines. His war elephants carried supplies, helped build bridges, and transported the sick and elderly over treacherous mountain terrain. As the occupying authorities put a price on his head, Williams and his elephants faced their most perilous test. Elephant Company, cornered by the enemy, attempted a desperate escape: a risky trek over the mountainous border to India, with a bedraggled group of refugees in tow. Part biography, part war epic, Elephant Company is an inspirational narrative that illuminates a little-known chapter in the annals of wartime heroism. Praise for Elephant Company  This book is about far more than just the war, or even elephants. This is the story of friendship, loyalty and breathtaking bravery that transcends species. . . . Elephant Company is nothing less than a sweeping tale, masterfully written.  Sara Gruen, The New York Times Book Review  Splendid . . .

But she has more important things to worry about, like maintaining her status as fiercest rakkhosh in her class and looking after her little cousins. There is also the teeny tiny detail of not yet being able to control her fire breathing and accidentally burning up school property. Then Sesha, the charming son of the Serpentine Governor, calls on Pinki for help in defeating the resistance, promising to give her what she most desires in return -- the ability to control her fire.

For almost 2,500 years, Buddhism has been dominant on the Indian subcontinent, based on the traditions, beliefs, and practices that came about from the teachings of the Buddha (Siddhartha Gautama), the Sansrkit word for \\"the awakened one.\\" Today, three distinct branches of Buddhism have mostly fanned out across Asia, and it's believed that upwards of half a billion people practice Buddhism today, and some of the traditional practices and principles of the religion, including the concepts of karma, reincarnation and the practice of yoga are all commonplace ideas across the world. Who was the Buddha, how did Buddhism become one of the world's major religions, and what are the main concepts and teachings of the religion? Religions of the World: The History of Buddhism examines the history and main tenets of Buddhism, explaining the way the religion has evolved over time, the similarities it shares with other religions and the differences that make it unique. Along with pictures of important figures and places, you will learn about Buddhism like you never have before, in no time at all.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XRlKtAEACAAJ&dq=Buddhism:+A+History+(Religions+of+the+World)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wind Off the Small Isles","description":"The Wind Off the Small Isles is beloved author Mary Stewart's long-lost novella, now available in paperback for the first time in 40 years and perfect for fans of Anya Seton, Daphne du Maurier and Santa Montefiore. 1879.

How do scientific discoveries happen? Why are cold fusion and parapsychology different from mainstream science? What is a scientific worldview? In this lively and wide-ranging book, Gregory Derry talks about these and other questions as he introduces the reader to the process of scientific thinking. From the discovery of X rays and semiconductors to the argument for continental drift to the invention of the smallpox vaccine, scientific work has proceeded through honest observation, critical reasoning, and sometimes just plain luck. Derry starts out with historical examples, leading readers through the events, experiments, blind alleys, and thoughts of scientists in the midst of discovery and invention. Readers at all levels will come away with an enriched appreciation of how science operates and how it connects with our daily lives. An especially valuable feature of this book is the actual demonstration of scientific reasoning. Derry shows how scientists use a small number of powerful yet simple methods--symmetry, scaling, linearity, and feedback, for example--to construct realistic models that describe a number of diverse real-life problems, such as drug uptake in the body, the inner workings of atoms, and the laws of heredity. Science involves a particular way of thinking about the world, and Derry shows the reader that a scientific viewpoint can benefit most personal philosophies and fields of study. With an eye to both the power and limits of science, he explores the relationships between science and topics such as religion, ethics, and philosophy. By tackling the subject of science from all angles, including the nuts and bolts of the trade as well as its place in the overall scheme of life, the book provides a perfect place to start thinking like a scientist.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Dk-xS6nABrYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Henry Cowell, Bohemian (Music in American Life)","description":"In this first full-length study of Henry Cowell, Michael Hicks shows how the maverick composer, writer, teacher, and performer built his career on the intellectual and aesthetic foundations of his parents, community, and teachers--and exemplified the essence of bohemian California. Author of the highly influential New Musical Resources and a teacher of John Cage, Lou Harrison, and Burt Bacharach, Cowell is regarded as an innovator, a rebel, and a genius. One of the first American composers to be celebrated for the novelty of his techniques, Cowell popularized a series of experimental piano-playing techniques that included pounding his fists and forearms on the keys and plucking the piano strings directly to achieve the exotic, dissonant sounds he desired. Henry Cowell, Bohemian traces the venerated experimentalist's radical ideas back to his teachers, including Charles Seeger, Samuel Seward, and E. G. Stricklen, the tightknit artistic communities in the San Francisco Bay area where he grew up and first started composing, and the immeasurable influence of his parents. Mining the published and unpublished writings of his mother, a politically motivated novelist from the Midwest who carefully monitored the pulse of her son's creativity from birth, Hicks provides insight into the composer's heritage, artistic inclinations, and childhood.Focusing on Cowell's formative and most prolific years, from his birth in 1897 through his incarceration on a morals conviction in the 1930s, Hicks examines the philosophical fervor that fueled his whirlwind compositions, and the ways his irrepressible bohemian spirit helped foster an appreciation in the United States and Europe for a new brand of American music.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=U_AAiFRmTM0C&dq=Henry+Cowell,+Bohemian+(Music+in+American+Life)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lyrics of the French Renaissance: Marot, Du Bellay, Ronsard","description":"Renowned translator Norman R. Shapiro here presents fresh English versions of poems by three of Western literature s most gifted and prolific poets the French Renaissance writers Cl ment Marot, Joachim Du Bellay, and Pierre de Ronsard.

Foreign in a Domestic Sense will redefine the boundaries of constitutional scholarship. More than four million U.S. citizens currently live in five  unincorporated  U.S. territories. The inhabitants of these vestiges of an American empire are denied full representation in Congress and cannot vote in presidential elections. Focusing on Puerto Rico, the largest and most populous of the territories, Foreign in a Domestic Sense sheds much-needed light on the United States  unfinished colonial experiment and its legacy of racially rooted imperialism, while insisting on the centrality of these  marginal  regions in any serious treatment of American constitutional history. For one hundred years, Puerto Ricans have struggled to define their place in a nation that neither wants them nor wants to let them go. They are caught in a debate too politicized to yield meaningful answers. Meanwhile, doubts concerning the constitutionality of keeping colonies have languished on the margins of mainstream scholarship, overlooked by scholars outside the island and ignored by the nation at large. This book does more than simply fill a glaring omission in the study of race, cultural identity, and the Constitution; it also makes a crucial contribution to the study of American federalism, serves as a foundation for substantive debate on Puerto Rico s status, and meets an urgent need for dialogue on territorial status between the mainlandd and the territories.

Gregory, a lawyer specializing in employment and discrimination law. Unwelcome and Unlawful provides information for those victims as well as for those suffering same-sex harassment and for male victims of sexual harassment. Gregory analyzes sexual harassment from the perspective of existing federal law and describes the legal rights that may be asserted by victims of harassment to obtain either injunctive or monetary relief. Conduct of a sexual nature that occurs in normal workplace socialization is generally not unlawful, but it will be considered to have crossed the line of legality if it is unwelcome and is sufficiently severe or pervasive to undermine an employee's work life. Questions typically arising in a sexual harassment case include: *What types of workplace conduct are classified as sexually harassing? *When is sexual conduct considered unwelcome? *When is sexual conduct perceived as severe or pervasive? *What are the obligations of an employee to report acts of sexual harassment? *If sexual harassment is proven, what monetary damages and other relief may the victim expect to be awarded? *When is an employer liable for acts of sexual harassment committed by its workers and supervisors? *What privacy rights does an employee claiming sexual harassment have? By clarifying little-understood aspects of the law barring sexual harassment, the author presents an indispensable resource for victims seeking to learn what to expect from the legal system if they contest the actions of their harassers in the courts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OJJlDwAAQBAJ&dq=Unwelcome+and+Unlawful:+Sexual+Harassment+in+the+American+Workplace&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Pop/Rock Era: The '60s","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Q6tCzQEACAAJ&dq=The+Pop/Rock+Era:+The+%2760s&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ultimate Nintendo 64 Pocket Power Guide: Prima's Official Strategy Guide","description":"? 1080  Snowboarding ?

In the winter of 1587 the Spanish Armada, the largest force of warships ever assembled, set sail to crush the English navy. This breathtaking overview of one of the most fascinating campaigns in European history begins with the execution of Mary Queen of Scots, the event that precipitated the launching of the Armada. From the first whispers of the threat against England and the English crown, to the return of the battered remnants of the fleet to Spain eighteen months later, it is a story rich in incident and intrigue. In this controversial study, Neil Hanson claims that Francis Drake s intention was not to sink the Armada ships but to disable and plunder them. He further claims that Queen Elizabeth was a monarch who left many of the survivors of the battle to die of disease or starvation and whose parsimony, prevarication and cynicism left her unable to make crucial decisions.

He felt that achieving purity by avoiding meat and refraining from committing harm further promoted the pursuit of a peaceful life. Elements of the worship of Dionysus, such as shape-shifting and ritualistic ecstasy, were fused with Orphic beliefs to produce a powerful and illuminating new religion that found expression in the mystery cults. Practitioners of this new religion composed a great body of poetry, much of which is translated in The Orphic Hymns. The hymns presented in this book were anonymously composed somewhere in Asia Minor, most likely in the middle of the third century AD. At this turbulent time, the Hellenic past was fighting for its survival, while the new Christian faith was spreading everywhere. The Orphic Hymns thus reflect a pious spirituality in the form of traditional literary conventions. The hymns themselves are devoted to specific divinities as well as to cosmic elements. Prefaced with offerings, strings of epithets invoke the various attributes of the divinity and prayers ask for peace and health to the initiate. Apostolos N. Athanassakis and Benjamin M. Wolkow have produced an accurate and elegant translation accompanied by rich commentary.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TTo3r8IHy0wC&dq=The+Orphic+Hymns:+Text,+Translation+and+Notes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Modern American Women: A Documentary History","description":"A collection of primary source documents for the American women's history course, 'Modern American Women: A Documentary History' focuses on events and developments involving women from 1890 to the present.

Odysseus' reliance on his wit and wiliness for survival in his encounters with divine and natural forces during his ten-year voyage home to Ithaca after the Trojan War is at once a timeless human story and an individual test of moral endurance. In the myths and legends retold here, Fagles has captured the energy and poetry of Homer's original in a bold, contemporary idiom, and given us an Odyssey to read aloud, to savor, and to treasure for its sheer lyrical mastery. Renowned classicist Bernard Knox's superb introduction and textual commentary provide insightful background information for the general reader and scholar alike, intensifying the strength of Fagles's translation. This is an Odyssey to delight both the classicist and the general reader, to captivate a new generation of Homer's students.

His trek across the disintegrating South brings him into intimate and sometimes lethal converse with slaves and marauders, bounty hunters and witches, both helpful and malign. At the same time, the intrepid Ada is trying to revive her father s derelict farm and learning to survive in a world where the old certainties have been swept away. As it interweaves their stories, Cold Mountain asserts itself as an authentic odyssey, hugely powerful, majestically lovely, and keenly moving.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=L9ve3Zz__1cC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"El seor de los lobos","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qIPhRwAACAAJ&dq=El+seor+de+los+lobos&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Southern Heritage Cookie Jar Cookbook (Southern Heritage Cookbook Library)","description":"Shares traditional recipes for drop, refrigerator, pressed, and bar cookies, as well as macaroons, shortbreads, jumbles, brownies, and Christmas cookies","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aJJXAAAACAAJ&dq=Southern+Heritage+Cookie+Jar+Cookbook+(Southern+Heritage+Cookbook+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Manage Your Boss: Build a Partnership with Your Boss That Will Make You Both Successful (Communication Series, 60-Minute Training Series)","description":"Get what you need from your boss In this follow-up to the bestselling It's Okay to Be the Boss, Bruce Tulgan argues that as managers demand more and more from their employees, they are also providing them with less guidance than ever before.

Early Islam made a seminal but largely unrecognized contribution to the history of economic thought: it is the only religion founded by an entrepreneur. Descending from an elite dynasty of religious, civil and commercial leaders, Muhammad was a successful businessman before founding Islam. As such, the new religion had much to say on trade, consumer protection, business ethics and property. As Islam rapidly spread across the region so did the economic teachings of early Islam, which eventually made their way to Europe. Early Islam and the Birth of Capitalism demonstrates how Islamic institutions and business practices were adopted and adapted in Venice and Genoa.These financial innovations include the invention of the corporation, business management techniques, commercial arithmetic, and monetary reform. There were other Islamic institutions assimilated in Europe: charities, the waqf, inspired trusts, and institutions of higher learning, the madrasas, were models for the oldest colleges of Oxford and Cambridge. As such it can be rightfully said that these essential aspects of capitalist thought all have Islamic antecedents.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Rgc5rgEACAAJ&dq=Islam+and+Capitalism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Genetically Altered Foods and Your Health: Food at Risk (Basic Earth Guides)","description":"This book examines how genetic engineering is radically changing our food at great risk to human health and the environment.

Interrogating the prominence of confidence in contemporary discourse about body image, workplace, relationships, motherhood, and international development, Orgad and Gill draw on Foucault s notion of technologies of self to demonstrate how  confidence culture  demands of women near-constant introspection and vigilance in the service of self-improvement. They argue that while confidence messaging may feel good, it does not address structural and systemic oppression. Rather, confidence culture suggests that women along with people of color, the disabled, and other marginalized groups are responsible for their own conditions. Rejecting confidence culture s remaking of feminism along individualistic and neoliberal lines, Orgad and Gill explore alternative articulations of feminism that go beyond the confidence imperative.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NpFSEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Patrick O'Brian, A Life Revealed","description":"A revealing and insightful look at one of the modern world s most acclaimed historical novelists Patrick O Brian was well into his seventies when the world fell in love with his greatest creation: the maritime adventures of Royal Navy Captain Jack Aubrey and ship s surgeon Stephen Maturin.

Dennis Dunn analyzes religious politics in the former USSR and in Russia, particularly in areas where relations between the state-backed Orthodox establishment and the Catholic Church have renewed debates about civil rights, religious freedom and Russian national identity under Vladimir Putin's regime. Discussing issues such as the role of Pope John Paul II in helping to bring down the Iron Curtain, Dunn argues provocatively that Catholic-Russian relations are a microcosm of Western-Russian relations and sheds new light on the historical strain between Russia and the West. Showing how Russia's adoption of a secular ideology - a vain attempt to surpass the West - alienated the Russian government not only from the Catholic Church but also from its own Orthodox foundation, this book discusses how Russia sealed its fate while precipitating the Cold War with the West. Students and general readers interested in Russian history, Western-Russian relations, Catholicism, and comparative religion more broadly, will find this an invaluable and accessible account of an important and understudied subject.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fgokDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Forever Jake (Harlequin Temptation, No. 848)","description":"Jordan Adamson is in a jam.

Once a year for half a century, a man and a woman have been meeting at the gazebo in the square of a small town in upstate New York. Martin Rayfiel and Claire Swift long ago married other people, yet they have remained faithful to their vow to love each other always. When Martin, now a handsome, elderly man, walks into the office of the town newspaper and tries to tell his tale to the young editor Abby Reston, she is too busy to listen. But the next day Abby finds herself drawn to the gazebo to watch for the annual arrival of Martin and Claire. She waits and waits, but they don't come. Puzzled and intrigued, Abby finds a briefcase that Martin left behind for her, and in it--in photographs, papers, tape recordings, and mementos--is the entire astonishing story of Martin and Claire, a love affair that spanned the globe and somehow survived for fifty years. The only son of the town's wealthiest family, Martin dreamed of being a world-class chef, while Claire, born of poor parents, hoped to be a sculptor. Despite their disparate backgrounds, and in defiance of small-town morality, they left everything behind and traveled together through Europe, until family allegiances suddenly and unexpectedly called Claire home. Before they parted, they vowed that, no matter what, they would meet at the gazebo once a year. Now it's up to Abby to find out what drove these lovers apart, why they continued to meet over the decades, and where they are now. From the picturesque square in the center of a small town to the hotels, restaurants, museums, and boulevards of Paris, Florence, and London, Martin and Claire's story offers a voyage of discovery that transforms Abby Reston's own life.

An attempt of an aging Senator from the U.S. intertwined with ruined castles of Ireland combined with events post 1066 Norman conquered England, makes Below The Salt a well written, dashing, exciting story. One that builds eventually leading to the large, open field of Runnymede close by the Thames. Judy H. at Amazon wrote: \\"England's King Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine had many children, the most famous of whom were Richard the Lionheart and John \\"Lackland\\". Another son, Geoffrey, died before his parents, but left 2 children: Arthur and Eleanor. And thereby hangs this tale. The historical record relates that after the death of Richard Lionheart, the evil John usurped the throne that should have gone to his older brother Geoffrey's son Arthur, and that to solidfy his claim, he murdered Arthur and swept Eleanor into a convent, where she was never to be seen or heard from again. In this wonderful, imaginative book, the author keeps to most of the historical record, but asserts that after the death of her brother, Arthur, Eleanor was spirited away to safety by William the Marshal. The story starts in the present day, and details the efforts of a descendent of Marshal to find the lineal descendent of Eleanor, who would be the de jure Queen of England. The story weaves back and forth between the present day and 13th century England, and is absolutely riveting. If you like English history, and especially if you like what-if situations, this is a great book.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8_FJAAAAMAAJ&dq=Below+the+Salt&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Proteus Vector","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kAYCPQAACAAJ&dq=The+Proteus+Vector&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Palo Verde: The Wanted Poster","description":"Author Martin Hollingshead's unique voice provides Palo Verde: The Wanted Poster with a fascinating narrative.

Beloved and hated, venerated and reviled, Andrew Jackson was an orphan who fought his way to the pinnacle of power, bending the nation to his will in the cause of democracy. Jackson s election in 1828 ushered in a new and lasting era in which the people, not distant elites, were the guiding force in American politics. Democracy made its stand in the Jackson years, and he gave voice to the hopes and the fears of a restless, changing nation facing challenging times at home and threats abroad. To tell the saga of Jackson s presidency, acclaimed author Jon Meacham goes inside the Jackson White House. Drawing on newly discovered family letters and papers, he details the human dramathe family, the women, and the inner circle of advisers that shaped Jackson s private world through years of storm and victory. One of our most significant yet dimly recalled presidents, Jackson was a battle-hardened warrior, the founder of the Democratic Party, and the architect of the presidency as we know it. His story is one of violence, sex, courage, and tragedy. With his powerful persona, his evident bravery, and his mystical connection to the people, Jackson moved the White House from the periphery of government to the center of national action, articulating a vision of change that challenged entrenched interests to heed the popular will or face his formidable wrath. The greatest of the presidents who have followed Jackson in the White Housefrom Lincoln to Theodore Roosevelt to FDR to Trumanhave found inspiration in his example, and virtue in his vision. Jackson was the most contradictory of men. The architect of the removal of Indians from their native lands, he was warmly sentimental and risked everything to give more power to ordinary citizens. He was, in short, a lot like his country: alternately kind and vicious, brilliant and blind; and a man who fought a lifelong war to keep the republic safeno matter what it took.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ru6O7-Pc_NMC&dq=Jackson+:+Character+in+Time+:+The+US+Presidents&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beowulf: Revised Edition (Manchester Medieval Classics)","description":"\\"Beowulf\\" is to English what the \\"Odyssey\\" and \\"Iliad\\" are to Greek literature the oldest example of vernacular literature of any substance not only in England but in the whole of western Europe.

The New York Times Ray Dalio, one of the world s most successful investors and entrepreneurs, shares the unconventional principles that he s developed, refined, and used over the past forty years to create unique results in both life and business and which any person or organization can adopt to help achieve their goals. In 1975, Ray Dalio founded an investment firm, Bridgewater Associates, out of his two-bedroom apartment in New York City. Forty years later, Bridgewater has made more money for its clients than any other hedge fund in history and grown into the fifth most important private company in the United States, according to Fortune magazine. Dalio himself has been named to Time magazine s list of the 100 most influential people in the world. Along the way, Dalio discovered a set of unique principles that have led to Bridgewater s exceptionally effective culture, which he describes as  an idea meritocracy that strives to achieve meaningful work and meaningful relationships through radical transparency.  It is these principles, and not anything special about Dalio who grew up an ordinary kid in a middle-class Long Island neighborhood that he believes are the reason behind his success. In Principles, Dalio shares what he s learned over the course of his remarkable career. He argues that life, management, economics, and investing can all be systemized into rules and understood like machines. The book s hundreds of practical lessons, which are built around his cornerstones of  radical truth  and  radical transparency,  include Dalio laying out the most effective ways for individuals and organizations to make decisions, approach challenges, and build strong teams. He also describes the innovative tools the firm uses to bring an idea meritocracy to life, such as creating  baseball cards  for all employees that distill their strengths and weaknesses, and employing computerized decision-making systems to make believability-weighted decisions. While the book brims with novel ideas for organizations and institutions, Principles also offers a clear, straightforward approach to decision-making that Dalio believes anyone can apply, no matter what they re seeking to achieve. Here, from a man who has been called both  the Steve Jobs of investing  and  the philosopher king of the financial universe  (CIO magazine), is a rare opportunity to gain proven advice unlike anything you ll find in the conventional business press.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qNNmDwAAQBAJ&dq=Principles&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Culture Concept: Writing and Difference in the Age of Realism","description":"\\"Culture\\" is a term we commonly use to explain the differences in our ways of living. In this book Michael A. Elliott returns to the moment this usage was first articulated, tracing the concept of culture to the writings -- folktales, dialect literature, local color sketches, and ethnographies -- that provided its intellectual underpinnings in turn-of-the-century America. The Culture Concept explains how this now-familiar definition of \\"culture\\" emerged during the late nineteenth century through the intersection of two separate endeavors that shared a commitment to recording group-based difference -- American literary realism and scientific ethnography. Elliott looks at early works of cultural studies as diverse as the conjure tales of Charles Chesnutt, the Ghost-Dance ethnography of James Mooney, and the prose narrative of the Omaha anthropologist-turned-author Francis La Flesche. His reading of these works -- which struggle to find appropriate theoretical and textual tools for articulating a less chauvinistic understanding of human difference -- is at once a recovery of a lost connection between American literary realism and ethnography and a productive inquiry into the usefulness of the culture concept as a critical tool in our time and times to come.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aRbiUN2FGfwC&dq=The+Culture+Concept:+Writing+and+Difference+in+the+Age+of+Realism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Afghanistan: Crosslines Essential Field Guides to Humanitarian and Conflict Zones","description":"Domestic violence is discussed from perspectives of human rights and legislation, with special focus on international law.

It follows the ambitions of Julien Sorel, a young man raised in the French countryside who wishes to rise above his provincial station by climbing the social ranks of Parisian society. Through a series of events, Juliens talent and hard work give way to deception and hypocrisy when he realizes the limitations for advancement of a sincere and honest man of humble origins. Although Julien achieves much which he aspires to, ultimately his pride gets the better of him when he commits a violent crime of passion, leading to his tragic downfall. Through the deep psychological introspection of Julien we see Stendhals unique literary genius, the remarkable way in which he allows readers to live in the minds of his characters. Set against the backdrop of the July Revolution of 1830, The Red and the Black is a narrative which embodies the rich social conflict of that time.

In addressing the four main challenges in culture teaching in Teaching Chinese as a Foreign Language (TCFL), this book focuses on precisely this area of pedagogical practice in Chinese as foreign language education and draws on a wide interdisciplinary base, including foreign language education, cultural studies, and intercultural communication to explore the potential of authentic TV drama as language and culture materials for revitalising TCFL and foreign language teaching more generally. It examines in detail the culturally shaped beliefs, values, and practices that give meaning to the action and language of the selected clips in a modern, award-winning Chinese TV drama. This book shows a potential experiential pathway into (pedagogical) practices to bring contemporary culture into classrooms, to engage learners with contemporary and authentic texts, and to encourage inquiry-focused teaching practices, which  in being intercultural  allow for learners  own interpretations of cultural messages in interaction and to recognise learners as learning to understand their own values and beliefs as they learn to explore those of other cultures.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=G4NlEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sound of One Thigh Clapping: Haiku for a Thinner You","description":"An authority on the world of dieting, Weight Watchers, and the struggle to be thin shares words of wisdom in a collection of brief but hilarious haiku poems that address such topics as food, nutrition, self-awareness, and more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OFNCmTsyJFIC&dq=The+Sound+of+One+Thigh+Clapping:+Haiku+for+a+Thinner+You&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fires","description":"WINNER OF THE PULITZER PRIZE WINNER OF THE NATIONAL BOOK CRITICS CIRCLE AWARD ONE OF THE NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW'S 10 BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR The first comprehensive historical biography of Laura Ingalls Wilder, the beloved author of the Little House on the Prairie books Millions of readers of Little House on the Prairie believe they know Laura Ingalls the pioneer girl who survived blizzards and near-starvation on the Great Plains, and the woman who wrote the famous autobiographical books. But the true saga of her life has never been fully told. Now, drawing on unpublished manuscripts, letters, diaries, and land and financial records, Caroline Fraser the editor of the Library of America edition of the Little House series masterfully fills in the gaps in Wilder s biography. Revealing the grown-up story behind the most influential childhood epic of pioneer life, she also chronicles Wilder's tumultuous relationship with her journalist daughter, Rose Wilder Lane, setting the record straight regarding charges of ghostwriting that have swirled around the books. The Little House books, for all the hardships they describe, are paeans to the pioneer spirit, portraying it as triumphant against all odds. But Wilder s real life was harder and grittier than that, a story of relentless struggle, rootlessness, and poverty. It was only in her sixties, after losing nearly everything in the Great Depression, that she turned to children s books, recasting her hardscrabble childhood as a celebratory vision of homesteading and achieving fame and fortune in the process, in one of the most astonishing rags-to-riches episodes in American letters. Spanning nearly a century of epochal change, from the Indian Wars to the Dust Bowl, Wilder s dramatic life provides a unique perspective on American history and our national mythology of self-reliance. With fresh insights and new discoveries, Prairie Fires reveals the complex woman whose classic stories grip us to this day.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yoq9DgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Solving Problems In Couples And Family Therapy: Techniques And Tactics","description":"First Published in 1992.

Regarding content, we suggest you pick a word to focus on for a month. It should be a word YOU think is worthy of being considered once an hour, as many hours as you can, for a month. The power of really coming to terms with what the word means in your life won't be apparent until the repetitions have been experienced. Just have the word. Notice what comes up for you when the chime beeps. This method is about simplicity; just let a word circulate through your brain once an hour. Yes, you can be more active than that, but, at least initially, just let the thought of the word be enough. You can enter the Olympic chiming events later. Let's take the word \\"present\\" for an example. Everyone can profit by becoming more present, by living more in the now. As has been said many times, many ways, the past is past and the future has yet to get here. All we really have is this moment. Yet we all tend to live anywhere but right here, right now. So many of the goodies in life are only available in the present moment and the more we remain present, the greater the access to our real lives we really have. When we live in the past, we tend to be victims of regret and when we live in the future, we tend to be victims of worry. Neither is very constructive. Being here now allows us to enjoy each breath, to feel the sun on our cheeks, to see the beauty in a tree. So, what if, for one month, each time your watch beeps, you ask yourself to get present? Be here now! Over the course of a month you will be reminded roughly 480 times to \\"be here now.\\" You'll be more attentive. You'll notice the dissolution of what gets in the way of you being more aware, more conscious, more tuned in. Synchronization is the second aspect of working with a digital watch that can add a powerful component to your experience. What you can do on your own with your watch is quite amazing. But what you can do with a watch and other people ... lovers, friends, family, and coworkers ... can be VERY interesting. To capitalize on the possibilities of playing with others, synchronization becomes important. If you and your significant other have agreed that each day at work, each time you chime you will think fond thoughts of each other, it feels kind of special to know that you're doing so at exactly the same moment.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lUzTwAEACAAJ&dq=Chime+for+a+Change:+How+to+Change+Your+Behavior,+Attain+Enlightenment,+Transform+Your+Relationships,+Nurture+Your+Family,+Empower+Your+Fri&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Atlas of Differential Diagnosis in Neoplastic Hematopathology","description":"Management of tumor patients now relies on new individualized approaches to treatment, requiring extensive knowledge of the molecular makeup of tumors.

Their contributions reflect not only widely divergent political orientations and value systems, but also three distinct domains of inquiry into human motivation and behavior -- social scientific, psychodynamic (or psychoanalytical), and clinical practice. Each of these three domains is privy to important evidence and insights that need to transcend epistemological and methodological boundaries if understanding of the subject is to improve dramatically. In keeping with this notion, the editors asked the authors to go beyond a summary of findings, and lend additional distinction to the book by applying the \\"binoculars\\" of their particular perspective and offering suggestions as to the implications of their findings. One of the goals of the conference that resulted in this book was consensus building in the area of media and family. From examining the findings and insights of a diverse group of scholars, it seems that consensus building in several areas is a distinct possibility. Addressing the concerns of educators about the influence of the mass media of communication -- entertainment programs in particular -- on children and the welfare of the nuclear family, this volume projects directions for superior programming, especially for educational television. The influence of sex and violence on children and adults is given much attention, and the development of moral judgment and sexual expectations, among other things, is explored. The critical analysis of media effects includes examination of positive contributions of the media, such as the search for missing children and exemplary educational programs.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0XT_AQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Christmas Angel","description":"\\"I lingered over the pages and the years as this special Christmas Angel was handed down from one generation to the next. This is a story that will linger in your mind and in your heart.\\" --Debbie Macomber, #1 New York Times bestselling author A charming, heart-warming Christmas tale, sure to delight fans of Debbie Macomber and Richard Paul Evans, about the power of family, tradition, and love In 1875, Owen Thomas, a poor Welsh coal miner, falls in love with a beautiful London actress, Jessica Lavery. He builds her a cottage in his village, and enchants her with the promise of the holidays they'll share after they marry. According to his special Thomas family tradition, the Christmas tree must always be outside, where it can look up to God. Owen carves her an angel to go on top of their tree, with lavender eyes like hers, a token more meaningful to her than any engagement ring. When Jessica breaks off their romance, Owen, broken-hearted, wraps the angel in his mother's shawl and brings her to America. There, she looks down over five generations, witnessing peace and war, triumphs and tragedies, reminding all who see her that Christmas is the time when families and sweethearts can come together, laughter and goodwill can lighten even the heaviest burden, and magic fills the earth. Jane Maas' book is a story of faith and love. And of the miracle that brought the angel home again.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XdUeAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The aWAKE Project, Second Edition: Uniting Against the African AIDS Crisis","description":"\\"Today, this very day, 5,500 Africans will die of AIDS.

Forstchen, continues the story of a Confederate victory at Gettysburg. The first book examined the great \\"what if\\" of American history: Could Lee have won the Battle of Gettysburg? A Confederate victory, however, would not necessarily mean that the Southern cause has gained its final triumph and a lasting peace. It is from this departure point that the story continues in Grant Comes East, as General Robert E. Lee marches on Washington, DC, and launches an assault against one of the largest fortifications in the world. Across 140 years, nearly all historians have agreed that after the defeat of the Army of the Potomac at Gettysburg, the taking of Washington, DC, would end the war. But was it possible? Lee knows that a frontal assault against such fortifications could devastate his army, but it is a price he fears must be paid for final victory. Beyond a military victory in the field, Lee must also overcome the defiant stand of President Abraham Lincoln, who vows that regardless of the defeat at Gettysburg, his solemn pledge to preserve the Union will be honored. Lincoln will mobilize the garrison of Washington to hold on no matter what the costs. At the same time, Lincoln has appointed General Ulysses S. Grant as commander of all Union forces. Grant, fresh from his triumph at Vicksburg, races east, bringing with him his hardened veterans from Mississippi to confront Lee. What ensues across the next six weeks is a titanic struggle as the surviving Union forces inside the fortifications of Washington fight to hang on, while Grant prepares his counterblow. The defeated Army of the Potomac, staggered by the debacle dealt at Gettysburg, is not yet completely out of the fight, and is slowly reorganizing. Its rogue commander, General Dan Sickles, is thirsting for revenge against Lee, the restoration of the honor of his army, and the fulfillment of his own ambitions, which reach all the way to the White House. All these factors will come together in a climatic struggle spanning the ground from Washington, through Baltimore, to the banks of the Susquehanna River. Once again, Newt Gingrich and William R. Forstchen create a brilliant story of how the Civil War could have unfolded. In Grant Comes East, they use their years of research and expertise to take readers on an incredible journey.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=czGYOJlBkXcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Apache Legends: Songs of the Wind Dancer","description":"-- Songs of the Wind Dancer is by Lou Cuevas, who was taught the legends of his ancestors by his full-blooded Apache grandfather.

It was through the efforts of the Peacemaker that the warring tribes of the Northeast joined together to form the Iroquois Confederacy over 500 years ago. The Peacemaker's work is preserved in the legend and history retold here and in the Confederacy's traditional constitution, which now influences many Native American governing systems throughout the United States. It also has had a major -- and rarely acknowledged -- impact in shaping the American Bill of Rights and the U. S. Constitution. The Iroquois Confederacy itself remains united under Deganawidah's unbroken spiritual lineage -- today represented by Chief Sidney I Hill, the Tadodaho, who is the temporal and spiritual leader of the Six Nations. Chief Hill has provided a message for this edition. The late Chief Leon Shenandoah, former Tadodaho, wrote the foreword. In an epilogue, historian John Mohawk takes up the story where Paul Wallace left off, chronicling the Confederacy's struggles to preserve its lands and sovereign dignity since the eighteenth century. The teachings of the Peacemaker remain vital today, offering an inspired model for consensus-building among nations and peoples throughout the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SY6WPwAACAAJ&dq=White+Roots+of+Peace:+The+Iroquois+Book+of+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Contemporary Finnish Poetry","description":"'Finnish poetry is a popular poetry. It does not solve problems, or try to, but people turn to it for solace, inspiration, stimulation to think about themselves, extensions of experience, and the shaping spirit. This poetry has fed a clearly felt hunger: the need for companionable reports on what it is like to be a Finn in this phase of the muddle for survival. But like all authentic local reports, its appeal is universal. It is very spare. Our own poetry can look baroque to the Finns, not leaving enough silence between the words. The younger poets are already moving in new directions. Inheriting a flexible common idiom, forged by the previous generation, they have been liberated.' - Herbert Lomas.Herbert Lomas's anthology traces the history of post-war Finnish poetry, showing the rise and repercussions of Finland's own revolution in poetry. In a wide-ranging introduction, he describes the poetry of all 21 writers featured in the book, and presents a detailed analysis of the two major poets with international reputations, Paavo Haavikko and Pentti Saarikoski, the most famous of the brilliant generation of 21 year-olds who led the rejuvenation of Finnish poetry in the 1950s. The selections from the towering and controversial figures of Haavikko and Saarikoski cover their whole careers. But the other poets too - ranging from Eeva-Liisa Manner (born 1921) to Satu Salminiitty (born 1959) - are comprehensively presented. Among the book's surprises are the animal parables of Kirsi Kunnas, Finland's Stevie Smith, and the satires of Jarkko Laine, whose work is fuelled by a hatred of conventional poetry and religion.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZGiAAAAAIAAJ&dq=Contemporary+Finnish+Poetry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Honors Disguise (Rocky Mountain Legacy #4)","description":"HONOR'S QUEST: Still adjusting to her ladylike life as Montgomery Farrel's wife, Abigail discovers she is pregnant and the world seems more exciting than ever.

For people of Indian, African, and European descent living in the newly formed United States, the most personal and emotional choices--to honor a friendship or pursue an intimate relationship--were often necessarily guided by the harsh economic realities imposed by the country's racial hierarchy. Few families in American history embody this struggle to survive the pervasive onslaught of racism more than the Graysons. Like many other residents of the eighteenth-century Native American South, where Black-Indian relations bore little social stigma, Katy Grayson and her brother William--both Creek Indians--had children with partners of African descent. As the plantation economy began to spread across their native land soon after the birth of the American republic, however, Katy abandoned her black partner and children to marry a Scottish-Creek man. She herself became a slaveholder, embracing slavery as a public display of her elevated place in America's racial hierarchy. William, by contrast, refused to leave his black wife and their several children and even legally emancipated them. Traveling separate paths, the Graysons survived the invasion of the Creek Nation by U.S. troops in 1813 and again in 1836 and endured the Trail of Tears, only to confront each other on the battlefield during the Civil War. Afterwards, they refused to recognize each other's existence. In 1907, when Creek Indians became U.S. citizens, Oklahoma gave force of law to the family schism by defining some Graysons as white, others as black. Tracking a full five generations of the Grayson family and basing his account in part on unprecedented access to the forty-four volume diary of G. W. Grayson, the one-time principal chief of the Creek Nation, Claudio Saunt tells not only of America's past, but of its present, shedding light on one of the most contentious issues in Indian politics, the role of \\"blood\\" in the construction of identity. Overwhelmed by the racial hierarchy in the United States and compelled to adopt the very ideology that oppressed them, the Graysons denied their kin, enslaved their relatives, married their masters, and went to war against each other. Claudio Saunt gives us not only a remarkable saga in its own right but one that illustrates the centrality of race in the American experience.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0lcOPTEXNzkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Midnight: Epic Fantasy in an Age of Shadow [d20 system]","description":"Midnight describes an exciting, highly detailed campaign setting for the d20 System.

The book begins in 1943, with Allied forces cementing their grip on the devastated city of Naples. The sometime Fascist and ever-resourceful Curzio Malaparte is working with the Americans as a liaison officer. He looks after Colonel Jack Hamilton,  a Christian gentleman . . . an American in the noblest sense of the word,  who speaks French and cites the classics and holds his nose as the two men tour the squalid streets of a city in ruins where liberation is only another word for desperation. Veterans of the disbanded Italian army beg for work. A rare specimen from the city s famous aquarium is served up at a ceremonial dinner for high Allied officers. Prostitution is rampant. The smell of death is everywhere. Subtle, cynical, evasive, manipulative, unnerving, always astonishing, Malaparte is a supreme artist of the unreliable, both the product and the prophet of a world gone rotten to the core.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uecxAQAAQBAJ&dq=The+skin&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Speculative Remark: (One of Hegel's Bons Mots) (Cultural Memory in the Present)","description":"This work, by one of the most innovative and challenging of contemporary thinkers, pivots on a Remark added by Hegel in 1831 to the second edition of his Science of Logic. As a model of close reading applied both to philosophical texts and the making of philosophical systems, The Speculative Remark played a significant role in transforming the practice of philosophy away from system building to analysis of specific linguistic detail, with meticulous attention to etymological, philological, and rhetorical nuance. Nancy uses his extended examination of the Remark to delineate certain overall strategies in several Hegelian texts that militate for language-oriented readings of Hegel, as shown in Nancy's redefinition of such key terms as Aufhebung, mediation, and speculation. Nancy's reading progresses from speculative words and propositions to registering the speculative itself. While he avoids analyzing Hegel's system as such, Nancy reconstructs the Hegelian trajectory on a basis of tropes, building from propositions rather than structures, elements, and cycles. The overview that emerges in the final chapter and epilogue constitutes a broad statement about Hegel's practice and significance, one nuanced by close attention to his deployment of rhetoric and linguistic play. The Speculative Remark thus furnishes a model for a theoretically aware approach to all systematic philosophy, while providing a significant historical contribution to the evolution of contemporary critical theory.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5PP0zgEACAAJ&dq=The+Speculative+Remark:+(One+of+Hegel%27s+Bons+Mots)+(Cultural+Memory+in+the+Present)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"America's Ancient Forests: From the Ice Age to the Age of Discovery","description":"At the time of European discovery, the ancient North Americanforests stretched across nearly half the continent.

How hearing works and how the brain processes sounds entering the ear to provide the listener with useful information are of great interest to psychologists, cognitive scientists, and musicians. However, while a number of books have concentrated on individual aspects of this field, known as psychoacoustics, there has been no comprehensive introductory coverage of the multiple topics encompassed under the term. Music, Cognition, and Computerized Sound is the first book to provide that coverage, and it does so via a unique and useful approach. The book begins with introductory chapters on the basic physiology and functions of the ear and auditory sections of the brain, then proceeds to discuss numerous topics associated with the study of psychoacoustics, including cognitive psychology and the physics of sound. The book has a particular emphasis on music and computerized sound. An accompanying download includes many sound examples to help explicate the text and is available with the code included in the book at http://mitpress.mit.edu/mccs.

The author focuses in particular on the wide-ranging effects of early stress on a baby or toddler s developing nervous system. When things go wrong with relationships in early life, the dependent child has to adapt; what we now know is that his or her brain adapts too. The brain s emotion and immune systems are particularly affected by early stress and can become less effective. This makes the child more vulnerable to a range of later difficulties such as depression, anti-social behaviour, addictions or anorexia, as well as physical illness.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uDCDBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Texas Haunted Forts","description":"The forts of Texas, once teeming with soldiers, settlers and Native Americans, today stand like silent sentinels, abandoned to the ravages of sun, wind, and time.

Dransfield, Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew Originally published in 1974, George Stevenson's Palms of South Florida combines explanations for beginners learning to recognize palms with meticulous descriptions and drawings of palms now grown in South Florida, and information on palm botany, geography, zones, care, cold and salt tolerance, and other features, in a simple, highly accessible format that has made it a favorite for many years. Beginners in palm study are often dismayed at the discovery that botanists do not separate the palms into categories by single characteristics but rather by long lists of criteria and that these factors are described in a jargon that that frightens off the casually interested. This is a book for those who are interested in palms but who have not mastered the highly technical method or vocabulary of the botanists. Stevenson's approach emphasizes apparent similarities that may be of more significance to the amateur than minute floral differences by which botanists determine relationships between species. And his hand drawn illustrations highlight specific features of the overall plant or of particular components that serve to identify it from its relatives.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NBdUHAAACAAJ&dq=Palms+of+South+Florida&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Building Embedded Linux Systems","description":"Linux? is being adopted by an increasing number of embedded systems developers, who have been won over by its sophisticated scheduling and networking, its cost-free license, its open development model, and the support offered by rich and powerful programming tools. While there is a great deal of hype surrounding the use of Linux in embedded systems, there is not a lot of practical information. Building Embedded Linux Systems is the first in-depth, hard-core guide to putting together an embedded system based on the Linux kernel. This indispensable book features arcane and previously undocumented procedures for: Building your own GNU development toolchain Using an efficient embedded development framework Selecting, configuring, building, and installing a target-specific kernel Creating a complete target root filesystem Setting up, manipulating, and using solid-state storage devices Installing and configuring a bootloader for the target Cross-compiling a slew of utilities and packages Debugging your embedded system using a plethora of tools and techniques Details are provided for various target architectures and hardware configurations, including a thorough review of Linux's support for embedded hardware.

He is the embodiment of charity and generosity, a creation of mythology, a tool of clever capitalists. The very idea of him is enduring and powerful. Santa Claus was born in early-nineteenth-century America, but his family tree goes back seven hundred years to Saint Nicholas, patron saint of children. Intervening generations were shaggy and strange   whip-wielding menaces to naughty boys and girls. Yet as the raucous, outdoor, alcohol-fuelled holiday gave way to a more domestic, sentimental model, a new kind of gift-bringer was called for   a loveable elf, still judgmental but far less threatening. In this engaging social and cultural history, Gerry Bowler examines the place of Santa Claus in history, literature, advertising, and art. He traces his metamorphosis from a beardless youth into a red-suited peddler. He reveals the lesser-known aspects of the gift-bringer s life   Santa s involvement with social and political causes of all stripes (he enlisted on the Union side in the American Civil War), his starring role in the movies and as adman for gun-makers and insurance companies. And he demolishes the myths surrounding Santa Claus and Coca-Cola. Santa Claus: A Biography will stand as the classic work on the long-lived and multifarious Mr. Claus.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=E4CML6akeYMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tough Customers : True Adventures of Game Wardens and the Outlaws They Pursue","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WtURPQAACAAJ&dq=Tough+Customers+:+True+Adventures+of+Game+Wardens+and+the+Outlaws+They+Pursue&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Strangewood Tales","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iu1ZAAAAMAAJ&dq=Strangewood+Tales&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Great Lakes, Great Quilts: From the Michigan State University Museum","description":"Includes how-to information.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=em_hAAAAMAAJ&dq=Great+Lakes,+Great+Quilts:+From+the+Michigan+State+University+Museum&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Clock Strikes 13","description":"Mildred A.

History at its best  (Publishers Weekly). Their names are forever linked in the history of the Civil War, but Robert E. Lee and Ulysses S. Grant could not have been more dissimilar. Lee came from a world of Southern gentility and aristocratic privilege while Grant had coarser, more common roots in the Midwest. As a young officer trained in the classic mold, Lee graduated from West Point at the top of his class and served with distinction in the MexicanAmerican War. Grant s early military career was undistinguished and marred by rumors of drunkenness. As commander of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, Lee s early victories demoralized the Union Army and cemented his reputation as a brilliant tactician. Meanwhile, Grant struggled mightily to reach the top of the Union command chain. His iron will eventually helped turn the tide of the war, however, and in April 1864, President Abraham Lincoln gave Grant command of all Union forces. A year later, he accepted Lee s surrender at the Appomattox Court House. With brilliance and deep feeling, New York Timesbestselling author Gene Smith brings the Civil War era to vivid life and tells the dramatic story of two remarkable men as they rise to glory and reckon with the bitter aftermath of the bloodiest conflict in American history. Never before have students of American history been treated to a more personal, comprehensive, and achingly human portrait of Lee and Grant.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xbm_DAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spanish Husband (Presents Passion) (Harlequin Presents)","description":"To love, honor and betray?

Over the next ten years, we had the very real opportunity to stop it. Obviously, we failed.Nathaniel Rich's groundbreaking account of that failure - and how tantalizingly close we came to signing binding treaties that would have saved us all before the fossil fuels industry and politicians committed to anti-scientific denialism - is already a journalistic blockbuster, a full issue of the New York Times Magazine that has earned favorable comparisons to Rachel Carson's Silent Spring and John Hersey's Hiroshima. Rich has become an instant, in-demand expert and speaker. A major movie deal is already in place. It is the story, perhaps, that can shift the conversation.In the book Losing Earth, Rich is able to provide more of the context for what did - and didn't - happen in the 1980s and, more important, is able to carry the story fully into the present day and wrestle with what those past failures mean for us in 2019.

And faced with drought and AIDS, he unscrupulously exploits these calamities to enrich himself, becoming a filthy rich mogul through gold panning and selling rubies and sapphires clandestinely. Ndoda s autocratic rule is, however, fiercely opposed by David Kaseke, a local high school teacher and Rufaro, a law student. To silence them, Ndoda orders his lackey, Mandebvu, to deal with Rufaro who is stabbed twice near the heart but survives the assassination. Years later Rufaro, now a qualified attorney, is found dead in a police cell. Similarly, David is brutally tortured by the partisan police. As the sun sets on his life, Ndoda is found dead on his expensive mahogany bed, having been haunted by the ghost of a spirit medium he had previously ordered to be killed.

This feeling stayed with her well into her twenties when she was told that  girls can t do science  or  women just don t know how to handle machines.  Yet in the span of just six years, Cecilia became the first Latina pilot to secure a place on the United States Unlimited Aerobatic Team and earn the right to represent her country at the Olympics of aviation, the World Aerobatic Championships. How did she do it? Using mathematical techniques to overcome her fear, Cecilia performed at air shows in front of millions of people. She jumped out of airplanes and taught others how to fly. She learned how to fund-raise and earn money to compete at the world level. She worked as a test pilot and contributed to the design of experimental airplanes, crafting curves of metal and fabric that shaped air to lift inanimate objects high above the earth. And best of all, she surprised everyone by overcoming the prejudices people held about her because of her race and her gender. Flying Free is the story of how Cecilia Aragon broke free from expectations and rose above her own limits by combining her passion for flying with math and logic in unexpected ways.

Its centrepiece was the most expensive diamond necklace ever assembled, and the tangle of fraud, folly, blindness and self-delusion it provoked. The humiliation the affair brought on the royal family contributed to their appalling deaths in the Revolution just four years later. In this unusual, witty and often surprising version of the story, the great Hungarian novelist Antal Szerb takes the narrative as a standpoint from which to survey the entire age including aspects of it seldom considered by more orthodox historians. The author s vast knowledge is worn very lightly and the book teems with amusing anecdotes, but it is, at heart, a deeply personal work, a remarkable gesture of defiance against the brutal world in which it was written.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=b4MiEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Queen%27s+Necklace&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Southern heritage cookbook library index","description":"Gathers traditional Southern recipes for breads, pancakes, brioches, sweet rolls, biscuits, coffeecakes, doughnuts, fritters, tortillas, and crackers","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_BFHAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+Southern+heritage+cookbook+library+index&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shoo fly!","description":"Adapted from the popular nursery rhyme, this book follows an adorable mouse as he tries in vain to escape from a delightfully determined fly","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Uvn31XXhiWMC&dq=Shoo+fly!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Little Snowgirl","description":"Caterina and Pavel's wish for a child is fulfilled when the snowgirl Pavel makes in the yard comes alive.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=y1fsAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Little+Snowgirl&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Tales of Ketzia Gold","description":"The Complete Tales of Ketzia Gold is a lavishly poetic novel that recounts through folklore and fairy stories the visionary obsessions of a passionate young woman. The narrative moves freely through time and space, uniting Ketzia Gold's early childhood with her sexual awakenings, creating a dreamscape of haunting vividness. Young Ketzia inhabits a storybook world of hallucinatory comedy and terror, surrounded by predatory adults, talking magnolias, and troll-like siblings. Her childhood romance with talented, brilliant Adam Brown flowers briefly into a marriage of tenderness and erotic fervor, but Ketzia cannot escape her own intelligence, and soon finds herself compelled toward intoxicating self-destruction. Bernheimer draws upon the motifs of traditional German, Russian and Yiddish folklore to shape Ketzia's bewildering adventures. This meeting of nursery rhyme and nightmare transforms everyday objects as childhood photos, wine bottles and metal trinkets take on a life of their own, eluding Ketzia's frightened grasp. Marked by a logical illogic and disarmingly sane madness, this haunting and innovative fable creates an emotional landscape that's as impossible to escape as it is for young Ketzia to inhabit. With an obsessive lyricism recalling the poetic fictions of Carol Maso, Kate Bernheimer interweaves hypnotic imagery and everyday life, moving back and forth through time, piecing together the fragments of memory and imagination. The Complete Tales of Ketzia Gold embroiders a visionary realism in the manner of Doris Lessing and Clarice Lispector, making Bernheimer's story a rich tapestry, patterned after childhood longings and the luxuriant complexity of womanhood.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vQrqAwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Complete+Tales+of+Ketzia+Gold&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Final Target","description":"The President s daughter...

The Kafka Effekt is a postmodern scream.

It doesn t happen very often. But Ageing with Smartphones in Ireland documents a radical change in the experience of ageing. Based on two ethnographies, one within Dublin and the other from the Dublin region, the book shows that people, rather than seeing themselves as old, focus on crafting a new life in retirement. Our research participants apply new ideals of sustainability both to themselves and to their environment. They go for long walks, play bridge, do yoga and keep as healthy as possible. As part of Ireland s mainstream middle class, they may have more time than the young to embrace green ideals and more money to move to energy-efficient homes, throw out household detritus and protect their environment. The smartphone has become integral to this new trajectory. For some it is an intimidating burden linked to being on the wrong side of a new digital divide. But for most, however, it has brought back the extended family and old friends, and helped resolve intergenerational conflicts though facilitating new forms of grandparenting. It has also become central to health issues, whether by Googling information or looking after frail parents. The smartphone enables this sense of getting younger as people download the music of their youth and develop new interests. This is a book about acknowledging late middle age in contemporary Ireland. How do older people in Ireland experience life today?

It presents the old masters' techniques by means of a thorough study of the historical and written evidence of the tools and materials used. The author also includes a series of workshop procedures he has developed with which the contemporary artist may produce the equivalents of the techniques of earlier draughtsmen. This book comprises a body of knowledge that is essential to students of art history, curators, collectors and artists, and is a significant addition to the literature on drawing. In addition to his scholarly investigation of earlier practices, the author identifies materials and processes used by such important artists as Rembrandt, Van Gogh, Romney, Picasso, Michelangelo, Watteau, Holbein, Tiepolo, and Delacroix. For the artist interested in reproducing the effects achieved by these and many other acknowledged masters, there are full discussions and specific directions concerning the making of inks, styluses, reed and quill pens, fabricated chalks, and instructions for preparing grounds for metalpoint drawings. At every step, the discussion is supplemented with illustrations from laboratory experiments and from drawings by both old and contemporary artists. Of the more than sixty illustrations included, thirty-six are reproductions of master works, and among the others there are microphotographic enlargements of detail showing the differences in density and texture produced by various tools on different papers or grounds. Thus, as a collection of master drawings, the book is worthy of the art lover's library; as a technical study, it is an indispensable aid to the art student and practicing artist.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FmCpAQAACAAJ&dq=The+Craft+of+Old-Master+Drawings&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"DER PARADOX EINE","description":"These essays propose a new dating of, and historical setting for the letters of \\"Ignatius of Antioch.\\" In so doing this volume forms an important contribution to the study of Monarchianism and early church history as well. An examination of the fragments of Noetus of Smyrna, the founder of Monarchianism, leads to the discovery of the oldest \\"Regula fidei,\\" and of its origin as part of anti-gnostic polemics. On the ground of late second-century parallels, especially Melito and Irenaeus, this \\"Regula\\" can be dated between 160 and 180 CE. It is within this context that the so-called Letters of Ignatius fit seamlessly. As a result of these findings this volume argues for a significant revision of our understanding of early church history. Monarchianism (\\"Sabellianism,\\" \\"Patripassianism\\"), later considered heretical, is shown to have been the almost universally accepted belief within the Church up to the period of the Roman bishops Zephyrinus and Callistus.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=j-p5DwAAQBAJ&dq=DER+PARADOX+EINE&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lives of the twelve Caesars","description":"This text by Suetonius, a Latin biographer, is a major source for the period from Julius Caesar to Domitian.

I am satisifed that I have completed the story of the first family. The last trips to Germany, Maryland and Pennsylvania have tied up lose ends. We have found the birth place of Anna Martha in Germany as well as the name of the wife of George Jr.and the mother of George(A11), born 29 May 1745. Her first name, Margaretha, is the same as a 19 year old girl listed on the ship when the family arrived in Philadelphia. She is therefore the likely mother of John(B), the founder of the Poffenberger clan of Washington Co., MD who was born shortly after their arrival. My vist to Host Church at Tulpehockebn resulted in being showin what was said to be the large Pfaffenberger farm and seemingly the original plantation since records show it was near Host Church. The last three members of the family to live there, Ralph b. 1884, Samuel born 1884, Carrie born 1882, all died the same year in 1963. The old farm house, long deserted, is covered with vines. They would be descendants of Michael (A7), the last child of Anna Martha and Johann George Pfaffenberger. I have added several pages of documentation, births and marriages from various church records which may be helpful to some in their search. Comment regarding the 2nd Edition \\"I have been tracing this family for about 5 years now. Thomas Poffenbarger filled in some of the gaps and answered the many questions that come up after you find that next clue. I read it cover to cover in two days. I went to Germany 15 years ago and had a wonderful visit with the friendly locals, this makes me want to go back soon.\\" D. Sinclair (Indianapolis, Indiana United States) \\"Dr.Poffenberger has answered all the questions about my father s ancestors that I never would have been able to discover myself. I recommend that anyone who has read this exceptional book goes to Mistelgau,Germany which is in a beautiful rural part of Bavaria.In this little village is the 14th century church preserved with it s original carvings and painted icons where the Poffenberger family worshipped.It just gave me goosebumps to think that my ancestors stood where I was standing.\\" Bunny (Encinitas, CA USA) \\"I enjoyed this book very much. Mr. Poffenberger did alot of reseach and I really enjoyed learning about where they came from in Germany. There was even some pictures! We had been searching,hoping to find a clue linking our family to the Pennsylvannia group and with his help we have done that. The book also gives you history in Germany and in Pennsylvannia. The Poffenbergers were certainly in the middle of all the early wars and managed to survive.\\" Wanda Gaul (Geneva, New York) \\"Thanks to Thomas Poffenberger s book, From Germany to Antietam, I can now confirm where my mother s gggrandfather Daniel Poffenberger was born. After 20 some years of researching, I now know Daniel was born in Berks County, Pennsylvania, who his parents were and when and where he was baptized. The history all through the book is an asset to any reader with an interest in the history of Berks county as well as Germany.

In asking how Indigenous and diasporic interventions have remapped these debates, the contributors argue that a new  cultural grammar  is at work and attempt to sketch out some of the ways it operates. The essays reference pivotal moments in Canadian literary and cultural history and speak to ongoing debates about Canadian nationalism, postcolonalism, migrancy, and transnationalism. Topics covered include the Asian race riots in Vancouver in 1907, the cultural memory of internment and dispersal of Japanese Canadians in the 1940s, the politics of migrant labour and the  domestic labour scheme  in the 1960s, and the trial of Robert Pickton in Vancouver in 2007. The contributors are particularly interested in how diaspora and indigeneity continue to contribute to this critical reconfiguration and in how conversations about diaspora and indigeneity in the Canadian context have themselves been transformed. Cultural Grammars is an attempt to address both the interconnections and the schisms between these multiply fractured critical terms as well as the larger conceptual shifts that have occurred in response to national and postnational arguments.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sBDaAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Frisket Takes Command","description":"An adventure story based on the computer-animated television series, ReBoot, follows Enzo's dog, Frisket, as he is kidnapped by the evil computer virus, Megabyte","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tqIddFalprYC&dq=Frisket+Takes+Command&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Christian View Of Science And Scripture","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ftL1zgEACAAJ&dq=The+Christian+View+Of+Science+And+Scripture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fantasies of Witnessing: Postwar Efforts to Experience the Holocaust","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Snuggle Puppy!","description":"A great big hug in book form, Snuggle Puppy is a year-round valentine from parent to child.

While it is widely accepted by scholars that substantial changes in technology occurred in Mexico during the last century, very little has been written on these issues, perhaps because of a propensity to associate Mexico with tradition and folklore rather than technology, progress, and modernity. This diverse collection of chapters--written by historians, literary scholars, social scientists, and cultural critics--tells this long-neglected story of technological change. Contributors examine themes ranging from the introduction of new forms of travel (automobiles, buses, trains, and subways) to innovations in media (radio, film, and the Internet) to the relationships between technology, literature, art, and architecture. Covering the twentieth century and beyond, Technology and Culture in Twentieth-Century Mexico, edited by Araceli Tinajero and J. Brian Freeman, illustrates the invention, use, and adaptation of technology, as well as the diverse ways that technology itself is both shaped by and shapes culture. This interdisciplinary book points to new directions in the study of Mexico and makes an important contribution to Latin American Studies and the history of technology.

Admiral Wilhelm Canaris was appointed by Adolf Hitler to head the Abwehr (the German secret service) eighteen months after the Nazis came to power. But Canaris turned against the Fu hrer and the Nazi regime, believing that Hitler would start a war Germany could not win. In 1938 he was involved in an attempted coup, undermined by British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. In 1940 he sabotaged the German plan to invade England, and fed General Franco vital information that helped him keep Spain out of the war. For years he played a dangerous double game, desperately trying to keep one step ahead of the Gestapo. The SS chief, Heinrich Himmler, became suspicious of Canaris and by 1944, when Abwehr personnel were involved in the attempted assassination of Hitler, he had the evidence to arrest Canaris himself. Canaris was executed a few weeks before the end of the war. In a riveting true story of intrigue and espionage, Richard Bassett reveals how Admiral Canaris s secret work against the German leadership changed the course of World War II.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IwXzYNoZ9FUC&dq=HITLER%27S+SPY+CHIEF:+The+Wilhelm+Canaris+Mystery&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dressing (Board Books)","description":"Babies wear all sorts of clothes - nappies, T-shirts, socks, trousers and hats.

At the farthest point of the shade my mother sat beside her fire, toasting a savory piece of dried meat. Near her, I sat upon my feet, eating my dried meat with unleavened bread, and drinking strong black coffee. The morning meal was our quiet hour, when we two were entirely alone. At noon, several who chanced to be passing by stopped to rest, and to share our luncheon with us, for they were sure of our hospitality. My uncle, whose death my mother ever lamented, was one of our nation's bravest warriors. His name was on the lips of old men when talking of the proud feats of valor; and it was mentioned by younger men, too, in connection with deeds of gallantry. Old women praised him for his kindness toward them; young women held him up as an ideal to their sweethearts. Every one loved him, and my mother worshiped his memory. Thus it happened that even strangers were sure of welcome in our lodge, if they but asked a favor in my uncle's name. Though I heard many strange experiences related by these wayfarers, I loved best the evening meal, for that was the time old legends were told. I was always glad when the sun hung low in the west, for then my mother sent me to invite the neighboring old men and women to eat supper with us. Running all the way to the wigwams, I halted shyly at the entrances. Sometimes I stood long moments without saying a word. It was not any fear that made me so dumb when out upon such a happy errand; nor was it that I wished to withhold the invitation, for it was all I could do to observe this very proper silence. But it was a sensing of the atmosphere, to assure myself that I should not hinder other plans. My mother used to say to me, as I was almost bounding away for the old people: \\"Wait a moment before you invite any one. If other plans are being discussed, do not interfere, but go elsewhere.\\" The old folks knew the meaning of my pauses; and often they coaxed my confidence by asking, \\"What do you seek, little granddaughter?\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7QYpYF_OUVwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crosswords to Keep You Sharp","description":"Bet you can t solve just one!

What can machines do? How do humans delegate actions to machines? In this book, Harry Collins and Martin Kusch combine insights from sociology and philosophy to provide a novel answer to these increasingly important questions.The authors begin by distinguishing between two basic types of intentional behavior, which they call polimorphic actions and mimeomorphic actions. Polimorphic actions (such as writing a love letter) are ones that community members expect to vary with social context. Mimeomorphic actions (such a swinging a golf club) do not vary. Although machines cannot act, they can mimic mimeomorphic actions. Mimeomorphic actions are thus the crucial link between what humans can do and what machines can do. Following a presentation of their detailed categorization of actions, the authors apply their approach to a broad range of human-machine interactions and to learning. Key examples include bicycle riding and the many varieties of writing machines. They also show how their theory can be used to explain the operation of organizations such as restaurants and armies. Finally, they look at a historical case the technological development of the air pump applying their categorization of actions to the processes of mechanization and automation. Automation, they argue, can occur only where what we want to bring about can be brought about through mimeomorphic action.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HQJPAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Antologia Esencial - 373 - (Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=B8ZFAAAAMAAJ&dq=Antologia+Esencial+-+373+-+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Washington Manual of Medical Therapeutics (Spiral Manual Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CxQ5ugEACAAJ&dq=The+Washington+Manual+of+Medical+Therapeutics+(Spiral+Manual+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Extinct Languages","description":"The concern for the fast-disappearing language stocks of the world has arisen particularly in the past decade, as a result of the impact of globalization. This book appears as an answer to a felt need: to catalogue and describe those languages, making up the vast majority of the world's six thousand or more distinct tongues, which are in danger of disappearing within the next few decades. Endangerment is a complex issue, and the reasons why so many of the world's smaller, less empowered languages are not being passed on to future generations today are discussed in the book's introduction. The introduction is followed by regional sections, each authored by a notable specialist, combining to provide a comprehensive listing of every language which, by the criteria of endangerment set out in the introduction, is likely to disappear within the next few decades. These languages make up ninety per cent of the world's remaining language stocks. Each regional section comprises an introduction that deals with problems of language preservation peculiar to the area, surveys of known extinct languages, and problems of classification. The introduction is followed by a list of all known languages within the region, endangered or not, arranged by genetic affiliation, with endangered and extinct languages marked. This listing is followed by entries in alphabetical order covering each language listed as endangered. Useful maps are provided to pinpoint the more complex clusters of smaller languages in every region of the world. The Encyclopedia therefore provides in a single resource: expert analysis of the current language policy situation in every multilingual country and on every continent, detailed descriptions of little-known languages from all over the world, and clear alphabetical entries, region by region, of all the world's languages currently thought to be in danger of extinction. The Encyclopedia of the World s Endangered Languages will be a necessary addition to all academic linguistics collections and will be a useful resource for a range of readers with an interest in development studies, cultural heritage and international affairs.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=p-7ON7Rvx_AC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"SVG Essentials (O'Reilly XML)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Tristia","description":"\\"This is no small achievement.

They reveal much about the central beliefs and guiding principles of Winnebago, Ojibwa, Menominee, and other peoples and provide a window into their outlook and aspirations. As Katharine Judson wrote in her original preface, they express the longing to understand the why and how of life. Many of these tales concern Manabush, a culture hero for several peoples and later the inspiration for Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's Hiawatha. Readers also encounter the elemental forces of Thunder, Rain, and Wind; the wise and foolish actions of Fox, Eagle, and Hare; and legends describing the creation of Earth, Sky, and Mountain. Told in a simple, unencumbered style, these stories and myths grow in depth and complexity upon each reading and provide rich material for understanding the peoples of a region whose cultures have received relatively little attention. An introduction by Peter Iverson highlights the divergent ways American Indian identity has been constructed through such legends. All ages can appreciate the strength, power, and beauty of these timeless legends and tales.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PYZ0QgAACAAJ&dq=Native+American+Legends+of+the+Great+Lakes+and+the+Mississippi+Valley&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Greeks and Romans in the Modern World","description":"This book discusses the debt we, in the modern world, owe to the ancient Greeks and Romans.

In his introduction, Kevin Gough-Yates writes: 'Even now, it astounds by its courage and its audacity; if you think you have an 'original' approach to a filmor a director's work and check it against A Mirror for England, you generally discover that Raymond Durgnat had said it already.' Durgnat himself said about the book that 'the main point was arranging a kind of rendezvous between thinking about movies and thinking, not so much about sociology, as about the experiences that people are having all the time.' Durgnat used Mirror to assert the validity of British cinema against its dismissal by the critics of Cahiers du cin ma and Sight and Sound. His analysis takes in classics such as In Which We Serve (1942), A Matter of Life and Death (1946) and The Blue Lamp (1949), alongside 'B' films and popular genres such as Hammer horror. Durgnat makes a cogent and compelling case for the success of British films in reflecting British predicaments, moods and myths, at the same time as providing some disturbing new insights into a national character by whose enigmas and contradictions we continue to be perplexed and fascinated.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=S1jyDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Boy of the Painted Cave","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Being Ok Just Isn't Enough: The Power of Self-Discovery (Lifestyle Series)","description":"-- Lays out specific solutions for every problem presented. -- New approach.

It offers a unique insider's view of human rights, rule of law, and fundamentalist trends in the Muslim World. It discusses the complex and problematic relationship between the institutionalization of Islamic doctrine or religious practice and the modern universal human rights doctrine, as well as the opinions Islamists hold towards democratization and the implementation of human rights in Muslim countries. Human Rights in the Muslim World focuses on the dichotomies of sociopolitical, economic, and cultural life in Muslim statehood and the military build-up within the nation-building process. Khan explores where the main breeding grounds for Muslim fundamentalist forces are and how such forces operate and are governed. In exploring such issues, this book presents an ongoing discussion and analysis of Muslim fundamentalism that puts atheistic, anti-religious, secular ideologies, and political movements in religious and spiritual perspective. This book is a serious, scholarly attempt at finding objective answers to many questions regarding Islam. \\"This study is strong on historical, religious, and philosophical analysis, and the author's discussion of the 'Medina Charter' of 622 is quite illuminating.

When marriage cost women their property rights? When the ideal woman was rarely seen and never heard in public? In other words, what was it like to be a woman in England between 1525 and 1675? Suzanne Hull, in Women According to Men answers these questions and more, taking fascinating look at how women were described, and prescribed to act, by men during that time. Hull, the first woman ever appointed as a Principal Officer at the Huntington Library as well as the author of Chaste, Silent and Obedient, uses her years of experience researching 16th- and 17th-century texts to provide you with an authentic look at the state of women during the Elizabethan era. Through an examination of texts written during that time about and for women, Hull elucidates what the rules for women were then, as well as discussing health habits, household remedies, theories on conception, the care of children, the making of food, fashion and more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GoZqM23NTnoC&dq=Women+According+to+Men:+The+World+of+Tudor-Stuart+Women&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bemelmans' New York: An exhibition of paintings by Ludwig Bemelmans","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZBFNnQEACAAJ&dq=Bemelmans%27+New+York:+An+exhibition+of+paintings+by+Ludwig+Bemelmans&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Improve your pan fishing","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0ATqGwAACAAJ&dq=Improve+your+pan+fishing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Three guineas","description":"The gifted English writer submits a strong plea for intellectual freedom, women's rights, and the cessation of war","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2QtxcFQkUk8C&dq=Three+guineas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Flesh and Metal","description":"A poetic exploration of the new world created by the collision of the biological body with technology and culture. For more than 3,000 years, humans have explored uncharted geographic and spiritual realms. Present-day explorers face new territories born from the coupling of living tissue and metal, strange lifeforms that are intelligent but unconscious, neither completely alive nor dead. Our bodies are now made of machines, images, and information. We are becoming cultural bodies in a world inhabited by cyborgs, clones, genetically modified animals, and innumerable species of human/information symbionts. Ollivier Dyens's Metal and Flesh is about two closely related phenomena: the technologically induced transformation of our perceptions of the world and the emergence of a cultural biology. Culture, according to Dyens, is taking control of the biosphere. Focusing on the twentieth century which will be remembered as the century in which the living body was blurred, molded, and transformed by technology and culture Dyens ruminates on the undeniable and irreversible human/machine entanglement that is changing the very nature of our lives.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NTLU0GTT-G0C&dq=Flesh+and+Metal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE INTERIOR SENSES.","description":"This is a new release of the original 1942 edition.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0ucfnwEACAAJ&dq=THE+PSYCHOLOGY+OF+THE+INTERIOR+SENSES.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Introduction to the Mathematics and Methods of Astrodynamics, Revised Edition (AIAA Education)","description":"Winner of the Summerfield Book Award!

One of the earliest buildings was a log hotel, indicating Orlando's future as a tourist destination. After its incorporation in 1875, wood-frame structures replaced the log cabins, and prosperous citizens built large houses around the developing government and business center. By 1900, as Orlando recovered from the economic disaster of the Great Freeze of 1894 and 1895, brick construction replaced wood frame as once pretentious houses close to the central city were torn down to make way for modern business blocks. As residences moved to less congested neighborhoods, schools and churches followed. From its beginning, people arrived in Orlando to prosper and build. Those men and their buildings are gone, but the history of the city is richer because of their presence. Orlando's story can be traced through the continuing cycle of constructing, demolishing, and rebuilding anew.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4xWDRXbzXsMC&dq=Orlando+and+Orange+County+(Images+of+America+(Arcadia+Publishing))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Geographic literacy, maps for memorization","description":"Contains brief summary of each region covered, alphabetized list of political and physical features, blank and labelled reproducable physical and political maps, tests and answer keys for each region.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1V3iuVFgqFsC&dq=Geographic+literacy,+maps+for+memorization&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crusade: Book 3 of the Aquasilva Trilogy (Aquasilva Trilogy 3)","description":"Book 3 of the Aquasilva Trilogy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uUfSAAAACAAJ&dq=Crusade:+Book+3+of+the+Aquasilva+Trilogy+(Aquasilva+Trilogy+3)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Organize Your Work Day In No Time","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=r_sDwgEACAAJ&dq=Organize+Your+Work+Day+In+No+Time&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Five Star Science Fiction/Fantasy - Odysseus On The Rhine","description":"Kruzurk first encountered the villain, Seed of Cerberus, when he studied with him under the master magician, Merlin.

The point of the book is that it may succeed in giving you a fair idea of where you stand in relation to the continuum of culture, and help you understand in what further direction you need to proceed.  Ashley Montagu, Ph. D. This provocative book, first published in 1958, is an inquiry into, and an answer to, three very important questions: 1) What is a cultured man? 2) What does  culture  mean in America? 3) What is YOUR  culture quotient ? Dr. Montagu analyzes and evaluations the first two questions above in a brilliant opening essay. He then provides 50 tests (1,500 questions with answers) which explore YOUR knowledge and attitudes and which enable you not only to determine where you stand as a truly cultured person but also to find out precisely in what directions you need to move to improve your  culture quotient.  From ballet to biology, from psychology to sex, this is an instructive test of your own intellectual status, a challenge and a guide to self-improvement. Dr. Montagu was a professor of anthropology at Rutgers University before retiring in order to devote all his time to writing. He was well-known for his TV and radio appearances, and became a renowned author.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nnZUDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Swan - the Second Voyage (Sheridan House)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Y0eGPwAACAAJ&dq=Swan+-+the+Second+Voyage+(Sheridan+House)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jerry of the Islands","description":"A lovable dog named Jerry and his adventure on a plantation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3fMOAAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Mother for Amanda (Love Inspired #109)","description":"A MOTHER FOR AMANDA Raising a child alone in the wilderness, widowed park ranger Greg Stone wanted no part of any big-city schoolteacher.

In Moving Devi she writes as she did in Can the Subaltern Speak?, about the authority of autobiography in a way that the earlier essay could not begin to. In Responsibility she makes another excursion into classic Spivak territory as regards the Other and the Ethical. In Our Asias she examines the concept of Asia as an idea that reflects Europe's eastward trajectory. She writes to pluralize the name of a continent and, by an inspired - if ironically paradoxical - return to Yeats, she seeks to do so also in the name of woman.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BW5tAAAACAAJ&dq=Other+Asias&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Survival Guide for the Elementary/Middle School Counselor (J-B Ed: Survival Guides)","description":"An expanded edition filled with ideas, strategies, and tools for school counselors This Survival Guide helps counselors plan and implement an effective counseling program tailored to the needs of all students.

Her story spans 51 years (1961-2012) of active service from the brink of nuclear war during the Cuban Missile Crisis to the first global cruise by nuclear-powered ships, to the first strikes during the Vietnam War, battles against the Iranians and Iraqis in the 1980s and 1990s, a pivotal role during 9/11 and the Global War on Terrorism, and hunting pirates off the Horn of Africa. More than just an operational history of Enterprise, this book recounts the experiences of the men and women who served on board--the pilots who flew from the flight deck, the men who fought to save the ship during a fire in 1969, the sailors who brought retribution against Al-Qaeda terrorists--with detailed descriptions of sorties through flak-filled skies and harrowing escapes from capture behind enemy lines. This book is dedicated to the men and women who have served on board Big E, and to those who paid the ultimate price for freedom.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4W17EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Light of Glory: Readings from John Donne for Lent and Easter Week","description":"The prose and poetry of John Donne come newly alive in these fresh translations for day-by-day Lenten reading.

Plus the short story Lord John and the Hell-fire Club. Adored bestselling author Diana Gabaldon brings us the first book in a new trilogy featuring many of the characters from her wildly popular Outlander series. In her New York Times bestselling Outlander novels, Diana Gabaldon introduced millions of readers to a dazzling world of history and adventure -- a world of vibrant settings and utterly unforgettable characters. Now one of these characters, Major Lord John Grey, opens the door to his own part of this world -- eighteenth-century London, a seething anthill of nobility and rabble peopled by soldiers and spies, whores and dukes. Great Britain is battling France for supremacy on three continents -- and life is good for a soldier. The year is 1757. On a clear morning in mid-June, Lord John Grey emerges from London  s Beefsteak Club, his mind in turmoil. A nobleman and a high-ranking officer in His Majesty s Army, Grey has just witnessed something shocking. But his efforts to avoid a scandal that might destroy his family are interrupted by something still more urgent: the Crown appoints him to investigate the brutal murder of a comrade in arms, who may have been a traitor. Obliged to pursue two inquiries at once, Major Grey finds himself ensnared in a web of treachery and betrayal that touches every stratum of English society -- and threatens all he holds dear. From the bawdy houses of London  s night-world to the stately drawing rooms of the nobility, and from the blood of a murdered corpse to the thundering seas ruled by the majestic fleet of the East India Company, Lord John pursues the elusive trails of a vanishing footman and a woman in green velvet, who may hold the key to everything -- or nothing. The early days of the Seven Years War come brilliantly to life in this historical mystery by an author whose unique and compelling storytelling has engrossed millions of readers worldwide.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=d8TWl1lVJm0C&dq=Lord+John+and+the+Private+Matter&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mook Jong Construction Manual","description":"The mook jong, or wooden dummy, is one of the most versatile and effective martial arts training devices ever developed.

Veteran martial artist Michael Janich takes you step by step through the process of building a traditional dummy that is proportionate to your height and reach, as well as constructing in-ground, wall-mounted and freestanding support platforms. He also shows you how to build his innovative Human Response dummy, a modern spring-loaded variant of the traditional dummy that provides almost human movement and allows the realistic practice of virtually any martial arts technique.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TnnsPQAACAAJ&dq=The+Mook+Jong+Construction+Manual&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Questions Women Ask In Private","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VtsAuAEACAAJ&dq=Questions+Women+Ask+In+Private&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"West of Bohemia","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OBUTGQAACAAJ&dq=West+of+Bohemia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Beauty of Chinese Yixing Teapots: And the Finer Arts of Tea Drinking","description":"The fine art of preparing and drinking tea has become a hallmark ofChinese civilization.

At the heart of their deals was a clear race-conscious intent to place the interests of whites above those of blacks. In this provocative and important book, Fair, the eighth of ten children born to a single mother on public assistance in an Ohio ghetto, combines two histories America's and his own to offer a compelling defense of affirmative action. How can it be, Fair asks, that, after hundreds of years of racial apartheid during which whites were granted 100% quotas to almost all professions, we have now convinced ourselves that, after a few decades of remedial affirmative action, the playing field is now level? Centuries of racial caste, he argues, cannot be swept aside in a few short years. Fair ambitiously surveys the most common arguments for and against affirmative action. He argues that we must distinguish between America in the pre-Civil Rights Movement era when the law of the land was explicitly anti-black and today's affirmative action policies, which are decidedly not anti- white. He concludes that the only just and effective way in which to account for America's racial past and to negotiate current racial quagmires is to embrace a remedial affirmative action that relies neither on quotas nor fiery rhetoric, but one which takes race into account alongside other pertinent factors. Championing the model of diversity on which the United States was purportedly founded, Fair serves up a personal and persuasive account of why race-conscious policies are the most effective way to end de facto segregation and eliminate racial caste.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7i4TCgAAQBAJ&dq=Notes+of+a+Racial+Caste+Baby:+Color+Blindness+and+the+End+of+Affirmative+Action&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Afghanistan: The First Five Years of Soviet Occupation","description":"When Soviet military forces invaded Afghanistan in late 1979, the invasion was, at once, an attempt to save a tottering Marxist government and a warning to both East and West that the Brezhnev Doctrine of \\"necessary intervention\\" would be enforced.

Anthony was one of the most important leaders of the movement to gain American women the vote. But, as Vivian Gornick argues in this passionate, vivid biographical essay, Stanton is also the greatest feminist thinker of the nineteenth century. Endowed with a philosophical cast of mind large enough to grasp the immensity that women's rights addressed, Stanton developed a devotion to equality uniquely American in character. Her writing and life make clear why feminism as a liberation movement has flourished here as nowhere else in the world. Born in 1815 into a conservative family of privilege, Stanton was radicalized by her experience in the abolitionist movement. Attending the first international conference on slavery in London in 1840, she found herself amazed when the conference officials refused to seat her because of her sex. At that moment she realized that \\"In the eyes of the world I was not as I was in my own eyes, I was only a woman.\\" At the same moment she saw what it meant for the American republic to have failed to deliver on its fundamental promise of equality for all. In her last public address, \\"The Solitude of Self,\\" (delivered in 1892), she argued for women's political equality on the grounds that loneliness is the human condition, and that each citizen therefore needs the tools to fight alone for his or her interests. Vivian Gornick first encountered \\"The Solitude of Self\\" thirty years ago. Of that moment Gornick writes, \\"I hardly knew who Stanton was, much less what this speech meant in her life, or in our history, but it I can still remember thinking with excitement and gratitude, as I read these words for the first time, eighty years after they were written,  We are beginning where she left off.' \\" The Solitude of Self is a profound, distilled meditation on what makes American feminism American from one of the finest critics of our time.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=P_8UlK6QEjQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rogue Warrior: Echo Platoon","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kd78twEACAAJ&dq=Rogue+Warrior:+Echo+Platoon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Us Navy Seals Handbook","description":"Instructs on how to adopt a Navy SEAL mentality to approach survival situations, discussing survival skills specific to mountain, jungle, arctic, desert, and ocean environments.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=W41DCgAAQBAJ&dq=Us+Navy+Seals+Handbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nurturing Your Baby's Soul: A Spiritual Guide For Expectant Parents","description":"Refreshing spiritual teaching on conception, pregnancy and childbirth.

However, Edgar Allan Poe s unnamed narrator, after suffering innumerable tortures upon his body and soul in the hands of his tormenters, sees the light of the day at the very end of his sanity s tether. Even despite the lack of supernatural elements, \\"The Pit and the Pendulum\\" (1842) has enjoyed and influenced several notable movie adaptations. Animations such as The \\"Flinstones\\", TV series like \\"Crime Scene Investigation\\", to films like Roger Corman s \\"The Pit and the Pendulum\\" (1961), starring Vincent Price and some torture methods found in the \\"Saw\\" franchise, the story s famous pendulum scene is a rather fruitful source of inspirations. Yet, despite the terrific torments, the story focuses primarily on how terror is implicitly depicted through the workings of the mind. Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849) was an American poet, author, and literary critic. Most famous for his poetry, short stories, and tales of the supernatural, mysterious, and macabre, he is also regarded as the inventor of the detective genre and a contributor to the emergence of science fiction, dark romanticism, and weird fiction.

Deeply researched and elegantly written . . . As a description of the politics and pressures under which modern independent central banking has to operate, the book is incomparable.   Financial Times The definitive biography of the most important economic statesman of our time Sebastian Mallaby's magisterial biography of Alan Greenspan, the product of over five years of research based on untrammeled access to his subject and his closest professional and personal intimates, brings into vivid focus the mysterious point where the government and the economy meet. To understand Greenspan's story is to see the economic and political landscape of our time and the presidency from Reagan to George W. Bush in a whole new light. As the most influential economic statesman of his age, Greenspan spent a lifetime grappling with a momentous shift: the transformation of finance from the fixed and regulated system of the post-war era to the free-for-all of the past quarter century. The story of Greenspan is also the story of the making of modern finance, for good and for ill. Greenspan's life is a quintessential American success story: raised by a single mother in the Jewish  migr  community of Washington Heights, he was a math prodigy who found a niche as a stats-crunching consultant. A master at explaining the economic weather to captains of industry, he translated that skill into advising Richard Nixon in his 1968 campaign. This led to a perch on the White House Council of Economic Advisers, and then to a dazzling array of business and government roles, from which the path to the Fed was relatively clear. A fire-breathing libertarian and disciple of Ayn Rand in his youth who once called the Fed's creation a historic mistake, Mallaby shows how Greenspan reinvented himself as a pragmatist once in power. In his analysis, and in his core mission of keeping inflation in check, he was a maestro indeed, and hailed as such. At his retirement in 2006, he was lauded as the age's necessary man, the veritable God in the machine, the global economy's avatar. His memoirs sold for record sums to publishers around the world. But then came 2008. Mallaby's story lands with both feet on the great crash which did so much to damage Alan Greenspan's reputation. Mallaby argues that the conventional wisdom is off base: Greenspan wasn't a na?ve ideologue who believed greater regulation was unnecessary. He had pressed for greater regulation of some key areas of finance over the years, and had gotten nowhere. To argue that he didn't know the risks in irrational markets is to miss the point. He knew more than almost anyone; the question is why he didn't act, and whether anyone else could or would have. A close reading of Greenspan's life provides fascinating answers to these questions, answers whose lessons we would do well to heed. Because perhaps Mallaby's greatest lesson is that economic statesmanship, like political statesmanship, is the art of the possible. The Man Who Knew is a searching reckoning with what exactly comprised the art, and the possible, in the career of Alan Greenspan.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=e6KoCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Polo's Mother (Cat Pack)","description":"The mystery-loving cats are back for one final adventure, in which Polo, who has longed for his mother, is surprised when she returns.

In this fully revised edition, political scientists David W. Brady and Craig Volden demonstrate that gridlock is not a product of divided government, party politics, or any of the usual scapegoats. It is, instead, an instrumental part of American government?built into our institutions and sustained by leaders acting rationally not only to achieve set goals but to thwart foolish inadvertencies. Looking at key legislative issues from the divided government under Reagan, through Clinton's Democratic government to complete unified Republican control under George W. Bush, the authors clearly and carefully analyze important crux points in lawmaking: the swing votes, the veto, the filibuster, and the rise of tough budget politics. They show that when it comes to government gridlock, it doesn't matter who's in the White House or who's in control of Congress; it's as American as apple pie, and its results may ultimately be as sweet in ensuring stability and democracy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IvlNDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Courage of the Mountain Man","description":"Despite the warnings of ranchers, Smoke Jensen and his trail herders head north out of Colorado, taking 3,500 head of cattle into the gunfire of Clint Black, the fiercely competitive and power-hungry rancher whose land they must cross.

As a Yale freshman, Worthen found herself deeply fascinated by worldly-wise professor Charles Hill, a former diplomat who had shaped American foreign policy in his forty-year career as an adviser to Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, and Boutros Boutros-Ghali, among others. Hill was never afraid to tell students how to think or what to do, and the Grand Strategy seminar he co-taught had developed a cult following. The Man on Whom Nothing Was Lost is at once the biography of a political insider and the story of how its author evolved as she wrote it. In a moving, highly original work, Worthen conveys the joy and the heartache of uncovering the human being behind one s idol.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Va4bZQ_lzuMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Measure and Category: A Survey of the Analogies Between Topological and Measure Spaces","description":"In this edition, a set of Supplementary Notes and Remarks has been added at the end, grouped according to chapter. Some of these call attention to subsequent developments, others add further explanation or additional remarks. Most of the remarks are accompanied by a briefly indicated proof, which is sometimes different from the one given in the reference cited. The list of references has been expanded to include many recent contributions, but it is still not intended to be exhaustive. John C. Oxtoby Bryn Mawr, April 1980 Preface to the First Edition This book has two main themes: the Baire category theorem as a method for proving existence, and the \\"duality\\" between measure and category. The category method is illustrated by a variety of typical applications, and the analogy between measure and category is explored in all of its ramifications. To this end, the elements of metric topology are reviewed and the principal properties of Lebesgue measure are derived. It turns out that Lebesgue integration is not essential for present purposes-the Riemann integral is sufficient. Concepts of general measure theory and topology are introduced, but not just for the sake of generality. Needless to say, the term \\"category\\" refers always to Baire category; it has nothing to do with the term as it is used in homological algebra.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Va_aBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Courtesans: The Demi-Monde in 19th-Century France","description":"In Second Empire Paris there were a dozen courtesans who were generally known as la garde: they were the queens of their profession, the women whom visiting princes thought it essential to see. They were the women who encrusted their bathroom taps with jewels, built palaces in the Champs-Elys es, fought duels in the Bois de Boulogne. They scandalised society and influenced the Press and politics. They also ensnared the husbands and lovers of the most beautiful women in Paris. Joanna Richardson presents her own version of la garde ? twelve of the most distinguished courtesans in Paris during their golden age. From the calculating Cora Pearl to the hideous la Pa?va, who rose from the Moscow ghetto to indecent wealth and fame, and the admirable Madame Sabatier made famous by Baudelaire, to La Castiglione sent by Cavour to seduce Napoleon III, la garde people these pages with all the colour, intrigue, scandal and vivacity with which they peopled the demi-monde of 19th century Paris.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PwvNwAEACAAJ&dq=The+Courtesans:+The+Demi-Monde+in+19th-Century+France&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Intermediate Chinese","description":"Acting Chinese is a year-long course that, together with the companion website, integrates language learning with the acquisition of cultural knowledge, and treats culture as an integral part of human behavior and communication.

Controversial and challenging, yet always enlightening, Krishnamurti guides us through society's common concerns, such as suffering and fear, love and loneliness, sex and death, the meaning of life, the nature of God, and personal transformation - consistently relating these topics to the essential search for pure truth and perfect freedom.

Over the course of her extraordinary life and career, Audrey captured hearts around the world and created a public image that stands as one of the most recognizable and beloved in recent memory. But despite her international fame and her tireless efforts on behalf of UNICEF, Audrey was also known for her intense privacy. With unprecedented access to studio archives, friends and colleagues who knew and loved Audrey, bestselling author Donald Spoto provides an intimate and moving account of this beautiful, elusive and talented woman. Tracing her astonishing rise to stardom, from her harrowing childhood in Nazi-controlled Holland during World War II to her years as a struggling ballet dancer in London and her Tony Awardwinning Broadway debut in Gigi, Spoto illuminates the origins of Audrey s tenacious spirit and fiercely passionate nature. She would go on to star in some of the most popular movies of the twentieth century, including Roman Holiday, Sabrina, Funny Face, The Nun s Story, Breakfast at Tiffany s and My Fair Lady. A friend and inspiration to renowned designer Hubert de Givenchy, Audrey also emerged as a fashion icon and her influence on women s fashion virtually unparalleled to this day. Behind the glamorous public persona, Audrey was a different and deeper person and a woman who craved love and affection. Donald Spoto offers remarkable insights into her professional and personal relationships with her two husbands, and with celebrities such as Gregory Peck, William Holden, Fred Astaire, Gary Cooper, Robert Anderson, Cary Grant, Peter O Toole, Albert Finney and Ben Gazzara. The turbulent romances of her youth, her profound sympathy for the plight of hungry children, and the thrills and terrors of motherhood prepared Audrey for the final chapter in her life, as she devoted herself entirely to the charity efforts of an organization that had once come to her rescue at the end of the war: UNICEF.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EiYCk36ZWmUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Next Year Will Be Better (Bison Book)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=C8eoAAAAIAAJ&dq=Next+Year+Will+Be+Better+(Bison+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Essays on the Mexican War (Walter Prescott Webb Memorial Lectures, published for the University of Texas at)","description":"To a large degree, the story of Texas  secession from Mexico has been undertaken by scholars of the state. Early twentieth century historians of the revolutionary period, most notably Eugene Barker and William Binkley, characterized the conflict as a clash of two opposing cultures, yet their exclusive focus on the region served to reinforce popular notions of a unique Texas past. Disconnected from a broader historiography, scholars have been left to ponder the most arcane details of the revolutionary narrative such as the circumstances of David Crockett s death and whether William Barret Travis really did draw a line in the sand. In Contested Empire: Rethinking the Texas Revolution, five distinguished scholars take a broader, transnational approach to the 183536 conflict. The result of the 48th Annual Walter Prescott Webb Memorial Lectures, held at the University of Texas at Arlington in March, 2013, these essays explore the origins and consequences of the events that gave birth to the Texas Republic in ways that extend beyond the borders of the Lone Star State.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rRJDDQAAQBAJ&dq=Essays+on+the+Mexican+War+(Walter+Prescott+Webb+Memorial+Lectures,+published+for+the+University+of+Texas+at)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Am The Master: Stepping Out Of The Darkness","description":"All Masters are grateful for being able to create the life where they can help other souls - individuals who are lost - find themselves.

Board member orientation truly simplified. Serving on a nonprofit board can be an incredibly rewarding experience for the properly prepared board member. This book is for the generous and busy people who agree to give of their time and talents by serving on nonprofit boards. Nonprofit boards often fail to do a good job of board member orientation for a variety of reasons. It takes a significant amount of time and effort to plan and conduct quality board member orientation programs, and every time a new board member arrives, it's time to do it again! Because of the challenges associated with providing quality board member orientation, many nonprofit organizations do not do it at all, leaving their board members to wing it. This book provides help and support to the truly great men and women serving on nonprofit boards whose service makes a positive difference in the lives of countless people every day. This book is a concise and appropriately comprehensive guide to nonprofit board service designed especially for new board members.

Hooey Alerts! Watch for Hooey Alerts! where the author identifies and dispels common myths and legends about nonprofit board service. There are many sources of false or misleading information about the nonprofit board service environment.

Set in the rich farmland of California's Salinas Valley, this sprawling and often brutal novel follows the intertwined destinies of two families the Trasks and the Hamiltons whose generations helplessly reenact the fall of Adam and Eve and the poisonous rivalry of Cain and Abel. The masterpiece of Steinbeck s later years, East of Eden is a work in which Steinbeck created his most mesmerizing characters and explored his most enduring themes: the mystery of identity, the inexplicability of love, and the murderous consequences of love's absence.

Within the space of two years he was fired from Vanity Fair, banned from the most fashionable bar in the city, and couldn't get a date for love or money.

Long plagued by endemic poverty, until the 1990s the Indian economy was also hamstrung by a burdensome regulatory regime that limited its ability to compete on a global scale. Since then, however, the Indian government has gradually opened up the economy and the results have been stunning. India's middle class has grown by leaps and bounds, and the country's sheer scale-its huge population and $2 trillion economy-means its actions will have a major global impact. From world trade to climate change to democratization, India now matters. While it is clearly on the path to becoming a great power, India has not abandoned all of its past policies: its economy remains relatively protectionist, and it still struggles with the legacy of its longstanding foreign policy doctrine of non-alignment. India's vibrant democracy encompasses a vast array of parties who champion dizzyingly disparate policies. And India isn't easily swayed by foreign influence; the country carefully guards its autonomy, in part because of its colonial past. For all of these reasons, India tends to move cautiously and deliberately in the international sphere. In Our Time Has Come Alyssa Ayres looks at how the tension between India's inward-focused past and its ongoing integration into the global economy will shape its trajectory. Today, Indian leaders increasingly want to see their country feature in the ranks of the world's great powers-in fact, as a \\"leading power,\\" to use the words of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Ayres considers the role India is likely to play as its prominence grows, taking stock of the implications and opportunities for the US and other nations as the world's largest democracy defines its place in the world. As she shows, India breaks the mold of the typical \\"ally,\\" and its vastness, history, and diversity render it incomparable to any other major democratic power. By focusing on how India's unique perspective shapes its approach to global affairs, Our Time Has Come will help the world make sense of India's rise.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=i8M9DwAAQBAJ&dq=A+Time+for+India&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fat Camp Commandos","description":"Sequel to Fat camp commandos. 7 yrs+","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9ZfGPAAACAAJ&dq=Fat+Camp+Commandos&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Amethyst (Dakotah Treasures #4)","description":"Dakotah Treasures Book 4- Major Jeremiah McHenry is retiring from the army and returns to Medora to make a new life and find a wife.

Visit us online at www.1stWorldLibrary.ORG - - As the streets that lead from the Strand to the Embankment are very narrow, it is better not to walk down them arm-in-arm. If you persist, lawyers' clerks will have to make flying leaps into the mud; young lady typists will have to fidget behind you. In the streets of London where beauty goes unregarded, eccentricity must pay the penalty, and it is better not to be very tall, to wear a long blue cloak, or to beat the air with your left hand. One afternoon in the beginning of October when the traffic was becoming brisk a tall man strode along the edge of the pavement with a lady on his arm. Angry glances struck upon their backs. The small, agitated figures - for in comparison with this couple most people looked small - decorated with fountain pens, and burdened with despatch-boxes, had appointments to keep, and drew a weekly salary, so that there was some reason for the unfriendly stare which was bestowed upon Mr. Ambrose's height and upon Mrs. Ambrose's cloak. But some enchantment had put both man and woman beyond the reach of malice and unpopularity. In his guess one might guess from the moving lips that it was thought; and in hers from the eyes fixed stonily straight in front of her at a level above the eyes of most that it was sorrow. It was only by scorning all she met that she kept herself from tears, and the friction of people brushing past her was evidently painful. After watching the traffic on the Embankment for a minute or two with a stoical gaze she twitched her husband's sleeve, and they crossed between the swift discharge of motor cars. When they were safe on the further side, she gently withdrew her arm from his, allowing her mouth at the same time to relax, to tremble; then tears rolled down, and leaning her elbows on the balustrade, she shielded her face from the curious. Mr. Ambrose attempted consolation; he patted her shoulder; but she showed no signs of admitting him, and feeling it awkward to stand beside a grief that was greater than his, he crossed his arms behind him, and took a turn along the pavement.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Xz2WDABvgd0C&dq=The+voyage+out,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Book of Directions","description":"Cutting through the noise.

She profiles cacao, raw sweeteners, water, pH level of foods, juices versus smoothies, salt, the process of dehydrating food, garlic and onions, and overall food preparation. Russo highlights what supplements (superfoods, vitamins, green products) to include in the diet.

Drawn in a group with Israel, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Austria and mighty Spain, it was hard to see the principality's part-time players scoring even one goal, never mind adding to its meagre international points total. So what motivates a nation of 30,000 people and eleven villages to keep plugging away despite the inevitability of defeat? Travelling to all of Liechenstein's qualifying matches, Charlie Connelly examines what motivates a team to take the field dressed proudly in the shirts of Liechtenstein despite the knowledge that they are, with notably few exceptions, in for a damn good hiding. Sampling the delights of Liechtenstein's capital, Vaduz, such as the Postage Stamp Museum, the State Art Museum and, er, the Postage Stamp Museum again, Connelly provides an evocative and witty account of the land where every year on National Day the sovereign invites the entire population into his garden for a glass of wine.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sAHdGwAACAAJ&dq=Stamping+Grounds:+Liechtenstein%27s+Quest+for+the+World+Cup&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One Eye Closed (Silhouette Sensation)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NjRFAQAAIAAJ&dq=One+Eye+Closed+(Silhouette+Sensation)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Difficult Truce (Signet Regency Romance)","description":"Taken captive by her ancestral enemies, the hated British, beautiful Irish aristocrat Christina MacCarthy had only one route of escape: marriage to one of England's most powerful, dangerously handsome lords, the Duke of Dacre.

The impact of those cost increases on both employers and employees will be huge. Workers will see a direct cut in their take-home pay. Millions will lose health insurance coverage completely. Senior citizens on fixed incomes will be hit particularly hard, as premiums for their Medicare supplement plans and prescription drug costs climb. Frustrated and angry, people will soon be demanding a solution from their elected officials, and, for the first time in recent memory, the size of our unemployed population will become a real political issue rather than just the subject of energetic rhetoric. It is time to recognize that we are moving into a major health care crisis in this country, a crisis driven by the way we deliver, receive, and pay for care. Epidemic of Care offers a comprehensive assessment of the factors behind the cost crisis, how the crisis will escalate, and what can be done to improve the situation. A blueprint for getting to a coherent national health policy, this book calls for a collaboration between different parts of the private sector, state and local governments, and, at times, the federal government  with a formula that can succeed no matter who rules Congress. Authors George C. Halvorson and George J. Isham, M.D.  two individuals who have made an impressive impact on the national health care scene  provide some practical, field-tested, sometimes controversial suggestions about how to make health care in this country more accountable, more efficient, more valuable, and more affordable.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FL-OCQAAQBAJ&dq=Epidemic+of+Care:+A+Call+for+Safer,+Better,+and+More+Accountable+Health+Care&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"15 Seconds","description":" A total white knuckle, stay-up-all-night thrill ride.

Let me count the ways.\\" With these words, Elizabeth Barrett Browning has come down to us as a romantic heroine, a recluse controlled by a domineering father and often overshadowed by her husband, Robert Browning. But behind the melodrama lies a thoroughly modern figure whose extraordinary life is an electrifying study in self-invention. Born in 1806, Barrett Browning lived in an age when women could not attend a university, own property after marriage, or vote. And yet she seized control of her private income, defied chronic illness and disability, became an advocate for the revolutionary Italy to which she eloped, and changed the course of cultural history. Her late-in-life verse novel masterpiece, Aurora Leigh, reveals both the brilliance and originality of her mind, as well as the challenges of being a woman writer in the Victorian era. A feminist icon, high-profile activist for the abolition of slavery, and international literary superstar, Barrett Browning inspired writers as diverse as Emily Dickinson, George Eliot, Rudyard Kipling, Oscar Wilde, and Virginia Woolf. Two-Way Mirror is the first biography of Barrett Browning in more than three decades. With unique access to the poet s abundant correspondence,  astute, thoughtful, and wide-ranging guide  (Times [UK]) Fiona Sampson holds up a mirror to the woman, her art, and the art of biography itself.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4wYDEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tori Amos: Anthology","description":"Illustrated sequences by more than eighty comic-book and graphic artists accompany the lyrics of songs by Tori Amos ranging from \\"Little Earthquakes\\" to \\"American Doll Posse.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hZnmPAAACAAJ&dq=Tori+Amos:+Anthology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rachel And Her Children: Homeless Families In America","description":"\\"Extraordinarily affecting....A very important book....To read and remember the stories in this book, to take them to heart, is to be called as a witness.\\" THE BOSTON GLOBE There is no safety net for the millions of heartbroken refugees from the American Dream, scattered helplessly in any city you can name.

His life symbolises the hubristic and visionary ambition Germany had to an alarming degree much better than anyone else, perhaps because he was an intellectual of the highest calibre:  Can t they see,  he said of his fellow accused at Nuremberg,  that this is a horrible tragedy in the history of mankind, and that we are the symbols of an evil that God is brushing aside?  As he recognised by the end he was a primary, if not the exemplary, symbol, his remorse, self-pity, and arrogance knew no bounds as they vied with his contrition. In Prague, big red posters were put up on which one could read that seven Czechs had been shot today. I said to myself, If I had to put up a poster for every seven Poles shot, the forests of Poland would not be sufficient to manufacture the paper.

However, though Potter is a household name around the world, few know the woman behind the illustrations. Her personal life, including a romantic relationship with her publisher, Norman Warne, and her significant achievements outside of children's literature remain largely unknown. In Linda Lear's enchanting new biography, we get the life story of this incredible, funny, and independent woman. As one of the first female naturalists in the world, Potter brought the beauty and importance of nature back into the imagination at a time when plunder was more popular than preservation. Through her art she sought to encourage conservation and change the world. With never before seen illustrations and intimate detail, Lear goes beyond our perrenial fascination with Potter as a writer and illustrator of children's books, and delves deeply into the life of a most unusual and gifted woman--one whose art was timeless, and whose generosity left an indelible imprint on the countryside.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mt5DijsNaMUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bidding Precisely Volume 2","description":"The second edition of this book incorporates the 2/1 Game Force bidding system. The book is designed to improve your bidding in 5 steps. The 1st step involves maximizing your use of the 2/1 system whenever you open with a major suit. The 2nd step involves your use of the New Minor Forcing convention to find a 5-card major in responder s hand. The 3rd step involves adoption of the strong 2 bid, a bid of 20-21p with an unbalanced hand (one with a singleton or void). By tweaking reverses, this allows the opener to show an unbalanced hand by bidding at the 2-lelvel with 16-17p or at the 3-level with 18-19p. The 4th step involves optimizing your slam bidding with conventions to show the trump Queen. It also involves the use of the Redwood kickback convention minor suit contracts and the use of the Fourth Suit Forcing convention to ascertain whether the opener has 4or 5 cards in this 2nd bid suit. The 5th step involves the use of bids to hamper the opponents from finding their 4-4 spade fit. This involves the use of the Casey overcall and the use of the Casey-Jacoby Transfer for R s 5-card majors. Finally, the use of inverted minors is discussed.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Tq2wDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spiritual healing, (His Practical series)","description":"This text examines the beauty of the human energy field and the flow of subtle energies during healing and life experiences.

Translator Stephen Kalberg is an internationally acclaimed Weberian scholar. In this Third Edition, Kalberg offers a precise and nuanced rendering of The Protestant Ethic that captures Weber's style as well as the unusual subtlety of his descriptions and causal arguments. Kalberg's standardization of Weber's terminology facilitates understanding of the various twists and turns in his complex lines of reasoning. Weber's original italicization, highlighting major themes, has been restored. A glossary of major terms has been added. In short, The Protestant Ethic thesis is presented in a clear and highly readable manner. There are three compelling reasons to read this classic: * It explores the continuing debate regarding the origins and legacy of modern capitalism in the West. * It helps the reader better understand economic development today around the world, especially in Russia, Eastern Europe, Asia, and South America. * It plumbs the deep cultural forces that affect contemporary work life and the workplace in the United States and Europe. In his introduction, Kalberg examines the controversy that has surrounded this book for nearly a century and summarizes major aspects of Weber's complex analysis. Kalberg also discusses The Protestant Ethic in the context of Weber's other writings. Finally, Kalberg investigates the contribution of this classical study for understanding the role played by cultural forces in modern economic development and discusses the wide-ranging impact today of ascetic Protestantism on the American work ethic. The Third Roxbury Edition includes Weber's 1906 essay \\"The Protestant Sects and the Spirit of Capitalism.\\" Written after his extensive travels in the United States in 1904, Weber comments here on the diverse ways in which the legacies of early American Protestantism remain influential. Also included in this edition are Weber's masterful prefatory remarks to his Collected Essays in the Sociology of Religion, in which he defines the uniqueness of Western Societies and asks what \\"ideas and interests\\" combined to call forth modern Western rationalism. For students, The Protestant Ethic is a starting point toward understanding the multiple dimensions of social change. The continuing debates about the main elements of modern life--capitalism, our \\"common sense\\" economic determinism and \\"rational choices,\\" relationships between cultural forces and social structures, the tension between religion and science, the cultural foundations of democracy, economic cultures and business ethics, and the future of modern capitalism--are very much part of the Weberian project. Small wonder, then, that The Protestant Ethic continues to be one of the most frequently assigned readings in sociology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nMbJQgAACAAJ&dq=The+Protestant+Ethic+and+the+Spirit+of+Capitalism,+Third+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Antonio Gaudi (Masters of World Architecture)","description":"Like all the titles from the Masters of World Architecture/Makers of Contemporary Architecture series, this is a solid architectural monograph, a copiously illustrated survey of 28 of Gaudi's major works from 1877 to 1910.

They have done less well in understanding the histories of the empires that came before, the local strongholds and fiefdoms swallowed up by the mighty civilisations that the Europeans encountered. Muscutt takes us into the heart of one such ancient civilisation, the Chachapoya, nestled in the high Andes of far eastern Peru. The area is remote and nearly inaccessible (one conquistador wrote that 'the natural difficulty of the countryside is so rugged that on some roads the Indians slide down great ropes a distance of eight or ten times the height of a man, for there is no other way of advancing') for which reason scholars have been late in coming to it. Muscutt's heavily illustrated, inviting text helps place the Chachapoya empire in the larger context of Andean prehistory.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=c2gaAAAAYAAJ&dq=Warriors+of+the+Clouds:+A+Lost+Civilization+in+the+Upper+Amazon+of+Peru&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Helping Students Graduate: A Strategic Approach to Dropout Prevention","description":"This book describes the fifteen strategies identified through research reviewed by The National Dropout Prevention Center and Network at Clemson University.

Deftly written and utterly addictive, this Western literary horror debut will find a home with fans of authors like Joe Hill, Cormac McCarthy, and Anne Rice. One night in 1980, a man becomes a monster. Haunted by his past, Travis Stillwell spends his nights searching out women in West Texas honky-tonks. What he does with them doesn t make him proud, just quiets the demons for a little while. But after Travis crosses paths one night with a mysterious pale-skinned girl, he wakes weak and bloodied in his cabover camper the next morning with no sign of a girl, no memory of the night before. Annabelle Gaskin spies the camper parked behind her motel and offers the cowboy a few odd jobs to pay his board. Travis takes her up on the offer, if only to buy time, to lay low and heal. By day, he mends the old motel, insinuating himself into the lives of Annabelle and her ten-year-old son. By night, in the cave of his camper, he fights an unspeakable hunger. Before long, Annabelle and her boy come to realize that this strange cowboy is not what he seems. Half a state away, a grizzled Texas Ranger is hunting Travis for his past misdeeds, but what he finds will lead him to a revelation far more monstrous. A man of the law, he ll have to decide how far into the darkness he ll go for the sake of justice.

For the first time in more than twenty years, research has shown that members of both parties hold strongly unfavorable views of their opponents. This is polarization rooted in social identity, and it is growing. The campaign and election of Donald Trump laid bare this fact of the American electorate, its successful rhetoric of  us versus them  tapping into a powerful current of anger and resentment. With Uncivil Agreement, Lilliana Mason looks at the growing social gulf across racial, religious, and cultural lines, which have recently come to divide neatly between the two major political parties. She argues that group identifications have changed the way we think and feel about ourselves and our opponents. Even when Democrats and Republicans can agree on policy outcomes, they tend to view one other with distrust and to work for party victory over all else. Although the polarizing effects of social divisions have simplified our electoral choices and increased political engagement, they have not been a force that is, on balance, helpful for American democracy. Bringing together theory from political science and social psychology, Uncivil Agreement clearly describes this increasingly  social  type of polarization in American politics and will add much to our understanding of contemporary politics.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=R29RDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Awareness, Dialogue and Process: Essays on Gestalt Therapy","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NcjNkln05owC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Claudius, the Emperor and his achievement","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=C3kJAQAAIAAJ&dq=Claudius,+the+Emperor+and+his+achievement&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Unsafe at any speed;: The designed-in dangers of the American automobile","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SKk9AQAAIAAJ&dq=Unsafe+at+any+speed%3B:+The+designed-in+dangers+of+the+American+automobile&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lost Consonants 6 (No. 6)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EH8UAAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Good Housekeeping Great Baking: 600 Recipes for Cakes, Cookies, Breads, Pies, & Pastries","description":"In addition to providing a helpful introduction to the fundamental tools and gadgets, ingredients and flavorings, and techniques of the baker's art, a colorful cookbook furnishes more than six hundred tempting recipes for cookies, quick breads and crackers, yeast breads, custards and souffles, pies and tarts, specialty pastries, cakes, and frostings and garnishes.

This authoritative work develops the theoretical concept of diaspora and investigates the formation and reformation of diasporic groups in relation to issues of socio-economic development, truman rights, and the nation-state. Focusing on ten migration crises in Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Europe, and Central America, the author charts the formation of these new transnational communities and analyzes their social, economic and political fall-out.

Each medium or style he chose to master, no matter how solid or sculptural, can be seen as line disguised, metamorphic; as the labyrinth to which a single thread is the key. Theoretically, line is infinite; Picasso in his fertility nearly realized that theory in almost a century of ceaseless drawing, whether on paper, zinc, stone, or other media. Here is a sampling, rather than a comprehensive selection, from that plenitude; while nothing could be comprehensive within a single volume, the genius of Picasso's line manifests itself so clearly that this culling from various periods reveals the line in most of its guises. Beginning with a 1905 circus family in drypoint, 44 drawings cover Picasso's major themes, techniques, and styles. From the almost classic Ingresque clarity of the Diaghilev and Stravinsky portraits (1919, 1920) via cubist studies and \\"neo-classical\\" nudes, Picasso's restless hand remakes his world again and again with fresh energy, culminating here in six sketches of the artist/model dashed out in raging love/hate in the midst of personal crisis (195354). In between are times of serenity and introspection (Seven Dancers (1919), with the future Olga Picasso up front; many figures and bathers) and, particularity as book illustrations, many mythological studies; Eurydice Stung by a Serpent (1930 etching), Dying Minotaur in the Arena (1933), an etching for a 1934 edition of Lysistrata. Balzac is represented by a striking lithographic portrait (1952) and by etching for Vollard's edition of Le Chef-d'oeuvre inconnu. The sudden appearance of an earthy, hirsute Rembrandt (1934) seems to confirm Picasso's membership in the select group of art history's greatest draughtsmen.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=A6Py7D9O5acC&dq=Picasso+Lithographs+(Dover+Art+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Technical Report Writing Today","description":"TECHNICAL REPORT WRITING TODAY provides thorough coverage of technical writing basics, techniques, and applications.

Meant to be read together with Systematic Theology, the Introduction includes Berkhof's discussions of the nature and character of dogmatics, the methods and history of theological system, and the principia, or foundations, of theology - Scripture and God.

Written in a concise and compact style and organized in a manner ideal for detailed study, Systematic Theology covers the full range of theology in traditional systematic fashion - examining, in order, the doctrines of God, anthropology, Christology, soteriology, ecclesiology, and eschatology. The work also includes an extensive bibliography and full indexes to the authors, subjects, and Scriptures referenced in the text.

As he became a star in American horror films in the 1930s and 1940s, publicists and fan magazines crafted outlandish stories to create a new history for Lugosi. The cinema s Dracula was transformed into one of Hollywood s most mysterious actors.

From the first entrepreneurs who attempted to lure customers in to movie exhibition halls, to the digital revolution and its impact on moviegoing, Reel Time highlights the pivotal role of amusement venues in shaping the leisure activities of working- and middle-class people across North America. As marketing efforts, the lavish interiors of the movie palace and the romantic view of the local movie theatre concealed a competitive environment in which producers, exhibitors, and distributors tried to monopolize the industry and drive their rivals out of business. The pitched battles and power struggles between national movie theatre chains took place at the same time that movie exhibitors launched campaigns to reassure moviegoers that theatres were no longer the \\"unclean and immoral places of amusement\\" of yesteryear. Under the leadership of impresarios, the movie theatre rose up from these attacks to become an important social and cultural centre - one deemed \\"suitable for women and children.\\" An innovative examination of moviegoing as a social practice and movie exhibition as a commercial enterprise, Reel Time depicts how the industry shaped the development of the Canadian Prairie West and propelled the region into the modern era. Robert M. Seiler is associate professor emeritus in communication and culture at the University of Calgary. Tamara P. Seiler is professor emeritus of Canadian studies at the University of Calgary.

A major focus of the collection is the poet's relationship to his brother Jonathan, who was born with spina bifida, a disease that rendered him both physically and mentally disabled. In rich and often wrenching detail, Fraser describes the emotional turmoil, familiar dysfunction, and complex social responses arising from the birth of a handicapped child. The book examines cultural standards of normalcy, and uncovers those aspects of the self and others that are often considered freakish, unnatural, or \\"monstrous.\\" What emerges is a poetry of poignancy and intellectual rigor, of private discoveries and larger philosophical questions about faith, beauty, and the redemptive power of art. The various other poems in the volume frequently take up disturbing subjects from domestic abuse to violent global conflict, from the death of a parent to the breakup of a close friend's marriage. By turns urgent, tender, skeptical, and wry, Fraser's work displays a complexity of thought with a clarity of language and imagery. A two-time finalist for the Walt Whitman Award from the Academy of American Poets, Strange Piet  is, according to Robert Phillips, \\"an important debut.\\" Phillips also writes, \\"This book, from beginning to end, shows the hand of one who has mastered his craft and lived long enough to have something to say.\\" James Olney of The Southern Review describes Strange Piet  as \\"a resounding triumph of strictly ordered emotion.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=NRont1oCzC0C&dq=Strange+Pieta+(Walt+McDonald+First-Book+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Slaves in Ancient Greece","description":"*Includes pictures *Includes ancient accounts of slavery and debating its role in Greek society *Includes online resources and a bibliography for further reading \\"A free man? There is no such thing! All men are slaves; some, slaves of money; some, of chance; others are forced, either by mass opinion, or the threatening law, to act against their nature.\\" - Euripides, Hecuba Slavery was a universal and totally accepted feature of ancient Greek society, so much so that while the conditions under which slaves lived and worked varied considerably, many ordinary citizens kept at least one slave, often working alongside their owners, while larger commercial enterprises involved huge numbers, many of whom could rise to positions of authority and wealth. It was possible for some slaves to buy their freedom, while others lived and died in conditions of appalling brutality, notably in the silver mines at Laurium. The revenues from these mines paid for the fleet with which Athens defeated Xerxes and were the basis of the Attic owls, the four drachma coins that revolutionized the Athenian economy. The mines were often leased to contractors and worked by slaves and condemned criminals. The galleries averaged approximately three and a half feet in height, so most miners had to work on their hands and knees. Another specific group of slaves that suffered particularly brutal treatment was the pornai, slaves used in the brothels as prostitutes. While those sound like the conditions of slavery people are accustomed to hearing about in more modern times, other forms of slavery in Greece were quite unique, and perhaps fittingly, Sparta might have had the most unusual system of all. Sparta will forever be known for its military prowess, but the importance the Spartans placed upon being a warrior society meant their way of life was entirely dependent on a class of indentured servants known as the helots. The Spartans needed the helots to maintain the domestic front, but they also frequently brought helots to the battlefield with them, and they repeatedly had to turn their own hoplites on unruly helots to suppress potential rebellions. As this makes clear, however unpalatable it may be to modern historians who expound on the virtues of the Greek legacy to Western Civilization, it is indisputably the case that slavery constituted a central part of that legacy. Indeed, slavery underpinned to a large extent the very foundations of the classical Greek way of life. Slavery in Ancient Greece: The History of Slaves across the Greek City-States examines the different ways people were enslaved in Greece, and what the Ancient Greeks wrote about slavery. Along with pictures depicting important people, places, and events, you will learn about slavery in Greece like never before.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=CNFytAEACAAJ&dq=Slaves+in+Ancient+Greece&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fall Leaves Change Colors","description":"Simple text and illustrations explain how and why leaves change colors as autumn approaches.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=LAYNPwAACAAJ&dq=Fall+Leaves+Change+Colors&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Human Slices","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=KRniRAAACAAJ&dq=Human+Slices&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Maltese cat: A polo game of the 'nineties","description":"The Maltese Cat, a polo pony living among the British in India, achieves glory and honor in the big game against the Archangels.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=movQAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Maltese+cat:+A+polo+game+of+the+%27nineties&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Greatness of the Kingdom","description":"This classic, penetrating analysis of the Kingdom of God as taught in both the Old and New Testaments has been republished in a handsome hardback dust jacket edition.

The revelation that the government has access to a vast trove of personal online data demonstrates that we already live in a surveillance society. But the erosion of privacy rights extends far beyond big government. Intelligence agencies such as the NSA and CIA are using Silicon Valley corporate partners as their data spies. Seemingly progressive tech companies are joining forces with snooping government agencies to create a brave new world of wired tyranny. Life in the digital age poses an unprecedented challenge to our constitutional liberties, which guarantee a wall of privacy between the individual and the government. The basic assumption of democracy requires the ability of the individual to experiment with ideas and associations within a protected zone, as secured by the Constitution. The unobserved moment embodies the most basic of human rights, yet it is being squandered in the name of national security and consumer convenience. Robert Scheer argues that the information revolution, while a source of public enlightenment, contains the seeds of freedom's destruction in the form of a surveillance state that exceeds the wildest dream of the most ingenious dictator. The technology of surveillance, unless vigorously resisted, represents an existential threat to the liberation of the human spirit.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bZs5DgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An historical guide to Afghanistan","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=SejdpczfsUQC&dq=An+historical+guide+to+Afghanistan&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Five Star Expressions - Colorado Sunrise","description":"Learning was never so much fun!

The subject has matured into a rigorous discipline, and many university tribology and mechanics courses now routinely contain material on magnetic storage devices. The major growth in the subject has been on the micro- and nanoscale aspects of tribology and mechanics. Today, most large magnetic storage industries use atomic force microscopes to image the magnetic storage components. Many companies use variations of AFMs such as friction force microscopes (FFMs) for frictional studies. These instruments have also been used for studying scratch, wear, and indentation. These studies are valuable in the fundamental understanding of interfacial phenomena. In the second edition, I have added a new chapter, Chapter 11, on micro and nanoscale aspects of tribology and mechanics of magnetic storage compo nents. This chapter presents the state of the art of the micro/nanotribology and micro/nanomechanics of magnetic storage components. In addition, typographical errors in Chapters 1 to 10 and the appendixes have been corrected. These additions update this book and make it more valuable to researchers of the subject. I am grateful to many colleagues and particularly to my students, whose work is reported in Chapter 11. I thank my wife, Sudha, who has been forbearing during the progress of the research reported in this chapter.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kiXjBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mystery at Claudia's House (Baby-Sitters Club Mystery)","description":"The hit series is back, to charm and inspire another generation of baby-sitters!

A quiet rage smolders in hundreds of public school systems, where court- ordered busing plans have been in place for over twenty years. Intended to remedy the social and educational disadvantages of minorities, desegregation policy has not produced any appreciable educational gains, while its political and social costs have been considerable. Now, on the fortieth anniversary of the Supreme Court's epic decision, Brown v. Board of Education, the legal and social justifications for school desegregation are ripe for reexamination. In Forced Justice, David J. Armor explores the benefits and drawbacks of voluntary and involuntary desegregation plans, especially those in communities with \\"magnet\\" schools. He finds that voluntary plans, which let parents decide which school program is best for their children, are just as effective in attaining long-term desegregation as mandatory busing, and that these plans generate far greater community support. Armor concludes by proposing a new policy of \\"equity\\" choice, which draws upon the best features of both the desegregation and choice movements. This policy promises both improved desegregation and greater educational choices for all, especially for the disadvantaged minority children in urban systems who now have the fewest educational choices. The debate over desegregation policy and its many consequences needs to move beyond academic journals and courtrooms to a larger audience. In addition to educators and policymakers, Forced Justice will be an important book for social scientists, attorneys and specialists in civil rights issues, and all persons concerned about the state of public education.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BJuAZpULzAsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The White Wolf","description":"Dink, Josh, and Ruth Rose are thrilled to visit Wallis Wallace at her new cabin in the Maine wilderness.

In the first book to examine disruption in American life from a cultural rather than a psychological perspective, Gay Becker follows hundreds of people to find out what they do after something unexpected occurs. Starting with bodily distress, she shows how individuals recount experiences of disruption metaphorically, drawing on important cultural themes to help them reestablish order and continuity in their lives. Through vivid and poignant stories of people from different walks of life who experience different types of disruptions, Becker examines how people rework their ideas about themselves and their worlds, from the meaning of disruption to the meaning of life itself. Becker maintains that to understand disruption, we must also understand cultural definitions of normalcy. She questions what is normal for a family, for health, for womanhood and manhood, and for growing older. In the United States, where life is expected to be orderly and predictable, disruptions are particularly unsettling, she contends. And, while continuity in life is an illusion, it is an effective one because it organizes people's plans and expectations. Becker's phenomenological approach yields a rich, compelling, and entirely original narrative. Disrupted Lives acknowledges the central place of discontinuity in our existence at the same time as it breaks new ground in understanding the cultural dynamics that underpin life in the United States. FROM THE BOOK:\\"The doctor was blunt. He does not mince words. He did a [semen] analysis and he came back and said, 'This is devastatingly poor.' I didn't expect to hear that. It had never occurred to me. It was such a shock to my sense of self and to all these preconceptions of my manliness and virility and all of that. That was a very, very devastating moment and I was dumbfounded. . . . In that moment it totally changed the way that I thought of myself.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=O5ZDTYq28GEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dictionary of word roots and combining forms compiled from the Greek, Latin, and other languages: With special reference to biological terms and scientific names","description":"How to use this dictionary; Dictionary of word roots and combining forms; Formulation of scientific names; Trasliteration of greek words; Some common combining forms.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Qd5qAAAAMAAJ&dq=Dictionary+of+word+roots+and+combining+forms+compiled+from+the+Greek,+Latin,+and+other+languages:+With+special+reference+to+biological+terms+and+scientific+names&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What Is Life?","description":"Nobel laureate Erwin Schr?dinger's What is Life?, one of the great science classics of the twentieth century appears here together with Mind and Matter.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=dg2bYMwdaBwC&dq=What+Is+Life%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The plain guide to Universalism: Designed to lead inquirers to the belief of that doctrine, and believers to the practice of it","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wVU_AAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Solving language difficulties;: Remedial routines","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=RsgDAAAAMAAJ&dq=Solving+language+difficulties%3B:+Remedial+routines&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Manimekhalai: The Dancer With the Magic Bowl","description":"A second-century Tamil verse epic reflects the ancient culture of India in the story of a beautiful young dancer who abandons her future as a courtesan in order to dedicate her life to the pursuit of \\"the bright light of knowledge\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=wl7T45yhh1sC&dq=Manimekhalai:+The+Dancer+With+the+Magic+Bowl&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How did they die?","description":"As the Washington Commanders step into a new era, celebrate the franchise's full NFL history with this revised and updated guide!

The volume upon the towns of the South brought closely to view the cosmopolitan character of the population which has settled our continent to the South and Southwest of the Appalachian wall. The stories of Baltimore, Washington, Richmond, Charleston, Savannah, and St. Augustine bring into view widely-different origins, experiences, and interests along a single stretch of coast; while Mobile and New Orleans, Knoxville, Nashville, and Louisville, Vicksburg and Little Rock, are groups representing chapters in our history which appear to have but slight connection save in the view of those who have closely studied the mainsprings of American development. The present volume represents even a wider range of historical interest. The attentive reader will, however, discover that although these towns of the far-stretching trans-Alleghany region have sprung from curiously divergent beginnings, and are apparently incongruous in composition and in aims, there really is and has been much in common among them. In order to understand Western history, one must first have knowledge of the details of the titanic struggle for settlement in North America, made respectively by Spain, France, and England. The early decline of Spanish power north of the Red and the Arkansas, save for the later temporary holding of Louisiana; the protracted tragedy which ended on the Plains of Abraham in the Fall of New France; the Revolution of the English colonists, and its portentous results; the Louisiana Purchase of 1803; the Mexican War, the episode of California, the story of Texas, with their consequent ousting of Spain from lands north of the Rio Grande and the Gila all these are factors bearing the closest relation to the history of the West, and consequently of many of the historic towns whose stories have been grouped within these covers. With these episodes of national rivalry, and consequent diplomacy and war, were intimately concerned the French fur-trade outposts of Detroit, Mackinac, Vincennes, and St. Louis, links in the forted chain which bound Canada and Louisiana, and by means of which it was sought to form a barrier against the Westward growth of the English colonies; also the Spanish stations of San Francisco, Monterey, Los Angeles, and Santa F , which were at once political vantage points and mission seats, for the spread of Spanish power and civilization from Mexico, among the brown barbarians of the North. St. Louis experienced both French and Spanish r gimes, while Mackinac, Detroit, and Vincennes were much affected by the period of English occupancy. As settlement grew upon the Atlantic coast, the English frontier was inevitably pushed farther and farther from tidewater. The hunter followed his game westward; so the forest trader, seeking the ever-receding camps of the aborigines, and, in due course, the raiser of cattle, horses, and swine who needed fresh pastures for his herds as tillage steadily encroached upon the wild lands of the border. At first timorously occupying the valleys and foothills of the eastern slopes, hunter, trader, and grazier, each in his turn, cautiously followed buffalo traces and Indian war-paths over the crest of the great range, and hailed with glee waters descending into the mysterious West. Not less formidable than the barriers reared by nature were those interposed by the savage, who with dismay saw his hunting grounds fast dwindling under the sway of the land-grabbing English; and by the jealous machinations of the military agents and fur traders of New France, who brooked no rivalry in their commercial exploitation of the forest.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=I0g0AueXMPoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Essence of the Gnostics","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3aX5MAAACAAJ&dq=The+Essence+of+the+Gnostics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gathering the Sun / Recogiendo El Sol Un Abecedar: An Alphabet in Spanish and English","description":"A book of poems about working in the fields and nature's bounty, one for each letter of the Spanish alphabet.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-C4IAAAACAAJ&dq=Gathering+the+Sun+/+Recogiendo+El+Sol+Un+Abecedar:+An+Alphabet+in+Spanish+and+English&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Precalculus: Functions and graphs","description":"The latest edition of Swokowski and Cole's PRECALCULUS: FUNCTIONS AND GRAPHS retains the elements that have made it so popular with instructors and students alike: clear exposition, an appealing and uncluttered layout, and applications-rich exercise sets.

Here for the first time is a SEAL insider s battle history of these Special Operations warriors in the war on terrorism.  Down range  is what SEALs in Afghanistan and Iraq call their area of operations. In this new mode of warfare,  down range  can refer to anything from tracking roving bands of al-Qaeda on a remote mountain trail in Afghanistan to taking down an armed compound in Tikrit and rousting holdouts from Saddam Hussein s regime. It could mean interdicting insurgents smuggling car-bomb explosives over the Iraqi-Syrian border or silently boarding a freighter on the high seas at night to enforce an embargo. In other words,  down range  could be anywhere, anytime, under any conditions. In Down Range, author Dick Couch, himself a former Navy SEAL and CIA case officer, uses his unprecedented access to bring the reader firsthand accounts from the warriors in combat during key missions in Afghanistan and Iraq. Couch creates a pulse-pounding, detailed narrative of the definitive engagements of this war, while painting an unusually intimate portrait of these warriors in the field. The performance of the SEALs in difficult, changing environments in the heat of the Afghan desert, in the snow-packed Hindu Kush, on the high seas, and in the urban chaos of Baghdad has been nothing short of extraordinary. The SEALs, coordinating with other American forces, the CIA, and foreign special operations units like the Polish GROM, have once more shown their genius for improvisation and capacity for courageous action in leading the fight against this new and vicious enemy. The first battle history of its kind, Down Range is a riveting close-up of some of America s finest warriors in action against a deadly foe.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eqYNOg-HWR0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"This Enemy Town: A Hannah Ives Mystery (Hannah Ives Mysteries)","description":"Hannah Ives is always ready to support others like herself who have been through the gauntlet of fear and uncertainty that a diagnosis of cancer often brings.

These cars use antiquated equipment that includes drum brakes, breaker points ignition systems, and 14-inch steel wheels. The OEM running gear is obsolete by today s standards but all of these Mustangs can turn into high-performance street machines that can compete with late-model Mustangs. While certain special-build and high-performance models should be preserved, many common V-8 Mustangs can be transformed into high-performance cars that rival the new cars of today. The Mustang can be upgraded and modified into a true driving machine by installing aftermarket suspension, steering, and driveline technology. Mustang expert and former Ford engineer Frank Bohanan explains how to perform simple and important bolt-on upgrades that radically increase performance. He explains the rationale and process of installing a crate engine, big high-performance brake kits, coil-over shocks, tubular A-arms, multi-link rear suspension, and many other projects that increase performance by leaps and bounds. From mild to wild, you are shown how to upgrade each component group in the car by stages according to budget and difficulty. These components include engine, transmission, rear differential, front suspension, rear suspension, steering, chassis, electrics, interior, tires, wheels, and more. By completing these procedures and product installs, you can complete an improved street car, a high-performance street car, or a street/track-day car. No other book provides the same level of information and instruction for transforming the first-generation Mustang into a car that performs with the best on the road today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=NJiiAgAAQBAJ&dq=Mustang+1964-1/2-1973&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Solar Cooling for Buildings (Workshop proceedings, February 6-8, 1974 Los Angeles, CA)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GsSXpjnXpFgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Roadkill Diaries: Strange Tales from Key West and Beyond","description":"Heavy drinking, casual sex with tourist girls, crazed behavior at Jimmy Buffett concerts, stolen Conch Trains filled with drunken ministers and strippers careening down A1A in the middle of the night, bizarre articles appearing in The KEY WEST CITIZENSas aCrime Reporta section, and much more.

Here leadership scholar Jean Lipman-Blumen explains what makes the followers tick, exploring why people will tolerate--and remain loyal to--leaders who are destructive to their organizations, their employees, or their nations. Why do we knowingly follow, seldom unseat, frequently prefer, and sometimes even create toxic leaders? Lipman-Blumen argues that these leaders appeal to our deepest needs, playing on our anxieties and fears, on our yearnings for security, high self-esteem, and significance, and on our desire for noble enterprises and immortality. She also explores how followers inadvertently keep themselves in line by a set of insidious control myths that they internalize. For example, the belief that the leader must necessarily be in a position to \\"know more\\" than the followers often stills their objections. In addition, outside forces--such as economic depressions, political upheavals, or a crisis in a company--can increase our anxiety and our longing for charismatic leaders. Lipman-Blumen shows how followers can learn critical lessons for the future and survive in the meantime. She discusses how to confront, reform, undermine, blow the whistle on, or oust a toxic leader. And she suggests how we can diminish our need for strong leaders, identify \\"reluctant leaders\\" among competent followers, and even nurture the leader within ourselves. Toxic leaders charm, manipulate, mistreat, weaken, and ultimately devastate their followers. The Allure of Toxic Leaders tells us how to recognize these leaders before it's too late.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ttklIpRQxsQC&dq=Allure.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Your erroneous zones","description":"THE RECORD-BREAKING, #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER  OVER 35 MILLION COPIES SOLD The first book by Wayne Dyer, author of the multimillion-copy bestseller Pulling Your Own Strings and national bestsellers There s a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem and Wisdom of the Ages, a positive and practical guide to breaking free from the trap of negative thinking and enjoying life to the fullest.

But the idea that the earth has a hollow interior was first proposed as a scientific theory in 1691 by Sir Edmond Halley (of comet fame), who suggested that there might be life down there as well. Hollow Earth traces the surprising, marvelous, and just plain weird permutations his ideas have taken over the centuries. From science fiction to utopian societies and even religions, Hollow Earth travels through centuries and cultures, exploring how each era's relationship to the idea of a hollow earth mirrored its hopes, fears, and values. Illustrated with everything from seventeenth-century maps to 1950s pulp art to movie posters and more, Hollow Earth is for anyone interested in the history of strange ideas that just won't go away.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=l8xjswEACAAJ&dq=Hollow+Earth&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Colloquial Swedish Cassette Ed (Colloquial Series)","description":"Colloquial Swedish provides a step-by-step course in Swedish as it is written and spoken today.

In the course of six months in 1961, four hundred and fifty Freedom Riders expanded the realm of the possible in American politics, redefining the limits of dissent and setting the stage for the civil rights movement. In this new version of his encyclopedic Freedom Riders, Raymond Arsenault offers a significantly condensed and tautly written account. With characters and plot lines rivaling those of the most imaginative fiction, this is a tale of heroic sacrifice and unexpected triumph. Arsenault recounts how a group of volunteers--blacks and whites--came together to travel from Washington DC through the Deep South, defying Jim Crow laws in buses and terminals and putting their lives on the line for racial justice. News photographers captured the violence in Montgomery, shocking the nation and sparking a crisis in the Kennedy administration. Here are the key players--their fears and courage, their determination and second thoughts, and the agonizing choices they faced as they took on Jim Crow--and triumphed.

The information is largely about the makeup of the human, where man comes from, what becomes of him; it explains what thinking is; it tells how a thought is created, and how thoughts are exteriorized into acts, objects and events, and how they make his destiny. Destiny is thus shown to be self-determined by thinking; and the process of re-existence and the after-death states are told in detail. A single reading of any one chapter of Thinking and Destiny brings rich rewards in new understanding of life\`s puzzling mysteries. To read the entire book is to come nearer to knowledge of one\`s destiny and how to shape it than is possible through study of anything previously written in the English language. Both the casually curious glancer at books and the most avid seeker for knowledge will be intrigued by the index, which lists more than 400 subjects in Thinking and Destiny, and by the fifteen chapter headings in the Table of Contents, which identify the 156 sections. The Foreword contains the only pages in which Mr. Percival uses the first personal pronoun.

The constitutionalization of rights and the establishment of judicial review are widely believed to have benevolent and progressive origins, and significant redistributive, power-diffusing consequences. Ran Hirschl challenges this conventional wisdom. Drawing upon a comprehensive comparative inquiry into the political origins and legal consequences of the recent constitutional revolutions in Canada, Israel, New Zealand, and South Africa, Hirschl shows that the trend toward constitutionalization is hardly driven by politicians' genuine commitment to democracy, social justice, or universal rights. Rather, it is best understood as the product of a strategic interplay among hegemonic yet threatened political elites, influential economic stakeholders, and judicial leaders. This self-interested coalition of legal innovators determines the timing, extent, and nature of constitutional reforms. Hirschl demonstrates that whereas judicial empowerment through constitutionalization has a limited impact on advancing progressive notions of distributive justice, it has a transformative effect on political discourse. The global trend toward juristocracy, Hirschl argues, is part of a broader process whereby political and economic elites, while they profess support for democracy and sustained development, attempt to insulate policymaking from the vicissitudes of democratic politics.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sv0nvGmUQHkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pokemon Ruby & Sapphire Official Trainer's Guide","description":"Relive your adventures in Hoenn or start a brand new journey with this re-imagining of a much-loved game.

Mechanics not only is the oldest branch of physics but was and still is the basis for all of theoretical physics. Quantum mechanics can hardly be understood, perhaps cannot even be formulated, without a good kno- edge of general mechanics. Field theories such as electrodynamics borrow their formal framework and many of their building principles from mechanics. In short, throughout the many modern developments of physics where one frequently turns back to the principles of classical mechanics its model character is felt. For this reason it is not surprising that the presentation of mechanics re?ects to some - tent the development of modern physics and that today this classical branch of theoretical physics is taught rather differently than at the time of Arnold S- merfeld, in the 1920s, or even in the 1950s, when more emphasis was put on the theoryandtheapplicationsofpartial-differentialequations. Today, symmetriesand invariance principles, the structure of the spacetime continuum, and the geom- rical structure of mechanics play an important role. The beginner should realize that mechanics is not primarily the art of describing block-and-tackles, collisions of billiard balls, constrained motions of the cylinder in a washing machine, or - cycle riding.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=yUDo7VptDgIC&dq=Mechanics:+From+Newton%27s+Laws+to+Deterministic+Chaos&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Start & Manage a Wheelchair Transportation Business","description":"This self-study course has been written for those who are considering starting their own business or have recently done so.

So we made it a trilogy: Markov Chains Brownian Motion and Diffusion Approximating Countable Markov Chains familiarly - MC, B & D, and ACM. I wrote the first two books for beginning graduate students with some knowledge of probability; if you can follow Sections 10.4 to 10.9 of Markov Chains you're in. The first two books are quite independent of one another, and completely independent of the third. This last book is a monograph which explains one way to think about chains with instantaneous states. The results in it are supposed to be new, except where there are specific disclaim ers; it's written in the framework of Markov Chains. Most of the proofs in the trilogy are new, and I tried hard to make them explicit. The old ones were often elegant, but I seldom saw what made them go.

I was like, Holy Shit, this is it, I'm entering a combat zone. Cool!' At twenty-six Colby Buzzell, unemployed and living at home, decided to join the US Army. Within months he was in Iraq, a machine gunner in the controversial Stryker Brigade Combat Team, an army unit on the cutting edge of combat technology and the first of its kind. Trapped amid 'guerrilla warfare, urban-style' in Mosul, Iraq, Buzzell was struck by the bizarre and often frightening world surrounding him. He began writing a blog describing the war - not as being reported by CNN or official briefings - but as experienced by the soldier on the ground. His story is a brutally honest and hard-hitting account of the absurdities of modern war. These are the real stories of the war: a firefight where the resistance came from 'men in black'; a night spent chain-smoking in the guard tower counting the tracer bullets being fired over the city; and the hesitation of a young soldier who had been passed around from platoon to platoon because he was too afraid to fight.

Nearly a year later, his drunken promise returns to haunt him. A reluctant Barley is quickly trained by British Intelligence and sent to Moscow to liaise with a go-between, the beautiful Katya. Both are lonely and disillusioned. Each is increasingly certain that if the human race is to have any future, all must betray their countries ...

Robert W. Smith's Martial Musings stands out as the sole literary work which offers readers a special perspective of martial arts as they evolved during the 20th century. Smith personally escorts the reader on a martial arts tour. He starts with his own initial involvement in the arts, then launches outward, across the nation, over to Asia, and eventually home again. Some of the topics covered in the book include martial arts theory and practice, portrayals of leading Asian instructors, profiles of Westerners who studied the arts and brought them back to their respective countries and an historical record of the evolution of fighting arts in the West. Martial Musings represents the fourteenth book Smith has written on the subject and is a broader, somewhat historical, semi-autobiographical commentary on martial arts in the 20th century. But, what makes this book such a joy to devour is the literary relish Smith stir-fries in with the books basic ingredients. He astutely couples combatives with literary panache, and a ready wit. In short, Martial Musings introduces the reader to the individuals who shaped martial arts in the 20th century. The hardbound book has 398 pages and over 300 illustrations with a full-color cover and two-color text pages.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kz8QEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The all new teach yourself to knit (Leisure arts)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=RVUlGQAACAAJ&dq=The+all+new+teach+yourself+to+knit+(Leisure+arts)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"101 Great Ideas for Introducing Key Concepts in Mathematics: A Resource for Secondary School Teachers","description":"Invigorate instruction and engage students with this updated treasure trove of 114 ready-to-use techniques compiled by two of the greatest minds in mathematics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2Em2rlclQisC&dq=101+Great+Ideas+for+Introducing+Key+Concepts+in+Mathematics:+A+Resource+for+Secondary+School+Teachers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The International Marine Log Book","description":"Essential for all vessels who wish to enter an Emission Control Area, are at berth in a United Kingdom port, or a UK passenger ship operating in UK waters and controlled waters or any other passenger ship which calls at a port in the UK.

It has its historic and its prehistoric era. In its historic era, it can be traced through various antecedent associations, similar in design and organization, to a comparatively remote period. Its connection with these associations can be established by authentic documents and by other evidence, which no historian would reject. For the prehistoric era we no longer treat of Freemasonry under its present organization, which we know did not exist in those days, but of a science peculiar, and peculiar only, to the Mysteries and to Freemasonry, a science which we may call Masonic symbolism, and which constituted the very heartblood of the ancient and the modern institutions, and gave to them, while presenting a dissimilarity of form, an identity of spirit. Every human institution is subject to great and numerous variations; the different aspects under which they appear, and the principles by which they are governed, depend on the advance of civilization, the nature of the protecting government, and the habits and opinions of the members themselves. The triumph of mind over matter was the great feat of the first architects, who were also the first natural philosophers. There is no speculation in the statement that these formed themselves into an association for improvement at an early date; and tradition informs us that this union of scientific men differed from the Freemasons of today in little more than in name. In Freemasonry, we see the important lesson of eternal life, taught by a legend, which, whether true or false, is used in Masonry as a symbol and allegory. But, whence came this legend? Did all lineal sources have this legend? The evidence is that they did. The connection of the Knights Templar with the Freemasons may much more plausibly be traced than that of the Knights of Malta. Yet the sources from which information is to be derived are for the most part traditionary; authentic dates and documents are wanting.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=4ZTKjgEACAAJ&dq=Origin+of+Freemasonry+and+Knight+Templar&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Begin My Life All Over : The Hmong and the American Immigrant Experience","description":"Records the stories of thirty-six Hmong immigrants who came to California, showing how their traditional ways have been replaced by the American way of life","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=xXV2AAAAMAAJ&dq=I+Begin+My+Life+All+Over+:+The+Hmong+and+the+American+Immigrant+Experience&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thailand: A Quick Guide to Customs & Etiquette (Culture Smart!)","description":"Culture Smart! is a new series of travel guides written for the traveler on the go.

In this book the author argues that our ability to use a wide array of emotions evolved long before spoken language and, in fact, constituted a preadaptation for the speech and culture that developed among later hominids. Long before humans could speak with words, they communicated through body language their emotional dispositions; and it is the neurological wiring of the brain for these emotional languages that represented the key evolutionary breakthrough for our species. How did natural selection work on the basic ape anatomy and neuroanatomy to create the hominid line? The author suggests that what distinguished our ancestors from other apes was the development of an increased capacity for sociality and organization, crucial for survival on the African savanna. All apes display a propensity for weak ties, individualism, mobility, and autonomy that was, and is today, useful in arboreal and woodland habitats but served them poorly when our ancestors began to move onto the African plain during the late Miocene. The challenge for natural selection was to enhance traits in the species that would foster the social ties necessary for survival in the new environment. The author suggests that the result was a development of certain areas of the primate brain that encouraged strong emotional ties, allowing our ancestors to build higher levels of social solidarity. Our basic neurological wiring continues to reflect this adaptive development. From a sociological perspective that is informed by evolutionary biology, primatology, and neurology, the book examines the current neurological bases of our emotional repertoire and their implications for our social actions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=aEeSmDRsXkcC&dq=On+the+Origins+of+Human+Emotions:+A+Sociological+Inquiry+into+the+Evolution+of+Human+Affect&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Buffalo Medicine","description":"\\"This vibrant book of wonders speaks true and dreams deep.

In these and other venues, authenticity is considered the best way to distinguish the real from the phony, the genuine from the fake. But in Real Black, John L. Jackson Jr. proposes a new model for thinking about these issues--racial sincerity. Jackson argues that authenticity caricatures identity as something imposed on people, imprisoning them within stereotypes--turning them into racial objects and inanimate things, instead of living, breathing human beings. Contending that such assumptions deny people agency--not to mention humanity--in their search for identity, Jackson counterposes sincerity, an internal and more productive analytical model for thinking about race. Moving in and around Harlem and Brooklyn, Jackson offers a kaleidoscope of subjects and stories that directly and indirectly address how race is negotiated in today's world--including tales of name-changing hip-hop emcees, book-vending numerologists, urban conspiracy theorists, corrupt police officers, mixed-race neo-Nazis, and high-school gospel choirs forbidden to catch the Holy Ghost. Enlisting \\"Anthroman,\\" his cape-crusading critical alter ego, Jackson records and retells these interconnected sagas in virtuosic detail and, in the process, shows us how race is defined and debated, imposed and confounded every single day.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FpIGAyGvZiUC&dq=Real+Black:+Adventures+in+Racial+Sincerity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pip the Penguin: Say Cheese, Please!","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=oEFWMwEACAAJ&dq=Pip+the+Penguin:+Say+Cheese,+Please!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The American Marathon (Sports and Entertainment)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Lx2VtQEACAAJ&dq=The+American+Marathon+(Sports+and+Entertainment)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Brazilian Trees: A Guide to the Cultivation and Identification of Brazilian Trees - Vol. 01","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1ypFAQAAIAAJ&dq=Brazilian+Trees:+A+Guide+to+the+Cultivation+and+Identification+of+Brazilian+Trees+-+Vol.+01&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mayflower: The Voyage That Changed the World","description":"Discover the real history behind Thanksgiving and follow the Pilgrims' famous voyage to the Americas in this beautifully illustrated non-fiction storybook for kids.

Surveying its development from 1874 to 1954, Netz describes its use to control cattle during the colonization of the American West and to control people in Nazi concentration camps and the Russian Gulag. Physical control over space was no longer symbolic after 1874. This is a history told from the perspective of its victims. With vivid examples of the interconnectedness of humans, animals, and the environment, this dramatic account of barbed wire presents modern history through the lens of motion being prevented. Drawing together the history of humans and animals, Netz delivers a compelling new perspective on the issues of colonialism, capitalism, warfare, globalization, violence, and suffering. Theoretically sophisticated but written with a broad readership in mind, Barbed Wire calls for nothing less than a reconsideration of modernity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=TQN-tI2Aa6MC&dq=Barbed+wire&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sarah's Quilt: A Novel of Sarah Agnes Prine and the Arizona Territories, 1906","description":"Sarah's Quilt, the long-awaited sequel to These Is My Words, continues the dramatic story of Sarah Agnes Prine.

Morse theory was developed in the 1920s by mathematician Marston Morse. (Morse was on the faculty of the Institute for Advanced Study, and Princeton published his Topological Methods in the Theory of Functions of a Complex Variable in the Annals of Mathematics Studies series in 1947.) One classical application of Morse theory includes the attempt to understand, with only limited information, the large-scale structure of an object. This kind of problem occurs in mathematical physics, dynamic systems, and mechanical engineering. Morse theory has received much attention in the last two decades as a result of a famous paper in which theoretical physicist Edward Witten relates Morse theory to quantum field theory. Milnor was awarded the Fields Medal (the mathematical equivalent of a Nobel Prize) in 1962 for his work in differential topology. He has since received the National Medal of Science (1967) and the Steele Prize from the American Mathematical Society twice (1982 and 2004) in recognition of his explanations of mathematical concepts across a wide range of scienti.c disciplines. The citation reads, \\"The phrase sublime elegance is rarely associated with mathematical exposition, but it applies to all of Milnor's writings. Reading his books, one is struck with the ease with which the subject is unfolding and it only becomes apparent after re.ection that this ease is the mark of a master.' Milnor has published five books with Princeton University Press.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=A9QZZ3S_QxwC&dq=Morse+theory+(Annals+of+mathematics+studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Place to Call Home","description":" Rarely will a book touch your heart like A Place to Call Home.

Phthor is the sequel to Chthon, less intricately structured and less complicated in plot, but still quite dark and ugly in theme and detail. Rather than flashbacks and flash-forwards, it has a Y outline, with the stem the initial story and the ends alternate futures, neither of which is acceptable to Aton s son Arlo. Arlo has his own encounter with a Minionette, and naturally, destruction is upon him and all with whom he associates. Writer and editor Charles Platt was so impressed with the chthonic setting that he wrote two additional sequels, Plasm and Soma, which are even darker and grimmer.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=88KmAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Classic Popeye Comic: Hospitality and Recreation Careers","description":"New York magazine was born in 1968 after a run as an insert of the New York Herald Tribune and quickly made a place for itself as the trusted resource for readers across the country.

After sketching the main features of each medieval age, he deals in greater detail with the Papacy, the relations between Rome and her rival Constantinople, the bishops and archbishops, and the various religious orders, providing in all a superb history of the period.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FIJPEAAAQBAJ&dq=WESTERN+SOCIETY+AND+THE+CHURCH+IN+THE+MIDDLE+AGES&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shall We Gather at the Garden?","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=q14PAAAACAAJ&dq=Shall+We+Gather+at+the+Garden%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Selected writings of Guillaume Apollinaire (A New Directions book.

It seemed foolhardy; even everybody knows you can't win the war on crime. But Bratton delivered. In an extraordinary twenty-seven months, serious crime in New York City went down by 33 percent, the murder rate was cut in half--and Bill Bratton was heralded as the most charismatic and respected law enforcement official in America.. In this outspoken account of his news-making career, Bratton reveals how his cutting-edge policing strategies brought about the historic reduction in crime. Bratton's success made national news and landed him on the cover of Time. It also landed him in political hot water. Bratton earned such positive press that before he'd completed his first week on the job, the administration of New York's media-hungry mayor Rudolph Giuliani, threatened to fire him. Bratton gives a vivid, behind-the-scenes look at the sizzle and substance, and he pulls no punches describing the personalities who really run the city. Bratton grew up in a working-class Boston neighborhood, always dreaming of being a cop. As a young officer under Robert di Grazia, Boston's progressive police commissioner, he got a ground-level view of real police reform and also saw what happens when an outspoken, dynamic, reform-minded police commissioner starts to outshine an ambitious mayor. He was soon in the forefront of the community policing movement and a rising star in the profession. Bratton had turned around four major police departments when he accepted the number one police job in America. When Bratton arrived at the NYPD, New York's Finest were almost hiding; they had given up on preventing crime and were trying only to respond to it. Narcotics, Vice, Auto Theft, and the Gun Squads all worked banker's hours while the competition--the bad guys--worked around the clock. Bratton changed that. He brought talent to the top and instilled pride in the force; he listened to the people in the neighborhoods and to the cops on the street. Bratton and his \\"dream team\\" created Compstat, a combination of computer statistics analysis and an unwavering demand for accountability. Cops were called on the carpet, and crime began to drop. With Bratton on the job, New York City was turned around. Today, New York's plummeting crime rate and improved quality of life remain a national success story. Bratton is directly responsible, and his strategies are being studied and implemented by police forces across the country and around the world. In Turnaround, Bratton shows how the war on crime can be won once and for all.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ns7GAZcA9AYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Calvin and Augustine","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=As2g2tZenlgC&dq=Calvin+and+Augustine&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"LET'S REVIEW: CHEMISTRY -- THE PHYSICAL SETTING","description":"Let's Review Chemistry covers all high school-level chemistry topics and includes: A topic review covering atomic structure, chemical formulas and equations, the mathematics of chemistry, thermochemistry and thermodynamics, the phases of matter, chemical periodicity, chemical bonding, and much more New practice and review questions with answers Two recent New York State Regents exams with answers","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=4l5xnQAACAAJ&dq=LET%27S+REVIEW:+CHEMISTRY+--+THE+PHYSICAL+SETTING&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Glory: Experiencing the Atmosphere of Heaven","description":"If you can capture the basic principles of Praise, Worship, and Glory which are outlined in this book--so simple that we often miss them--you can have anything else you want in God.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=huKiPAAACAAJ&dq=Glory:+Experiencing+the+Atmosphere+of+Heaven&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tai Chi Chuan: Roots and Branches (TUTTLE)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=bheGzQEACAAJ&dq=Tai+Chi+Chuan:+Roots+and+Branches+(TUTTLE)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Between War and Peace: Lessons from Afghanistan to Iraq","description":"In his acclaimed collection An Autumn of War, the scholar and military historian Victor Davis Hanson expressed powerful and provocative views of September 11 and the ensuing war in Afghanistan. Now, in these challenging new essays, he examines the world s ongoing war on terrorism, from America to Iraq, from Europe to Israel, and beyond. In direct language, Hanson portrays an America making progress against Islamic fundamentalism but hampered by the self-hatred of elite academics at home and the cynical self-interest of allies abroad. He sees a new and urgent struggle of evil against good, one that can fail only if  we convince ourselves that our enemies fight because of something we, rather than they, did.  Whether it s a clear-cut defense of Israel as a secular democracy, a denunciation of how the U.N. undermines the U.S., a plea to drastically alter our alliance with Saudi Arabia, or a perception that postwar Iraq is reaching a dangerous tipping point, Hanson s arguments have the shock of candor and the fire of conviction.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=daMLOWN_30UC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"20 Over 40","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=KyBJ2sdqgBsC&dq=20+Over+40&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Love's Wild Desire","description":"Catherine Mayfield, a cold, aristocratic, New Orleans beauty, learns the overwhelming power of her passions in the arms of a ruthless pirate","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=nSLhHlesLi0C&dq=Love%27s+Wild+Desire&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Signs and Relics","description":"Russia's forgotten world of avant-garde public signage--the latest in Fuel's collectible Soviet series For this volume, French photographer Jason Guilbeau has used Google Street View to virtually navigate Russia and the former USSR, searching for examples of a forgotten Soviet empire. The subjects of these unlikely photographs are incidental to the purpose of Google Street View--captured by serendipity, rather than design, they are accorded a common vernacular. Once found, Guilbeau strips the images of their practical use by removing the navigational markers, transforming them according to his own vision. From remote rural roadsides to densely populated cities, the photographs reveal traces of history in plain sight: a brutalist hammer and sickle stands in a remote field; a jet fighter is anchored to the ground by its concrete exhaust plume; a skeletal tractor sits on a cast-iron platform; a village sign resembles a constructivist sculpture. Passersby seem oblivious to these objects. Relinquished by the present they have become part of the composition of everyday life, too distant in time and too ubiquitous in nature to be recorded by anything other than an indiscriminate automaton. This collection of photographs portrays a surreal reality: it is a document of a vanishing era, captured by an omniscient technology that is continually deleting and replenishing itself--an inadvertent definition of Russia today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jtv9yQEACAAJ&dq=Signs+and+Relics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"English-Tagalog dictionary","description":"Tuttle Pocket Tagalog Dictionary is the most up-to-date Tagalog pocket dictionary available.
