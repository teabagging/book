I carted it around with my other favorite novels through numerous moves, a marriage, some children, etc. I don't read it all the time, as it's just one of the hundred or so books that I've also carted around while additions to the collection were made.So, I read it again this week and had to ask myself: Why did I carry this with me for so long?I know I liked it when I first read it. I liked the whole series, I think. Garwood does fill a book with sufficient plot, characters and action. But now I'm older and have found the one I want to spend my life with and have opinions about the type of men I'd want my daughters to meet. I find now that I hate the hero and heroine of this book.Like some of the other Garwood books I recently re-read, this book has a Lout for a hero and an Air Head for a heroine. Sure the heroine is supposed to be intelligent and organized. But her expressions, her pushover personality, her incredible \\"innocence\\" just translates into an Air Head who might as well be a beautiful blow up doll that the hero pulls around on a string like a floating balloon. Her convent background is supposed to also explain some of her character but.. Nevermind, I find her so boring I can't even stand to go on. The Lout comes from the venerable background of glowering super-handsome actions-speak-louder-than-words Heroes who works for the government and is too uber macho to listen to anything a woman has to say or admit he loves her. Every time she starts to say something remotely relevant he decides to have sex with her to stop her talking. Oh, isn't that what happened? Maybe it just seemed that way. Curiously, the hero is described as the charming one in other books of this series and yet there's not a drop of charm in his dealings with the heroine.So, I ended up hoping the serial killer got them both. Just for a change of pace. Then I got to the end. Damn."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"I've read several of Julie Garwood's books and really enjoyed them. Castles had a lot of potential, but it fell short in my estimation. It was almost as if she was writing two books simultaneously, and got mixed up. I felt the dialogue was not period appropriate. Colin used words like: Yeah, Sure, and baby quite a bit during the middle part of the book. This type of dialogue/writing then disappears. In a modern setting, I have no problem with that type of speech. For a story set in the early 1800's it seems quite out of context.Another nitpick I have about the story, is how the plot line changed. At first it was mystery killer's partner and his daughter who were killed. Then at the end, it was a Frenchman and his sister who were killed. Once again it seemed like she had two books going at the same time. I also found the description of the last murder rather disturbing.Seeing the murderer's thoughts was a plot device similar to one used in The Bride. I thought it was used to better advantage in that book.Colin tended to be very overbearing, more than I would have expected, and Alesandra kept flip flopping. She would be intelligent and strong, and then become an airhead.For the most part I really enjoyed the book, but the discrepancies mentioned above cut into my enjoyment. The book just didn't seem to flow as well as most of the others I've read by this author, and it just seemed rather disjointed and somewhat lacking, which is a shame, since I felt the story had a fair amount of potential."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"I purchased Castles a couple years ago and have read it at least 2 more times since. Its a great story, funny, intriguing and romantic, and I like the hero especially. The heroine is a tad too naive for my taste, but still, she is smart and often flippant and clever when dealing with her husband (which is when I liked her best) and I liked their chemistry. While not one of the very best books I've ever read, it certainly is in the very top tier of outstanding historical romances. If Amazon allowed it, I would give this story 4.5 stars . . .What's compelling me to write this review, however, is that finally a few weeks ago I found a copy of the Lyon's Lady at the library, read it and then went on to read the rest of the series in order, including, once again, Castles. Of the four, the Lyon's Lady is tied with Castles as the best of the series -- they each deserve 4.5 stars. The weakest is probably The Gift (3 stars). Guardian Angel (4 stars) was good, but was similar enough to Lyon's Lady in terms of the dynamics between the leads and the temperaments of the hero and heroine, that it got a bit boring. Overall, the series comes in at 4 stars.I somewhat disagree with those who say you need to read the other books first in order to best enjoy Castles. This is my 4th reading but first time with some knowledge of prior characters, and that didn't really change anything for me. Furthermore, the leads of Lyon's Lady are mentioned but once in this book, in a very ancillary and irrelevant way. The leads of the other two stories (Caine & Jade and Nathan & Sara) were mentioned quite a bit, especially Caine & Jade, and I suppose the Castles story was a bit richer reading this time around already knowing something about Caine and Colin's relationship and family. However, don't worry too much if you haven't read the other three when deciding whether to pick this one up or not. Its definitely worth reading all on its own."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"The fourth book in the series tells the wonderfully warm story of Caine's brother Colin and Princess Alesandra. Although not my favorite book in the series (Lion's Lady is my favorite followed by The Gift) I still couldn't put it down.Though this book CAN be read on it's own, I do recommend that you read the other three before you delve into this one as characters mentioned in Castles are revisted from the previous books."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"Julie Garwood is a very popular romance writer. Many reviews I have seen for other books suggest this author, so I decided to give her a try. I guess I am in the minority on this one, because after reading this story and The Prize, I can honestly say that Garwood is not for me.To start out with, I don't find it romantic in the least to have the hero treat the heroine like a child. This is a regency novel and it being such, I know the husband had the right to order the wife around but this was a little extreme. It seems like every page the hero is telling the heroine what to do and what not to do and it seemed to get to the point where the poor couldn't do anything without giving him the ok. Even choose her own clothes.My second problem is that the heroine, Alesandra, behaves like an idiot the whole time. I think Garwood is trying to make her seem innocent, but she gave a different impression entirely. She comes off as dumb and childlike.Garwood just isn't for me. I can't believe she is so popular. Her work pales in comparison to authors like Mary Jo Putney, Lisa Kleypas, or Marsha Canham."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"Yeah, ok, so I expected a romance, but because it's from J.G., I also expected a bit of suspense, mystery. HOWEVER, since I'm such a little fraidy-cat, I am still a little afraid that Morgan's going to come get me. His death was too graphic. And I read it in the dead of night so that I could finish it in one day.But overall though, I thought it was a pretty nice book. I didn't give it 5 stars because the threat of the general could have been explained a bit more, expanded upon. Also, there were a lot of minute details that were never resolved nor was an explanation supplied.The part where Colin finds something wrong in everyone one of the guys on her list and then how he traps her into marriage...MUCHO HILAIROUS! My brother thought I was crazy, I couldn't stop laughing.All in all, a good book to read and I would read it again, but I'd skip over a quite a bit of pages."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"Loved it...almost thoroughly. Colin could have been less pigheaded, but otherwise his and Alessandra's interactions gave me chills. I definitely give it one thumb and half up:)"},{"Title":"Castles","review":"I was very disappointed by this novel. If I'd read it alone, maybe I would have liked it. But I read it as a continuation of the series. I was very upset that Nathan does not make an appearance until the end of the novel. I was also disturbed by the physical changes Garwood made in the other characters from previous novels. To me, it just isn't a sequel. Colin did not seem like himself. Even when viewing the book separate from the rest, the character of Alesandra is not fully fleshed out. Nor is the story believable. I didn't buy their romance for a minute. I can only recall a few memorable moments from this novel--one touching, one funny. This is definitely a novel to borrow but not to buy."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"I have become a great fan of her books. They read easily and floats through the pages effortlessly. The Castle is another one that is well-written, although the story is not anything unusual. Colin's objection is marrying the Princess is really quite funny at times. It is a good romance with predictable plot. I have also read 'guardian angel', Colin's brother Caine's story - I like that a little better since it has more surprises than this one, but still enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"Castles was the third Julie Garwood book that I read and I felt slightly let down halfway through. Colin seemed like a jerk throughout most of the book and all of a sudden, he does a complete 360 and becomes a loving husband. I usually like the picture the characters in my head as I read, but with Colin and Alesandra, I just couldn't see them in my mind. And the parts with the murderer's thoughts were just lame! Overall, the book was good, but not what I expected after The Secret and The Prize."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"I LOVED the characters! Julie brought each character to life, especially Colin and Alesandra. I feel like I know them personally.....truly, I will miss them. Don't pass by this book, it's a really good one!"},{"Title":"Castles","review":"I really enjoyed these books about Caine and Jade, Sara and Nathan, and now Alessandra and Colin. All were delightful and very highly recommended, just as I would recommend any other Julie Garwood book. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Castles","review":"I loved the story of Colin,younger brother to Cain. The story was nicely done and the characters well developed. This was one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"I ordered this book recently on my Kindle. I had read it previously, of course, as I've read all her novels. I was very surprised when I started reading the Kindle version and noticed instead of the historical romance Castles, I was reading the contemporary romantic suspense Sweet Talk. I contacted Kindle customer support and found out that for some reason the exerpt from Sweet Talk is in front of the book instead of in the back. I had never encountered this before.So if you buy the Kindle version, be aware that Castles is actually there, just go to the table of contents and go to the prologue to skip the exerpt from Sweet Talk."},{"Title":"Near Santa Fe","review":"This started a little slow, but soon picked up after a few chapters. This is not really a mystery or detective novel, although it does have some of those elements. It will have a strong effect on the emotions of the reader.I tried to find out something about the author, Morgan Lane, but he/she seems to be as elusive as the famous painter who makes a brief appearance in this story."},{"Title":"We Are Not Alone: A Teenager Boy's Personal Account of Child Sexual Abuse from Disclosure Through Prosecution and Treatment","review":"Another P.O.V. story same genera as the others that have been published in recent years. Interesting focusing on the legal process of when a child/teen first disclose the abuse. A quick read good for those in the field or for teens to read.

By far, my favorite is on page 86, where an aged man has a young woman on his lap and looking at an aged woman who is giving him a stern look. All are angels and the man is saying, \\"Buzz off Louise! That was only till death us did part.\\" On page 45, an unhappy couple are in the office of a marriage counselor and the man says, \\"No heroic measures.\\" This is very funny stuff. I loved them all, love songs fill the airways, but the real world is much more like the messages in these cartoons."},{"Title":"The New Yorker Book of True Love Cartoons","review":"&quot;The New Yorker Book of True Love Cartoons&quot; brings together 102 pages of cartoons from 46 different artists. Each cartoonist is represented by 1 to 6 examples of his/her work. The artists include Charles Addams, Lee Lorenz, Victoria Roberts, William Steig, and others; because of this diversity of artists, the book has a good variety of drawing styles.Under the general topic of love, these cartoons cover such areas as sex, marriage, infidelity, jealousy, conflict, sexual politics, and miscommunication.A few of my favorites: A woman at a bar tells a man, &quot;If you quote Rilke again, I'm just going to have to take my bra off&quot; (p. 26). Wife to husband, at home: &quot;You may be from Mars, but the children and I are still from Westchester&quot; (27). Categories in a Valentine's Day cards rack: &quot;SWM TO SF,&quot; &quot;GBF TO SWF,&quot; &quot;DWM TO SGF&quot; (61). And finally, a man, fully dressed with a coat and tie, and a woman, stark naked, sit in chairs at home facing away from each other.

The title led me to expect heart-warming humor about love. Instead, what I got was mostly a series of cynical perspectives on infatuation gone wrong. As in some other New Yorker cartoon collections, this one also lacks an integrating essay. The drawings are often good, but the lines make these cartoons. I have included some to give you a flavor of the volume. If you are getting over a soured relationship, this book may help you to brighten up a bit.Older man, asleep in front of television set.

Get this book!"},{"Title":"The essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for corporate America","review":"In the first place, Lawrence Cunningham, whose school it turns out is just a couple blocks from me here in Manhattan, has done a very fine public service in collecting these essays. If you've ever tried to wade through Buffet's annual letters yourself, you know that there are long bits of detailed financial discussions interspersed with the gems of wisdom, aphorisms, and humor that the amateur Buffet-ette is more apt to be seeking. So his collection and coalition, which is well-chosen, well-ordered, and well-edited is a treat for any Buffet fan looking for an accessible volume of the man's work.Buffet has the strangest of powers in that he comes across as a homespun billionaire. Now that's different from just being homespun, the way Sam Walton was, or just being a billionaire, like Bill Gates. Buffet flaunts his wealth and his professional love of money, all the while expressing essential, eternal truths in simple, earthy phrases. When I saw Buffet speak at business school he tapped on the microphone to test it and said \\"testing, testing, one-million, two-million, three-million.\\" It is that natural genius for combining wealth, truth and comedy that is most vividly on display in \\"The Essays of Warren Buffet.\\".Of course, these timeless, simple truths are all known - the way we know that \\"eat less, exercise more\\" is how to lose weight. And yet, and yet, it takes Buffet to remind us to \\"think like an owner\\"; invest only in management that you \\"like, trust, and admire\\"; and buy pieces of business (stocks) when it costs less than the intrinsic value.There are the excellent statements of managerial accountability, business valuation, and capital structure. Helpful warnings on accounting shenanigans, trading costs, and paying heed to Mr. Market. For clarity, brevity, wit, truth, and learning, there is no business writer in the 20th century that compares with Warren Buffet.Buffet's sayings are irreplaceable (and I am not cherry picking here, but merely highlighting a half-dozen of the hundreds of bon mots in this book):\\"On the other hand, working with people who cause your stomach to churn seems much like marrying for money - probably a bad idea under any circumstances, but absolute madness if you are already rich.\\"\\"The speed at which a business success is recognized, furthermore, is not that important as long as the company's intrinsic value is increasing at a satisfactory rate. In fact, delayed recognition can be an advantage: It may give us the chance to buy more of a good thing at a bargain price.\\"\\"Just as work expands to fill available time, corporate projects or acquisitions will materialize to soak up available funds... any business craving of the leader, however foolish, will be quickly supported by detailed rate-of-return and strategic studies prepared by his troops\\"In regard to acquisitions, which usually fail to earn the cost of capital: \\"The managers at fault periodically report on the lesson they have learned from the latest disappointment. They then usually seek out future lessons.\\"\\"One of the ironies of the stock market is the emphasis on activity. Brokers, using terms such as \`marketability' and \`liquidity,\\" sing the praises of companies with high share turnover... but investors should understand that what is good for the croupier is not good for the customer. A hyperactive stock market is the pick pocket of enterprise.\\"On acquiring bad companies for cheap prices: \\"In my early days as a manager I, too, dated a few toads. They were cheap dates - I've never been much of a sport - but my results matched those of acquirers who courted higher-price toads. I kissed and they croaked.\\"Buffet is approaching literature here - the nuance involved, and the delicious counter-pointing of toads, dates, sport are pitch-perfect. The payoff - \\"I kissed and they croaked\\" is as fine a line of found poetry as exists.Buffet, having studied at the feet of the master of investment literature for the first half of the 20th century, has ascended to become the master of investment literature, unqualified. This is a book that will please Buffet-maniacs, investors, finance newbies, and anybody with an interest in the articulated evolution of managerial capitalism that has separated the finance and capital allocation specialties from the operational and day-to-day specializations.In closing, it's appropriate to quote America's great investing wag quoting America's greatest political wag - the subject is, as always with Buffet, simple maths and simple truths:\\"Managers thinking about accounting issues should never forget one of Abraham Lincoln's favorite riddles: \`How many legs does a dog have if you call his tail a leg?' The answer: \`Four, because calling a tail a leg does not make it a leg'.\\"Enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for corporate America","review":"For all of you investors who want to invest like Warren Buffett - that is, successfully - this is what you really want to read. There are a large and growing number of books out there that will claim to make you think/act/be like Buffett; here you can actually read his thoughts. As WB has often said, go to the source material (not the analyst reports, etc.) to make your judgments, and that is true in studying Buffett as well.On top of that, Buffett is a much better writer than most of his biographers. The editor of this compilation has done a good job of organizing Buffett's writings into themes with a light hand. You get a good idea of how Warren thinks.Buffett has an amazing way of penetrating the thick coating of B.S. that covers most of what passes for investment theory nowadays. He ruthlessly applies Ockham's Razor to cut things down to their essential truths; two of the most basic are that owning stock in a company is truly owning part of a business and that the future is full of uncertainty. Obvious, right? But, when you really absorb these concepts the answers to the questions of when and why you should buy a stock become much clearer. I won't attempt to boil down any more of his thoughts - you can find plenty of that elsewhere. Suffice it to say that, although I am a Chartered Financial Analyst and have advised others regarding investments for over 20 years, when reading this book I had many \\"V-8 moments\\" - where you want to slap yourself on the forehead and say \\"of course!\\"While I first heard of WB many years ago (before he was cool), this book was my first significant exposure to his writings. He writes well, with wit and wisdom, and makes fairly complex subjects amazingly accessible to the uninitiated. I wish I had read this book much earlier, but I'm not sure if I would have been mature enough to put much of it into action anyway.One thing to keep in mind when you hear about all the easy ways to make money from following charts, or are tempted to buy the latest idea emanating from your brother-in-law - or a talking head on CNBC: what Buffett does REALLY works. To put it crudely, it isn't an accident that he is, per Forbes, the 2nd richest man in the world - out of over 6 billion people. (I haven't seen any chartists make the list yet.) If you are really a serious investor, why would you NOT want to read what he has to say?However, I can tell you why you probably won't actually put into practice most of what he says - it's no fun! It's no fun (for most) reading 10-Ks and 10-Qs. It's no fun keeping your own council and avoiding the crowd. Also, why wait, perhaps for years, for the \\"fat pitch\\" of a great company at a great price when you can get your kicks day-trading? After all, if most people were willing to wait until the odds were truly in their favor before they risked their money, lotteries would disappear and Las Vegas would be a dusty little village. Even those who acknowledge Warren's achievements and study his words will find putting his seemingly obvious concepts into action surprisingly difficult.But that is how you actually earn the money.Finally, here's a story, retold by Buffett, that illustrates the herd mentality you must overcome to succeed. I quote:Ben Graham told a story 40 years ago that illustrates why investment professionals behave as they do: An oil prospector, moving to his heavenly reward, was met by St. Peter with bad news. \\"You're qualified for residence\\", said St. Peter, \\"but, as you can see, the compound reserved for oil men is packed. There's no way to squeeze you in.\\" After thinking a moment, the prospector asked if he might say just four words to the present occupants. That seemed harmless to St. Peter, so the prospector cupped his hands and yelled, \\"Oil discovered in hell.\\" Immediately the gate to the compound opened and all of the oil men marched out to head for the nether regions. Impressed, St. Peter invited the prospector to move in and make himself comfortable. The prospector paused. \\"No,\\" he said, \\"I think I'll go along with the rest of the boys. There might be some truth to that rumor after all.\\"-Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway Letter to Shareholders, 1985"},{"Title":"The essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for corporate America","review":"This collection of essays by Warren E. Buffett, compiled by Lawrence A. Cunningham, is an excellent introduction to basic investment concepts that have proven successful for the 'Oracle of Omaha' and his loyal following. The reader will want to supplement these papers periodically with more timely updates from the annual letter Buffett writes to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. Buffett's ideas have been widely reported so there are no surprises here. To be sure, Buffett is consistent. He pokes fun at the 'efficient market' school which confuses stock price with stock value. Early on we hear him calling for the expensing of stock options and urging more transparent, segmented financial reporting by large companies. For Buffett mechanically rebalancing portfolios to achieve diversification, back in fashion, may miss the point of holding-on to your best investments for superior returns. Distinguishing between Growth and Value styles of investing is unnecessary and misleading. If you have ever wondered why Berkshire Hathaway does not pay a dividend or why it doesn't split its high stock price, Buffett gives his reasoned explanations. It was Warren Buffett's fundamental school mentor Benjamin Graham who introduced the allegory of Mr. Market and the concept of 'margin of safety' both of which get satisfactory attention here. Most importantly, I think, Buffett reminds us continually that as stock market investors we are buying for the long-term parts of real businesses that produce measurable cash flows as evidence of their intrinsic value. Real businesses that produce real value are run by dedicated, competent leaders who know how to allocate capital. Hanging-on to such deceptively simple principles can get an investor through some very rough market cycles. Reading this collection is a lot like listening to the conversation of an avuncular and very experienced elder who with great patience, common sense, and wit explains what principles have guided his (investment) life. Indeed uncommon sense and integrity are hallmarks of Warren Buffett's writings. Humor too. In what other serious investment study will you get quotations from such luminaries as Woody Allen, Mae West, and Yogi Berra. Buffett loves aphorisms to make his point. I challenge anyone reading this book not to underline or commit to memory some of these gems. For a general introduction to the fundamental school view of investing this collection is required reading."},{"Title":"The essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for corporate America","review":"This book is a great, well organized compilation of Mr. Buffett's famous &quot;Letters to Shareholders&quot; which appear in the annual reports of Berkshire Hathaway.It has been recently updated to include the letters to shareholders written since the book was first released in 1996, a new introduction has been written, and a new, tougher, blue cover has been added. Mr. Buffett advised shareholders at the 1999 &amp; 2000 Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting if he had to pick a single book describing his methods, this would be the one. It is a great tool to use when trying to compile Mr. Buffett's comments on a particular subject since it is organized by subjects he has discussed in his letters over the years. Trying to find all of his comments on a particular subject throughout the annual reports is a time consuming task when you have to look through many years worth of annual reports. Mr. Cunningham has made this task much simpler with this book."},{"Title":"The essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for corporate America","review":"It is certainly true that Mr. Warren Buffet is nothing if not consistent. On June 29, Forbes Magazine will release their latest compilation of the wealthiest people in the world. There are 538 on the list, 269 from America, 56 that disappeared from last year, and many that while still present, have seen their billions cut in half or even a third of what they once enjoyed. Even the wealthiest individual, Mr. Gates, while maintaining his position at number one saw his assets decline. Guess who has billions more than last year? Warren Buffet!I always enjoy watching those that enjoy being critical of Mr. Buffet. Their charges are absurd, ranging from he never changes his methods, or he did not buy into the technology sector. The year 2000 will be remembered for many things but the amount of money lost in the tech sector will always remain the stuff of which legend is made.Mr. Buffet did in fact embrace technology as he saw fit, and last year the stock of his company went up by 14.4%. That is a number shared by other companies, however it is closer to what they are worth today as compared to one year ago if they are still alive and limping. We have embraced the 21st century by entering such cutting-edge industries as brick, carpet, insulation and paint, Buffett told his Berkshire Hathaway shareholders this year. &quot;Try to control your excitement.&quot; More exciting is the holding's company's stock price in the last year, up 14.4%. Stings a bit to the nay Sayers I would think.The real treat for investors is that Mr. Lawrence A. Cunningham has earned the respect of Mr. Buffet and Mr. Munger unlike others who report from afar. In this his, \\"First Revised Edition\\", Mr. Cunningham has expanded the text by over 10%, and added items like a, \\"Disposition Table\\", that are instructive to maximizing the value of what he presents.The comments I made on the first version need to be revised as follows. One share of Berkshire \\"A\\" stock is not $59,900.00; you missed that bargain, Now it will cost you $67,000.00. Up $2,250.00 this past Friday when the markets were soft to say the least. And that bargain \\"B\\" Berkshire? Well last time $1,966.00 would have done it, $2,235 will be required now, and it too rose $84.00 this past Friday.I cannot imagine that Mr. Warren Buffet is not on any investor's top 5 list of the greatest investors since there were markets in this Country. I would also suggest that a dispassionate appraisal of his performance argues quite eloquently that he is the best to have ever amassed his fortune, and that of his shareholders on Wall Street. Thanks to the efforts of Mr. Lawrence A. Cunningham readers have access to essays that previously were available primarily to shareholders, and which are organized in this book thematically for the second time. Annual reports are generally easy to come by, however as I wrote on August 3, 2000, 1 Share Of Berkshire Hathaway &quot;A&quot; required $59,900.00, and the &quot;Baby Berkshires&quot; $1,966.00 per share. Many are quick to respond the price is so high as Mr. Buffet has not split the stock, ever. But what is more important is why he has never done this. This book explains his theory on this matter, and dozens of others. Mr. Buffet has his critics, they range from the idiotic, &quot;he's lucky&quot;, to &quot;his success allows him to make attractive deals&quot;, and to those who feel he missed the money that was made in tech stocks. As for the luck theory, who else has earned 23.8% compounded annually for over 25 years? Winning the lottery is probably more likely an event. As to the attractive deals his wealth is said to facilitate, I guess the answer is, is the questioner serious? He made what he has, his reputation allowed him to have the Federal Government allow Solomon Brothers to continue participating in the bond market based on one thing, his word! This is a man who has rescinded very successful trades because news arrived within days of his buying/selling that could have given the appearance of his having had information others were not privy to. This book has more useful information and ideas that have been proven over decades than any 10 hot Business Books of the moment. Mr. Buffet has had off years, but he has never gone bust. One of my favorite stories is when he was hanging out with friends as a kid, his pals were collecting bottles for the deposit. He was collecting bottle caps, sorting them, and determining who was drinking what brand! He clearly was put amongst us for a reason. On a time invested basis there is no better or more rewarding reading than these essays. No one can match what he has accomplished, why would someone not wish to hear what he has to say on dozens of topics?Thank you Mr. Cunningham for gaining this man's trust."},{"Title":"The essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for corporate America","review":"This book collects all the essays which Warren Buffett wrote, which in essence is his Berkshire Hathaway chairman's report, and arranges them neatly in order so the reader isn't confused. The great thing about this, is that you don't have to go digging through mountains of statistics and figures just to find Mr Buffett's words of advice and wisdom. This is especially good for non Berkshire shareholders who haven't had access to the reports since day one. The Berkshire reports tends to assume that you've been following them in order hence if you start off with the 1993 one, you'll probably end up all muddled.Now as we all know, there are loads of books dedicated to Mr Buffett and proclaim to be able to help you use Mr Buffett's wisdom and turn yourself into Warren Buffett Jr. What makes this book stands out from the others is that it doesn't make any attempt to interpret or analyze Mr Buffett's investment technique nor does the author try to give advice to the reader. Its all Warren Buffett plain and simple. In defence of the accusation that this book is [not great]since you can get everything from the reports, I'd just like to point out that this book never made any attempt to be anything but exactly what appeared in the Berkshire annual reports. If you are comfortable with the numbers that appear in the report, by all means continue with the report. This book is merely attempting to makes your life much easier if you don't want to pound your head needlessly figuring out the figures that plague the report, but yet be able to access Mr Buffett's wisdom. Also I'd like to point out that Warren Buffett has never written any books apart from what appeared in the annual reports. In escence Larry Cunningham has created the book Warren Buffett has never written. All the others which the authors offer their opinion on the investing style has diluted Mr Buffetts wisdom and you now have to sort out which is the author's own conviction and which one is authentically Warren Buffett"},{"Title":"The essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for corporate America","review":"As a Berkshire Hathaway shareholder, I believe this is a good collection of essays by Warren Buffett. However, keep in mind that much of the essays are quite dated. While all of them are from the past, many of them are from decades ago.While still a useful read for a gleen into Buffett's investing fundamentals, I believe you could learn just as much by downloading the letters to the shareholders totally free from the Berkshire Hathaway website-this is probably what Warren Buffett would do. And doing so gives you the further benefit of being able to read more recent words than what is including in this book."},{"Title":"The essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for corporate America","review":"Good because you can feel it is by Warren Buffett himself. It's like reading any great book &iexcl;V presentation style matches perfectly with the underlying idea. While you are reading all the investment rules on the book, you know what an investor Warren Buffett is. He is so good at financial literacy; he looks for true value in a business just like an honest man looks for true love before he promotes himself from Single to Married; he is confident on his own faith; he has great vision on the kingdom of investment&iexcl;K They are not only investment rules of Warren Buffett, but also personality of Warren Buffett.If you want to know how Warren Buffett looks at a business (or an investment), you must read this book. If you want to keep dreaming about becoming a billionaire overnight, go back to your Wall Street brokers. They have plenty of dreams on every single equity listed on any market on earth &iexcl;V of course you need to provide commission for sweet dreams&iexcl;K sometimes nightmare as well!! Yes, pay for nightmare. Look at those who were advised to buy in Enron before the meltdown.You won&iexcl;t find any stock picking advise from this book. What you will find is a lesson on becoming a true investor rather than a speculator.[P.S. In one of the essay (written years ago) in the book, Warren Buffett even pointed out how American Oil Giant make use of the &iexcl;Creative Accounting&iexcl;skills in inflating their earnings. So, he has the ability to know the future? Definitely not. He is just an honest wise man who loves the truth!]"},{"Title":"The essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for corporate America","review":"Who better than to describe Warren Buffett than Buffett himself? Editor Lawrence Cunningham expertly stiches together Buffett's wisdom and wit (he is genuinely funny) compiled from 20+ years of Berkshire Hathaway annual reports. The triumph is that the result feels like a seamless, oral narrative with Buffett speaking to you one-on-one over hamburgers and Cherry Cokes.My only problem with the book comes in the form of the rather interminable 24-page introduction penned by Mr. Cunningham. Frankly, I barely made it to the starting line. My advice to you, the prospective reader, is to graze the first *three pages* of the introduction, and then skip right to Buffett. Pages four through 24 feature Mr. Cunningham telling you what Buffett is going to tell you. The only redeeming aspect of this otherwise useless overhead is that it clearly demonstrates the power of Buffett's writing. Cunningham completely succeeds in draining the text dry of Buffett's folksy, accessible style.Just let Warren tell the story, please."},{"Title":"The essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for corporate America","review":"By analyzing the essays Warren Buffet has written over the years, a reader can obtain a general, intuitive, though non-technical guide (for that Intelligent Investor) to Warren Buffet's investment method.

It is a collection of his annual messages to shareholders organized according to topic: Corporate Governance, Corporate Finance and Investing, etc.For those who enjoy and value Berkshire Hathaway's annual messages, this is a great recap. The annual messages, read annually are great but they reflect a moment in time. This collection helps to remedy that. It does two things: first, it collects all Buffett's thinking on important subjects over the years and, second, it gives a chronological progression of events (the development of his perspective on US Airways and Salomon Brothers, for instance) and the progression of his own thinking over time, shaped by his experiences.There is sometimes an odd sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu because the excerpts are not always in strict chronological order, but this is a minor defect.Having been read once, my Berkshire Hathaway annual reports sit in a pile in my attic gathering dust. This collection allowed me to savor them once more and to see how they fit together.

More than the academics, it gives a perspective that is conducive to making quality stock picks. Warren Buffet's philosophy on stocks hinges on the premise that you are buying a company for the long-term and not the short-term. Thus, he invests on companies such as Coca-Cola, See's Candy, Fruit of the Loom, etc. There are not many (if any) dot com companies.This is a quality book that is intellectually stimulating that makes practical sense (cents).JR FelisildaAuthor of the book, \\"Nanay: Lessons From a Mother\\""},{"Title":"The essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for corporate America","review":"Buffett, the master investor, shares some keys to his success.

You don't understand Balance Sheets, Cash Flow Analyses, Income Statements...and \\"what in the world\\" these things can tell you about a company...and whether or not to buy its stock? Buffett puts you inside HIS mind, using HIS thinking and analytical prowess, and illustrates just how HE does it...and allows YOU, too, to grasp the complexity of the issue and to understand WHAT it reveals about a company and its management. After reading these essays you WILL understand more about some of these \\"mysterious\\" accounting statements, and the unfolding stories that they reveal. I have been a serious amateur investment analyst for years, studied accounting, taught university level Corporate Finance, and made private corporate investments professionally, and NEVER have I seen so clearly drawn HOW to understand and use accounting reports for smarter investing.

Good stuff."},{"Title":"The essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for corporate America","review":"These essays are collected from Berkshire's annual letter to shareholders, which are available for free on Berkshire Hathaway's website. The essays Lawrence Cunningham selected provide a good synopsis of Warren's investment philosophies and cut through to the point of some very important concepts. Both Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger are the clearest-minded, sharpest, to-the-point thinkers when it comes to investments and their openness in sharing their true beliefs is an unbelievable blessing for those wise enough to pay attention and study. I doubt there is any other billionaire who would share his innermost thoughts, beliefs and secrets to success in the fashion that Buffett does.OK enough praise, I could go on and on about his successes but here are a few tidbits from the book:\\"Inactivity strikes us as intelligent behavior. Neither we nor most business managers would dream of feverishly trading highly-profitable subsidiaries because a small move in the Federal Reserve's discount rate or because some Wall Street pundit had reversed his views on the market.\\"\\"Obviously many companies in high-tech businesses or embryonic industries will grow much faster in percentage terms than will \`The Inevitables- Coke, Gillette and his latest perchase BUD'. But I would rather certain of a good result than hopeful of a great one.\\"\\"In our view, though, investment students need only two well-tought courses-How to Value a Business, and How to Think about Market Prices. Your goal as an investor should simply be to purchase, at a rational price, a part interest in an easily-understandable business who's earnings are virtually certain to be materially higher five, ten and twenty years from now.\\"\\"In the final chapter of The Intelligent Investor, Ben Graham points our: \`Confronted with a challenge to distill the secret of sound investment into three words, we venture the motto, Margin of Safety.' Forty-two years after reading that, I still think those are the right three words.\\"\\"Beware of past-performance \`proofs' in finance: If history books were the key to riches, the Forbes 400 would consist of librarians.\\"\\"Market commentators and investment managers who glibly refer to \`growth' and \`value' styles as contrasting approaches to investment are displaying their ignorance, not their sophistication.\\"Berkshire's purchase criteria:1) Large purchases (at least $50 million of before tax earnings)2) Demonstrated consistent earnings power (future projections are of little interest to us, nor are turnaround situations)3) Businesses earning good return on equity while employing little or no debt4) Management in place - We cant supply it5) Simple business (if there's l;ots of technology, we won't understand it)6) An offering priceSome interesting stats on See's Chocolates which was bought in 1972 by Blue Chip Stamps- a subsidiary of Berkshire:Bought early in 1972 for $25 million and was earning about $2 million after tax.

I was truly happy that I did not disregard what I initially percieved to be a poor purchase on my part. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for corporate America","review":"Others have dealt with the specifics and offer many quotes from Cunningham's book. I will deal with why you need to read this book, and its source material directly.Warren Buffett has never written a book, which is sad for the rest of us, and he probably never will. At the same time, Buffett is one of the finest writers on financial thought in our society today. The clarity, brevity, perfect phrasing, and play on words that he is capable of, would lead most sophisticated readers to believe that the Sage of Omaha could have had quite a remarkable career in journalism had he chose to go another way in life.Since 1977, what Buffett has done so effectively, is personally write (no committees, or public relations firms) a Chairman's letter to his Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. The letters (all of them) are freely available to you by going to the Berkshire website, and downloading them. The earliest letters were much shorter than the later letters, as Buffett's style writing style evolved. He was also more willing to share his thoughts in later years.Lawrence Cunningham, the editor of these essays is a very fine financial mind in his own right. What he has done is organize the contents of the Buffett letters into different categories. At the same time, he has left out the technical aspects of the letters for the most part, which refers to any specific transactions Berkshire committed in any given year. This allows us, the readers to be able to go right for the wisdom that is contained in the letters. We are thus able to leap over what some readers might consider less important financial details of business transactions.IS THIS THE WAY TO GO?For many it is better to read Cunningham's book. The choice reminds me of the joke about the two lecture halls at Harvard University. One says GOD on the door. The other says LECTURE ON GOD. Everybody wants to go to the LECTURE as opposed to seeing the real thing. In this case the real thing is Buffett's words without someone organizing them for you.All communication is context related. You know this. If you were to download the letters, one at a time, and read them in chronological order starting with the first letter, something quite remarkable might happen.You would be getting the PURE FLOW of Buffett's mind, from him to you directly - NO INTERMEDIARIES. Yes, depending upon your sophistication, you might not understand everything he is saying, but that doesn't matter. You'd get it, I promise you.You'd write in the margins as I do. You would underline, or highlight what is important. You would write questions. You'd make those letters yours; in short, you would take OWNERSHIP OF THEM. At the end of your journey, you would have an extraordinary financial education.You would learn things that you will never ever read anywhere else. This is because you would be the one interpreting Buffett, and you would have startling insights that other writers have not picked up on. Just about everybody writing about Buffett from authors, to journalists are not in the same league as the MASTER. They want to impress you themselves with their words, and their ideas, or twist Buffett's thinking and bask in the reflected glory. Please allow me to illustrate.Nobody ever writes about how Buffett is hardwired in a different way than the rest of us, and this is his genius. It's no different than running into Newton, Einstein, or Leonardo da Vinci. The concept of compounding on a geometric level is in Buffett's brain while the rest of us play at an arithmetic level. This is no different than a World Champion Chess Master. The only difference between an International Grand Master (IGM), and a World Champion is that the World Champion can think one more move ahead than the IGM.In a meeting I attended in Wall Street a couple of decades ago, Buffett said, \\"One of the stupidest things you can do with money is spend it.\\" Who else on the planet would say such a thing? He meant it too. Buffett doesn't think like an investor, he thinks like a businessman who is making investments, only when he makes them, they are not investments to him. They are allocations of capital. You will notice he is always talking about allocations of capital. So what does this mean?If you can get a 20% yearly compounded rate of return for decades with no tax consequences until you sell (capital gains treatment in the end), you can build capital into the billions depending upon what you start with. Take Emerson a company you probably don't know. A dollar invested in 1956, by 2000 was worth $638. Those are Buffett type returns, and I can show you scores of public corporations that are comparable in performance. You must hold long enough to let compounding work for you.BOOK is FABULOUSYou want to read this book for the wisdom, the quotes, that you can memorize, and attempt to exploit for your personal investment advantage. We should all be grateful to the author for doing this. Buffett himself has publicly complimented the author for his work because he is the first author to give you pure Buffett without altering the Master's words.In closing, I have read Cunningham's book several times, and you should too. Just don't forget to go to the actual source documents, the letters themselves. Carry one around with you in your pocket, and just read it in a park, in a restaurant, or anywhere else you can reflect, and work with pure genius.Richard Stoyeck"},{"Title":"The essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for corporate America","review":"If you are used to reading public company annual reports, including the (usually) short letters from company presidents, you know how shallow, self-congratulatory and sometimes even misleading these reports can be. On the (extreme) other hand, Warren Buffett's annual letters in his Berkshire Hathaway annual reports represent detailed, on-target, lively and highly readable masterpieces of valuable education, information, and wit. You can read Buffett's annual letters for free at Berkshire Hathaway's website, but it will take you a while, since there are many of them (back to 1977) and they run 20+ pages each. Further, Buffett's various letters weren't intended to serve as serial chapters of a book. Better, you can shell out the cost of Lawrence Cunningham's thematically organized collection (220 pages or so)of Buffett's essays and gain a better appreciation of the numerous important topics that Buffett addresses. These topics include, first and foremost, the critical impact of the quality of corporate governance--Buffett was years ahead of most investors in focusing on this area. Other topics include corporate finance (addressed with a clarity that is both unusual and revealing of Buffett's powers of insight), mergers and acquisitions, accounting (Buffett is the only person I know who can regularly make accounting seem positively interesting), taxes, junk bonds and much more.Moreover, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is nearly unique in its intense commitment to shareholders. The opposite (a commitment to management entrenchment and exorbitant compensation) is the norm with so many companies today that it would be easy to forget how vital shareholder primacy should be. As you read Buffett's essays you will have a model to measure other companies against--which should come in handy the next time you exercise your voting rights as a shareholder.Life is short. As an investor or a concerned citizen-shareholder, you can learn through your own experiences, of course. There's nothing wrong with that, but the process can be long and expensive. (Depending on one's experiences, it can be very expensive.) Alternately, you can learn via Warren Buffett's lifetime of experiences distilled into a very readable, lively, fascinating collection of his essays.

I emphatically recommend this book to CFOs, investment bankers, financial analysts, and anyone else interested in corporate finance and business valuation.For those people that wish to learn about Buffett's philosophy this is the book to read.

Mr. Buffett is widely known as one of the most articulate, successful and intelligent businesspeople of our time.While all of Mr. Buffett's writings are worth reading, this book represents a helpful distillation and codification of the general principles of business in general, and investing in particular. This book is well worth a read."},{"Title":"The essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for corporate America","review":"This book contains the Investment philosophy of Benjamin Graham and Philip A Fisher combined.

Mentored by Benjamin Graham (The father of value investing\\" he went on to produce over an annual 20% return in his stock portfolio for 40 years. As Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway he also brought a failing textile business that was trading at $4 a share in 1965 to the highest priced stock ever at over $100,000 a share in 2007.If you are are familiar with Mr. Buffett then let me tell you I am also a huge fan. This book is the one he chose out of a stack of books during a special that featured him on CNBC during the holidays \\"The billionaire next door\\".He said this one out of the many written about him capture his thoughts and investment style. Mr. Buffet's comments about this book were \\"First class. A great job at collating our philosophy\\". Can you get a better review than that?I was not disappointed, this is the book to by if you want to study and understand Warren Buffett. The author has done an excellent job arranging the essays to the shareholders in a format that will enable us all to learn the key principles in investing and managing followed by Buffett.I always wished that Mr. Buffett would have written a book, this is the closest we may ever have. Buy it and enjoy, it is packed with profound yet simple wisdom. Here are a few examples:Virtually all his $40 billion net worth is in Berkshire stock.(99% of it) So much for diversification, he believes in putting all your eggs in one basket, then watching that basket.Margin of safety is critical in investing, only buy excellent businesses at fair prices.Only invest in businesses you understand. Your circle of competence.He does not believe \\"value investing\\" is the right term for him. He prefers \\"focused\\" or \\"intelligent\\" investing.He believes in buying excellent businesses, and then holding them, forever if possible.When investing he believes in buying true value not hopes and dreams.Get out a high lighter and prepare to learn. It is packed with great quotes and lessons."},{"Title":"The essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for corporate America","review":"This excellent book was hard to put down. Mr. Buffett is as innately talented a writer as he is a businessman. The book funny, entertaining and highly informative, is sure to add significantly to the knowledge of any aspiring investor. Buffett takes topics like corporate accounting malfeasance and makes you laugh at them while at the same time providing profound insight into the inner workings of the corporate enviornment. This title is definatly one you will want to own."},{"Title":"The essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for corporate America","review":"There are so many investment gems in this book. Warren Buffet has a way of stating things that stick with you, and pointing out things that others don't . Concepts like \\"look-through\\" earnings blew me away. You should own and read this book no matter what investment style you follow. The best thing this book has done for me is to show me how to value companies, how to think about a business in which you may invest for the long term. It'd be hard to call yourself a serious investor and not know what this book has to offer. Let's see, at $17 for the book, what price are you paying for the future cash flows that it will produce???? This book is THE BEST possible bang-for-buck investment you could ever make."},{"Title":"The essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for corporate America","review":"There are plenty of books written about Warren Buffett, but what is a better source if not THE source: Warren Buffett. There are just so many lessons to learn from this book. I loved the section where Mr. Buffett explains the Cigar Butts investment style that he practiced before Charlie Munger convinced him to change his style into buying excellent companies at reasonable prices and holding them for a long time. Mr. Buffett is very good at explaining difficult concepts in simple terms that almost anybody can understand.- Mariusz Skonieczny, author of Why Are We So Clueless about the Stock Market?

Warren Buffett doesn't like to talk about stock picks nor has he write any type of investment book. However, this book is as close as it come to being Buffett's investment book [if he ever decide to write one]. His investing philosophy are sound and insightful. Best of all, this book is full of wit.Warning: it might be a little dense for beginners but once you understand the financial terms, you won't regret buying this book!"},{"Title":"The essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for corporate America","review":"In his recent CNBC interview, Warren Buffett was shown some of the many books written about him. He said all the books were fairly accurate, although most contained some mistakes.When asked his favorite, he said it was this book.

This is Buffet, himself, talking from the pages of the book. Every investor must read this one.The book is a compilation of his famous letters to shareholders. Cunningham, unlike others, must have realized that only Warren Buffet knows how to invest like Warren Buffet. So, instead of writing about him and his investment style, he simply allows the reader to learn from the source."},{"Title":"The essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for corporate America","review":"Some who read the book complained that it's possible to find the same information on Warren's website. Although I have enjoyed the shareholder's letters, there is something to be said about an easy to pickup, and read, compilation of some of his best ideas.The way I look at it -- $25 is a small price to pay for the gems which you encounter in this book. One paragraph, even one sentence, could potentially change the way in which one invests and could make a significant change in your long term wealth!"},{"Title":"The essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for corporate America","review":"If you are at all involved in business or investing, you should read this book.NOTE: Though you can read all of Buffett's letters to the shareholders that are assimilated in this compilation through Berkshire Hathaway's website, I found this compilation quite helpful and much more &quot;user-friendly&quot; than clicking through links upon links of letters.As far as material is concerned, Buffett speaks to the masses as the messiah of capitalism- not that he would ever claim such a title. As a recent college grad, I found that I learned more from reading Buffett's writings than I learned in numerous college courses. The material in his letters is simply that insightful. Did I mention that Buffett is a funny old guy? That all comes through in these letters, as well. In another life, Buffett would have made an excellent teacher. Fortunately, Buffett likes to talk - he wants to share his understandings and insights, the thoughts of the master: his letters or &quot;essays&quot; are those thoughts. And what a nice little book in which to read them. I know that I am better off as an investor and as an academic for reading them.I will undoubtedly re-read this book at least once more. I cannot give it any higher recommendation."},{"Title":"The essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for corporate America","review":"Okay so you may not have the same capital as he does to purchase things, but you can still apply some simple basics into your investments.

Many other books about Buffett cover his approach to investing, but his annual letters to his shareholders excerpted in this book cover the same material. His letters are filled with wit and insights, and he's got a home-spun style that lightens up what might otherwise be a very dry subject. If you're not familiar with Buffett's value-based investing approach, then you'll learn about it here, and how it's helped him average an eye-popping 25% average annual return for 35 years running. For those already familiar with Buffett's approach, it's still enjoyable to read him in his own words. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for corporate America","review":"I bought this Book because I read in the reviews that the author organized the topics.

You can learn much from the tales of his experience and advice. I can appreciate the time and effort the man takes to select the businesses he buys and leads to economic success. How can the average investor profit from his experiences. I agree with the other reviewers that this book is an outstanding essay for those who want to learn how to select stocks for a value portfolio. Where we differ is that the typical investor he does not have the resources to build a properly diversified portfolio. Value stocks do provide returns in excess of broad market returns but in order to have adequate diversification you must assemble several hundred issues well beyond the resources of the average investor. Further one must have the time and skill to evaluate several thousand issues. I can offer a solution to this problem. I want to recommend for you a book titled How to Make Money in the Stock Market-Buy 2,500 different stocks for $1000 - Pay no Commission This book is a must for those wanting to find out about indexing (passive investing) and why it is the superior method for the small investor (and big one too). This book is an outstanding guide to personal investing. It will be useful to all investors from novices to highly the highly experienced. This book prepares the reader to approach investing from the standpoint of the underlying science. It is the antithesis of a 'get rich quick scheme'.All aspects of Modern Portfolio Theory and passive (index) investing are explained in a through and easily understood manner. The aspect I like most is that as well as a solid theoretical foundation the book is very practical and shows the reader how to create (and more importantly) and manage over time a successful portfolio. This is a great book- for the beginning investor, it's a great place to start and for the experienced investor there are many valuable suggestions.It's a shame to think of how much money investors have lost \\"investing\\" in the stock market over the years. I wish I had read this little book years ago. The chapter on automatic investing recommends a number of portfolios that follow modern portfolio theory and adjust risk as you age without any effort on the part of the reader at all. Had this book been written years ago and had I followed its directions I would be rich today of that I am certain. Nevertheless I will pursue one of the portfolios recommended and stick to my chosen asset plan.How to Make Money in the Stock Market-Buy 2,500 Different Stocks-Pay no Commission"},{"Title":"The essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for corporate America","review":"Buffet is trenchant and smart but abandoned his own principles in the late 90s after run ups of KO, FRE, and other stocks he had the foresight to purchase in the 80s.

His treatment of the Streltsy - a large corps of traditional elite guards for the tsar - following an attempted revolt was extremely brutal, including an orgy of torture and horrible executions, closely attended by Peter himself.So too Peter's demands for his many wars, demands on his people for harsh taxation and much manpower, repeated again for his building from scratch, out of lands captured from Sweden's empire, the city of St Petersburg.The author does a good job of capturing Peter's many eccentricities, his uncontrollable and grotesque movements at times, likely owing to a form of epilepsy, his alcoholism, his fondness for parodying the church in his private gatherings with friends, his deliberate choice of close companions who were not members of the old aristocracy and were themselves sometimes rather odd characters, his bizarre treatment of his first wife, and his explosive temper which many times ended with serious blows on the heads of good friends.Peter is famous to students of European history for his \\"great embassy,\\" a long and unusual journey through parts of advanced Europe he undertook in disguise, investigating how things were done in institutions and industries everywhere he went and spending great periods of his time in studying the skill of ship-building, cheerfully taking up carpenter's tools himself to work as an apprentice. His penchant for disguise, while having some justification on security grounds, clearly, in view of some of the details of how he proceeded, was another of Peter's eccentricities.Peter is rightly regarded as the father of the Russian navy. He studied the skills, established an industry, hired many experts from Europe, and conquered outlets in the south and in the north as outlets to the sea.Peter's embrace of foreigners created a good deal of suspicion and animosity amongst Russia's traditionalists, suspicion of foreign ways and belief that Russia was close to God in its native customs being a prominent part of the culture at the time, and Peter worked regularly to end it, but it hardly made him popular. For example, he insisted on aristocrats not wearing traditional long robes and shaving and sometimes acted in highly abrupt and disturbing ways, as the time he decided to go around the table at a dinner and cut off the long sleeves of some of the nobles' robes.Peter was a military leader of considerable talent, spending a huge portion of his reign on wars - the Great Northern War with Sweden lasted twenty years - and he defeated the redoubtable general-monarch, Charles XII of Sweden.The author has a tremendous subject in Peter, and I think he does justice to him in a book which reads like a good novel.I have just two small reservations about the author's approach. There are places, especially in the early part of the book, where the author puts quotations into people's mouths that we know perfectly well cannot be actual quotations, although of course they reflect genuine historical content. He does not do this extensively, and it is a stylistic tool used by other biographers, but I am not a fan of it.Another approach some readers may not like involves the author's way of introducing a significant new subject. Massie leaves the main street behind, as it were, and wanders down interesting side streets, offering background and historical discussions which might be described by some with the slightly pejorative teaching expression \\"chicken walk.\\" This does not bother me, and indeed I enjoyed his little side trips.I recommend this book as a fine introduction to the beginnings of modern Russia. It is enjoyable reading, and its subject lived a life about equal to that of half a dozen lesser historical characters."},{"Title":"Peter The Great Part 1 Of 3","review":"This audio tape is the standard on The Greatest RussianPeter the Great was a giant. He embodied all that was Russia and aspired too many of the things Russia would later become. As a young man he had learned much about Russia's long and storied history. As Tsar he embarked on unrelenting campaigns against all of Russia's neighbors and forged a modern empire.Massie's Biography of this seminal leader is the standard on the subject. It explored every facet of Peter's long life; his relations with family, his military genius, his ambitions, his fears, his obsessions and his weaknesses. Successive chapters detail the Northern war, the Wars with the Ottomans, the wars in Europe proper, and the final campaign along the coast of the Caspian.In his life Peter \`Piervui' redeemed the Russians at the battle of Poltava and thus set the foundations for the building of Peters \`window on Europe', the city on the Neva named after his saint, St. Petersburg. The brilliant writer, Massie, delivers a tour de force in describing the building of Peter's northern capital.Massie also looks into the dual personality of Peter, his obsession with Europe and his own inward struggles with his weak son. Massie examines relations with both the Ottoman east and the European West. Peter in his life looked forward to a vast Russian empire, one that would one day stretch the length of the continent and on which the \`sun would never set'. Peter dreamed of a world class navy operating from the Baltic to the Mediterranean. He dreamed of liberating the Christians of the Caucasus and Balkans and saw a role for Russia in Europe, all dreams that would be realized by successors like Catherine the Great.A brilliant book, an epic of detail and flavor!"},{"Title":"An Introduction to Rumen Studies","review":"This book is a very good introduction to rumen studies.

Churchill himself had run for governor just two years earlier and had met his defeat at the hands of the state's railroad lobby. In the character of Humphrey Crewe, a somewhat politically nave, comical figure who is running for governor, Churchill drew a character similar to himself. But Crewe is basically a minor figure, there to offer comic relief, but the main thrust of the story lies elsewhere. The main characters actually are Hillary Vane, the chief lawyer for the railroad company and major state political operator, and his son, Austen, who represents reform. Austen accuses his father of violating a \\"nearly forgotten\\" statute whereby the railroads were not to increase rates in exchange for the right to consolidate, a ruling they have long ignored. Churchill's real-life reform concerns came to the fore right here, as this was exactly what was happening in New Hampshire at the time. The battle between Austen and Hillary builds dramatically throughout the novel, until Austen is encouraged by other reformers to run for governor. But out of loyalty to his father, he declines the nomination.This is one of the problems with the book, and what sets it aside from other reform novels such as those by Upton Sinclair: Churchill was not willing to take the fight beyond the dictates of parlor civility; he believed that gentlemen discussing principles would bring about change. This was a highly idealistic view, and when he has Austen convince his father of the rightness of the reformer's position, it's too pat and contrived to be very believable. There is also, of course, a love story unfolding within the proceedings, between Austen and Victoria Flint, which succeeds splendidly by novel's end - but it's the least impressive thing about the book. In fact, it's hard not to want to skim through the scenes where these two characters are on stage, they are so stiff and uninteresting. But despite his kid glove approach to reform, Churchill makes the political battle for reform dramatic and lively."},{"Title":"Mr. Crewe's career,","review":"Another novel by the American novelist Winston Churchill, distantly related, whose fame was such at the turn of the century that Winston SPENCER Churchill promised to use his middle name to distinguish himself.

There are not words to describe how pleased I am with the authors. The contents of this book contain sheer brilliance and are full of dark, vulgar comedy, action (not to mention an extensive knowledge for wrestling), intresting, colorful characters, and some of the most vile, stomach-spilling, sex acts ever captured on paper( YOU ARE WARNED!). Mr. Lee and Mr. Pelan have tag teamed again and will surley NOT dissapoint their readers with this little gem. Any reader of the hardcore horror genre who has not read this book should stop wasting their time with my review and get it NOW! A pleasant ride through an extremely perverse*, laugh out loud!, are you kidding me?, fast paced rollercoaster of a book. My hat goes off to these two masters of the macabre, GREAT JOB!!!"},{"Title":"GOON - Ilustrated Revised Edition","review":"The best thing about \\"Goon\\" is its cover art: massive and still, his head down, his face covered by a mask, Goon suggests pure malevolence. Unfortunately, one of the biggest flaws about \\"Goon\\" is that he's never around. Though he is the titular character, we never really get to see Goon in action. Considering how thin this book is, it doesn't make sense to me why Lee couldn't include one chapter showing us Goon's ghastly deeds. He has no problem including a pointless scene involving police detective Straker getting it on with a witness, which features all areas of the female anatomy described as food.In fact, about eighty percent of this book is taken up with Straker's juvenile sexual musings about reporter Melinda. It feels like the entire middle of the book is her prattling on about why women sleep with these sleazy wrestlers and describing the culture while he internally drools over her legs.I know you're not exactly supposed to expect total coherency while dealing with this type of story, but it's pretty ridiculous. All the evidence clearly points to Goon. So instead of Straker going undercover with a reporter (!) why doesn't he just bring Goon in for an interview, which any sensible law-enforcement agent would?There are two great, disgustingly hilarious scenes in the book -- one involving a redneck cop detailing various trysts and the other featuring Straker in a most unerotic sexual encounter -- but overall the novel (which, at 128 pages with plenty of blank space, is really a short story) felt slapdash. You don't expect Fitzgerald-like prose from Lee, but he has shown he has a better command of language than this. When describing one female, he lists her cup size. Phrases and words are often repeated, literally on the same page, by different characters.While the cover art is brilliant, the illustrations inside are childish and annoying; they look like something a bored teenager might doodle in his notebook. They also come before their appearance in the text, which, at one point, ruins a \\"surprise\\" in the plot. It should also be noted that the main story of \\"Goon\\" is basically the same one used for \\"The Bighead,\\" which is superior to this in every way."},{"Title":"GOON - Ilustrated Revised Edition","review":"Nowhere near as gross and vile as it's rumored to be \\"Goon\\" is still a fun sick read and at only 138 pages you can get through it pretty fast.A lot of mutilated bodies have been piling up and police captain Straker thinks it's the work of Deep South Wrestling Conference wrestler Goon. So with the help of a super hot female reporter Straker goes undercover in the seedy world of wrestling groupies or ringrats. Repulsive sex scenes follow.After reading so much about this book I was disappointed overall in the community college level writing and the gross stuff wasn't that gross. Yea, I laughed a few times and there's no shortage of nastiness, but it's done in such an over the top way that a lot of the impact is lost. A good example is when you're watching \\"South Park\\" there's lots of gross stuff there but it's funny in its outrageousness not gross."},{"Title":"GOON - Ilustrated Revised Edition","review":"This exercise in hardcore grossout horror, originally published in 1996, may contain more scenes of carnal grotesqueries in its 138 pages than most horror writers publish in a lifetime. Any effort to do so usually comes off as a pale imitation of these two fine writers, who are kind enough to return us to some familiar territory here as well as introduce some new aspects to the genre that none of have ever imagined before. In this volume, we have the return of Philip Straker (Lee's pseudonym he used on his first two novels and the main character in his novel Creekers), we have the return of PFC Micah Hayes (who also illustrated this edition) and Chief Richard Kinion (another Lee pseudonym), and we have a parody of virtually ever professional wrestler in the business.The book is about a police officer and a reporter who go undercover as ringrats, or wrestling groupies, to try to catch Goon, a heel wrestler who can take a fatal blow to the head without batting an eye and who may be responsible for the murders of several ringrats. To say more would spoil the story, which may be the most unique piece you've ever read. It may not be Faulkner, or even Stephen King, but it will remain in your mind (in a dark corner filled with memories of other things you will never speak of in certain company) long after you've read it.Fans of the Lee and Pelan team are encouraged to track down copies of Shifters, Splatterspunks, Family Tradition (especially this one, I can't stress enough), and whatever short stories you can find.

There's some brutal stuff in here, extreme sexual violence that may turn some people off. If you like this stuff, though, get this book.The one thing that I had a slight problem with were the illustrations. The cover of the book is awesome but the illustrations are sort of cartoonish. It just made the content of the book less horrifying. When I read hardcore horror, I want to be disgusted or horrified.. but I can't if I get the impression that everything is happening in a sort of comic book world.Anyway, that's my only criticism.

It seems like a very basic story written by someone other than Lee (Pelan) where Lee has added several sections of gross sex. Lee is usually very good and very funny at this stuff but on this occasion it comes off as a half arsed effort that probably took him a couple of hours to write.There is one piece of classic Lee in this novel, a conversation between two police officers.

I grew up in Cuba with an American father and Cuban mother. I'm very interested in cross cultural marriages and the lives of colonialists and their hosts.The final scenes were like my leaving Cuba for violence and craziness and mixed emotions and I felt it was therapeutic for me to have this gift from the author.

The writing is rather ordinary. Perhaps, as some note, it's sardonic, but it does that often through stereotyping. The main character Chloe never seems to change much. None of the male characters progresses much either. The story is rather lame. You can pretty much figure out what's going to happen about 1/4 of the way into the book. But you have to wade through a lot of nothing much to get to the last 50 pages which finally have intrigue and action. To understand the political background in Iran, a reader would have to be quite familiar with what happened. Johnson never even helps the reader recollect the events with more than sketchy historical information; the main American characters are not really aware of what's happening during the fall of Iran from the Shah's control but that doesn't mean the reader has to be put into the dark as well. Johnson alludes to &quot;A Passage to India&quot; which I think would be a better book to read if you want to read about culture clashes. What puzzles me is all the positive reviews Johnson keeps getting."},{"Title":"Persian Nights (William Abrahams Book)","review":"The main character inspires nothing but a mild distaste and unfortunately overshadows with her pointless little musings a much more interesting subject of a people on the verge of revolt.

There is not enough wit or drama or lirerary cleverness to make one want to read beyond page 15, the only reason I did, is that I made it a rule to finish all books I start. Johnson has written much better books."},{"Title":"Persian Nights (William Abrahams Book)","review":"I don't know how anyone could have enjoyed this book. It's horrible!

Try one of her other novels maybe, but steer clear of this one!"},{"Title":"Persian Nights (William Abrahams Book)","review":"This was one of those books I started to read-gave up on it, because it kept on dragging on and nothing was happening.

I will not waste my time any further"},{"Title":"Persian Nights (William Abrahams Book)","review":"After reading some of the negative reviews here, I was a bit trepidatious when I started this novel, but after reading and enjoying Le Divorce (despite its many negative reviews on Amazon), I decided to give it a go. Suprisingly, it was not horrible at all. I found it a very fun and enjoyably light read, with typical Diane Johnson characters, self-centered, blind to their surroundings, and not altogether pleasant. Actually, I found this plot much more cohesive than Le Divorce (for which Ms. Johnson was nominated for the National Book Award), with fewer loose ends. But I would still have preferred that she stay away from the political intrigue-type shenanigans (which she never really explained satisfactorally) and stick to her characters, whom she writes about with great wit and charm.I did not find the book at all boring, as some earlier reviewers have described, and am completely puzzled as to the reference of a &quot;string of 4-letter words.&quot; I certainly didn't notice any. I wonder if we read the same book?"},{"Title":"Persian Nights (William Abrahams Book)","review":"Read by my bookclub months ago, I finally picked this one off the shelf and gave it my best shot. The protagonist, Chloe Fowler, is the wife of a doctor who has chosen to spend the summer in Iran, working in Shiraz at the Azami Hospital. In London on the trip out to Iran, her husband, Jeffery, is suddenly called back to the States to tend to a dear friend who has had a terrible accident. Jeffrey encourages Chloe to go ahead and he'll meet up with her later (he never does). Chloe's world in Iran is a chock-a-block of doctors and their wives (some American, some Iranian, some European) who live and work in the Azami Compound. It is the summer of growing discontent in Iran and the book ends with them all fleeing as the hostages are being taken at the US Embassy in Tehran (although they are oblivious to that fact as they line up in the airport to buy caviar). Although this book was very well written, I had a terrible time identifying with Chloe. She is self-centered, unliberated, a pretty, empty-headed thing who has very little sense of what is happening around her and seems way too preoccupied with her various affairs to care. Although the stage for this novel is Iran, it could have taken place in any developing country. Johnson attempts to make us see that Chloe has some redeeming qualities in her amateurish quest to better understand the Persian poets or some of the archeological sites they all visit en (tourist) masse. But the result does not move me. Chloe is still a bonehead, and has more than she deserves in life. I finished this book wishing that it had been written about one or another of the more interesting, less shallow peripheral characters in Chloe's little Iranian world."},{"Title":"Persian Nights (William Abrahams Book)","review":"The content of 'Persian Nights' was very vivid and realistic, so I was immediately transported into the story. I could easily identify and empathise with a lot of the feelings and emotions there, particularly concerning those of the main protagonist Chloe, and I could also clearly imagine the sort of atmosphere evoked. The characters were portrayed in a very human, 3-dimensional way with both their qualities and faults exposed. I enjoyed the transparency of their inner thoughts and emotions. The story went at a nice pace, there was a good sense of humour, tension, disturbance and suspense, especially towards the end, local colour and detail added exoticism and charm, the plot was compelling with little unexpected and original twists at times. Overall the book is very rich, there is a lot in it, worthy of a re-read or even chosen for a book study group. I came across the book by accident, my first impression looking at the cover and blurb was that it might be about a uncultured, ignorant American woman who blunders through Iran constantly hostile and complaining at the culture shock, and so I chose to read it for entertaining, humorous and light holiday reading. However it was refreshing to find that the protagonist was not only cultured, liberated, professional and sophisticated, but that she bravely attempted to integrate into Iranian culture in her own way and had good intentions to make the most of her short stay there through studying the language and improving her knowledge of local artefacts (she worked part-time in the University library and took out some heavy reading!). Thus I admired the character and learned a lot from her too. I wish I were as strong and brave, and sometimes as good, as she was.Although not explicit, you can deduce fairly quickly that the political backdrop is Iran in the 70's, the time leading up to the Iranian revolution . If you want to read a detailed account of the political or cultural situation of Iran at the time, (as some readers seem to have wanted to do - I wonder why they don't just look up the encyclopaedia?), then you might be expecting too much from this book, which in its 300-odd pages packs a lot more in besides. If you keep an open mind and want to be enriched emotionally and intellectually, then you will experience the joy of top quality writing. There is no mystery why the author's books have been selected for various prizes. It certainly makes me want to read all of the other Diane Johnson books and pretty soon. I'm already a fan! I must admit I was rather shocked at the negative comments and low-star ratings for 'Persian Nights'. Are all these readers reading the same book? The book deserves at least four stars on average. Thank you Diane Johnson for an excellent book!"},{"Title":"Persian Nights (William Abrahams Book)","review":"I wanted this book because I thought it would describe INTERESTING events happening in the life of an American woman in a Middle Eastern country. Not quite. It merely threw a few week's boring events together to create a boring story that went nowhere. The story is called &quot;Persian Nights&quot;, yet the reader wasn't informed about the culture, customs or traditions of this mysterious land! The few somewhat eyelifting parts (that would seem difficult for the author to solve)somehow were suddenly patched (Noosheen and the whole passport thing). There were so many parts that could have gone somewhere and never did. Awfully boring."},{"Title":"Persian Nights (William Abrahams Book)","review":"I had read Le Divorce, Le Marriage and L'affaire before ordering Persian nights. I am very surprised by the negative comments here. Although the later books are very incisive as to the cultural and psychological differences between the French and their both loved and hated US friends, I find Persian Nights a very well written and interesting rendition of the suburban upper middle class wife and mother of the 70s. Feminism by passed college-educated Chloe. Instead she chose the safety of a marriage to a successful doctor. Even her volunteer work as a museum docent is safe. The most daring action she can muster is extra-marital sex. Thrust alone into the totally alien environment of pre-revolutionary Iran she sets off on a journey of self discovery and finds herself lacking in every aspect of her life. As danger, fear, disease, poverty and even death slowly creep silently into her safe cocoon Chloe 's transformation begins. Though in the past her impulses for action have always been stifled by a pervading apathy she increasingly abandons the safe role of the observer for that of the actor.Persian Nights is a wonderful, insightful novel that very much captures the feel of the women's movement of the 60s and 70s cleverly staged vis a vis Iran's uprising against the superficially benign regime of the Shah. This setting adds to the complexity and interest of this work."},{"Title":"Persian Nights (William Abrahams Book)","review":"Brilliant book -- far more ambitious than Le Divorce, which I also loved (but is a very different animal). &quot;Persian Nights&quot; is witty and fascinating, a devastating character study."},{"Title":"Persian Nights (William Abrahams Book)","review":"Fast-paced, humorous, and very, very smart! This is Diane Johnson at her best. The main character is self-centered, blind to reality, and, ultimately, quite entertaining.

I am an avid reader and I am really sorry I wasted my time and money on it. The main character has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. It was impossible to care what happened to this poor excuse for a women. How this novel could be described as fast-paced is beyond me. Three quarters way through the book I was still waiting for something, anything, to happen. At about this same point in the story the author tosses out a stream of vulgar language that seems to have no place in the book. Perhaps it is to get our attention away from falling asleep. Sweeping negative generalizations for nearly every ethnic group mentioned in the story abound. Iranians men are ridiculed right down to the size of their collective private parts. Was the author trying to be funny or just plain offensive? If you need to prop up the leg of a table perhaps this book would have some merit. How it could have been nominated for the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction I do not understand."},{"Title":"Persian Nights (William Abrahams Book)","review":"Like Le Divorce, Diane Johnson once again serves us a teaspoon of female angst in a foreign locale. I always find her books to be very funny, written in her unique sardonic tone. The only complaint that I have is that like Le Divorce, the book has a slow start and takes a while to get into. But the endings are always satisfying and action-packed. What I like most about her books is that Johnson always makes the heroine very human, but albeit likable. Chloe is obviously self-centered, but it becomes apparent how well this serves her by the end of the book. Lots of plot twists make this perfect beach reading. I reccommend it highly."},{"Title":"Persian Nights (William Abrahams Book)","review":"This was not a good book at all.

That was 20 years ago, and I still have that poor, much-abused paperback in my bedside table and it is still one of my favorite stories.It tells the tale of Laurie, a 16 year old junior at Glendale High, who has been in love with her next door neighbor, Sammy, for as long as she can remember. In the first chapter, he comes over to her porch to confide in her that he has finally fallen in love! However, their stars become crossed when Sammy tells her he is scared to death because \\"this isn't just any girl, this is a popular, beautiful girl!\\" Laurie bravely tells him she will help him get this girl, whoever she is, and that the absolute best way to get her attention is to make her think he is interested in someone else. That shuts Sammy up fast because, of course, Laurie is the girl!So poor Laurie spends her days helping Sammy capture this unknown rival's attention by acting as if they are a couple...and she spends her nights crying into her pillow. Miserable, she asks her mother, \\"What is the meaning of love?\\" Her mother tells her, \\"Love is wanting someone to be happy.\\" Laurie is disappointed with this lame answer and concludes that parents are completely out of touch. But when Sammy realies she loves him and asks her why on earth she was trying to help him win over another girl, she tells him she was doing it all to make him happy, even at her own expense. Dear old mom...she really did know what she was talking about.In another chapter, Laurie causes trouble for her mom and dad when her father gives her mother a vacuum cleaner as a present, and Laurie tells her mother that it is a pathetic gift, and that her father is taking her completely for granted. Of course this causes all sorts of chaos!I love this book. It is set in such a sweet time--and is such a sweet story, but it has some real lessons about letting people be themselves and find happiness in their own way. The story is light and funny and the fifties slang is \\"dippy\\" but the characters (especially Laurie's parents) are very three-dimensional. And in the end, you see that Sammy's love for Laurie is the serious kind, and not just puppy love.I recommend this book for anyone! Although it is set in the fifties, much of the story could take place today. What is more timeless than 2 kids in love? It is \\"safe\\" for pre-teens because there is really nothing sexual, just some light kissing. And Laurie is so dramatic--what young girl can't realte to that?! Girls would most definitely like it more than boys, although I made my husband read it when we first got married and he really enjoyed it! If you are lucky enough to locate a copy, you must read it!"},{"Title":"Something Foolish, Something Gay","review":"When my older sister went off to college in 1968, I stumbled upon this book in her book shelf. It is the lighthearted and engagingly written tale of two high school sweethearts, Laurie and Sammy. Yes, it was written in and about a bygone era, the 1950's, but for me it sparkled with all the excitement, joy and heartache of my own coming of age I was experiencing at the time.The characters are well drawn. Laurie's parents were the typical 50's mom and dad. Her older sister is reminiscent of my high school best friend's sister with melodrama galore. The situations, the powerful emotion of first love, the frustration with being forever misunderstood by out dated parents, these are universal and contemporary subjects no matter what decade we grew up in. For me as a young teen, I found the story very easy to relate to and it became a favorite book. One I have never forgotten.I recently purchased a copy on amazon and re read it, enjoying it just as much if not more than the first time. The story is still fresh, light and fun. It took me right back to high school and filled me with a warm and bittersweet longing for simpler times when I was young and life was so fresh.I recommend this book to anyone who is young, or once was young. You will enjoy the warm rush you will receive from this timeless, lighthearted tale of young love."},{"Title":"Something Foolish, Something Gay","review":"Silly, fun book.

It proved in my case to be very stimulating, and I found myself pondering the ideas presented for some time.Why then, do I award only four stars? Because the title is no longer appropriate. It is not a book exclusively about modern man, but rather, about man as he was seventy years ago. Some of the concepts seem to describe very accurately the state of mind that mankind was experiencing in Jung's time, but today they won't be observed with any great consistency - they are no longer appropriate. That being said, the book outlines the general principles in such a logical way that one may apply them to the world around them, seeing the similarities and differences between Jung's world and their own for themselves.Worthwhile reading for anyone interested in psychology, or simply expanding their view of life - puts a wide range of life's issues in perspective."},{"Title":"Modern man in search of a soul","review":"I have to give this book a 5-star rating because I find Dr. Jung's deductions on things like dreams, stages of life, archaic man, psychology and literature, analytical psychology, spiritual problems of man and the like, just the kind of thing I'm enthralled with, and which keeps me reading long after I realize I should be putting the book down to do other pressing things.

For those of you who already own some or most of Jung's Collected Works (CW), it may be unnecessary to purchase this title. I found this out too late since in my haste I failed to check the table of contents graciously provided for by Amazon on this web page. So for the benefit of those who are intending to buy this title I have listed below all the chapters and the corresponding volume of the CW where these same essays can be found (note: translations in this work and those in the CW may differ slightly as exemplified by the change in the title of the first chapter).Table of Contents1.

Jung is a deeper thinker, and I think not reductive like Freud and Adler tended to be. He makes no claim to dogmatism or absolutes. Jung really hits on the psyche and transcends the borders of rational intelligence into areas of the unconscious expressions in symbolism and images.I am going to argue against another reviewer here that gave this book 4 stars as being outdated. When I look at the present collective societal structure and current cultural pattern apart from the minority of advanced individuals, I can see the postmodern man has regressed far from the modern man of the 1930's in search of a soul. Of course there as been advances individually, but on a collective level; fundamentalism, religious literalism, nationalism, patriotism and one-sided thinking This has grown in major proportions as opposed to the other way around and it is far more serious than most even realize and patterns after historical events of very similiar nature.The first essay on dream-analysis hits on the idea that dreams are very hard to interpret and suggests that understanding the circumstances and conditions of the conscious life is significant in relation to the dreams of the unconscious life.On the problems of psychotherapy, Jung relates four stages of analytical psychology, the confessional, explanation, education and transformation\\"The great decisions of human life have as a rule far more to do with the instincts and other mysterious unconscious factors than with conscious will and well-meaning reasonableness. The shoe that fits one person pinches another; there is no recipe for living that suits all cases. Each of us carries his own life-form - an indeterminable form which cannot be superseded by any other.\\" p. 61The essay on the personality types is short, non-exhaustive and briefly relates Jung's ideas of the introvert, the extrovert and the 4 basic types consisting of those persons who are thinkers, feelers, sensory and intuitive.In his essay on the stages of life, Jung ventures beyond childhood into early adulthood and the expansion of the self into sexual desires and masculine and feminine traits and how after somewhere in the 40's there begins a contraction of the self where men may acquire more feminine traits and women more masculine. In the second half of life less is needed to educate his conscious will but more aim towards the inner being, until old age where one leaves the rational self and retreats into the psyche as children yet in a different sense.Jung acknowledges the validity of Freud and Adler and their valuable contributions, yet Jung sees Freud's sexual reduction to all neurosis as limiting, as well as Adler's will to power over inferiority as the sole cause. Both views have proven themselves as valid in many cases, yet Jung finds there is far much more levels in what he calls \\"value intensities,\\" which underlie many complexes.Jung also briefly goes into the archaic man's interpretation of all chance events having external meanings and causes, or as causal occurrences and the contrast of the modern man's ability to see the majority of chance and unexplainable events as the human imagination, as the perception of the human. Also the same ability of assumptions in the archaic man, can be seen in the modern who uses science as the foundation over the supernatural.Jung's essay on psychology and literature is my favorite essay. It hits on something I both think of and am affected by almost every day. I found this entirely meaningful and very much profound. In this he writes of two types of writers; those that explain all they write of and those that have visions where their writing is obscure and needs the psychologist to read into. It is those visionaries that are the most inspiring. Here there exists those as in The Shepherd of Hermas, in Dante, in the second part of Faust, in Nietzsche's Dionysian exuberance, in Wagner's Nihelungenriing, in Spitteler's Olympischer Fruhling, in the poetry of William Blake, in the lpnerotomachia of the monk Francesco Colonna, and in Jacob Boehme's philosophic and poetic stammerings.Jung speaks of the human intuition that points to things that are unknown and hidden, and by our very nature are secret and that throughout human history this unfathomable primordial source of creative experience been expressed in images, as in the sun-wheel, in attempting to point to this. The artist and poet will resort to mythology and images which only appear to occur in dreams, cases of insanity, narcotic states and eclipses of consciousness.\\"A great work of art is like a dream; for all its apparent obviousness it does not explain itself and is never unequivocal. A dream never says; \\"you ought,\\" or \\"this is the truth.\\" It presents an image in much the same way as nature allows a plant to grow, and we must draw our own conclusions.\\" p. 171I really can't even begin to touch on all the vital, significant and soul inspiring information that is loaded in the pages of this book and I think as I try I am taking away from what's written far better than what I'll ever write. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Modern man in search of a soul","review":"I have always been deeply suspicious of the field of psychology. While I may not go so far as Richard Feynman did when he referred to them as the &quot;modern day counterparts to witchdoctors,&quot; the discipline does make me rather nervous (if pushed to extremes).That said, I have always respected Jung as an intellectually honest scientist. I may not agree with all his views, but I appreciate that fact that he is not the usual run-of-the-mill sterotyping pigeon-holer (as most psychologists are). His concept of the collective unconscious (whether it is correct or not) is rather fascinating. I do believe there is something to it, as these common archetypal images incessantly end up in our dreams and mythologies. It is not by chance that Joseph Campbell was so influenced by Jung's ideas as to incorporate many of them into his exegesis of mythology.The present book is my all-time favorite book that is written in the psychology field. The book covers a diverse set of topics which Jung engages with his remarkable acumen. Some of the issues raised are the problems with psychotherapy, the contrasts between his views and those of Freud's (which led to their falling out), psychology and literature, and the spiritual problems of modern man.One of the most interesting chapters of the book is entitled &quot;Archaic Man.&quot; Jung details the psyche of tribes in such places as sub-Saharan Africa and New Guinea. Many of these cultures live the same way today that their ancestors lived thousands of years ago. Their psychological state, like their way of life, has been frozen in time. In essence, they are much the same as primitive man; the same as our own forefathers. Jung dicusses how they tend to explain everything via supernatural happenings. Much of the &quot;reasoning&quot; is anti-logic and extremely ad-hoc. However, Jung points out how such a dangerous and volatile envioronment as the jungle may coerce most anyone into thinking in ways which we &quot;civilized&quot; people would interpret as superstitous.One of the underlying themes of the book is how we as a human race have become overly-logical today. It may be that primitive tribes may have something to teach us, after all. Somehow, we have descended into apathy after existing for thousands of years as a race that explained everything via the supernatural. This book is a wonderful dissection of the post-modern current state. It is highly recommend for any modern man in search of a soul."},{"Title":"Modern man in search of a soul","review":"_Modern Man in Search of a Soul_ is the first book you should read by Jung. That is not to say that it is particularly easy; it is by no means a watered-down layman's version of Jung. This is Jung at full intensity. It is an ideal introduction simply because it deals with his more accessable concepts, such as the actual practice of psychotherapy, the doctor-patient relationship, the types of things a doctor should say to his patients, ect. It also deals with broader sociological issues and does not get bogged down with esoteric concepts such as alchemy and ancient mythology. Overall, I would say this is a perfectly crafted philosophical/psychological work. It is potent, miserly, well-written, well-translated, and never gets bogged down with unreadable, esoteric sections. It is not as far-reaching and revolutionary as some of Jung's works, but it is a magnificent work of art pared down to the absolute essentials. Overall it is one of the top five books ever written, by any author, from any genre or time period. Also, as a side note, I would recomend _Psychotherapy East and West_ by the American author Alan Watts as a companion piece to Jung's _Modern Man in Search of a Soul_."},{"Title":"Modern man in search of a soul","review":"This book is page after page of intelligent insight into the psyche of man. He oscillates back an forth between practical understanding of self and others, and therapy scenarios between doctor and patient. This book exemplifies the kind of thought that will elevate and evolve the common man beyond what we are and have been. He illuminates the logical next steps forward in personal evolution by sharing what amounts to his intimate knowledge of the human condition. Jung gives credit to his audience in that he trusts us to follow his thought with understanding and one feels growing responsiblity with every newly illuminated concept. Please enjoy this book.

The book is just as relevant now, if not more so.In one of the essays from this book, Jung accurately predicted today's raging \\"cultural battles\\" between proponents of so called \\"ID\\" theory and those who espouse Evolution, when he said, correctly, that natural science has for all practical purposes shot down the whole notion of anything \\"magical\\" or \\"supernatural\\" about the psyche. It's puzzling that in light of the overwhelming mountain of scientific evidence to the contrary, a vast majority of people in the U.S. still believe in \\"eternal life\\", and \\"heaven\\" and \\"hell\\".Maybe if those who believe in whatever religion they think is the only true religion could loosen up a little, and realize that all religions are organized, but slightly different interpretations of our collective conscious handed down to us through the ages, we might not have problems like 9/11 and ongoing wars, not to mention the ugly politics in this country, all driven by the sentiment \\"My God is the only right God\\".While indirectly discounting the ideas of \\"heaven\\" and \\"hell\\", as those terms, or their endless variations are commonly defined in most of the world's religions, Jung does point out that there is still a mysterious quality about thoughts, feelings, emotions, etc. separate and apart from \\"reason\\". Maybe that \\"spot\\" is where the \\"soul\\" or \\"spirit\\" truly resides.If there were a way for people to find this within themselves, they might just find \\"God\\" at last. And if this type of personal, inward looking belief system could be more widely developed, we, as humans, might find better ways to get along.Not to rain on anyone's religious parade, but the religions \\"du jour\\" (or of the current times), will be no more relevant millenia from now (or sooner?) than the religions espoused by the Greeks, the Romans, the Zoroastrians, Druids, or the Pagans before us.Having said that, we're damned if we have religion and damned if we don't (no pun intended), because one argument that Jung makes for religion being beneficial for society is that if we didn't have religion, God only knows whether we'd all kill each other or not (once again, no pun intended).Jung's bottom line argument is that you're not going to find God in your local synagogue, church, temple, or mosque, in spite of our collective conscious efforts being channeled toward those places."},{"Title":"Modern man in search of a soul","review":"Modern Man in Search of a Soul is extremely dense but also extremely rewarding.

For those who take the time to head and understand the deep and philosophical questions that Jung answers about life and psychology, your view on life will truly be transformed.\\" The needs and the necessities of individuals vary.

Jung is perhaps psychology's most free and original thinker. Perhaps not...However, it is books like this that demonstrate Jung's ability to think outside of the box and examine critically those things that his contemporaries failed to critically examine. I truly believe that Jung has not gained the acceptance he deserves in psychology as a result of his telic thinking/conceptualizing, which appears to many psychologists, who rely on a Newtonian scientific framework (failing to realize that advances have been made in scientific perspectives), as unscientific. In this book, Jung takes aim at and provides justification for seeing difficulties in many of the more cherished \\"scientific\\" perspectives and providers counterarguments to forward a more positive direction. Unfortunately, enough people have not read this gem. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"East Asia: the Modern Transformation","review":"A History of East Asian Civilization, Volumes One and Two:(1) East Asia: The Great Tradition (1960).(2) East Asia: The Modern Transformation (1965).***(3) East Asia: Tradition and Transformation (1978). A condensation, rather then a continuation, of (1) and (2).The SECOND volume of the series, East Asia: The Modern Transformation, was designed as a continuation of East Asia: The Great Tradition, but they have a chronological overlap of several centuries: the first volume traces TRADITIONAL China through the Ch'ing dynasty and Japan through the Tokugawa period, while the second volume sees the MODERNIZING phase as beginning with \\"The Coming of the Europeans\\" to East Asia as early as the 16th century. This is a good strategy for presentation, but we should be careful not to read \\"modernizing\\" as being equivalent to \\"civilizing.\\" The countries of China, Korea, Japan, and Southeast Asia had as much claim to being civilized as the intruding Westerners. . . Readers interested in this period of cross-fertilization should also check out The Western World and Japan: A Study in the Interaction of European and Asiatic Cultures (1965) by the preeminent Western scholar of Japanese history, George Sansom (book signed as G.B. Sansom; 1883-1965), pp. xvi, 504, xi (index). Although the focus of the work is on Japan, Part One (pp. 1-164) discusses the larger context of \\"Europe and Asia,\\" especially China.While all three books were originally designed with the classroom in mind, I am gradually of the opinion that they are more appropriate for an older class of readers who have had time to develop a taste for history. During the second decade of our lives we tend to be too distracted by SAT scores, term papers, and hormones to see history as much more than the boring memorization of names-and-dates. So when should we start learning about history? Probably during our first decade as children, when we tend to be interested in just about everything.Then, with a little luck, our interest may survive the turbulent second decade. . . .Be all that as it may, East Asia: The Modern Transformation (xvi, 955 pp.-- a full 216 pages more than volume one), is also packed with monochrome illustrations, drawings, maps and charts. The text is divided into 10 chapters, including one each on \\"East and Southeast Asia in the Age of Imperialism,\\" \\"Colonialism and Nationalism in the Peripheral Areas,\\" and \\"East Asia in the New International World.\\" It also includes, as did volume one, a Pronunciation Guide of Chinese [Wade-Giles], Korean and Japanese. This is followed by 8 pages of Bibliography (omitted in East Asia: Tradition and Transformation, probably because of the rapidly expanding number of books and articles in recent decades), and a detailed index (pp. 899-955).Another great bargain!

I have read several of the other O'Reilly books including the Missing Manual's for OS X, but this book really gets into the functions of Panther server. Sure, it is a little late since Tiger is already out, but much of the book still applies to Tiger server. Before buying this book I bought the Peachpit Press Visual QuickPro Guide for Panther Server. It is a pretty good book for someone who has never administered an OS X server or who is uncomfortable with the command line. This O'Reilly book goes way deeper into administering the server. It talks about some 3rd party open source software that is very often helpful in maintaining a server. OS X server provides a lot of services that are derived from open source projects almost all of which have entire O'Reilly books dedicated to them. This book does a nice job of covering what you NEED to know about the services that OS X server provides all in one book.

While I enjoyed both in their own right, they are so different that going from one to the other adds nothing to either.While the movie's most notable qualities are a breath of story and an epic scope, the book is beautiful for its economy of words and distant style. Written in the third person, as opposed to the film's heavy handed first person, the perspective is all knowing, yet reveals few details. The author brings the characters to life to some degree, but what is amazing is that they are interesting given their one dimensionality. The story, short as it is, contains much less of the deep intertwined relations of the movie, but I believe that makes it much improved over the screen version.While everyone focuses on the title story, the other two that are included are also enjoyable. As a read, each of the stories is quite quick and complete. If you are taking a trip in several staggered stints, this is a good book to take along and pass the time."},{"Title":"Legends of the Fall","review":"I was in the Navy in 1983 when I discovered this book lying around the shop. Having nothing else to read on watch at the time I picked it up and became instantly hooked.A prior reviewer made the analogy that Harrison runs a thread of choices: No matter what we decide to do in life we can never be certain of the outcomes. What is important is that we are able to live with the options we choose for ourselves. All three short stories contained in this book explore this theme and the character they exhibit when faced with challenges. It seldom works out how we, the reader, want it to end but like the protaganist we are able to make peace with it.I seldom if ever read a book more than once, but I have read this one at minimum seven times. As a very young man trying to find himself in a huge cold world when I discovered Jim Harrison's work, Legends Of The Fall (And Other Short Stories) became a sort of blueprint for what would follow in my life and how would I meet the challenges: Alcoholism, divorce, death, even my spitituality.The movie follows the story line very closely and for that we can be grateful. The tale is beautiful on its own and punching it up to make the transition would have been a fruitless exercise. That said, the vivid picture Harrison paints throughout while utilizing an economy of words causes the film to pale in comparrison."},{"Title":"Legends of the Fall","review":"Upon watching the film for the first time, I wanted to know more about the characters. The film, although well casted (Pitt,Hopkins,Quin and Ormond),does not do much for the book. The book is a timeless work of art. When reading a book, I tend to feel the pain and suroundings of each chatacter. You can only do this to a point in a film. With the book I was lost in the life, and death of the Ludlow family. It was so wounderful to get inside Tristin and the others and experience what their life was all about. Mr. Harrison has done wounderful works of art. I hope to find more!"},{"Title":"Legends of the Fall","review":"Initially upon reading Harrison's novella, I was disappointed since I wanted so much for it to completely parallel the movie. However, after picking up the story for a second time, my opinions have altered. I found Harrison's straightforward writing to be completely appropriate and rather distinctive. I discovered new depth to several characters who were slighted in the movie. The read was enjoyable and the story is so very memorable."},{"Title":"Legends of the Fall","review":"The book is interesting in that two of the three novellas in it have been made into movies, Revenge, and Legends of the Fall.I'll go on record saying that although I enjoyed the movie, I thought the book was better, although it's not really that long a book. Still, even in a work this short, there are depths that can't really be explored in a 2-hour movie, so if you liked the movie, I would strongly recommend you read the book.Harrison has a direct but poetic style, and his male characters are well-drawn and believable. The women don't have much of a role in his books, but I don't mind that really. Harrison is a writer about old-fashioned masculine virtues and ideals of the sort that perhaps don't exist in our society anymore. But if you want equally well-developed women characters, you'll need to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Legends of the Fall","review":"That two of the three novellas in this book have been produced as motion pictures should tell you something. In fact, when I first read this collection I thought each of the three stories sounded like fleshed-out Hollywood 'treatments'. The writing is tight and concise, yet stunningly poignant. Harrison's true calling is as a poet, and he uses that training to full effect, creating crystal-clear images in the turn of a phrase. The result is never abstract, however; Harrison is also an outdoorsman whose knowledge of nature is equaled by his uncanny ability to portray his characters' surroundings in lucid, even beautiful prose. Read this book. You may become a Harrison adict."},{"Title":"Legends of the Fall","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed all three novellas, particularly the Man Who Gave up His Name. Jim Harrison's writing through out this book is fantastic and very original. I highly recommend this book. It should be noted that this book is NOT the movie, and attempts to compare or critique the book by comparison with the movie is pointless. The movie was based on only one of the stories, and only bits of the story for that matter."},{"Title":"Legends of the Fall","review":"The three novellas by Jim Harrison collected in Legends of the Fall took my breath away when I read them, and made me wonder why in the world it took so long for me to discover Harrison. His language is sparse and clean--reminiscent to a certain extent of Cormac McCarthy's--but it has a musical/poetic rhythm to it that is uniquely his own. His ability to create images, plots, and characters that keep the reader riveted is profound, especially given the fact that he uses (at least in the last two of the three novellas collected here) almost no character dialogue.The publisher's blurb for Legends of the Fall say that the three stories all deal with the theme of revenge, but this strikes me as a paltry characterization of their richness. What the stories do have in common is that the protagonists in each of them suffer a fall from \\"innocence.\\" In Revenge, the main character discovers that the \\"innocence\\" of honest and passionate romantic love can exact a horrific price. In The Man Who Gave Up His Name, the main character loses a sense of who he is after his \\"innocence\\" is shattered by the break-up of a nearly twenty-year marriage. In Legends of the Fall, the main character, an \\"innocent\\" child of the Montana plains, is traumatized by the violence of the world.Yet the fall from innocence in each of these \\"legends\\" isn't hopeless. Life lessons are learned in each case, even if the lesson hurts terribly. This is especially evident in the middle novella. Norstrom, the main character, loses his old identity. But in the losing of it, he acquires a more sensitive appreciation of the everyday. It's as if his loss of self leaves an open, receptive space that wasn't there before.Having said that, though, I think it's a mistake to try to reduce these novellas to a single, overarching theme. They're honest narratives of the complexities of what it means to be human. The characters behave admirably at times, reprehensibly at others. Nothing is cookie-cutter, nothing inauthentically simple. Harrison's faithfulness to the tangled web of human relationships, plus his mastery of his craft, makes these novellas minor masterpieces. I look forward to reading more from him."},{"Title":"Legends of the Fall","review":"THis is a classic novela. Among the best I have ever read. Harrison masters symbolism to represent the division of traditional family values and the modern age of the industrial century.

A masterpiece that even a soldier like myself can enjoy."},{"Title":"Legends of the Fall","review":"Harrison puts on paper many of the feelings and thoughts that we have all had. Our world is violent and beautiful and dreary all at the same time. He is at times harsh, but always honest with himself and his reader."},{"Title":"Legends of the Fall","review":"This film has an excellent ensemble cast which includes Brad Pitt, Julia Ormond, Aidan Quinn, Anthony Hopkins, Henry Thomas and Karina Lombard. They all have excellent performances.This is a complicated story, it reminded me of an epic along the lines of Gone With the Wind. The narration by the Old Cree Scout helps us understand \\"the bear within Tristan\\" and transitions of the film. It keeps the melodrama in perspective, although there are deep desperate angst scenes to digest.Legends of the Fall is a romantic story, set just before World War I and spans through prohibition. It centers on one family through the decades. The movie is narrated by the Colonel's Old Cree Scout, \\"One Stab\\". A strong father, Colonel William Ludlow, who (Anthony Hopkins) and his three sons - each a strong-willed man with clearly different characteristics. Their mother has left to return to the East Coast. She still corresponds and is interested in her family, but in a somewhat cool and \\"friendly separation.\\" So the boys and their father take care of their ranch in Montana. Sort of like Bonanza.The initial scene is when Tristan as a young boy is almost killed by a bear. The bear's claw left something \\"within Tristan\\" that is tied up in the ending. So we see the bear at the beginning and the ending.Spring of 1913 arrives, the youngest son, Samuel (Henry Thomas), returns from an Eastern school with his fiancee, Susannah Finncannon (Julia Ormond). Susannah is the catalyst for all that transpires and ends up with relationships with all the Colonel's sons.Samuel's older brothers have taken over key areas of the ranch business. Alfred (Aidan Quinn) is a manager of the ranch and Tristan (Brad Pitt) is the wild, strong-willed, free spirited, chief wrangler.The First World War calls to the young idealistic Samuel to make a difference and stand for his beliefs. His father disagrees and is tired of wars, but Samuel is strong-willed. His brothers are used to taking care of Samuel and accompany him to give support. Samuel dies on the battlefield. Tristan sees the death and cuts out his heart (frees the spirit) and sends Samuel's heart back to be buried in Montana. Reunited in Montana, Tristan and Susannah become lovers.Tristan's demons and feeling of guilt over Samuel's death cause him to leave the ranch and tour the world. He needs to find himself and heal from the trauma of losing Samuel and the guilt of becoming Susannah's lover. Susannah eventually marries Alfred, who is now a Congressman. When Tristan returns - about the time of Prohibition - he sees Susannah and wishes her well. He then marries a half-breed related to Old Cree and starts a family on the ranch. His father, Colonel Ludlow has had a stroke while he was gone and needs Tristan.Then the story continues getting complicated with suicides, beatings, revenge and all scenes dramatic. The story ends with Tristan as an old man in the woods and the final tie-in with the bear that first affected Tristan's spirit."},{"Title":"Legends of the Fall","review":"I loved this book.

It hit the core of human passion - the darkness and light of it - with a raw and eloquent energy as I'd never even sought before!There are two other novellas in the book - and one of them, REVENGE, has also been portrayed on the screen!

I like the form: these feel almost epic in scope, just not in length.I love Harrison's writing, rather solemn, almost elegiac. His imagery is poetic but unsentimental, which makes sense, since he's also published numerous volumes of poetry. All three stories are told in the third person, and primarily follows one male character and his relationships with others.\\"Revenge\\" takes place in Mexico and the U.S. border states, about a man who falls in love with the wife of a friend, a man with money, authority, and a brutal sense of honor and entitlement. The writing feels old or even timeless. \\"The Man Who Gave Up His Name\\" is more contemporary, following a man's adulthood into the 1970s. Nordstrom is pragmatic, or what his wife called \\"unimaginative,\\" but I found him interesting and increasingly imaginative as his story progresses and he crosses paths with a dangerous man. The third story is \\"Legends of the Fall.\\" I saw the film many years ago. It's often unfortunate to read a book after seeing the movie, since one, you know what's coming, and two, the characters are already seated in your brain as looking and acting a particular way. But this is just so good, centering on Tristan, the middle son of a wealthy rancher in Montana. Tristan is a complicated and endlessly tormented character. He loves, but he leaves, venturing off to sea, or to California, or to Mexico, heeding a call that seems urgent to him. He becomes a bootlegger during Prohibition, which leads to an event that brings senseless grief to many.Don't look for happy endings. These stories are intense in terms of what happens: love and frank sex, betrayal and adultery, lots of death, lots of revenge, lots of murder, lots of vindication. Despite that, the stories are very calm in their telling, and unsensationalized.I'm usually more drawn to female literary authors but I will be looking for more of Harrison's writing."},{"Title":"Legends of the Fall","review":"Legends of the Fall took me back to an era I have always been interested in living in, when men were men and loyalty and friendship were important values. Harrison captures the U.S. West's people and landscape in the early 20th century. His characters are courageous and disturbing and the twists in his plots are riveting. I think the other novellas in this publication are even better than the titled one, particularly \\"Revenge\\". I have just become a fan of Mr. Harrison in the last couple of years after having stumbled on his novel, \\"The Raw and the Cooked: Adventures of a Roving Gourmand\\". Anthony Bourdain's, \\"No Reservations\\", television documentary on the state of Montana featured Jim and the Montana denizens in a most favorable spirit. I just read the Farmer's Daughter novellas and am looking forward to reading more about and from this marvelously adventurous man."},{"Title":"Legends of the Fall","review":"I've heard positive things about Harrison for years, but much as I wanted to enjoy this trio of novellas, I found myself disappointed. While he is capable of turning a beautiful, poetic sentence now and again, Harrison's stories seem obsessed with summarizing instead of actually narrating. He tells you everything everyone is doing and everything they ever have done, ad infinitum. There is no sense of immediacy here, of the present moment unfolding in any significant or meaningful way. He tells you what happened incessantly instead of showing you, which, for me at least, makes it heard to really get invested in what's going on. It also doesn't help that all of the main characters feel like variations on the same stoic, proud, usually well-off guy whose basically has it all. It's too bad because the title story has some real potential and would probably make a killer novel if it was expanded by a few hundred pages, instead the reader is treated to an ornate summary of what in more capable hands (maybe Cormac Mccarthy's?) could be made into compelling literature."},{"Title":"Legends of the Fall","review":"She loves Brad Pitt and everyone else in this movie.

He takes everything back down to earth and to the very individual person. And yet his stories are archetypal. I love James Harrison with a passion. His writing never fails to move me. Even one I saw in movie form before reading."},{"Title":"Legends of the Fall","review":"Legends of the FallExcellent book. The book itself was in new condition. We bought it because we had seen part of the movie and wanted the entire story. We were not disappointed. I went on line to find it and through the Barnes and Noble website located new ones on Amazon.com; where we purchased it. I recommend this book if you like historical novels about the old west."},{"Title":"Legends of the Fall","review":"My only regret in reading Jim Harrison's books is that someday I'll come to read the last book of his that I haven't read. The only thing to do after that one is read will be to find that first book of his and read them all over again."},{"Title":"Legends of the Fall","review":"I read the novella when it was in Esquire magazine when I was 19 years old. I said then, that if I ever had a son his name would be Tristan. My son was born when I was deployed and the doctor had said 'Looks like a baby sister\\" so we hadn't picked out boys's names. My wife named Andrew after my cousin who had died, a truly worthy name. But now that she has watched the movie she says, \\"We would have a Tristan.\\" Mr. Harrison's writing was so poignant, so touching, I couldn't imagine any short story better."},{"Title":"Legends of the Fall","review":"Really liked this book. Has a lot of depth and good characters. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Legends of the Fall","review":"In Legends of the Fall, Jim Harrison has established himself as the best fiction writer of my generation. I am referring to the third of the three novellas in this trilogy, the one entitled Legends of the Fall. (I also loved the second, The Man Who Gave Up His Name, but the first, Revenge, does nothing for me. It is ironic that Revenge was the first to be made into a movie.) With only about five lines of dialogue in the entire story of 75 pages or so, Harrison has created a work of extraordinary power and scope. The characters are unforgettable, the world he describes is incredibly vivid and full of nuances, and the story itself is so moving that I have been compelled to read it at least twenty times. It never loses its appeal. Harrison is the consummate story teller, and that's what Legends is for me -- story telling at its very best. The film with Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins was a huge disappointment -- it missed the true feeling of the book by a mile, largely due to the miscasting of Pitt in the role of Tristan. They might as well have cast Pee Wee Herman (at least it would have been amusing instead of trite). The Man Who Gave Up His Name is also a fabulous tale with a wonderful twist on one of my favorite subjects -- what does it mean to be a success (I wrote a book entitled Beating the Success Trap). In short, Harrison has provided a feast of outstanding reading material that should not be missed by anyone who loves fiction. I give this ten stars!"},{"Title":"Legends of the Fall","review":"There are some books one owns; and other books that own the reader. For some time now I have kept this book near me, for simple saving moments, when I need to find a place of hope to dive into.I always feel rich when I read this book, even if I don't have two dollars to my name. I call that divinepower, the ability to drap ones frame in security and elegance.There are many wrestlings with the almighty dollar in Harrison's writing, maybe that's why I identify with it so much. Sometimes it comes so easily that its best just to give it all away and other times it barely comes at all so why save? There are big questions regarding what does it mean to give up safety and a future for a few moments of adulterated love, and why is it that when the cost is so high that always makes the treasure so much more alluring. If you can't afford a vacation, Harrison will take you there; albeit rather smarmily and with the very same regret you may have felt once enjoying a five thousand dollar vacation you look down to see that not only is your wallet gone, but there are a band of ne'er do wells on their way to see you. So lovely.By far, The Man who Gave Up His Name is such a comical, legendary, and yes, romantic piece; and on conditional terms shall stave the heart. If one is willing to completely let themselves free fall into the orange and navy hued melting sunset narrative that literally bleeds of aching where the days grow lengthier yet simpler as the future approaches, much like a leisurely sea swell; all are ocean view.I first saw the movie \\"Revenge,\\" with Kevin Costner some years ago, and thought, \\"well, that was pretty.\\" - - obviously, the novella is like having a choice between real or fake. I own this book for one reason: Nordstrom. I have dreamt upon this very life change so many times, I dare say it's under option's 1,2, and 3 for things I would do if given the chance.Some women may look at these stories as sexist, and I would caution them to take a second look. Nordstrom, if his character is to be understood is a man whose heart lies within a deep ravine and few can get to it. Still, why punish a man for having sexual yearnings? Yes, there are other Jim Harrison novels where I would agree there is a dash of sexism, yet for Legends, I can make no such call. Certain characters have a crude way of looking at women, and who seem preoccupied with the female anatomy, B.D. comes to mind; however, this is inherent in his character and several other characters do not exhibit the same bawdliness. \\"The Farmer's Daughter,\\" which has just come out, displays an amazing sense of clarity and sensitivity toward the awfulness of Rape and the Post Traumatic Stress that follows. Sarah is a character that Harrison has drawn richely into a Montana framework and that story alone shows a compassion that very few writers attempt much less champion.My advice is to plan on having a good time with this book; like a long sought after fishing trip. First, take off your watch, then forget the time, let your boat drift as she may, and just read.Having a few moments with an American Master is a luxury many can afford within these troubled times, yet some forget the opportunity for grand transcending. A guarantee of sorts: your heart is thirsty for this."},{"Title":"Legends of the Fall","review":"Expected a novel, the tale on which one of my favorite movies was based; in fact, it was one of several short stories/novellas. I did enjoy the stories and characters, however."},{"Title":"Legends of the Fall","review":"My husband loves the entire series by Jim Harrison. I just ordered two more books. They arrived very quickly and I received what I ordered"},{"Title":"Legends of the Fall","review":"Jim Harrison's, Legends of the Fall retains morose and depressive ideals, depicting human nature in all of its negative aspects. The setup of the novel is nothing like the film's sequence in that, the movie only shows a portion of the third and last novella, which also shares the title of the book. There are two additional novellas enveloped in the novel itself, \\"Revenge\\" and \\"The Man who gave Up His Name.\\" All of the novellas relate to the common theme that once a human commits a wrongdoing they head down a long decline of morals, this theme also manifests the title. Harrison repeatedly refers to love as being wonderful and sustaining, but that it creates many more problems. Due to specific tendencies of the book, it is not recommended for everyone.To read these novellas, the reader needs plenty of patience and a dictionary nearby, because Harrison tends to use a higher logic than a casual read. He drags sentences out into long descriptive paragraphs that sometimes go on for pages and has an extensive vocabulary. Although the paragraphs are lengthened by the author's superfluous description, the words are utilized so the descriptions create vivid images of characters and settings in the reader's imagination. This novel would also not be recommended for optimistic readers because the novel's nature would make reading and comprehending even more difficult. Younger, immature readers are also advised to avoid this novel for sexual references and casual drug use. Regarding the fact that there are some good points throughout the novellas, there is absolutely no humor or extended periods of joy in the lives of the characters. If you are prepared for an emotional depressant and have a large amount of time on your hands, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Legends of the Fall","review":"As has been mentioned, this entire book is not \\"Legends of the Fall.\\" It consists of three novellas, that being just one of them. Still, despite their short length, all were engrossing.I found the first (Revenge) and third (Legends of the Fall) stories to be the best by far. The middle story (The Man Who Gave Up His Name) veered off into an almost unbelievable plot twist. It was almost - almost - a somewhat self-indulgent middle age male fantasy.Revenge was far, far superior to the movie. Legends was just as sad and moving as the movie, albeit with slight differences in plot.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Legends of the Fall","review":"I read the title story and dismissed it as a liberal wet dream without purpose or destination or lesson.

The book is not the exhaustive treatment one might expect, but given the secrecy of his subject and the fact that most scholarship has overlooked it, Tzalel has done yeoman work indeed."},{"Title":"Marijuana Questions? Ask Ed: The Encyclopedia of Marijuana","review":"I cannot understand the other reviewer's comment that this book isn't factual. In fact, that is the most absurd thing anyone could say about this classic encyclopedia that addresses many questions that other books tend to leave out. Case in point:Q:I have been growing for 3 years now, and every time my plants start to bud, the leaves turn a reddish purple. What causes this and does it affect the potency of the plant?Ed:There are 3 possible reasons for this:1. The plant is genetically keyed to produce a red or purplish color and it does it as part of the plant's development.2. The plant has suffered a cold spell and suffered from a temporary shortage of Phosphorous (P) with cells as well as in the soli and nutrient mix (which doesn't affect potency or growth). Some plants turn red or purple depending on temperature, red in warm conditions, purple in cold. (my note this is true, it also causes leaves to turn color in the fall due to a drop in evening temp.)3. The plant is suffering from a P deficiency,this could occur either because it is unavailable, or there is a shortage in the medium. Lack of P does not affect potency.Hello...is that factual enough an answer? Those of us who grow tomatoes and other types of plants KNOW Ed's answers are right on the money.

What you get is Ed's answers to questions set forth by the public in his popular High Times magazine column. &quot;Great!&quot; I thought. Just what I need. Something to improve my growing skills.... But wait............The book is full mistakes and errors! As a &quot;type-of-grow-book&quot; it will certainly give you a foundation for cannabis growing logic and a bit about how to solve cannabis problems, but it has a fatal flaw. It appears that the writer has not actually put much of his &quot;Answers&quot; into practice.There are a number of passages that read well and you say to yourself 'wow' that is a great idea. Putting them into practice is another thing all together. For example: a guerrilla grower (someone who grows outside of their own property) asks the author what he can do about predators eating his plants. The author tells him to put up an electrical fence around the plant! (How is he supposed to power the fence? Hot-wire it to an electrical pylon near-by?) But in all fairness the author does follow this up and admits that it is a bit silly and not very 'stealthy', but then he tells us to do something else that quite frankly does not work. It appears that the answers to the questions have been rushed and not well thought-out.I have also noticed that the book was written in the late 80's. Sorry but there are better books out there on the cannabis subject that are more up-to-date. Do not expect to find new techniques mentioned in this book. What you can expect is 80's material that has a lot of holes in it. The back of this book tells us that the author has been giving out &quot;expert advice&quot; that has been used by millions of gardeners. I have to say that if this is the standard of advice he has given out then those \`millions of gardeners' are certainly not getting very far with their grow. There are only 3 or 4 photographs which give us a good example of what a proper flowering cannabis plant should look like and yield. All the other pictures are sub-standard. Most of the picture suggest that only 1/8 of an Ounce is the standard yield for indica plants, when in fact it is closer to 1 Ounce and more.But I do confess. I often turn to this book for its short but very interesting glossary. Pages 265 - 272 are really the meat of this book and that is about it. Go elsewhere for better information.

He wrote it with Laurence Shames after learning of an impending, untimely death.He was an extraodinarily creative person, always able to see the context of every situation. Life rewarded him well financially but, most of all, with an uncanny sense of where we fit in the course of our lives.This book is filled with large-scale insights, many of which will be useful to each of us. Even knowing him, I found the book a worthwhile read. I personally grew from the &quot;read,&quot; as I'm sure you will. It may reset your values as well as your expectations regarding living.Laurence Shames is skillful not only with words but also with conveying ideas. His book reads very well."},{"Title":"Not Fade Away: A Short Life Well Lived","review":"It's hard to describe the mixture of emotions that accompany reading this masterful book by Laurence Shames and Peter Barton. It was Barton's knowledge of his impending death that was the impetus for the book. Barely fifty, with young children, a happy marriage and tons of money, Barton chose to face his mortality through leaving a memoir. Shames became Barton's collaborator, co-author, interpreter and ultimately friend. There are moments of humor, heartbreaking sadness and revelation. It would be impossible to read this book without evaluating your own feelings toward life and death, family, friends, happiness and setting the right priorities for yourself. It's a brave and beautiful book that shouldn't be missed."},{"Title":"Not Fade Away: A Short Life Well Lived","review":"This book is about the life and death of Peter Barton, a very successful entreprenour who lived life fully, yet died early at the age of 51 from stomach cancer.This story is told in alternative chapters by Barton and Laurence Shames, a writer who befriended Barton at the end of Barton's life in order to help him express his feelings and emotions about his impending death.This small book contains very big ideas. Barton makes you understand how being wealthy doesn't automatically give you the best medical care, and it certainly doesn't protect you against death. He brings home in this very personal way how health and family are the things that are important, and that the end of life is a complicated, individual experience, full of reflection and introspection.I thought that it was \\"gutsy\\" and generous of Barton to want to share his experiences with the world, and one gets the impression from the book that that is the kind of individual he was.When you finish - you can do it easily in a few hours - you are left appreciative of the things that you normally take for granted, and can briefly try to comprehend the concept of living in the moment.I say briefly because, alas, I think we are hardwired not to be able to live our lives the way Peter Barton did at the end of his life...living in the here and now and giving up the foolish pursuits that drive us daily. I think that is why books like this are important, so that we can read them and get back to what is important, and try to live our lives thinking about these issues and thus be \\"ready\\", when we face the end of our own lives.Recommended, but I think I would have liked a little more information about Barton's illness and treatment although I understand that it was a conscious decision not to include that in the book."},{"Title":"Not Fade Away: A Short Life Well Lived","review":"One thing that attracted me to this autobiography was, the way that Peter Barton Embraced his life not only when he was healthy, but as well as when he was diagnosed with cancer. The way he describes the terrible side of cancer, and how it can easily put a person into an enormous depression. However, he chose to fight it and face up to it. He admits freely the fact that he was scared at times, but also grateful at others. Finally, his story will make you realise how wonderful life can be, even when the road gets tough. Unfortunately, Peter Barton is no longer among us, but I am sure that his story will show you, just how much he respected and loved every moment of his life. It is an honour for me to recommend this book to anyone who is looking for inspirational writing."},{"Title":"Not Fade Away: A Short Life Well Lived","review":"I have to say, I bought this somewhat expecting to be uplifted, and to gain some insight on life, death, dying. I'm not much for self-help type stuff, but the blurbs of a \\"life well lived\\" definitely appealed to me. I've always run full-tilt towards......whatever presented itself! Having just lost my dearest friend, and pooch, and being single in my early 30's (in LA, no less), heading home for T-day to take on aging grandparents with fading memory, crazy in-laws, etc.....strangely enough, this was perfect for the plane ride back to LA. At times, I became a bit annoyed by the bad-boy swagger of Barton, yet I realized three hours into the flight that I had dog-eared more pages for later reference, insight, or raw truthfulness, than I normally do. If you can set aside a difference in lifestyles - because he truly lived a unique life - some of the insights and hindsights are truly raw and real. This is a strange book in that it's a good, easy read, with nuggets of wisdom that are absolutely blatant and brilliant. This seems to be someone who - maybe to some of his peers - didn't appreciate all that he had. Yet, reading this book, he clearly appreciated all the moments - good and bad, for what they were. And this book made me re-affirm my joy of leaving the airport and putting the top down on the car, cracking open a great bottle of wine, appreciating my neighbors: all things I do normally, but things I'll make sure never to take for granted.Huh, not sure this is a good review, but it's the way the book made me feel. So, there you have it. It's good reading and good advising. Not so neatly wrapped up, but, maybe it's not supposed to be."},{"Title":"Not Fade Away: A Short Life Well Lived","review":"For Peter Barton, a maverick businessman whose career has been characterized by creativity and billion-dollar partnerships, the psychology of cancer was difficult to digest. Unlike most business agreements he has brokered in the media industry, the deal between a terminal patient and his cancer appeared to be a zero-sum game, and the forty-something year old media mogul struggled to bridge the disconnect.Hardly a person to let death dictate the terms of his legacy, Barton preserved his insights on the matter before he left the living. As such, Not Fade Away -- Barton's chronicle of the last days of his life -- is an attempt at coming to terms with one's finality. The chapters switch back and forth from Barton's first-person narrative and the observations of Barton by a professional writer assigned to shadow the terminal patient during the last stages of his life.Despite the subject matter, Not Fade Away is an uplifting read because even as death closes in around Barton, we see that life reveals itself in all its sublime beauty. Such a paradox, namely that death is infused with life, leads Barton to embrace both the fact of his imminent death and the ever-present life that surrounds him. Barton reformulates his understanding of the linear aspect of the past, present, and the future, and realizes their convergence and singularity. Just as death is a part of living, we are not fixed to a single point in time; the past, present, and the future are manifest in the now.Although such notions are not terribly original, Barton's honesty and courage in sharing his innermost fears and doubts during the last days of his life provide a refreshing look at life, death, and perhaps what it means to \\"not fade away\\" in a language that resonates with timeless relevance."},{"Title":"Not Fade Away: A Short Life Well Lived","review":"Peter Barton spent his all-too-brief, brilliant life like a gambling addict let loose in a casino. He didn't taste experience --- he devoured it in great chomps and gulps of adventure, leaps in imagination, success in business ventures, and deep family commitment.He played away his early years as an anti-war hippie, experiencing to the fullest extent the joys and freedoms of the 1970s. But by the time he reached that life altering, ominous &quot;over thirty&quot; hurdle, he began to think seriously about his future. He took a reality check, buckled down at Harvard Business School, and projected his enormous intellectual and physical energies into the world of ideas. As a visionary on the threshold of the cable television era, Barton co-founded Liberty Media, which pioneered with the Discovery Channel, Fox Sports, The Learning Channel, Black Entertainment Television, and STARZ.Along the way to his meteoric success, Barton met and married his wife and started a family. Once he knew they were financially secure, having made some profitable stock market investments, he felt free to explore new horizons and stepped down as President of Liberty Media. Barton was about to launch a whole new career in the fledgling Internet sphere when life's ultimate reality check arrived via cell phone in the middle of a meeting with Yahoo executives in Silicon Valley. It was Barton's doctor calling from Denver. He had been ignoring a vague but persistent stomachache and had gone in for some tests. He remembers the call this way:&quot;'I need you to come to my office to discuss this with me. You have cancer.' Just like that. That terse, that quick; that casual. I don't remember getting up, but suddenly I'm standing. The Yahoo board of directors is staring at me. Maybe they understand that something bad has happened; maybe they're just wondering what could possibly be more important than going head to head with AOL.&quot;Life is suddenly brought into sharp focus for Barton.NOT FADE AWAY is narrated by Barton in collaboration with mystery writer and novelist Laurence Shames. It is a diary, a memoir and a biography. Shames, who didn't know Barton personally but was introduced to him by a mutual friend, says that Barton's first intent was to leave something of himself for his three children, ages 14, 11 and 9.But as the relationship between the two men intensified during the last months of Barton's life, the idea behind the book grew to become much more. Shames saw the enormous humor and deep affection Barton felt for not just his family but for life, and he wanted to bring the depth of feeling that Barton was experiencing to the public --- not only his exuberance for life but his growing insights into himself as the inevitable drew near.NOT FADE AWAY isn't a sad story or one filled with angst and foreboding. It is a story that deals with love, success, friendships, business relationships, war protests, the simple joys of parenting and the simple-minded joys of college pranks.Barton jams with Sha Na Na, rock climbs at Robert Redford's Sundance Ranch, and deals craps in Vegas. He reminisces about his boyhood and relationship with his father, who also died young, and rejoices over the fact that he lived longer than him. He then writes of the self-discovery that arrives when one's mortality is brought sharply into focus. Almost reluctantly he discusses briefly the pain and encumbrances of illness, but he focuses on separating his mind from his demanding body, trying to prevent the physical wreck, which he likens to a rusted-out old car, from becoming who he really is. Barton fiercely denied to Shames early in their relationship that he was spiritual or religious. This amuses Shames, and as the process moves on, Barton's deep core of strength and belief in &quot;something more&quot; begins to shine through.NOT FADE AWAY deals with life at its most glorious, and the end of life at its most transcendent. Perhaps readers of this often humorous, deeply honest, adventurous and courageous story will come away feeling as columnist Dave Barry did when he said, &quot;Sooner or later, we'll all make the journey Peter Barton took; now, thanks to him, it doesn't look so scary.&quot;--- Reviewed by Roz Shea"},{"Title":"Not Fade Away: A Short Life Well Lived","review":"This book is one of my all time favorites.

And what a luxury to be able to have a writer extoll your virtues for your friends and family before your untimely death; an account relatively unbalanced by reflections of painful learning experiences, regret, humility in the face of enormous fortune, notions of how one made have made life better (or worse) for others outside of one's immediate family, etc. I found this 'life affirming' book quietly disturbing; a high gloss two dimensional portrait of another yuppie, his unknowingly self centered and self congratulatory values (heavily pandered to by the baby boomer writer), extolled for 'living large' rather than living reflectively or compassionately, and still, up to the moment of his death, unchallenged in his obliviousness to the shadow he and his self congratulatory-generation still cast.

They called this living large.He didn't serve his country, didn't invent television, didn't invent the internet, didn't devote his life selflessly to find a cure for cancer that would help all humanity, but he did join John Malone, the founder of Liberity Media, and made a fortune doing it. He was paid a fortune for helping to create a product that is consumed mainly by children and adults of limited perception. He didn't do much to pay society back for his good fortune.What this book illustrates is that he was a boomer to the end, self-absorbed, self-indulgent, and self-important.

(I also have an MBA.)I have read through the 38 reviews here and find it interesting that some people apparently read the book and think that Laurence Shames had cancer and died!! Sometimes I guess you wonder if people read the same book you did!"},{"Title":"Not Fade Away: A Short Life Well Lived","review":"Pete and I were classmates at Loomis. The recommendation to read his book came during our recent 35th reunion. I have two observations after reading it: the first, is my regret at not having kept up with Pete. He lived his life fully and always had a lot of fun. He was irreverent, a trait I admire. The second is his admonition to slow down and enjoy the &quot;now&quot; that life offers. It has given me pause as I reflect upon my own life and values. While most in my generation have assumed responsibilities that require more than the narrow focus of living entirely for the moment, Pete's experiences in the last year of his life show that responsibility and enjoying the now can go hand in hand: after all, today may be all you have."},{"Title":"Not Fade Away: A Short Life Well Lived","review":"I first learned of Peter Barton's death in the quarterly alumni news letter that I receive from the Loomis School.I ordered the book when I saw mention of it. I was several years behind Peter, but knew him since it was not a large school.He was an athletic and confident senior, as I remember him, and oddly after all these years I can still recall his face.The book details his life with candor,and I enjoyed reading his story; and I was saddened to learn of his death from a carcinoma.I thought the book was well worth the time. There are a few denigrating reviews in this list at Amazon, but I think they miss the point. He may have been fortunate, or lucky, in many ways, but he appreciated that- many of us do not.I do indeed recommend this book."},{"Title":"Not Fade Away: A Short Life Well Lived","review":"This book is a must gift to anyone you know that needs a good dose of reality and humanity.

I like that the authors traded off narrating chapters, which is an interesting spin on writing a memoir/biography. I especially like Barton's self-reflective honesty, honesty that's helped me out several times when my lack of confidence threatened to \\"give me away\\" to associates and clients.Although Barton was famous as a pushy, brash, and successful businessman, few people knew he could also be unsure of himself. He says: \\"(There was) a truth that at the time I hid even from myself, but that now, with the bracing candor that comes with being close to death, I can readily admit: I had a lot of bluster but very little confidence.\\"He also says: \\"There's no surprise in a truly brave person acting brave; it's when the erstwhile coward rises to the occasion that we feel pride in our humanity. Similarly, it's not great accomplishment for a genuinely confident person to seem confident. But I had to work at it every time. I had to suck up fear over and over again. (This, by the way, is a trait I seem to share with many of the most successful people I have met in business.)\\"Barton's thoughts make me feel more secure with my insecurity, and they reassure me I don't have to be confident to be successful."},{"Title":"Not Fade Away: A Short Life Well Lived","review":"Peter Barton died of cancer at the age of fifty one. He and Lawrence Shamis have written a short book that describes his life changing battle with cancer and his struggle to accept death.You come to know Peter and understand how his battle with cancer changed him. Peter is an experimenter, an adventurer, and an optimist. His story is worth reading for those trying to come to grips with why we are living."},{"Title":"Not Fade Away: A Short Life Well Lived","review":"This book is about Peter Barton and he has written half of it and the biography part is by Laurence Shames. My personal philosophy is pretty well set in stone, but for a younger person, this book should be a good primer in how to live...well. Mr. Barton tried to do many things and did do them well. His serious occupation did not develop until his early 40's (along with his marriage) and the story of how he arrived there is very interesting. He was responsible for much of what you see on cable television today and his ideas of what to look for in finding a job for yourself is enlightening. His attitude of life is superb and you should get a lot out of reading about his stairway to the stars."},{"Title":"Not Fade Away: A Short Life Well Lived","review":"Do not listen to russp61 from Atlanta, I loved this book. Just read it; I cried at the end. It is life changing and like Tuesdays with Morrie only from a younger persons point of view.I would write more, but I have to go. This wondeful work of writing is well worth picking up."},{"Title":"Not Fade Away: A Short Life Well Lived","review":"Not Fade Away was given to me by an older friend of mine after we had a conversation about Death and its meaning. He loved it.I really liked it.Peter Barton lived a life richer in drama, accomplishment, struggle, and intensity than most everyone. His memoirs that chronicle his journey to death are enlightening, funny at times, and very heavy at others.I appreciated the reminder this book offers. It helped re-remind me that those things in life we tend to take for granted (our health, our relationships, the beauty around us everyday) are so very valuable.As a spiritualist, this book will be interesting; you'll see a very objective, very rational corporate raider lean spiritual.As an atheist/agnostic/rationalist, this book will be interesting; you'll see a very objective, very rational corporate raider lean spiritual.Like they say, &quot;there are no atheists in foxholes&quot;.

Great discription and funny and amusing in some places too."},{"Title":"Not Fade Away: A Short Life Well Lived","review":"I was walking through the book store and stumbled upon Not Fade Away. I am very thankful that Petter Barton was generous enough to write this book. I started the book and didn't move until I stopped the read. The book is most definitely worth reading , no matter your point in life. I think it would be a superb graduation gift to a young person. It disturbs me to read the small group of negative book reviews . How could anyone with a heart not thank Peter Barton and his family for sharing this journey."},{"Title":"Not Fade Away: A Short Life Well Lived","review":"So rich an experience is this remarkable work that I find myself sitting back and marveling at the life that was Peter Barton. His love, his courage, his restless embrace of the nearly unimaginable reality of his all-too-early death, helps Peter speak to us about the road we have yet to travel with the confidence of a seasoned guide. This book offers the reader so much to absorb that it takes a second reading to truly appreciate the gift the reader is being given. This is a book to relish, to share, but not to relinquish. Thank you Larry Shames and Laura Barton for sharing Peter with us."},{"Title":"Not Fade Away: A Short Life Well Lived","review":"I picked this book after hearing about it on the way to work one morning on Imus. I would say it falls into the same vein of Tuesdays with Morrie and How We Die in that shows the courage of accepting our own eventual demise. I actually have picked this book up and down over the course of the months as it sometimes leaves some deep thinking on the subject. What is very moving is that, as Peter's condition worsens, he is more concerned for how his family feels rather than himself. A good book that shows that life is to be lived for the moment because it is gone before you blink an eye."},{"Title":"Not Fade Away: A Short Life Well Lived","review":"I happened upon an advance uncorrected proof of this book quite by accident. I read a few sentences and thought, \\"Why not give it a read?\\" Well, I have to say that the book - both the writing and the content - are absolutely wonderful. Laurence Shames gets all the emotion and humility and pride down flawlessly in the pages of this book. You can't help but wish you had known Peter Barton after reading this."},{"Title":"Not Fade Away: A Short Life Well Lived","review":"I have never read a more approachable yet profound book. I have never read as entertaining yet life altering book. It is not just the story of Peter Barton: it is a story about us all--our youth, out careers, our family choices, our mortality. I laughed, I smiled, I cried. I no longer look at the world the same way. I try to balance my life better. I try to make wiser choices. I often fail; but the book at least has me thinking about how to spend my limited time and how to be more gentle with myself and those around me."},{"Title":"Not Fade Away: A Short Life Well Lived","review":"I just finished reading \\"Not Fade Away\\" for the second time. The first time I read it a couple of years ago I remember taking it very slowly because I felt each word was so important. Usually a very fast reader, I would stop and go over sentences because I didn't want to miss anything. Impactful ideas were there in every sentence.I just finished reading it again because I wanted to see how it stood up against \\"The Last Lecture.\\" And it held up very well. The two books are by (and about) similarly energetic, optimistic men dying of cancer, but they tell very different tales in different styles. I'm glad to say that there's an honesty in this book that wears well with time. Re-reading it again made me very glad that I recommended it last year to a friend whose brother was dying of cancer. They say the best gifts come in small packages, and that's certainly true here. Powerful and enjoyable! Read it."},{"Title":"Not Fade Away: A Short Life Well Lived","review":"As a leukemia survivor, married to a wonderful spouse and with three young children, Peter's memoir rings almost too true to me. I actually met Peter a few times in the 80s through one of his dearest friends whom I dated for a short time. Peter was never so enthusiastic as he was when talking about Laura, his soon-to-be bride. You could tell that family devotion, and a strong conscience was deeply rooted in him from an early age.The basic values given to him by his parents, particularly the sacrifices his mother made, were at the heart of this book. He sacrifices his own personal privacy and makes a gift to his children and others coping with cancer. He shows us what the process feels like. Knowledge, however sad, is somehow empowering.As a cancer patient, I have plenty of time to reflect and read. If you don't, then I say read it. You won't regret it. This book is at times intoxicating and high-flying, philosophical and deadly real. It is about life, much more than it is about death.Peter may have not thought that he was a survivor, but he was--every day he lived. Here's hoping that Peter's life, however brief, will never fade away in the hearts and minds of all he loved."},{"Title":"Not Fade Away: A Short Life Well Lived","review":"Mr. Shames wrote a poignant and very real account of the disease that took his life at a very early age. I read this a couple years ago, and just re-read after hearing the story of a \\"younger\\" person stricken with cancer. This book will inspire, but will also force the reader to consider; \\"What would I do? Would I have that much grace and zest and enthusiasm?\\" The dirt-nap gets us all, this book demonstrates how one man dealt with his impending demise---and teaches valuable life-lessons that we could all use. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Not Fade Away: A Short Life Well Lived","review":"This is an excellent book by someone who finds he is dying and begins to really assess his life and treasure moments. It's not maudlin and does not dwell on the medical side as much as it focuses on the spiritual side (not religious) of discerning life's meaning. I believe this is a must read for people who need to get a quick dose of perspective. Too often we get mired down in the trivial and we miss the real importance of the every day moments. Sounds trite perhaps, but I know what I learned from watching my best friend die in her early 50s. Sometimes cancer is the wake-up call."},{"Title":"Not Fade Away: A Short Life Well Lived","review":"It was bound to happen: Now that the Baby Boom generation is ballooning itself toward that good night, there is -- and will continue to be -- a whole new energy in the topic of what it means to die, and what it means to be dying. En masse, we're beginning to lose our loved ones, each other, and ourselves.It's absolutely consistent with Peter Barton's life that he tells the story of his last project with a certain amount of &quot;yee-ha!&quot; to his spirit and voice. And I think it's wonderfully consistent with the spirit of our generation that there should be a heartbreakingly beautiful book about dying that is more about that absolute over-the-top thrill of living.I hope it becomes one of The Most Important Books of our times, setting the tone for the way we as a generation choose to experience the next four or more decades."},{"Title":"Not Fade Away: A Short Life Well Lived","review":"When I saw Laurence Shames interview on televison last week, only having caught a portion of it -- for some inexplicable reason I felt compelled to read this book. I mentioned my interest in reading this book to a few people, and got some sideways glances...I'm sure they were wondering why a pregnant woman would be drawn to a memoir of a dying man? Shouldn't I be reading something a bit livlier? I knew just enough about the remarkable life of Peter Barton that I really wanted to know, what were his final thoughts?This book is about the adventure of being alive, the choices we make and the risks we take that make it incredible. There are pearls of wisdom in this book -- his remarkable insight into business, parenthood, love and of course the eventual struggle we all will face with our own mortality. It's the type of book you finish, and then just sit there for awhile soaking it in -- feeling a bit changed from having read it."},{"Title":"Not Fade Away: A Short Life Well Lived","review":"Truly one of the best books I have read in years. Peter Barton had an extrordinary life! The one question I am asking is why this book is not on the bestsellers list! All in all a truly wonderful book. He has very interesting thoughts about death. HE just sees it as another adventure waiting on the other side. He made smart moves in life and that is what got him in the position he was at the time of his death. LIght in some palces heavy in others. Peter Barton and Laurence Shames truly did a wonderful job!"},{"Title":"Not Fade Away: A Short Life Well Lived","review":"I had the opportunity to develop life-improving and life-saving medical devices for terminally ill cancer patients in the early 1980s. The time I spent with people who were dying became THE touchstone for the rest of my life. These fine people, more than any other group, taught me the truths of life and how to live it with purpose and meaning.If you (most people I have met do) are in need of an Extreme Makeover when it comes to your life, \\"Not Fade Away\\" does not disappoint. Some of the takeaways include:\\"When you really grasp death, it is one of life's defining moments...nothing looks quite the same again...If you've always got your health, you can always make money. But all the money in the world can't buy back your health.You will never accomplish anything if you're afraid to look bad trying.And, why do we lose that feeling, that sense of wonder, for so much of our lives?\\"Redeem yourself...and your life with this very thoughtful and provocative book."},{"Title":"Not Fade Away: A Short Life Well Lived","review":"Laurence Shames and Peter Barton have written one of the best books since Tuesdays with Morrie. I enjoyed every page and found Mr. Barton's life and dying experience to be funny, sad and touching. We are given the opprotunity to see inside of a man who worked hard and had &quot;everything&quot; only to die at a young age. However, he provides the reader with insight as he goes through the dying process. What he learned about his parents, his wife, children, himself and life. What really becomes important when you know your time is limited and how it effects how you send that time.After reading this book my only questions was why has someone not gotten the word out about this touching story? If you like Tuesday with Morrie you will love Not Fade Away..you go way from reading the book with a greater knowledge of what we all will have to face day.Mr. Barton has blessed us with his experience.

I love it... very inspiring."},{"Title":"Not Fade Away: A Short Life Well Lived","review":"This is a great book. I bought it to read when a friend of mine was suffering with cancer, along with a book by Father Jim Willig, \\"Lessons from the School of Suffering.\\" Both helped me better understand what my friend was going through.Peter Barton was, most obviously, a tremendously charismatic character with a zest for life. The author does a masterful job of telling Peter's story, not dwelling too heavily on anything irrelevant so as to portray a clear vision of the man in the mind's eye of the reader. We follow Peter from childhood through his successes and eventual brilliant career with Liberty Media to his heartbreaking experience with stomach cancer, a devastating disease that befell him in the prime of his life.After reading Mr. Shames' book, I wished I could have met Peter Barton. \\"What a guy, what a tragedy,\\" I thought. I found a video interview with Peter on the Internet, made during his time at Liberty Media, and I could see the magic Shames portrayed in words. He appeared to be every bit the energetic, charismatic entrepreneur with a love for life and a smile that could melt snow or sell you ocean-front property in Boise, Idaho. \\"So long, Peter,\\" or should I say, \\"So short, Peter?\\" You shall not fade away.Easy reading and a well-told story. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Not Fade Away: A Short Life Well Lived","review":"It's been a few years since I read this book. I still think about the story and suggest the book to my friends who may be at a crossroads in life. I've often contemplated whether I would prefer to \\"go out in a flash\\" or to have an illness that allowed me time to know that death was coming. This story will give reason to pause and reflect both during and after you've consumed it. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Not Fade Away: A Short Life Well Lived","review":"I have given this book to several friends when they have helped me or needed some help themsleves in those dark moments in life. Will make you cry mostly joyful tears when you recognize something or someone in your life that is relative to what is on the page. Not phony or trumped up. Ignore the few moments when the \\"ghost author\\" interjects himself. The voice of the man makes you know him, feel joy with him, but never pity him. A great emotional read from a good man dying."},{"Title":"Cruel Doubt","review":"Bonnie Von Stein 's life was perfect - married to her heart's true love; two nearly grown children; and forever stretching out in front of her. But her perfect bliss was shattered the night an intruder broke into her home, killing her husband and almost killing her.In \\"Cruel Doubt,\\" Joe McGinniss writes about this terrible tragedy that would have destroyed a lesser person.Invited by Wade Smith, one of Jeffrey MacDonald 's defense attorneys to whom readers were introduced in McGinniss's book \\"Fatal Vision,\\" to chronicle the single worst nightmare a family could face, McGinniss spent the months after the shocking, surprise arrest of Bonnie's own son for planning the murders.Once again, Joe McGinniss tells a gripping story of pain, pathos, horror, and humanity. He takes the reader through the investigation, trials, and aftermath that left a family in ruins and ended what may have been promising futures for two young men - one sentenced to life in prison and the other sentenced to death in North Carolina's gas chamber.This is a must read for fans of true crime... and for those who love a good who dunnit."},{"Title":"Cruel Doubt","review":"Excellent. Excellent read. McGInnis is one of only two authors who can get me to stay up three hours after my bedtime reading."},{"Title":"Cruel Doubt","review":"This is one of the best true crime books that I have ever read. I liked it even better than Fatal Vision (McGuiness as well). Mcguiness makes the characters come alive for the reader. It makes you want to go a meet and speak with them all personally. The story is sad and will break your heart, and mcguiness definitely does not try to diminish these feelings. There is no warm fuzzy ending, just the hope that Bonnie Von Stein's life is getting better."},{"Title":"Cruel Doubt","review":"After Lieth Von Stein was murdered and his wife Bonnie was attacked in their bedroom by knife and club wielding bandits on a hot summer evening in July 1988, the ensuing police investigation and courtroom drama would reveal that it was the bloody climax of a fantasy game which had begun several weeks earlier in the hallways of North Carolina State University. To the young men who partcipated in this game, it was not merely fiction or fantasy, but reality, as real as the three million dollars that they would have gained if both the Von Steins had perished in the attack. It was this game, along with the lure of that easy money, that was the catalyst behind Lieth Von Stein's brutal murder, turning what appeared to be a &quot;routine&quot; family murder into one of the most frightening and bizarre cases ever to appear before the American judicial system. Author Joe McGinniss draws us into this story with his precise, succinct narrative in much the same way as the participants were drawn into the deadly &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; scenarios. This is a superb read and I highly recommend this book to anyone who doesn't mind a few sleepless nights!"},{"Title":"Cruel Doubt","review":"This book thrilled me and annoyed me at the same time. I was blown away by the family dynamics that led to the murder of the main character's husband. And the insane world of drugs and Dungeons and Dragons that her son (who the reader suspects is involved from the beginning) inhabits is a glimpse into a real person's dark side.But don't expect the story to end like a fictional murder mystery. You'll be left with many unanswered questions, unexplainable evidence, and a sinking suspicion that there's more to the story than what was revealed. But it's just this ambiguity that makes this such a compelling read."},{"Title":"Cruel Doubt","review":"This is quite possibly the best book I have read. True crime at its very best with characters that jump off the page. It is the true story of a North Carolina family torn apart by a sons greed and the murder that resulted. This book was made into a movie in the 90's with Blythe Danner as the mother and I am sure you have heard of her Gwyneth Paltrow as the daughter (Danners real life daughter). I finished the book and am reading it again it is that good. Trust me on this one the detail is amazing. If you don't believe me try a sample but I guarantee you a sample will just wet your appetite."},{"Title":"Cruel Doubt","review":"I read Joe McGinniss' Fatal Vision on Jan 5, 1985, and found it a well-done account. This book is just as good, and I found that I kept wanting to get back to reading it. It is very well-done, and a lawyer can read it without cringing, since the author handles the legal issues--fascinating ones so far as attorny-client relations go--intelligently. Anyone reading the book will want to read the opinion of the North Carolina Supreme Court which is State v. Upchurch, 421 S.E. 2d 577 (N.C. 1992). The book does not cover the retrial and I have found out how the retrial came out, but to tell you might be in the nature of a spoiler, so I won't."},{"Title":"Cruel Doubt","review":"I thought McGinnis did an incredible job with some very, very touch subject matter. I read &quot;Blood Games&quot; as well, and while both had their advantages, &quot;Cruel Doubt&quot; was far and away the better book. Like other readers, I was shocked that Moog was convicted without physical evidence, and while I'm sure he was involved, I feel confident that others -- including Henderson and Pritchard -- were also involved. Unlike Bledsoe, McGinnis took the time after the trial to gauge those involved on what THEY thought really happened, and that is where the book really gets great. I, too, am hoping for another book on this crime.Along those lines, does anyone know of a site or message board that addresses this particular crime? Thanks."},{"Title":"Cruel Doubt","review":"Good true crime story. Fascinating details of modern day crime. Sick young individuals & how todays society lets young people run amok.No guidance,no discipline and bad,bad parenting.Chilling from start to finish."},{"Title":"Cruel Doubt","review":"I did not think much of this book.First, I found it quite interesting that Bonnie Von Stein had very similar injuries as Jeffrey MacDonald, and McGinnis thinks he's guilty and Bonnie isn't. It seems that McGinnis switches &quot;sides&quot; depending on payment. Also, Wade Smith, Bonnie Von Stein's attorney, brought McGinnis into this case. Smith was also involved to some degree with the MacDonald case.Secondly, McGinnis tells the tale solely from Bonnie Von Stein's point of view. He did not dig into anything that would point in her direction (and there is a lot!). Yet another change from the way he handled Fatal Vision.Lastly, when McGinnis discusses other parties involved, he does so from a stand point where one would believe he had actually spoken with these people. He did not. His book is nearly 100% based on what Bonnie said, what Bonnie did, how Bonnie reacted, ad naseum.A final note about some of the other reviews.1- Upchurch did not get a retrial. Upchurch's death sentence was vacated on appeal under McKoy due to faulty jury instructions. He was granted a resentencing hearing. At that hearing he was resentenced, this time to life in prison. He will not be eligible for parole for about 40 years (2 life sentences - consecutive).2 - There was never evidence that Upchurch was involved. Neither Henderson nor Pritchard could corroborate each others stories. The information they provided varied widely! There was not one single piece of physical evidence. The murderer was right handed. Upchurch is left handed. If this intrigues you, check out www.freejbupchurch.com!And also, stick to Bledsoe's Blood Games. A better read, a better understanding of the case and people involved, and a much better writing style!"},{"Title":"Cruel Doubt","review":"I don't usually comment on others' reviews, but I found a recent one not to be fair, in this case. McGinniss gave his usual, awesome description of this horrible murder, including detailed interviews with the investigators and especially Bonnie Von Stein and Chris Pritchard. A criticism was that it was one-sided. As a true crime author myself, I know that often the &quot;other side&quot; won't talk to the author, and I suspect this was the case here. In Bledsoe's &quot;Blood Games,&quot; another excellent depiction of this awful crime, it's obvious Bledsoe had cooperation from the defendants' families -- and it might be looked upon as one-sided since he didn't have too much cooperation, it seems, with Bonnie. The two books together, both dramatically and frighteningly written, give readers a full picture of what went on in that case. I give both books 5 stars. This case has intrigued me since I saw the movie Cruel Doubt, and I was ecstatic that Bledsoe, another great true crime author, also wrote a book on the subject!One main reason that makes me think McGinniss wasn't able to get interviews with the defendants is the fact that his book doesn't mention &quot;Bart&quot; as the nickname for James Bartlett Upchurch III. How would anyone know that unless they'd interviewed the family? Sometimes it looks like, when people won't talk to us, that we just didn't bother to try to talk to them, but that's absolutely not true. I'm sure Mr. McGinniss tried and tried to get the defendants' and families' interviews.McGinniss is just one of the forefathers, it seems, of terrific true crime with awesome imagery -- which makes the reader picture the crime and people in their heads without a movie being necessary! Mr. Bledsoe also is a top true crime writer. Neither book detracts from the other. Both are sublime depictions of one of the most bloody crimes police have seen.My hat's off to both authors!"},{"Title":"Cruel Doubt","review":"I guess true crime was coming into it's own with authors like Joe McGinnis and Ann Rule. I saw the mini-series starring Emmy Winner Blythe Danner as Bonnie Von Stein and her Oscar Winner daughter Gwyneth Paltrow as her daughter Angela Pritchard. The movie version is quite faithful to the book and the events itself which I highly recommend as well. The book does delve into the story of dungeons and dragons which becomes an obsession of Christopher Pritchard and the horrible murder of his stepfather Leith Von Stein in a small North Carolina town and the near murder of his own mother. The case is riveting and the story is told with complete details and information. I can still see the cast which included Ed Asner as one of the lawyers and Miguel Ferrer as the police investigating the case. The title of Cruel Doubt is about the fact that a horrendous crime has been committed, the motive was for the inheritance, and the fact that the sister Angela slept through the entire event without hearing a sound. A mother must come to terms with her son's crimes against his own family while trying to convict the men who actually carried it out. McGinnis has also written Fatal Vision and Blind Faith about family members who are involved with the death of a relative. I recommend reading those books as well. Cruel Doubt is almost forgotten. The mini-series is worth seeing though and i wished that they put more photos or pictures about the people and places involved."},{"Title":"Cruel Doubt","review":"I bought this book after reading \\"Fatal Vision\\" which I found riveting. \\"Cruel Doubt\\" is written with the same amazing detail and imagery, and has fascinating insights into the people involved. What I found frustrating has nothing to do with his storytelling ability. I personally found that there's just too many unanswered questions, a lack of evidence and confusing conflicting stories from the accused to make it a truly satisfying read. I guess the problem is that McGinniss writes so well that you truly care about the people involved and you need some sort of closure. I couldn't put it down when I was reading it but I found myself wanting 'more' when it was finished."},{"Title":"Cruel Doubt","review":"Another great book by Joe McGinness. I like all his books, and alot of other people must like his books too - I NEVER see them in the Used Book Store I go to all the time. I've been looking for over 3 years & have yet to find any hard-bound or paperback of any of his books. Guess Amazon is the place to find them."},{"Title":"Cruel Doubt","review":"Kinda wordy, but much can be skimmed.McGinniss is a superb writer - all his work is well worth reading.\\"Cruel Doubt\\" should be read from an armchair detective's eyes, and not the thinking of the writer. Perhaps that's what the author intended. For that reason it's a mystery that the reader can figure out, who? got away with murder, and consequently the best true crime book ever written."},{"Title":"Cruel Doubt","review":"Stepfather, Lieth, was dead, and mother, Bonnie Von Stein was in intensive care. By contrast, Angela, the daughter was unharmed, and son, Chris, a student at North Carolina State University, reached the bedside of his mother and cried. The resident agent for the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation, Lewis Young, felt someone had tried to stage a break-in at the family's house.Lieth Von Stein had worked for National Spinning, a textile company, as a director of internal audits. Lieth, an alcoholic, had lost patience with Chris and Angela when they became teenagers. Bonnie and Lieth had been reclusive. Living in the community of Little Washington in Beaufort County, they hadn't made any close friends.Neighbors told investigators to focus their attention on Chris and Angela Pritchard. At North Carolina State Chris played Dungeons and Dragons and used marijuana and LSD. The title of the book draws upon Bonnie's dilemma. It is wondered whether her children were in some manner responsible for the death of Lieth.The investigators in the case moved slowly. Most of the leads were fruitless. The law enforcement contingent was dismayed when the family hired some of the best lawyers in the state to represent their interests.This is a good book. The realistic details shown in the search for answers drive the piece."},{"Title":"Cruel Doubt","review":"Author Joe McGinnis covers the tragic 1988 murder plot of young Christopher Pritchard. Readers see how this young university student's obsession with drugs and fantasies from the popular board game Dungeons-and-Dragons (D & D) helped lead him tragically astray. Specifically, he plotted with two classmates (also D & D fanatics) to kill his step father Leith Von Stein and mother for an inheritance. The narrative also describes Christopher's protective mother Bonnie, who survived her stab wounds, entered a state of denial, and became her son's protector. Finally, we learn of the unusual and quite riveting court trial. The book is gripping and tragic, but some have criticized the author for basing too much of his writing on statements by Bonnie. This book also touches on board-game fanatics, some of whom are lonely young men seeking refuge and friendship. Of course, most D&D; aficionados (like my brothers at one time) simply like the game, and may feel a bit abused by these pages.McGinnis writes with great skill, although his methods often generate controversy. This book doesn't quite match his controversial best-seller FATAL VISION, but it remains an interesting read."},{"Title":"Cruel Doubt","review":"Joe McGinnis' chillingly true story is about a son, (Chris Pritchard) convicted of murdering his stepfather (Lieth Von Stein) and his mother (Bonnie Von Stein) in their own bedroom for greed. Leith's parents and uncle had all died within a year and a half of each other. Lieth inherited close to $2 million. Chris who was a failing student at NC State University, was away at school when the murder happened. His sister Angela was asleep in the room across the hall from her parents. When the police arrived, they woke Angela up from a deep sleep. She did not hear anything. Lieth was killed and Bonnie was taken to the hospital where she stayed for 7 days. When Chris came home he went to visit his mother at the hospital. Neither Angela or Chris seemed to interested in what had happened. Hardly a tear was shed. A year and a half later the investigation led to Chris and his friends at NCSU. One of the friends admitted to the investigators what happened that night. This implicated Chris, himself (Henderson) and Moog. Even though all the information gathered never really had concrete evidence all three were convicted. Information given by the forensic doctor did not match up with the time of the attack that was given by Bonnie. None of the family, Bonnie, Chris and Angela showed emotions of remorse or loss. This unemotional family confused the investgation even after the conviction. To grasp the atmosphere surrounding this investgation that bring us through the medieval game of Dungeons and Dragons, drugs and greed you must read this book. I could not put it down. To see how they were finally going to convict them with out physical evidence was amazing. To have let them free because of lack of evidence would have been terrifying. I do not believe this case has been completely solved. I am waiting for Part II, the unabridged version."},{"Title":"Cruel Doubt","review":"A beautifully crafted book that allows you to walk through the window of each persons conscious. McGinnis has done a stellar job of connecting all the dots in this story of loss, betrayal, ethical dilemmas, and forgiveness. It also gives real insight into how the mind can protect us from realities too harsh to face. Start reading it early in the day because you won't want to put it down."},{"Title":"Cruel Doubt","review":"Classic Joe McGinnis.He involves the reader in the family dynamic and then unflinchingly into the murder and cover up. Two thumbs up."},{"Title":"Number Phonics: Basic Reading Instruction Made Easy for Children in Homeschooling, Private Tutoring Title I, Lap, Special Education, ESL, And Elementary School (Skills for Life)","review":"I was skeptical about this system when I first got the book. At first glance it looked complicated. In practice, however, the author's instructions were easy to follow and apply. Davidson is a very clear writer and walks you (the parent or teacher) step by step through the process so there is no ambiguity about what to do and how to do it.We started our daughter on this material when she was three and a half. She already knew her alphabet and a basic sound for most letters. We used Leap Frog Word Whammer/Fridge Phonics, which gave her a great start with no work on our part (it works like a game she could play herself). We also read to her a lot, filling her mind with drama and a love for stories. I think these two things set the stage for the next step with Davidson's book.Our daughter responded very well to Number Phonics, even though we were not very consistent with our lessons (not even once a week). We were very relaxed in our approach, especially since she was so young. We only did as much as she was interested in at the time. Two-thirds of the way through her fourth year she had a breakthrough and took off on her own, more or less. She seemed to be able to read anything basic--street signs, menus, advertisements, most of her books, even the summaries of the sermons in the church bulletin. In fact, we never actually finished Number Phonics because she seemed to be doing so well on her own.We credit Numbers Phonics with the rapid increase in her reading ability, and had we been more consistent (which is what we recommend) I think the results would have even been better. There are gaps in our daughter's ability that would have been filled had we followed the plan. Even so, we are thrilled.I'm convinced that this training material will enable any child to read before they start first grade if Davidson's clear and manageable system is put into practice and if there is a positive, supportive attitude towards books and reading in the home. This book is a great investment in your child's future."},{"Title":"Number Phonics: Basic Reading Instruction Made Easy for Children in Homeschooling, Private Tutoring Title I, Lap, Special Education, ESL, And Elementary School (Skills for Life)","review":"I have been using this book to teach my 5 year old to read, she was having a hard time with reading until we started using this book.

I would love to read more of Hans Holzer's books in the near future. He's a great author."},{"Title":"Ghosts of New England","review":"I give this book only a two star rate. This book is ok, the author I feel is a little repateivtive in his writting. He relies heavy on channeling with very little history if any to back things up.

Its still a good read but most of the stories are a bit old."},{"Title":"Ghosts of New England","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone who is truly interested in the paranormal. Not only someone who is interested, but also someone who respects the spirit world. Parapsychology is not always a very respected profession, and it truly should be. Though it may seem farfetched to some, there are many people who can admit to having seen, felt, or heard something that made the hair on the back of their neck stand up. Why should one not believe in what their own senses tell them to be true? This collection of stories is just the tip of the iceberg in experiences with the spirit world. Even if you simply have an open mind, this is an interesting book to read. I would not recommend it to a person who absolutely cannot broaden their mind and horizon."},{"Title":"Ghosts of New England","review":"I have read many books of this genre, more than one of Mr. Holzer's. This is by far his worst work. The biggest problem is the way that he writes. It is apparent in his other books, but not as prominent. He comes off as if he is the world's best ghost hunter and that his opinion's are fact. Many times he states in the book that he doubts and discredits any person that hasn't in the past had some kind of psychic occurence. There is no history to any &quot;haunt&quot;. He and his medium are the only credible people in any story. My overall consenus is that he is getting old and is trying to cash in on a few more books. there was no thought or follow through, just cocky, arrogant fatigue in this book.

Well, they weren't.The book is, well, boring and hard to get through because of it's flatness. There are too many details when it comes to &quot;he said, she said&quot; descriptions and not enough detail of the actual hauntings that would draw the reader in, or at least throw a chill down your spine.The cover boasts &quot;Spine-Tingling Encounters with the Phantoms of New England,&quot; but I think the made-up ghost stories that are told by campfires and in the dark at sleep-overs are more enjoyable and &quot;spine-tingling&quot; than the ones in this book.I found his story telling to be repetative, as another reader also mentioned. At times I thought my bookmark had been moved and I was re-reading a chapter, but it was just his style of writing repeating itself over and over.Lastly, I'm not sure why this book makes it seem as if ghosts only haunt big, old houses. I'm sure there are plenty of ghosts out there that aren't haunting houses, but I guess Hans didn't hunt down any of those.All in all, if you're looking for a nice book to curl up with late at night in order to get a good scare, this isn't the one. It's not even worth it for those who aren't looking for a scare, actually.

At the most forgiving, we can call it a nonce work, interesting as an exemplar of the kind of bitchiness and personalism that passes for journalism in Italy. But for the ordinary reader today, if it is to succeed at all, it needs a comprehensive introduction. But Peter Robb (who has written well about Sicily elsewhere) apparently wasn't willing to put in the time or the effort.Some will say that the likely reader already knows about the Moro episode. Probably in outline, yes, but if he knows it in the kind of detail necessary to appreciate this work, he has probably read Sciascia's account long ago--and, chances are, in Italian.On the other hand, if you really do want a decent overview of the Moro affair, there is a good one available, ironically, through the New York Review of Books. It's a review, by Adrian Lyttelton available (albeit as paid content) in the archives at the NYRB website. If you really need to master Sciascia on Morrow, Lyttelton is probably a ticket. But unless you are a fairly serious specialist, you can probably give it a bye."},{"Title":"The Moro Affair (New York Review Books Classics)","review":"I read this book in its Spanish edition expecting to find something interesting about power. This a theme or a topic very interesting to me given the fact that its understanding give us the possibility of knowing a lot about ourselves.The Moro affair took place in Italy on 1978. I just was a teenager when all this happened so I don't remember so much about it. In fact, having read Sciascia before I expected to find his meditations on the affair and not a detailed record of what happened day by day. I was interested in those meditations and that's what I got.Sciascia is a writer whose focus is not so much in the story as in the plot itself that triggered the story. The context. And its meaning. Sciascia is not James Ellroy let alone Michael Connelly. The problem to Sciascia is not the serial killer as the meaning of being killed by a madman.So why the Red Brigades kidnapped Moro? What did Moro do to be kidnapped? What did Italy do for him? What did his friends do to rescue him? Why did everything go wrong even the most common actions that the police follows in these cases?Yes, only questions of a very lucid mind. So I insist: this is not a chronicle or a spies tale. Far from that. Thus, if you are interested about what power is and what can make to people, just buy the book and read it.Very good indeed."},{"Title":"The Moro Affair (New York Review Books Classics)","review":"Aldo Moro was a brillant politician in Italy. The Red Brigades kidnapped him in 1978 and killed his five bodyguards. They then proceeded to let him beg for his life to the Christian Democrat government. The Red Brigades offered to exchange him for 13 of their imprisoned comrades. They also wanted to stymie his attempt to forge a compromise government of the Christian Democrats and Communists. This was one of the reasons the Red Brigades wanted to kidnap and kill him.Moro comes off as a beggar for his life. Worse, the Red Brigades were just killers, with no real ideology, except the killing and maiming of people. An appropriate sentence for the 13 RB prisoners would have been the death sentence or life in prison. As for Moro, they shot him in the head, and his children did not get to experience a parental figure.The author hitches this story to the disappearance (killing) of a Physics professor working with Fermi.If you read this book, the author talks about how the Christian Democrats failed Aldo Moro, and the Red Brigades failed their ideology. I was scratching my head at a lot of the language and musing. Perhaps the Italian translator did not do such a good job."},{"Title":"The Moro Affair (New York Review Books Classics)","review":"This book includes a shorter piece, \\"The Mystery of Majorana\\", which is a gem.

The book is a well-written guide to prayer. Floyd honestly admits that no book can teach a person to pray but the person must take the teaching of the book on prayer and apply them to their own prayer lives. Floyd can pray but he can only teach us to pray without us getting on our faces in true prayer.The positives of this book are that Floyd stays true to his text. His exegesis of the biblical passages on prayer is true to the text and he stays in the context. Floyd does not chase unbiblical thoughts about prayer (particularly in reference to spiritual warfare). I also greatly enjoyed his honesty throughout the book and his chapter on fasting and prayer was very helpful.The negatives of this book are few. While some charismatics might take exception with Floyd's view of what it means to \\"pray in the Spirit\\" (Eph. 6:18), I believe Floyd is biblical accurate in his teaching on praying in the Spirit.Overall this is a wonderful addition on prayer. Dr. Ronnie Floyd has given the Church a manuel for true praying.

I assume this is because unlike other types of books self-help requires actual application of practical work on a daily basis and quite a bit of time. So very often people get excited by the promises the books make & how the book made them feel during the reading of it to the point where they give it raving review without actually having any practical evidence whether any of the advice works.Well, I'm afraid that I too am writing a review prematurely. It's hard not to with this book because the recommended practice the author gives is 40 days for each letter (working on two letters at a time at the MOST). That means that if you were to never skip a single day of practice it would take you at least a year and a half to go through the program. Almost 3 years if you decide to do one letter at a time. At least the author is being honest about how long it usually takes to change one's handwriting and I think that's a good thing. These excersises will take you anywhere between 10 & 30 minutes a day depending on whether u do 1 or 2 letters and depending on how fast your hand gets the hang of the letter (in the first week of writing a letter I find that it takes me 15 minutes of getting through the excersises for that ONE letter, but then I make less mistakes and am able to go faster.)I got this book because my handwriting is truly ugly and often ilegible even to my own self. So even if it turns out that handwriting doesn't affect my life at least in the end I'll finally come out with nice handwriting! So for me it is a win either way. I do notice that I feel better after applying some of these techniques, but I can't tell if it's because the handwriting is changing my life or because I feel good about accomplishing something I've been wanting to fix for a while. It's an easy read that you can go through in one sitting if you want. What I love best about this book is that it is truly a practical guide. Most books that claim to help improve your life in some way merely preach and give a variety of motivational phrases to get you pumped, but very little practical application that you can actually use. There are lots of people now who have made a lot of money pumping out useless, new-agey, impractical motivational information. This book is nothing but practical excersises so you can get right to work on your goals. Like I said, I can't comment on whether or not it really works in improving one's inner self yet- I'll have to get back to you in about 3 years for that, but whether it changes your life or not it will at the very least change your handwriting."},{"Title":"Your Handwriting Can Change Your Life!","review":"I have a small library of psychology and analyse books as i study psychology as a hobby. I picked this book up in a bookstore and had to buy it. The information when you look deeper as the words are overwhelming. I changed my letters as instructed especially the A, S and L. The effect was amazing. When analysing people i suggested they change their handwriting, just here a letter of two that i knew corresponded with their problem and the effects was astonishing. I have finally got the courage to take dance lessons and now i am the one asking the ladies to dance, and yes i now write with a fountain pen. Thanks Vimala. Note it sounds easier than it acually is to change the way you write. As Vimala says. The harder it is to do the more the reward will be in the end."},{"Title":"Your Handwriting Can Change Your Life!","review":"Vimala Rodgers has written the definitive book on handwriting. Privileged to be one of her students, I know firsthand the benefits of Vimala's teaching -- and now she has distilled this knowledge into a comprehensive volume that's both practical and easy to understand. Your Handwriting Can Change Your Life offers a hands-on approach to effectively taking charge of your life with the simple strokes of a pen!

As a homeschooling parent of three, this is the only way I am teaching my children to write. Something we do everyday can dramatically affect who we are. As we write, we change how we think. Consider it body-based daily affirmations ..."},{"Title":"Your Handwriting Can Change Your Life!","review":"I have been one of those people who hated the sight of their own handwriting. I always chose to type my assignments through college, even some math homework, when I was going to be turning it in for a grade. I finally realized that I wanted to change my writing and Vimala gave me a great book to assist with my desired change. The book is very informative and directs you in how letters should be written. At the sametime she allows you to choose exactly what changes you make. The book's name says it all, I no longer look at my handwriting like I want it to go away, now I want it to stay!"},{"Title":"Your Handwriting Can Change Your Life!","review":"For me, this book, by far, has been the most informative,direct and to-the-point on how to change self defeating personality conditions and improve one's personality.

I am experiencing results faster than I could ever have imagine. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Your Handwriting Can Change Your Life!","review":"Interesting book. I can't say I gave it the time recommended, which was 40 minutes or more a day patiently practising the letters and the aspects of your writing you wish to improve. Its thesis seems hyperbolic and the actual writing style I didn't like. Instead, I now practice cursive italic, a style designed for fast, legible handwriting. It seems both more functional and aesthetically attractive to me than the Vimala style. Whats more, cursive italic was the chosen hand of the Italian middle ages; if Leonardo Da Vinci managed to struggle along without the benefits of the Vimala method of handwriting self-development then so can you and I.My final impression? - I think there is something to the notion that diligent practice of a well thought out hand will have cognitive and character benefits. Vimala Rodgers is to be admired for her work and insights. What I'd really like to see is a similar method developed using cursive italic as a basis, and dare I say, with a bit more of a 'male' feel, to both its appearance and the associated character traits. I suspect that the Vimala method could be further developed/adapted according to one's own preferences once a good feel for it had been gained. For now, however, it's overall style fails to appeal."},{"Title":"Your Handwriting Can Change Your Life!","review":"This is a good book to use as a beginning book to 'improve' your life. It gives examples of ways to form the letters that create a positive change. From my own observation and practice, the changes work! The information provides a good basic foundation for improvement. It does not, however, go in depth to explain the quirkiness of individual letter formations that persist despite making the suggested changes."},{"Title":"Your Handwriting Can Change Your Life!","review":"This book make a good handwriting personality analysis.

This is a must if you want to turn your life around and change!"},{"Title":"Your Handwriting Can Change Your Life!","review":"Hey. Nice to see a book on handwriting analysis with the idea that people can change. How hopeful. The idea of practicing (to write) a specific alphabet sort of gives me the creeps. Is'nt it enough to change a few \\"flaws\\" in the writing to get it within a field of the norm?

It's a short, quick read, packed with great info."},{"Title":"Your Handwriting Can Change Your Life!","review":"This book has a more powerful effect than I would have imagined. I think that the focus is right in not dwelling on negatives. I have only read 1 other graphology book, one that has a high rating here and in my opinion the spirit and focus of this book is the right one. My only criticism is that there could be more context setting, introduction and there is not much of an epilogue.

I asked her, \\"Do you believe it can work?\\" and she said, \\"It has for me!\\" I started working with it in November and felt this joy come over me - it was fun! By changing the marks I made in the world, I could feel the change within. I bought a couple of copies as Xmas gifts. One friend said he had always hated his handwriting and spent hours with this book - loving it. I've told several others about it and they also love it - including a healer, an engineer, and a musician. Just understanding our own patterns as they exist now (graphology) is fun (and made me want to change some things right away). The book is an easy read, very accessible, and you can start changing very quickly. I've worked with it for about 6 weeks now and have definitely seen changes in my attitudes, and my life."},{"Title":"Your Handwriting Can Change Your Life!","review":"I was delightfully surprised at how comprehensive this book was.

I have since bought dozens of copies as gifts for friends. Check it out!"},{"Title":"Your Handwriting Can Change Your Life!","review":"Implementing Vimala Rodgers's handwriting changes from 'Your Handwriting Can Change Your Life!' is the most powerful tool that I know for self-improvement. Using handwriting changes is an accelerator for anything I've done since using the Vimala alphabet, from getting my nerve up to change careers, improving my eyesight naturally, raising my goals and improving personal relationships. Currently, I'm practicing the Epsilon e and r and the figure 8 g to aid me in creating my own book.This book is straightforward, non-threatening, lively and thorough. It covers the components of handwriting, has easy-to-follow instructions for each letter and most importantly to me, explains the personal application of each letter."},{"Title":"Your Handwriting Can Change Your Life!","review":"A) It is interesting to read about all this handwriting analysis. Pretty cool. But, ya know. I'm not buying this thing to know about how cool handwriting is, I'm buying it to change my life so...B) At first, I was working with 3 letters. It got too intense (I hated trying to remember to change my handwriting all the time and crossing out words and stuff) and its funny because the author would say that my mind is on overload with the changing of my personality. Maybe you could say that, or maybe you could say I don't like trying to remember to change 3 different letters. So...C) I started working on N. Because I really want to build strong relationships. I was working on H because I wanted to live life joyfully, but I kind of already do that so I stopped. I was doing J because I have been in several situations where my intuition screamed and I didn't listen, but I decided I can work on that via some other way than handwriting. So N won.Now, I have been practicing when I can. I forget some days, but I am a student and N is a frequent letter so I practice when I take notes. And I have started making more of an effort to show appreciation and such to friends. Is it because I've been writing Ns different? Is it because when I THINK about writing my N different, I am THINKING about how I want my friendships to change? Is it because I am also reading the Dale Carnegie book that explicitly tells you to shower friends with appreciation? Hmm.I also feel more relaxed when I meet people and when I hang out with people. Is it the N? or Is it because of my Emma Stone obsession? I made a vow to be more like Emma Stone. Relaxed, silly, and totally herself -- absolutely not caring if you think her joke is stupid because she'll still smile and keep the convo going. So which was it? The N or my Emma Stone girl-crush?I'm writing my review today. It hasn't been 3 months. Its been 3 or 4 weeks? What prompted me to write today is ... a boy asked for my phone number.Ok, ok. I know that sounds silly, but this is one of the few times that a nice boy (not some \\"can I have yo numba? Can I have it? Please can I have it?\\" guy) has a conversation with me and asks for my number in a normal, day-to-day life situation (not a club or something). And I can't help but think \\"... ... N?\\"Okay, so I don't know. I don't know if this works. I don't know if its just the meditation on \\"I want better friendships\\" everytime I write. I don't know if the handwriting really is the key. I don't know if this stuff would have happened anyway! I don't know. I can say that these improvements were not happening prior to buying this book set. In fact, the reason I bought this was because I had been feeling lonely and have been looking for ways to change that. Well, certainly I can feel it changing!So I give it 3 stars. Well, originally, I have it 3 stars. I don't know if this book deserves the credit. But the author would say \\"Well, if you don't believe me then stop writing and see what happens\\" and... I don't want to risk it. The very fact that I don't want to risk this progress by stopping my N practice made me think \\"ok, fine. 4 stars...\\" The N doesn't look ugly. Its not hard to do. For all intensive purposes, I should just continue with it and see this through.So should you buy this? I don't know. It depends on how much you want to change. It certainly doesn't hurt and it doesn't take up much time at all (practice while watching tv or something)."},{"Title":"Your Handwriting Can Change Your Life!","review":"This woman is simply phenomenal and really knows handwriting. Having been a student of handwriting analysis all her life, she has arrived at an amazingly accurate process for seeing the personality beyond the writing.Vimala Rodgers is expert at her craft, and she can so easily explain her work in a minimum of verbage.

YES. Is Vimala a wonderful and educated person... YES. HOWEVER it important to note that, on an internet radio show, I heard Vimala state that she is NOT a handwriting expert OR a handwriting therapist but she IS an ALPHABETICIAN. Is she then qualified to write on handwriting THERAPY? There is a BIG difference in my opinion!! Dr. Pierre Janet, a pioneering French psychologist and philosopher in the field of dissociation and trauma was the first person to prove the connection between a person's past experiences and present-day issues. He is also the first person to use the words \\"dissociation' and \`subconscious'. In many ways he preceded Dr. Sigmund Freud and many consider Janet the true founder of psychoanalysis and psychotherapy. He received an honorary doctorate from Harvard in 1936. One of Dr. Pierre Janet's students during the 1940's - a graphologist named Paul S. Colombe - developed the \`pen and pencil therapy' or \\"Grapho-therapeutics\\". He stated that, when writing, the subconscious sends a message to the hand and, by reversing the process, we could consciously send a different message to the subconscious. Thus grapho-therapy, was developed from this theory although no actual programs per se were put into place or implemented specifically until 1987. In 1987 Treyce d'Gabriel, a Metaphysical Psychologist, who also has traditional psychology degrees and has worked in traditional psychology for most of her life, created the Handwriting Formation Therapy (HFT) program... and copyrighted it 13 years prior to Vimala's first book \\"Change Your Writing, Change Your Life\\". Since the conception of Treyce's HFT program, there have been many programs which appear to be unauthorized attempts or copies of her program, most of which classify themselves under an umbrella term of \\"graphotherapy\\". Despite Treyce's 2009 YouTube and otherwise public announcement that she would allow \\"HFT clinics\\" to be launched all over the world, as of 2010, Treyce has not trained or certified anyone in the HFT discipline stating the certification is currently being developed. In 2006 Treyce was the first analyst in history to conduct research that was aimed at reducing crime recidivism rates via the HFT program. Her 2006 project for the State of Texas Juvenile Probation Commission was a proven success. All the kids that participated remained 100% anonymous and, after the full six month program, improved grades, behaviors, self-esteem, and much more. The most important success is that to-date, none of these kids have reoffended proving that Treyce's HFT program not only reduced, but stopped, juvenile crime recidivism rates in Texas by a full 100%. Since its conception in 1987, hundreds of kids and adults around the globe have changed their life... permanently. I recommend you visit [...] and search for her \\"No Doc, No Drugs\\" book aimed at this HFT program. When you want to change your life shouldn't you change it with someone who is clearly qualified... like the creator of the original program?"},{"Title":"Your Handwriting Can Change Your Life!","review":"The first part of this book is dedicated to understanding handwriting and how that translates into our personality. After completing that section, I just wanted to go around and ask everyone I know for a sample of their handwriting so I can try to figure out more of their personalities. The next section is dedicated to showing proper form for writing letters and the reason behind why this is the best way to form the letter and what it means. The final and shortest of all sections talks about the exercises on how to improve your handwriting. The purpose of reading this book was to improve my handwriting, so while the first two sections were more academic and interesting, I felt that the book was really lacking what I was trying to do and just drive me to try and find a handwriting expert to take lessons from. I would recommend this book to someone that is interested in learning what handwriting says about a person, but otherwise I wouldn't recommend it for improving ones handwriting."},{"Title":"Your Handwriting Can Change Your Life!","review":"An informative book about this fascinating and transformative method.

Handwriting does make a difference. And you can change things in your life by changing your Handwriting. Great Book."},{"Title":"Your Handwriting Can Change Your Life!","review":"I have been a student of handwriting analyis for about a dozen-odd years. Handwriting analysis-- formally known as Graphology-- is known to many people, and is used worldwide as a psychoanalytical tool to give us insights into someone's personality. There is considerable scientific evidence to suggest that since our hand (and thus writing) moves as a result of electrical impulses from our brains, our handwriting is a very accurate representation of our state of mind, and the way we think and behave. Although still regarded as a &quot;soft science,&quot; Graphology is now used extensively in courts, in the crimal justice system, by therapists and by employers.Graphotherapy takes a &quot;reverse&quot; approach, suggesting that if a certain style of writing is representative of a certain personality trait or characteristic, then by changing our writing style, we must also be able to &quot;reverse engineer&quot; and change certain behavioral traits.This book is NOT about handwriting analysis-- it is about about how modifying your handwriting can change the way we think, act and react.The first half of the book provides readers with a general overview of various aspects of handwriting, and their meaning. In this section we are also introduced to the &quot;Vimala Alphabet,&quot; which is the author's interpretation of &quot;ideal&quot; handwriting-- digitized into a computer font, but not difficult to reproduce with pen and ink.The second half of the book walks us through the letters of the alphabet, one by one, explaining the corresponding personality traits, thoughts or habits associated with both the uppercase and lowercase version of each letter. Along with the recommendations on how to shape each letter, Rodgers also shows us a number of ways NOT to write certain letters, since they have negative connotations. At the end of the book, there is a brief chapter suggesting how to undertake daily exersises to help permanently change your handwriting over time.The one (fairly minor) reservation I have with this otherwise noteworthy and useful book concerns the author's &quot;Vimala Alphabet.&quot; I feel that it is based rather heavily on the assumption that everyone wants the SAME traits, and interpret the SAME traits as &quot;what they should strive for&quot; in life. Other works on graphotherapy put more effort into explaining the psychological implications of DIFFERENT ways of writing each letter, while Ms. Rodgers' book simply suggests that the Vimala Alphabet is &quot;the answer&quot;-- and the justifications for adopting it are a bit vague and not well explained. Whereas most recomendations are sound-- from a graphological standpoint-- there is a definite emphasis towards &quot;extreme positive,&quot; rather than a more &quot;balanced person&quot; approach. This is the only reason the book doesn't quite merit a 5-star rating.Final thoughts: Recommended (8.5 out of 10 possible bookmarks). As a therapeutic tool for self-improvement, graphotherapy provides an easy and inexpensive way to get a lot of value for your money, and Rodgers does a thorough and understandable job."},{"Title":"Your Handwriting Can Change Your Life!","review":"Dr. Christiane Northrup, author of \\"Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom\\" highly recommended this book in her newsletter (visit Dr. N's website to read her recommendation). I bought \\"Your Handwriting Can Change Your Life\\" the very next day. I started out by only changing my \\"t\\"s. The book said the letter \\"t\\" represents what we do in the world, so I made tall stems and put the crossbars on top with a firm upward stroke each time I wrote them. Within 40 days of practicing this letter, I had a new and better-paying job. And as I immerse myself in the Vimala Alphabet it gets even better .

She offers some very good advice about changing your handwriting, and gives as much scientific basis as she can. However, there are many things that she left out. For example, she will say things like &quot;Do not EVER write your H's like this,&quot; but won't say exactly why. I don't believe it's because she doesn't know, because there are many places where she does give specific reasons for advice. One other thing bothered me. Rodgers gives you the Vimala Alphabet, a way to write to write the alphabet which she feels will be the most beneficial in changing your personality. For many letters, she gives two different ways to write them, like M's that are rounded or pointed, but doesn't give any sort of advice on which one to choose. Since every little thing has significance in graphology, I'm sure there is a difference. I would suggest getting this book along with a general book on graphology that has more information in it."},{"Title":"Your Handwriting Can Change Your Life!","review":"This book has changed my life for the better!

However, his movie career is touched on only briefly in the next chatetr, A New Career, as Cynthia Klingel and Robert B. Noyed have to cover how the actor became the governor of California and almost a candidate for the Republican nomination for President. Chapter three, The Road to the Presidency explains how Reagan was elected to the White House, covers the assassination attempt that wounded the President, and describes his basic positions on the American economy and foreign relations. The final chapter, Ending a Memorable Career, focuses on Reagan's second term in office and the issues of Libya, the \\"Challenger\\" explosion, and relations with the Soviet Union and their new leader Mikhail Gorbachev.If you are familiar with Reagan's life then it is easy to take issue with some of the choices made here. There is a picture of Reagan as \\"The Gipper\\" in \\"Knute Rockne--All American,\\" and mention of \\"Bedtime for Bonzo,\\" in which he shows a decidedly comic flair despite the film's reputation as a joke, but there is no reference of his excellent performance in \\"King's Row,\\" which is the one film those who are curious about the actor who became president should check out. More importantly, the Iran-Contra Affair is essentially dismissed as being \\"complicated to understand,\\" without an explanation of what the political and legal issues involved were that threatened the Reagan presidency (there is no explicit notion of Reagan as the \\"Teflon President,\\" although his popularity is frequently mentioned). However, overall Klingel and Noyed provide a solid foundation for understanding the key elements in Reagan's life and presidency. There are other juvenile biographies with more detail, but for younger readers this would be a good place to start reading about the man who was president right before they were born.The first half of the book tends to focus more on details in Reagan's life while the second organizes his presidency into a series of fundamental issues and events. Reagan's political philosophy is covered in the sidebars to those last two chapters, one on Reaganomics and the other on Communism. An earlier sidebar is devoted to Nancy Reagan. Throughout the book, which is illustrated with family and political photographs of Reagan, the margins are filled with Interesting Facts (e.g., how he got the nickname \\"Dutch\\" and how the Brady Bill resulted from the assassination attempt). The book emphasizes the idea of Reagan as a strong president who deserved his reputation as \\"The Great Communicator.\\" At the end it touches on Reagan being diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, and it will be interesting to see if this ever forces future biographers to reassess Reagan's considerable legacy."},{"Title":"Meridiano De Sangre / Blood Meridian (Spanish Edition)","review":"Bueno este es quizas una de las mejores obras que ha escribido Cormac McCarthy.

Bette did such a complete job of portraying the close ties of connection between twins and yet also the strain that's created when major decisions about marriage and family values have to be &quot;excused&quot; within that relationship and within a family. I am a twin myself and am presently in the grieving process at living without my womb-mate. Bette's words I believe helped heal my hurt and encourage my recognition that sickness and loss are a part of life. But with a family's comforting ties one's review of life can be less painful. Faith in God truly brings a spiritual strength you don't know you have until the difficult times. Just reading of the twins' cycle of faith added real hope and grace into my situation.

I cried and felt with the characters from beginning to end. Although this is a fictional story - it seemed real to me with the knowledge of the increasing occurence of AIDS in our society.Colleen, the main character, showed me what real love is all about. As she became stronger through trials, I grew in my understanding of Grace. The Christian perspective was wonderful! This book will touch many lives! The characters were so real that I feel that I have actually lived through this with them.To watch all of the family members react to AIDS in their family was a study of our society today. This is a good book for all family members to read - old and young. I challenge everyone to read this informative book! Kudos to the author! and Thanks!"},{"Title":"A Season of Grace","review":"Colleen Payton is delighted when her brother, Stephen MacLaughlin, shows up out of the blue for their mother's birthday. Her twin has been estranged from his family for years over his alternative lifestyle, and after a disagreement at the party, he storms out. Colleen, determined not to lose him again, drives from her small town in Oregon to his Seattle home --- and finds out a truth she wasn't prepared for: Stephen is very ill with the AIDS virus.After dealing with the emergency at hand (Bette Nordberg is a former registered nurse and therapist --- not only are her scenes of caregiving accurate, they're also fast-paced and interesting), Colleen decides to bring Stephen back to her own home. But there are so many problems: Colleen doesn't consult her husband Kevin, nor does she talk to their two teenaged children. She also ignores the fact that her brother neither shares her Christian faith nor wants to do so. Most of all, Colleen has spent a lifetime pushing away her family members --- and a personal secret that is tearing her up inside.Few authors, Christian or not, are willing to confront terminal illness honestly and lovingly. Yes, lovingly: for although Colleen faces all manner of criticism, from her husband to her son to her fellow parishioners, her care for Stephen takes over every aspect of her being. Whether she is waiting patiently in a doctor's office for him or trying to decide what he'll want for lunch, Colleen is the very model of a modern caregiver.Nordberg does not let this dwindle into a heartwarming tale of footrubs and hospital vigils. There's a much bigger issue at stake. For some authors, that issue would be Stephen's sexual preference. Nordberg does deal with this, deftly weaving in details from Stephen's life (his companion's earlier death from the same illness, his childhood feelings about being different, etc.) along with reminders that modern Christians have fundamental disagreements with homosexuality. There is never a question in the novel that Colleen or anyone in her community believes Stephen's lifestyle is the best choice.However, Nordberg is also too sensitive a storyteller not to realize that the biggest issue --- of faith --- needs to be tackled, and Colleen would never have to confront her own demons if she were simply allowed to change bedding and shed tears. Her controversial decision to bring Stephen to her home forces her to own up to why having him there is so important to her. The truth, once revealed, frees up her energies to remember that God is present even in the midst of this grief and pain. And if He is present, what does that mean? What does it offer?Surprise, surprise: there are no easy answers. But there are easier and more meaningful communications once Colleen, Kevin, and their family have come to recognize that faith lived out in the smallest ways can have an impact. All too often, stories of conversion and of fatal illness can be tedious. This book is neither; it's engaging, intelligent and compassionate.--- Reviewed by Bethanne Kelly Patrick"},{"Title":"A Season of Grace","review":"This book was so good at showing how Gods grace will get you through your trials.It was great how Bette was able to portray someone who has aids and how all the different family members react to it, Live with and learn from it.

There's no doubt that she spent many hours not only researching but also putting her heart and soul into writing this novel about an extremely sensivite topic.The main character, Colleen Payton, taught me a great deal about love, compassion, perseverance and hope. When she finds that her twin brother, Stephen, has been stricken with AIDS, not once does she turn her back on him. The guidance and inner strength that she receives through her faith in God is a marvelous example for me.I highly recommend Season of Grace. This page turner novel can't help but impact your life as it did mine."},{"Title":"A Season of Grace","review":"This is a great book telling about the trials and heartaches associated with AIDS. The book is written in first person by the twin sister of a gay man with AIDS. While this is a touchy subject, the author tells the story so well no one should be able to find offense with it, other than possibly the gay community. It does have a Christian slant in that it speaks of homosexuality as being wrong and the AIDS victim becomes saved in the end. A very moving account of one (fictious) family's struggle with AIDS."},{"Title":"A Season of Grace","review":"The book is accurately titled A SEASON OF GRACE as Colleen shows the love of Christ and His grace to her twin brother who is experiencing the results of his homosexual lifestyle with the onslaught of Aids. It has changed my attitude from one of judgment to one of compassion and love."},{"Title":"A Season of Grace","review":"Story Description:With candor and compassion, Silver Angel award-winning writer Bette Nordberg explores the struggles and heartaches associated with homosexuality and AIDS to create a gripping novel that reveals the comfort of a personal relationship with Jesus. Colleen is wary when her brother Stephen arrives, but she refuses to dwell on his homosexuality. After a family fight, Stephen angrily leaves. Colleen follows him, discovers he has AIDS, and invites him to live with her family. As Stephen's illness progresses, Colleen encounters fear, prejudice, and judgments from \\"it's a shame\\" to \\"God is punishing Stephen.\\" Slowly Colleen considers a new answer. Maybe AIDS isn't a condemnation. Perhaps God has granted Stephen time to evaluate his life and discover the love of the Master Healer.My Review:If you don\`t completely understand the true meaning of \`grace' in the context of your faith, you will by the time you\`ve finished reading this novel.Colleen hasn\`t seen her twin brother, Stephen, for years until he shows up at Colleen\`s house for their mother\`s birthday party. Stephen has been away from his family due to disagreements over his alternative lifestyle and after another disagreement at the party he storms out of the house and goes home. Colleen is terribly upset and vows not to lose Stephen again and hops into her car and drives across the state to his home. Once there she finds out Stephen\`s truth - he has the AIDS virus.Colleen brings Stephen back to her home and eventually invites him to stay and live with her family so she can care for him. However, Colleen didn\`t ask her husband, Kevin, or their two teenage kids how they felt about Stephen living with them. Travis, Colleen\`s son doesn\`t even want to be in the same room as his Uncle and Kevin questions her allowing Stephen to help bake Christmas cookies. The family\`s fears about AIDS are depicted so well and pretty much mirror image how a lot of people in society today still view AIDS patients even with all the education that has been done. I think there will always be some type of stigma attached to AIDS and some will never feel comfortable with it.Even in her church, Colleen faces criticism from fellow parishioners, including one woman who gets up, turns off the keyboard Colleen just finished playing on, and proceeds to clean every single white key, black key, and all other buttons before she herself would play it. Can you even begin to imagine how that would make you feel if you were in Colleen\`s shoes?Not only is AIDS a huge part of this story but so is faith. Colleen has a secret that her family knows nothing about and I think that held her back from really participating in her conversations with God and her ability to hunker down and feel totally at peace. But her decision to move Stephen into her own home basically forces her to delve deep into why she \\"really\\" brought him there and why it is so important for her to care for Stephen in his final days.We need to remember that God allows us to experience grief and pain because it is a gift and through that we learn the true meaning of grace.A Season of Grace would have been a difficult book to write I would imagine, but Ms. Nordberg handled it with grace, humility, and great compassion. This is more than just a novel it's a lesson, an opportunity to learn. Unconditional love is a great thing! I would highly recommend that everyone read this novel."},{"Title":"A Season of Grace","review":"At the time he showed up on her doorstep, Colleen hadn't heard from her twin brother for many years While she knew he was gay, she being a Christian, wanted Stephen to become one and change his lifestyle. Not feeling accepted, that only helped serve to drive him from her and her God.At their mother's birthday celebration dinner, after their mother criticizes their sister Carrie, she then turns to Stephen and finds fault with him. She angers him and he leaves, driving back home to Seattle across the State from Colleen. After not returning several phone calls to him, Colleen drives to his house where she accidently discovers that he has AIDS.That's pretty much where the story really begins. And what she does with this discovery. A Season of Grace deals with how others handle this disease and their reactions. It deals with compassion, losing one's independence, and of course, AIDS and its complications.What I found rather annoying during the first half of the book was Colleen's constant reminders that she and he were twins as though somehow neither the reader or the book's other characters \\"got\\" that.What I found missing was her lack of frustration with what her life had become because of what she had taken on. It's like she was fine with it and had no complaints, no frustrations. While her husband had fears as to how the disease could affect him and their children, he got over them quickly, while she had no fears about that. Not quite realistic, I'm thinking.The reader can come to understand that our choices have consequences, some more obvious and painful than others. I find it interesting how Christians label the gay lifestyle as a worse sin than say adultery. Just a thought...I rather liked this book. I particularly liked Gloria and Noah."},{"Title":"A Season of Grace","review":"This book is absolutely wonderful.

Following his attraction to Faith, Adam offers her protection. On impulse, Faith seduces him and they enjoy an intimate relationship. This author does a nice job of developing the romance along the way, with the action as more of a backdrop. The suspense is short-lived and the shooter quickly identified, but he doesn't get apprehended until the dangerous conclusion. This book managed to combine the essential romance ingredients with flying bullets.

And yes, wouldn't it be nice if we could return, just for a moment, to those carefree days of yore?Andrew Verrett, grants us this wish with his new novel, &quot;The Roses of Haye.&quot; Written in rhyming couplets, its metered verse flows with a lyrical quality reminiscent of Edgar Allen Poe and the beloved Mother Goose herself. Yet, &quot;The Roses of Haye&quot; has a decidedly grown-up flavor. At its very core, &quot;The Roses of Haye&quot; is a simple love story, where honesty triumphs over evil and the good guy finishes first!

This little book takes but an hour to read and will fill you with indelible images of men of faith. Chaplains on the front lines, serving Mass at a makeshift 'chapel', the sound of explosives being ignored while distributing Communion. Servicemen requesting a chaplain to find them in the jungle so they can receive the sacraments. Spiritually edifying and truly patriotic, this book is literally about faith in action, about meeting Christ- even when hell breaks out all around you. There is no other book like it in print today. Highly recommended for those considering a call to the military chaplaincy, to service in the US Armed Forces, or the family members of such persons. Real hope. Real courage. Real heroes.

The nurses are holding an injured soldier and caring for him, while one of them is looking up for the airevac to arrive.

It's definetely not Great Expectations or David Copperfield as the entire thing is depressing, morose, and a bother to read. Dickens throws in characters that don't furthur the plot (do I hear paid by the word?)The characters aren't real, I mean nobody could be worse off than Stephen Blackpool; the allusions are driven home, the Bounderby as wind motif; and its basically hammered out.

There is a passel of things in the book which are inconsistent or unsatisfactory. The continued presence of Ms. Sparsit on the payroll after she has been made redundant; Blackpool's reason for defying the union; and Sissy in her entirety, for instance.Still, this is not a bad tale and parts of it are enthralling.What I found intriguiging was the obliquely described opium session between the cad and the whelp; Dickens' use of the word 'noodle' as mid-1860's vernacular slang; the mention of walnut ketchup which is still being made today and is something that I should like to try; and an introduction to a pretty decent alcoholic drink, to wit warmed sherry with lemon peel and nutmeg.I used cream sherry to make a concoction very much like a smooth-edged hot toddy; it comes highly recommended to anyone in need of a hot toddy.What I find I like even more is plain, unheated, cheap cream sherry and lemon peel which is a surprisingly excellent combination.Having said that, this book did re-introduce me to the spice nutmeg which is heady indeed--the Chinese would call it 'heaty'--and deeply satisfying."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"I liked the service and it got here very quickly, but the book itself really needs to be laminated almost if you actually want to use it, otherwise it looks very used, very soon."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"The fact that Dickens wrote \\"Hard Times\\" in weekly installments, more than probably means that there was a time and space constraint. It must not be a coincidence then that this is among his shortest novels. I suppose this is why at times, his characters wind up being caricaturesque, and not as complex and real as some of his other very memorable characters. By the same token, some of his subplots do not fit in to the main plot the way they do in most, if not all, of his other works.Dickens is trying to explore and provide us with a picture of the effects of utilitarianism on different types of human characters, and in my opinion he does a good job, but only as far as individuals go. We can see the impact of the post romantic victorian social system on all of the novel's characters, and this makes the book interesting. The downside, however, is that when Dickens tries to extrapolate and paint a picture of the social struggle going on, he falls quite short. He tries to oversimplify too much, and in my opinion, fails at that.The \\"nothing but Facts\\" system psychologically castrates most of the main characters in the book. In one way or another, they all have their share of \\"Hard Times\\", and this can surely be attributed to a dehumanizing system, where people are statistics or simply gears within the machine which represents the newly industrialized world.It is no surprise that there are absolutely no happy people in this novel. This is definitely not one happy book, but overall it's really worth reading. If what you're looking for is a book that easy to read and to understand, and a page-turner, just stay away--read John Grisham instead ;-). If you want to read Dickens, this is more that probably not his best, but it's still good."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"Considered by 19th century critics to be one of Dickens' more artistic and literary triumphs, Hard Times can be viewed in present time as a blistering polemic against the rise of industrial society and the dominate philosophy that rose in tandem with the industrial age, utilitarianismIt is well known that Dickens was a chronicler of his times, and his mode of expression, the novel. An intensely emotional individual, Dickens was known to be a power walker, starting in the afternoon, covering miles, to return home just before sunrise. It was during these extensive walks that he witnessed the utter poverty and squalor scattered throughout the streets of London. These walks brought inspiration for many of his novels, particularly, Hard Times.In this novel, Dickens explores the applications of utilitarianism in its highly rational, and in many ways, brutal forms. The novels general theme is that a philosophy that is only concerned with happiness and survival for the majority, will attempt to quash any and all individual thought and effort. Individual ideas, emotion, imagination and creativity must be ruthlessly rejected in order for the majority of people to think alike, work alike and behave alike to attain a status quo of happiness for all. Rationality must prevail because imagination promotes individuality, which is anathema to mob concerns.This polemic against utilitarianism is expressed clearly and persuasively in the practice of education. In the opening chapter for example, \`The One Thing Needful\\", the reader is introduced to this dictatorial emphasis on the rational:\\"Now, what I want is, Facts. Teach these boys and girls nothing but facts. Facts alone are wanted in life. Plant nothing else, and root out everything else. You can only form the minds of reasoning animals upon Facts: nothing else will be of any service to them.\\" (p. 47)Romanticism was now on the wane and utilitarianism and the rise of rationalism infiltrated every aspect of 19th century industrial life - emotion has no place in capitalism - the masses are reduced to statistics.Dickens main point in writing Hard Times, I believe, was to illustrate the brutality of the applications of the philosophy, utilitarianism, and the destructive results it entails when humaneness, the vital aspect of our nature, is ignored completely. Dickens was reporting, and speaking against a potentially destructive sway in society away from basic humanity and the importance of the individual, towards the highly mechanical and rational \`mob' philosophy of Utilitarianism during the Industrial revolution.In our so-called modern times, Dickens message continues to be relevant. Our societies emphasis on rationalism and the exclusion of emotion, can only lead to destruction. A balance must be found."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"A most interesting book, and not the &quot;downer&quot; one might expect from the title. The story begins with the issue of what might happen to children raised in a setting where the non-logical human qualities are repressed. This is blended in with the relationship dynamics of those who own the factories and those who make the factories actually produce something to sell. Further, related issues are added. These various topics are intermingled in a moving story."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"Despite the explicit title, &quot;Hard Times&quot; is not so much an ode to poverty and misery as it is a commentary on the increasing impact of industrialization on the fragmentation of society and on the dehumanization of education. The result, as Dickens implies, leads to lives hollowed by the emptiness of work for work's sake and wealth for wealth's sake.The setting is Coketown, a factory town befouled by industrial smog and populated by underpaid and undereducated laborers. The novel's most prominent character is one of the town's richest citizens, Josiah Bounderby, a pompous blowhard who owns a textile mill and a bank and whose conversation usually includes some boastful story about his impoverished childhood and the hard work that led to his present fortune.Bounderby is the commercial projection of Thomas Gradgrind, a local schoolteacher and an extraordinarily pragmatic man who instills in his students and his own children the importance of memorizing facts and figures and the iniquity of indulging in entertaining activities. Gradgrind offers to Bounderby his son, Tom Jr., as an unwilling apprentice, and his daughter, Louisa, as an unwilling bride.On the other end of the town's social scale is Stephen Blackpool, a simple, downcast man who works as a weaver at Bounderby's mill and slogs through life misunderstood and mistreated. When he refuses to join his fellow workers in a labor uprising, he is ostracized; when he criticizes the economic disparity between Bounderby and the workers, he is fired and forced to leave town; when Bounderby's bank is robbed one night, he is suspected as the thief. So halfway through the novel, Dickens grants his reader an interesting, albeit somewhat contrived, plot element to embellish the narrative.If this novel contains a ray of sunshine, it is in Sissy Jupe, a girl abandoned by her father and adopted by Gradgrind, whose oppressive educational method nearly breaks her. However, she grows up with her own intuitive sense of propriety, which she uses as a tool to eject a dishonorable character from the novel. Her strong and independent spirit will allow her to do much better in life than Louisa, who withers away in an unhappy marriage, and Tom Jr., whose boredom renders him vulnerable to temptations.Compared to his other novels, &quot;Hard Times&quot; is relatively short and straightforward and has few characters, as though Dickens felt that what he had to say was so important, it had to be said quickly and bluntly. He is less interested in realism than in making a point, and it's really the poetic power of his prose that enables him to get away with the overbearing sentimentality and often ridiculous caricatures that accompany his poignant human truths."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"Some critics go so far as to say this is not an important part of Dickens. In my opinion this is a serious error. If anything, this is one of his best creations. The characters are plausible. In addition, the passages are dramatic and chilling. Dickens also fills this work with suspense, powerful images, and dramatic irony. Not one page is wasted. Don't let the thin length of this book fool you. This is a phenomenal masterpiece in every sense of the word."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"As a previous writer said, this is probably not the easiest Dickens novel to read, as it lacks the charm and appeal of the more popular works like Oliver Twist and David Copperfield, but it still occupies an important place in Dickens's oeuvre. It is basically an expose of the evils of the unrestrained capitalism of the period, as Dickens portrays the lives of the poor who are held captive, oppressed, and ultimately crushed by it.In this book, although it speaks mostly from the oppressed working class and lower middle class, characters from all walks of society mingle. Although Dickens describes the dismal and oppressive working conditions of the time, the economic realities really take a back seat to the intimate story of the families, and of their trials and tribulations and failures.Fallen, old-family aristocrats like Mrs. Sparsit serve crass, nouveau-riche boors like Mr. Bounderby, whom she despises, and criminals and even circus people have important roles, such as in the case of Sissy Jupe, the daughter of a clown. The characters, however, aren't formulaic stereotypes but are real people who love, hate, make mistakes, fail, and live to regret and apologize for their mistakes.The novel takes place during the second phase in the industrial revolution which led to the development of the power loom. One of the main characters, Stephen Blackpool, is a power loom operator, and the new productivity of this device put many formerly skilled, manual loom operators out of work, further worsening an already bad unemployment situation.Gandgrind, the schoolteacher, is a rationalist representing the 18th century enlightenment ideals, and his philosophy of \\"fact\\" is shown to be a loveless and dispiriting sham. His views are ridiculed by Dickens, and his daughter ultimately rebels. In a sense, the novel is as much about the false and destructive ideals and beliefs of many of the main characters as it is about the economic vicissitudes of the time.Dickens's stories about the conditions in the factories and the lives of the workers were an important influence in changing things for the better. Eventually, England passed laws restricting child labor (to 11 hours a day), redistricting the so-called \\"rotten bourroughs\\" (whose seats in Parliament were sold by the wealthy landowners), and chattel slavery was abolished in the early 1830s, although economic slavery continued to exist in the form that Dickens depicts it in this novel. Laws were passed that didn't limit election to Parliament to landowners, and the stage was set for a fairer representation of the worker's interests.The Chartist labor movement attempted to obtain justice by smashing the looms and machines, but it ultimately failed to achieve its goals. The later labor movement was more successful in calling attention to the plight of the workers and in creating badly needed changes.By the way, an odd piece of trivia on Dickens that I read once. Just as today, back in Dickens's time even otherwise intelligent people believed in all sorts of pseudoscience. One of these was the supposed effects of magnetic fields on biological organisms, which still persists today. It was thought that if one slept with one's body aligned with the earth's magnetic field, that one would reap significant health benefits. When Dickens came to America to go on a speaking tour, the maids who came into his hotel rooms were surprised to find that he had completely rearranged the furniture so he could align the bed north and south with the magnetic field. Dickens kept a pocket compass with him so he could do just that.Unfortunately, there is no basis for such a claim although speculation about the health benefits of magnetic fields persists today. Also unfortunately for Dickens, it's too bad that there were no real positive health effects, otherwise he might have lived longer--his exhausting speaking tour wore him out and he became ill and died soon after returning to England. I've also read that he was paid $100,000 for this tour--an enormous sum of money at the time."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"Dickins was a master of satire. He routinely lampooned the social structure of his time. Hard Times deals with the philosophy of utilitarianism. You can enjoy this book without any history lesson but for full effect read a little about Jeremy Bentham, James Mill and his son John Stuart Mill. You will undoubtedly notice the parallels. This book savages the unthinking, uncaring effects of unchecked capitalism. I'm no Marxist but this book is a fine arguement not just for balance in economic thinking, but in our daily lives. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"Here is a stunning indictment of soot-covered early Victorian England. Its relevance today though should not be underestimated. Parallels abound both here at home and the world over. Hard Times is brilliant and multifaceted. Dickens is both dreadfully serious and stingingly witty. And yes, a thorough Marxist reading is certainly possible. Dickens cared deeply about the world in which he lived and his humanity shines through in every line. This book, and all that Dickens wrote, is worthwhile if only for the beauty of the prose. Those forced to read it in school are unlikely to see its value as anyone forced to do anything against the will is going to be resentful and rejecting. Be deeply suspicious though of the reader from Madison Wisconsin, Hitler, or anyone who advises the literal trashing of books."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"This review is for the audio book narrated by Martin Jarvis. This is one of the better audio books I've listened to in a while from the perspective of the narrator doing excellent voice characterizations. Jarvis was able to make each character sound distinct and they each sounded just like I would have imagined. Bounderby was thunderous, Tom Gradgrind sounded like a whelp, and Blackpool sounded meek and humble. It made for an enjoyable listen that made it very easy to follow the characters.I've always been a fan of Dickens and have read most of his books, but this was my first time through \\"Hard Times\\". As with most of Dickens novels, the characters are almost caricatures, but this method does a good job of pointing out human strengths and weaknesses. This is a short novel for Dickens, but still did a good job exploring the impact of what would happen if science is emphasized too much over emotional education.He once again highlighted the problems with class distinctions in English society at that time. I like how his humble characters have more wisdom than those that are rich or of high social position.I highly recommend this audio book as a great way to be introduced to Dicken's \\"Hard Times\\"."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"Charles Dickens, as is his custom, slams into so-called civilized 19th century British industrial scenes in a smoky place called Coketown. He writes with a sharp knife about poverty, hunger, cruel management and lack of compassion. Humor here is on the grim side."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"Hard Times was written in 1854 by England's greatest novelist CharlesDickens (1812-1870. It is the shortest of his novels. The novel was originally published as a weekly series in \\"Household Words\\" periodical edited by Dickens. The novel reads quickly telling a story that is still relevant in our own post-industrial 21st century Western Society.The novel is set in fictional Coketown set in the English Midlands. The first scene is set in a classroom where children are being taught by rotelearning. Only FACTS yells Mr. Gradgrind who has raised his two children the feckless Tom and the more impressionable Louisa to eschew the emotions of art and the heart to stick strictly to practical learning.Enter into the town Mr. Sleary's circus. Cecilia (Sissy) Jupe is a young girl whose father is employed by Sleary to ride horses. He deserts Sissy who is adopted by the Gradgrind family. Sissy befriends the lonely lass Louisa. Louisa is forced into a loveless marriage with the bloviating humbug industrialist Josiah Bounderby. Bounderby has crafted a false story of a difficult childhood while disdaining the love of his mother who lives in the country.We also met the tragic Stephen Blackpool a miner who is wed to an alocholic wife. Stephen is in love with the beautiful and kind Rachael. He will be framed for the robbery of Bounderby's bank which was really robbed by Tom Gradgrind.The novel is divided into three parts covering several years. Many of the characters come to a bad end. The novel attacks industrialism, the state of British education and the necessity for entertainment in the lives of everyone.All of Dickens fictions are worth reading. Hard Times is a good introduction to the second half of his career in which he moves to more serious themes. A Victorian classic which will be enjoyed by the discriminating reader."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"Dickens wrote some diverse plots, that's for certain. \\"Hard Times\\" certainly DOES portray some hard times. Everyone knows \\"A Christmas Carol,\\" and I had read and loved \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" years ago. This book is something altogether different.Dickens has a knack for creating memorable characters. I had to read this novel for a British Literature class a year ago, and Bounderby, Sparsit, Blackpool, and the Gradgrinds are permanently ingrained in my mind.This novel would have been more enjoyable had my class been able to read it at a slower pace! Pay careful attention to the characters' development.Also, a word on the Norton editors: I really like the way they organized the additional material at the end of the book. There's even a reading by Darwin. It's all related; I think Dickens would have liked it."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"While this was a faster paced book than usual for Dickens, and expertly written, the marked darkness of this piece is hard to avoid. Dickens is known for tackling the serious issues of his time and this is no different. He paints a scathing portrait of industrialism and a world only big enough for cold hard facts. The novel takes place in Coketown, a place laden with serpentine smoke and oppressed by the heavy burden of industry; a place where intelligence is to be fostered, but the imagination quashed.I suppose my only complaint is that this book is totally devoid of comic characters. Dickens' ability to caricaturize is amazing and he deprives his readers of that comic relief here. It really could have used a \\"Uriah Heep\\" or \\"Fagin.\\" Sure, these characers are villainous, but also darkly comic...characters one loves to hate. Without this element, Hard Times leaves one a bit depressed.Don't get me wrong, it is a good read, I just cannot put it into the same category with David Copperfield and Dombey and Son."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"Hard Times is first and foremost a burning indictment on industrialism and the total reliance on reason without consideration for emotions. It is also a great novel. I didn't get quite the same connection with the characters as in Great Expectations - I can't readily recall their names after a few months - but I know them and can remember vividly the scenes that he painted them in.Again there are several sub plots which drive the point home and wrap the novel up in such a tight and well thought out way that only Dickens could have written this. The main character, for me, is Louisa, raised under conventional wisdom on only dry facts and reason. As such, she is completely unable to cope with real life. She is married to Bounderby, who owns the local bank while her brother, Tom, works for him. Bounderby claims to been raised in the gutter, abandoned by his parents, and to have raised himself up by his bootstraps. Each character has built for themselves a house of cards which are destined to come tumbling down revealing all the flaws, all the lies and the fundamental errors of their thinking. The only person left unscathed is the abandoned circus girl who, like Biddy in Great Expectations, reminds us that the people we overlook may just be the best ones out of the bunch."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"I was forced to read Hard Times for my English class. Although I was skeptical at first, this book turned out to be pretty good. Dickens manages to create an engaging story with believable characters. He definately does an excellent job satirizing England during the Industrial Revolution. This book is not perfect, but is clearly a fine work of literature. A word of CAUTION: If you have a hard time reading wordy, descriptive passages in the Victorian writing style, this book is NOT for you! (I generally enjoy novels written during this time period.) A further note: If you are not assigned to read this book and really want to read some good Dickens, I would choose GREAT EXPECTATIONS, which I think is superior by far. Otherwise, enjoy the novel!"},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"Coketown is \\"the inner-most fortifications of that ugly citadel where Nature was as strongly bricked out as killing airs and gases were bricked in at the heart of the labyrinth of narrow courts upon courts, and close streets upon streets, which had come into existence.\\"Hard Times takes place in 1854, six years after Karl Marx first published his ideas in the Communist Manifesto. Marx revolutionized the way people looked at history. His historical science was a radically new way of looking at human history, our past, our present, and our future. Marxist themes are plentiful in Hard Times, everything from the Bourgeoisie to the Proletariat are represented in this account of the industrial revolution.Dickens provides an excellent portrayal of real-life people faced with hard times amidst an economic boom. This is a touching story, giving names and faces to the people who are creating, being replaced by, and being abused by the industrial revolution. The Communist Manifesto is not complete until you have read Hard Times."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"Still not a bad story, but rather more depressing than most of his books, there is very little to make this an enjoyable read, as Dickens usually is. Also, there is very little subtlety here; Dickens has a point (facts are not everything; there is more to life than practicality) and he hammers that point home repeatedly, making little effort to allow the reader to feel clever for having discerned the author's point. Most of the characters are caricatures, with the possible exception of Louisa; this is a flaw not unusual in Dickens' writing, but it seems more noticable and blatant here than in some of his better stories.Worth reading, but not excellent."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"I just finished this book, it is the third of Dickens novels that I have read. It is one of his shortest so it was easy to get through reading it in a decent amount of time. I enjoyed the characters he introduced, but I found myself getting a tad bit lost in some of his phraseology trying to figure out what was being said and understand exactly what was going on. Perhaps not everyone will enjoy this novel of Dickens, but the one thing I do like about Dickens is you can't breeze through any of his novels without putting some effort into concentrating on what is being said-or else you get lost! This being said, It isn't the most light hearted of his novels, but If you enjoy reading Dickens, you will most likely like reading this one, too, even if it isn't necessarily his best one."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"I read this book later than I read novels such as Great Expecatations and David Copperfield, but I don't remember it as well. Hard Times is a fine novel - short, often miserable (but that's the reason why this novel is so important), but with a good message. It's also an effective satire that actually does have its moments of humor as well as pathos (such as when Stephen Blackpool dies). I do recommend it, but as good as a book it is, it'll never be one of my favorite Dickens novels."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"\\"Now what I want is, Facts. Teach these boys and girls nothing but Facts. Facts alone are wanted in life...Stick to the Facts, sir!\\" With this opening, Dickens shoves his message down the gullet of the reader of Hard Times which is indicative of the entire story line, characters, and the social message that he is trying to shout out to his audience. The book is an allegorical message in every sense of the word where his descriptions of the character's physical traits bring their personalities to life. Dicken's description of the story's setting, Coketown, and those who live and work there, also illustrates the bleak and dismal attitude surrounding the Victorian Era and the changing social structure of the time.The tale begins in a school, barren of the delightful faces usually evident in children, due to the staunch efforts of Mr. Gradgrind and Mr. M'Choakumchild, the proprietor and schoolmaster of Coketown's school. Their quest is to instill nothing but facts into the children of Coketown \\"until they were full to the brim.\\" They attempt to create an environment in which no child will be allowed flights of fancy or fits of imagination. The fruits of this quest are strongly apparent in Gradgrind's own children, Thomas and Louisa, who are encouraged to learn facts, and not allowed to participate in activities that other youths would see as a necessary part of life. Following their education, the two are given over to the control of Mr. Bounderby, a self-proclaimed, self-made man, proud that he has pulled himself up the \\"corporate ladder\\" and into a better life than he claims to have come from. Louisa becomes Bounderby's wife at the insistence of her father, and Thomas, an employee at Bounderby's bank. The one wild card added into the equation is Sissy Jupe, the daughter of a circus performer who has abandoned his station in life and his daughter, as well. Gradgrind takes in this pure, young soul in order to prove that his methods can be used to teach respect and proper behavior, even in a girl raised in an environment such as the one in which Sissy has been raised.Along the path, Dickens introduces some of the other residents of Coketwon, including Stephen Blackpool, an honest and hardworking, virtuous man who lives in misery due to bad choices made in his youth. His friend and co-worker, Rachael, is also hardworking and honest, and although there is romantic interest evident, Blackpool's unwise decisions of younger days keep them apart. Also mired in the plot is Mrs. Sparsit, Mr. Bounderby's house keeper, and a truly despicable and pathetic character. And last in the line of detestable characters that Dickens adds is James Harthouse, an upstart from another place whose sole purpose in the novel is to wreak havoc on the lives of the others while remaining absolutely clueless to his part in their misery. The story continues as the characters trod along in their lives with only suspicion that there is another way of life, until Dickens casts his redemption spell in the form of Stephen Blackpool's martyrdom for society and Sissy's powerful moral character that affects Harthouse so strongly that he leaves Coketown.Throughout the tale, Dickens so strongly exerts his opinions and hopes that at times the book left me feeling ambivalent towards almost every charcter introduced. And his use of language, although allowing the tale to be vivid in the mind of the audience, also makes the reader wonder if he wasn't being paid by the word, rather than by the page."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"This is a gem and for those readers out there who are tempted to try Dickens, then, apart from A Christmas Carol, this is the only book by him that can be read in a day (unless you are an insomniac). I have - like many of the other reviewers I am sure - read every one of Dickens' works including the unfinished Mystery of Edwin Drood. For sheer brilliance, Pickwick Papers, David Copperfield, Bleak House and in my opinion Little Dorrit. But for something transcending literature - a deep social and political commentary - try Hard Times. Plus you won't grow old trying to finish it as it's about 300 pages (220 in somew versions)."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"Dickens has an incredible energy that, after putting away a few dull contemporary novels, should be immeadiately striking to anyone. And with the wonderfully satirical opening of Hard Times, \\"Now, what I want is, Facts....\\" he continues to begin a book better than anyone. That energy does not dissapate as the novel progresses.Hard Times is set in the industrial but fictional Coketown. Its central point of concern is a certain ultilitarian/Victorian sensibility, a point of view that reduces everthing to rationality. This reaches is most tragic moment when a father must watch her daughter literally crushed by a \\"economical\\" marriage that he encouraged. Rationality also dictates the divisions of labor and class, that become dehumanizing.But while this book is satirical, and does have a social agenda, Hard Times can't be reduced to that agenda. It isn't merely a collection of opinions. There is too much here for that. Characters are shamed, outcast, forced into \\"sensible\\" but unfulfilling lives, and commit crimes while letting others take the fall. Unlike some of our contemporary satires, Hard Times doesn't just mock. There is heart and tragedy too. Further, no one, rich or poor, gets off the hook. Whether its Slackbridge the union leader and a group factory workers, or a wealthy banker, anyone who lacks humanity is shamed. Probably the richest and most aristoratic character, James Harthouse, is judged indifferently. Dickens isn't a partisan.Hard Times is the shortest Dickens novel and its brevity is a double edged sword. While one is not exhausted at its conclusion (As I was with David Copperfield), and there are less story lines to confuse, you a don't know the characters as well as you do with the longer novels, and the cast of characters isn't as wide. Also absent is some of the jolly or quirky characters that are Dickens staples. This accounts for why some call it a dreary novel, though I disagree.This isn't his best, and there will be some moments when you shake your head (why does everyone seem to die with perfect timing?) but Hard Times is still great. When I criticize one of Dickens' novels, I compare his low moments with his high ones, not to other writers. I will continue to read his novels and love their energy and wit."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"If you read Hard Times for the sole purpose of being entertained you will probably be highly disappointed. However, if you understand what was happening during this time period, you will realize that Hard Times is in reality, a long commentary. The Industrial Revolution was starting to show its down side. There was rampant poverty and disease, from the overcrowding of the cities. Children of the poor had to work long hours in unsafe factories rather than go to school. The gulf between the haves and the have-nots was very wide. The middle class was only beginning to be a distinct group.This then was the backdrop of Hard Times. Dickens is making a social and political statement. This is a statement against the mechanizing of society. It starts with Dickens repeated use of the word fact. It is facts that have meaning. Human conventions like feeling, compassion or passion have no meaning or looked down upon as an inconvienent waste of time. If a situation cannot be put down on paper as in an accounting ledger it should not be considered.This is where the conflict of the book comes in. Which helps humanity more compassion or fact. Is Bounderby a better person than Blackpool? Bounderby, who by his own admission was a self-made man. Untrue as this was he said it enough to make it his own reality. Or Blackpool, a weaver with an alcoholic wife, who was in love with another woman. Facts made Bounderby rich, compassion made Blackpool human.Louisa presents another conflict. Louisa was educated only by fact. No wonder or inquisitiveness was ever allowed. She was the perfect robot. Doing what she was told when she was told. Just another piece of the machine, however, the piece broke, emotions came out, and they broke down the wall of fact that Mr. Gradgrind had so carefully constructed. Because the feelings have finally been acknowledged things really break down. She finds that not only has she married the wrong man but also the man she did marry is a buffoon whom she cannot respect nor live with.The reader is left wondering if there is no one who will not be ruined by all the worship to fact. The whelp has certainly been ruined to the point he feels no responsibility to anyone but himself. If a situation can not be used to his advantage then he has no use for it, as a matter of course, he will run when he believes he will have to take responsibility for his own actions.The gypsies have not been ruined by fact. But only because they live outside of society, they do not conform to the rules of society. These are the people who value character over social status. The gypsies do not value Bounderby and Bitzer with all their pomp and egomania. Rather they value Stephen Blackpool and Cecilia whom can show compassion and kindness no matter a person's station in life.Hard Times can be used to look at today's society. Are we, as a society more worried about our computers, cell phones, faxes, and other gadgets than our neighbor's well being? Do we only get involved to help others when there is a personal benefit? Or, are we like the gypsies who can look into the character of the person and not worry about the socio-economic status? While Dickens' wrote Hard Times about 19th century England the moral can easily fit into 21st century America"},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"Charles Dickens visited Preston during a strike. So, this book is written largely based on his observations. People tend to go from one extreme to the other on this one. They tend to either really like it, or really dislike it. While it lacks the artful improvisation of some of his works like \\"The Pickwick Papers,\\" \\"David Copperfield,\\" or \\"Our Mutual Friend,\\" it is good in a different way. Right away, we meet Thomas Gradgrind who thinks that FACTS are the answers to all the questions in life. While he may seem harsh and brutal, he does have a conscience, and he honestly believes in what he does. We then meet Sissy Jupe and Bounderby. Sissy Jupe is pretty much the opposite of Thomas Gradgrind. She is one who hangs onto sentiment and hope. Bounderby on the other hand is the more dark and extreme version of Gradgrind. (Though it is hard to hate Bounderby because we can see the society that created him.) Through clever wording, Dickens describes the darkness and sadness of the area. Interestingly, the dark Bounderby has one notable redeeming feature. He is good to his housekeeper Mrs. Sparsit. We later meet Stephen Blackpool who has worked 12 years in Bounderby's factory. He is a good honest man who suffers because he can not go along with any extreme. He loves a woman named Rachel, but he is already married. (And of course the marriage is not a happy one.) Stephen then has a dream that foreshadows his fate. One of the most disturbing events of the book then takes place. Under her father's advice, the 20 year old Louisa agrees to marry the 50 year old Bounderby. (Charles Dickens could have hardly known that some time later he would marry the young Ellen Ternan, but we won't go there.) Later, we learn that Slackbridge is stirring up a mutiny in the factory and poor Stephen Blackpool is cast out because he will not join. And even Bounderby will not help poor Stephen. (What a situation!) Louisa (now Mrs. Bounderby) gives Stephen some money to help him, but Tom Jr knows that he can probably use Stephen's slowness to his advantage. James Harthouse starts to grow close to Louisa, and we can see the tension rising. The bank is then robbed, and poor Stephen Blackpool is suspected, but it doesn't take much for us to know who really did it. Interestingly, Mrs. Sparsit (Bounderby's servant) continues to use Louisa's maiden name. Louisa knows that her brother probably robbed the bank, but she can not bring herself to tell. The tension between Bounderby and Louisa begins to increase, and we can guess that the marriage does not have much longer. In a well written chapter Louisa has an emotional breakdown due to her upbringing, and the good in Thomas Gradgrind starts to show. His intentions were good, but he realizes he was wrong. (Thomas Gradgrind is not exactly a Murderstone or a Uriah Heep.) In a rage, Bounderby ships Louisa's stuff back to her father's, and we can see the marriage is over. But there is more to come. Stephen Blackpool is still suspected of robbing the bank, and fleeing did not help the situation. He makes his way back to proclaim his innocence, and he has a fatal accident. Poor Thomas realizes that his son robbed the bank. And in a moment of irony, the circus (that Gradgrind scorned so openly) is hiding his son. There is a brief and tragic reunion, and Thomas Jr is sent out of the country where he can hide in safety. And if it's any small consolation prize to Mr. Gradgrind, Thomas Jr does mend his ways. While the book does not exactly end in utter happiness, the characters do grow in a sense, so it does not end in utter sadness either."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"I'm surprised by all the two and three-star reviews appearing on this site. For me, &quot;Hard Times&quot; was enjoyable right from the start and memorable long after. The writing is evocative and fluid, and although it can be easy to get lost due to some of the anachronisms in Dickens' writing, in general the writing is excellent. The characters, while not subtle (it's pretty easy to sum them up in a few words) are all memorable and tug on the heartstrings quite a bit. Sissy, Mr. Gradgrind, Mr. Bounderby, Stephen, Tom, and Louisa are great characters (and just because they're easily defined, they are no less human or believable). Finally, the story itself is a bit sobering (as it was intended to be) but it's also very human and shows the possibilities of redemption quite nicely.In short, &quot;Hard Times&quot; is excellent. I'd recommend it to any fan of Dickens or just anybody who likes good literature."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"I love the ending of this novel by Dickens when he says:\\"Dear reader! It rests with you and me, whether, in our two fields of action, similar things shall be or not. Let them be! We shall sit with lighter bosoms on the hearth, to see the ashes of our fires turn cold and grey.\\"This novel is all about what one would think of as a dreary life in a north England mill town (fictitiously) called Coketown. It is named after the seemingly endless plumes of thick coal smoke being emitted from many different mills in this small lifeless town. But true to Dickens style he gives us a delightful set of characters that we can love or hate but who keep us entertained through a quick read of about 300 pages.There is method in the madness, in that Dickens tries to push us in the direction of accepting that fate was not preordained for these folks and they could choose a better life if they so desired. He includes many biblical references and references to the mid 1800 culture to keep it all upbeat and entertaining.I was expecting a more depressing plot to reflect the title \\"Hard Times\\", but in many ways it is good times for some of the characters, and as Dickens says at the end that he can hope for a positive outcome for their lives - the precise details of which he leaves us guessing.Entertaining 5 star read at a bargain price by a wonderful author."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"... of English literature? I read \\"Hard Times\\" -- the 1969 Penguin Classics edition, which I still own and which is still intact -- roughly 40 years ago, in the midst of a Dickens binge, and I'm surprised to find that the humor in it has gotten angrier from aging on my book shelf. The anger has a lot of targets: industrial pollution and ugliness, the smug hypocrisy of the wealthy, the connivance and impotence of lawmakers, the class inequity of the Law, the dysfunctional divorce laws of England, the inaccessibility of education for the poor, the 'utilitarian' social philosophy of the era, the sort of education that crushed a child's creativity under the thumb of intellectual conformity and economic utility. In fact, a lot of the humor of \\"Hard Times\\" is of the bitter, scornful variety -- no less funny for being preachy -- while the tirades of anger are bedecked and bedizened in the drollest caricatures and exaggerations, as if Mr. Pickwick were asked to expound the utopianism of Charles Fourier.But I admit that I had remembered \\"Hard Times\\" inaccurately. I recalled it as being a tale of 'labor agitation' in a mill town, rather like Emile Zola's great protest novel \\"Germinal\\". There is indeed a brief episode of labor protest, scarcely a chapter in the middle of the book, but the narrative focuses far more on the family affairs of the utilitarian philanthropist Gradgrind with his two children and the despicable mill owner Josiah Bounderby, boor, boaster, bully, buffoon. Gradgrind has raised his daughter and son, by the most systematic repression of their imaginations and sympathies, to be paragons of utilitarian values. The son inevitably turns out to be a self-centered scoundrel and the daughter a frigidly dutiful automaton. Gradgrind weds his beautiful young daughter to the far older and dictatorial Bounderby, and plot complications ensue. \\"Hard Times\\" encompasses three tales of woefully failed marriages, a thwarted seduction and hopelessly obstructed romance. There's really only one \\"working man' in the cast of \\"Hard Times\\" - the honest but 'limited' weaver Stephen Blackpool, whose eventual fate provides the pathos readers must have expected in a novel of 1854. The 'introduction' to my ancient Penguin Edition, by David Craig, perceptively challenges Dickens's own inability to assign a well-rounded self-determining 'humanity' to his lower-class characters, for all of his purported sympathy with their plight. Blackpool has the virtues of a victim only, a dumb beast. The circus performers, who appear in the novel at the beginning and who return at the end, are likewise morally admirable but incomplete. Frankly, if one stops too often to think about the reforming zeal of Charles Dickens, one can get frustrated with the man, especially when reading his earlier novels like Hard Times. He was, I fear, as hidebound in his assumptions of social class as anyone in Victorian England; he merely had a warmer heart and a much sharper pen. There's a brisk current of influence from the literary works of Dickens to the political and sociological notions of Progressivism, the Social Gospel, the Temperance Movement, and all the elitist reformers of the late 19th and early 20th Centuries.Do not, however, let analysis of any Dickens novel inhibit your pleasure at the vitality and inventiveness of his words! That's another thing I'd forgotten over the years since my first Dickens binge: just how damned well the aptly-named \\"Dickens\\" could write!"},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"A book called \\"Hard Times\\" doesn't sound like the type of book you'd pick up for some light, cheerful reading, but you shouldn't judge a book by its cover - or its title either. \\"Hard Times\\" certainly deals with a difficult subject, but thanks to the genius of Dickens, it never becomes unbearably depressing.At the centre of the novel are the upheavals of the mid-1800s that changed the world forever: the rise of the Industrial Revolution, mass manufacturing and capitalism, and the rural-to-urban flow that led to compulsory schooling and shocking living conditions for vast amounts of the English population. The Enlightenment was gaining in popularity, as was the bourgeois class, which was gradually outing the old aristocracies. It was a time of drastic social and economic change, and inevitably many less-fortunate people fell down the cracks in the new system. With all this as his background, Dickens creates various characters of differing classes and the impact such social changes had in their lives. Exploring the phenomena on individual, familial and social levels, Dickens reveals some of the pain and misery that plagued his time-period, and is still very much relevant to our present day condition.What is vitally important to understand is that reading \\"Hard Times\\" is reading history - in more ways than one. As a philanthropist who investigated the factory conditions of the working class, Dickens not only vividly describes the situation as he saw it with his own two eyes, but threw light on the cruelty that was at work to the general public (before there was investigative journalists, there were novelists). It was partly because of the publicity that Dickens raised in regards to factories and workhouses that philanthropists came to the aid of the poor and that laws were passed in order to secure better conditions for the lower classes. The pen is indeed mightier than the sword.Thrown into the mix of this great social and political satire are a range of vivid (though often one-dimensional characters) of all classes and situations who all dwell in the industrial town of Coketown, described as \\"a town of red brick, or of brick that would have been red if the smoke and ashes had allowed it...a town of machinery and tall chimneys, out of which interminable serpents of smoke trailed themselves for ever and ever, and never got uncoiled.\\" Out of this miserable place comes Sir Thomas Gradgrind, a man uninterested in anything but facts - at school, at home and in life in general. His children Louisa and Thomas are the products of a strictly factually-based education; as a result she is clinically depressed (as we would describe it in modern terms) and her brother turns to cards and drinking in order to alleviate his boredom with the world. Among the lower-class is Stephen Blackpool, an honest and hardworking older man who is in love with fellow worker Rachael, but because of his class is unable to divorce his drunken wife. Providing the lighter side of this dreary existence is the circus, which brings colour and enjoyment into the lives of the Coketown residents simply for its own sake, personified by Sissy Jupes, the daughter of a clown who brings a sense of fancy and spiritual understanding into the lives around her that mere facts don't even begin to provide.All of these lives, plus many more eventually collide in typical Dickens melodrama, with the clear message that imagination (or \\"fancy\\") and the need for simple pleasures in life are essential for the good of humanity. Whether it is in the strict classroom, the dismal workhouses or the familial unit, the human spirit will be crushed without some measure of light, laughter and enjoyment. As an extra bonus, \\"Hard Times\\" is one of Dickens's shortest novels; if you are a steady reader it shouldn't take you more than a week to complete!Some critique \\"Hard Times\\" as being too transparent in some of its themes and messages, and though this is probably true (with his characters representing different points of view, rather than being three-dimensional figures), this is precisely the point of the novel. Unlike \\"David Copperfield\\" or \\"Great Expectations\\", this is not a story that revolves around one particular character and their development, but rather an assemble piece that has the \`hard times' as its main focus. Therefore, characters do not need to be anything but a representative of worldview; Mr Gradgrind as the strict rationalist, Bounderby as the hypocritical bourgeois member, Blackpool as the angelic poor man, Mrs Sparsit as a member of the fading aristocracy and Slackbridge as an ignorant trades-union agitator (proving that although Dickens had sympathy for the poor, he still believed that giving them *too* much power was a dangerous thing).These were hard times indeed, but this novel attempts to show that there is hope for humanity to see such times through to the other side."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"To write an outline of Hard Times or Dickens' work would not be necessary. His writing has withstood the test of time, and is well know. To give encouragement to would-be Dickens' readers and Hard Times readers does seem like time well spent.Hard Times ventures from other Dickens' books in the writing style lending a departure from Dickens' previous descriptive formats. In this particular book, Dickens lends skill, imagination, and panache to English language usage. He breathes life in to the language of the novel, and he remains a master of dramatic setting and story line. When people say, \\"Read good books, it will rub off on you.\\" Hard Times comes first to my mind. Therefore, a reason to read Hard Times would be to improve your own reading and writing.I admit some of the character's lives are depressing. When I looked back upon the entire book, and wondered if Hard Times would differ if set in present day with cell phones, PDAs, the Internet, electricity, airplanes, automobiles, and so many distractions. My guess would be - probably not. Would Louisa Gradgrind's life have taken a different course if she were living in today's world? My guess would be, perhaps, a slight shift on her circumstances, and, again, probably not. Dickens' charms include being able to put his finger on a character type and bring it to life. This is why I'd call certain present day figures, \\"A Mr. Bounderby\\" or \\"A Gradgrind\\". The Whelp or Tom Gradgrind remains alive and kicking; I've met him.My recommendation: Read Hard Times. You will be a better reader and writer for it."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"Although not one of his more popular novels, Charles Dickens' Hard Times still stands as a classic among classics. Carrying on with his highly prolific writing style, this novel is a bit more bleak than his other renown works, but enjoyable from the start, especially with Dickens' excellent choice of character naming.Suitable for most ages, this classic should not be passed up.

Instead of the usual monthly periodical installments with room to spare, \\"Hard Times\\" was done in weekly installments with a very limited space allotment, for the newspaper \\"Household Words.\\" Dickens found the combined pressure of time and space nearly intolerable, given the breadth and depth of his vision for needed social reform. One can only imagine how much better, fuller, and more satisfying this book would have been -- in plot, character-development, dramatic impact -- if Dickens had written it as 900 pages over two years, rather than 300 pages in five months."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"This book at times was challenging to read due to its drab setting (Victorian England) and heavy (read: depressing) subject matter, but its clear message and singularity of theme helped keep me focused: all work and no play makes Jack (or in this case, the Gradgrind children) a dull boy. All in all, an excellent and convincing criticism of Utilitarianism. The characters were well developed and evoked genuine feeling, although ultimately you either hate or feel sorry for all of them. Poor Louisa was piteous, having bypassed childhood and forgone love to slavishly follow her father's iron rule; while Josiah Bounderby elicited the kind of loathing one has for a sleazy politician, the way he concealed his privileged background in order to appear self-made and humble.Despite being almost 150 years old, this tale wasn't dated one bit, and its lessons are appropriate today along the lines of &quot;stop and smell the roses.&quot; However, its teachings are not of the inspirational sort, and to read this I would suggest being free from distractions (you will need to concentrate to get through some of the slower parts), and keeping some sort of emotional pick-me-up nearby afterwards. Lastly, unlike some reviews I have seen, I thought it was seamless, despite its being published in installments."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"Although critics dislike Dickens' novels for their twisted, drawn-out plots and his maddening penchant for creating soap-operas in the midst of otherwise realistic plots, these faults must be considered in light of the genre that Dickens wrote for: the magazine serial. Even if one is not fond of the structure of Hard Times, a closer example of the story as a period piece crafted to satisfy the tawdry tastes of the rag-reading public exposes a masterpiece of suspense and morality. A very important work and worth reading with or without this context."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"I think everyone can agree right from the start that \\"Hard Times\\" is not Charles Dickens's greatest work. It is certainly nothing compared to works of a similar length, such as \\"Tale of Two Cities\\" or \\"Great Expectations.\\" But even Dicken's lesser works are gems, although a bit less refined.The tale spreads across three households, the upright and serious Gradgrind family, the wealthy blowhard Joseph Bounderby of Coketown, and the dismal, poverty stricken Stephen Blackpool and his wretched, drunken wife. Gradgrind is all facts, and raises his children to be without imagination or wonder. Bounderby, a self-proclaimed self-made man is all appearances, having dragged himself out of the gutter into station. Blackpool is all honesty, unable to commit even the smallest wrong that would bring his own happiness.Into this mix are thrown two strays, the orphaned but lighthearted Sissy Jupe and the immoral and charismatic James Harthouse. They are the catalyst for the downfall of the orderly lives built by Gradgrind and Bounderby, and the further descent of Blackpool. No good deed goes unpunished in \\"Hard Times,\\" but neither does an ill deed go rewarded.Dickens's shortest novel, \\"Hard Times\\" is only a small investment of time to spend with such rich characters. Lacking the light-hearted balance from his longer novels, the short length is a relief as too much more dreariness could be an undoing. At the same time, a deeper exploration of the lives and philosophies of the storyline would have made for a richer experience."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"It is unfortunate that HARD TIMES by Charles Dickens is not usually read outside the classroom. It is an unforgettable glimpse of an age that did not prize the worth of the individual over a collective society--sort of like today's emphasis on the same. What stamps HARD TIMES as the classic that it is is Dickens' continual focus on the rights of the individual and his championing of anti-child labor laws. In an age that routinely crushed individuals in the grinding gears of a society that was hell-bent on automating the factory system, it was only lone voices like Charles Dickens who, in his novels, cried out to stop the madness. In HARD TIMES, Dickens takes a savagely satirical poke at a then popular system of thought: utilitarianism, a philosophy which saw men and children as interchangeable cogs in a machine that demanded that all facets of life and output be reduced to facts, numbers, and quantifiable data. Thomas Gradgrind opens the novel by insisting that the students in his school be just like Officer Joe Friday from &quot;Dragnet&quot; fame: give me the facts, and only the facts. Those who can deliver advance. Those who cannot get routinely squashed flat. Josiah Bounderby is the villain as he represents the ultimate in a selfishness and fact-centeredness way of life. As typical of Dickens, there is a vast assortment of subplots that he manages to tie neatly together by the closing pages. What stamps HARD TIMES as relevant in this or any future age is Dickens' insistance that, regardless of technological advances, the individual will always matter. HARD TIMES says this as well as any other book."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"Hard Times feels like a book that Dickens did not polish nearly as much as the many classics associated with his name. It's the story of the unhappy lives of two children of a father who raised them to speak and appreciate only &quot;facts.&quot; Imagination, fantasy, passion, and the like were all forbidden in their household.Their lives are unhappy, as you'd expect. But they also lack much narrative interest. The usual twists and turns of fate that Dickens invests into his characters' lives are mostly absent. As a result the book drags on. Hard Times also lacks the humor found in other Dickens books, his pithy observations of different persona of his time. So, in reading the uninspiring narrative, you find yourself wishing for something, anything of the old Dickensian magic.

This book takes a hard shot at Utilitarinism and with good reason. The imagery and description in this book are simply brillant. A definate read if you want a look at how it was in the Victorian Era."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"This is a totally honest book of life between the lower and upper class. Having lived in the United Kingdom for more than 4 years, I truly appreciate Dicken's description of the physical environements of Coketown. It has so much resemblance of present day London's buildings, especially with regards to the North and South part of the city from Zone two onwards, except for the trailing serpents of smoke.As to the characters so vividly presented and the conversations that were exchanged between them in the course of the narration, I just enjoy the satire on fat old Bounderby, the game being turned upon the Gradgrinds, I think mainly to shame Mr old Tom Gradgrind for his stiff-necked beliefs in 'hard facts'. The consoling fact is he did learnt his lessons.Poor Mrs Gradgrind. It was a pity that she had to be killed off so soon in the story. If she had been alive till the end, what would she say to her daughter's divorce, her son's connection with the bank robbery and Bounderby big fat lies? Probably nothing but something she would never hear the last of!I don't know much on how to comment with a literature eye, but I think Dickens did write pretty well here. I would not hesitate to read it again but since I still have a lot of other books to peruse, I may just as well skip this second reading till later..."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"While this is certainly one of Dickens' shorter novels, that does not stop me from considering it an exquisite masterpiece. In all honesty &quot;Hard Times&quot; (1854) is full of chilling passages and convincing characters such as Thomas and Louisa Gradgrind. There is not one single dull moment. Also, every chapter is full of striking images. In addition, the suspense and dramatic irony are well placed. To be sure, many of Dickens' full length books such as &quot;Dombey &amp; Son&quot; (1848) and &quot;Bleak House&quot; (1853)are exquisite as well. But, don't let the thin length of &quot;Hard Times&quot; fool you. It is a masterpiece and one I highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"To be quite honest, I didn't find this book overly entertaining. However, though you may call me old-fashioned, I still believe there is educational value to reading. And the book is educational. For openers, it provides us a picture of the world in which Dickens lived. It isn't a very attractive picture, but it is probably an accurate one. The city of Coketown was dirty; its inhabitants breathed polluted air; they struggled to make ends meet. There were a few exceptions among the upper echelon, like Bounderby who owned a country home to which he could retreat. But for the most part, the citizens of Coketown were trapped in a day-to-day mundane existence that didn't offer many bright spots. There's no way I would want to trade places.The book is also revealing in other ways. We learn of the class structures of Dickens' day. We learn of the silly pretensions and the airs people of the upper class put on. Morality and integrity seem mostly limited to the lower class, particularly the circus. Dickens gives us a picture of education that is dreary, directed at the head and away from the heart. The carrying out of justice seems somewhat elusive. In the words of Stephen Blackpool, \\"its all a muddle.\\" This could be a summary of the times. Things do seem to be pretty messed up.Still, the book has its appeal. I think for me, the best part was the descriptions of the characters. They definitely weren't complex or sophisticated. On the contrary, they were almost too obvious in their representation of the roles they played. They remind me of facades of a building on a movie set. Bounderby is constantly bragging that he \\"came from a ditch.\\" His character reminds me of so many people who thrive on a sense of their own importance. Tom was a whiner--please, spare me the privileged child who is never satisfied and always looking to be bailed out. Louisa needed to get some gumption and stop doing everything according to the book. For Pete's sakes, forget your upbringing and get a life! Sissy was fun; and Rachael was admirable. Stephen Blackpool got quite a bit of ink devoted to him. Had his character had a better command of the English language we might actually have been able to understand what he was saying. Oh, well. The best characters, without a doubt, were Mrs. Sparsit and Bitzer. Mrs. Sparsit gets the Oscar for best female in a comedy role; Bitzer for the character everyone loves to hate. The circus people deserve at least a mention; they definitely add some color to the novel.So, no, its not a must-read, in my opinion. But I've definitely read a lot worse. You must take fair warning, though. Nearly everyone I know has to power through at least the first half of the book. Eventually it gains some momentum, and you'll probably want to finish it. Even if you're not crazy about the book, you can still mention you've read something by Charles Dickens. Someone somewhere might actually be impressed."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"I picked up this book at B&N; because I had just read two Jane Austin novels and I thought this would be a light read. I was wrong. The beggining and the end had a purpose in the story but the middle could have been much, much shorter and the ending made a little longer.I liked the character of Mr. Bounderby. He was very well developed. I would even say over-developed, but he was the only one. How did Sissy influence the youngest Gradgrind? Why didn't we know of Mrs. Bounderbys inner turmoil till she ran to her father? Every character had something missing. What happened to Mr. Bounderby once he was found out? Why is Sissy so special and what did she really do for the family?It was a long book where nothing much happened until the last quarter and when it finally ended I felt cheated because it lacked a complete story line and full characters.

The thing that really saves it towards the middle. So I would not read this book if you are looking for something gripping or that will really make you eager to find out what is going to happen next. The book is simply put a drama with no positive turning points until the end. The ending of a book is really inportant to me. This book has a good ending , so that raises the from my point of view.The book was kind of hard to follow for me. One of the main reasons for this is the fact that there are too many characters. There is at least twenty. Some of these characters are Louisa, Mr. Bounderby, Mr. Gradgrind, Sissy Jupe, and Stephen Blackpool. Stephen Blackpool's story was very sad and really affected my emotions as I read it. I also felt that Sissy Jupe went through a lot but stayed strong through her troubles.The basic storyline is this: Mr. Gradgrind opens a private school that teaches his philosophy: facts only! He is the father of Tom and Louisa. Louisa has been preplanned to marry Mr. Bounderby, a banker that is twice her age. She does not like this.This book also does not teach good morals and the reading level is pretty high. I would say that anyone who reads this book should be at least 15 years old.

The high schools of America would be better off trashing their Dickens paperbacks and reading something with real value, like Lewis Carroll or the Marquis De Sade, both masterful storytellers of the absurdity of authority.

Not only do you get a handsomely presented copy of Hard Times, but articles and criticism about the work in one package.For me Hard Times becomes the indispensable Dickens. The relationship between Sissy Jupe and the Gradgrind children is something that is relevant today as it was 165 years ago. That the Education system can ruin children is absolutely a point that needs to be addressed in modern times. The Gradgrind academy only cares about facts, and only turns out vacuous twits. Only Sissy Jupe comes out of the academy with a head on her shoulders. Young Tom Gradgrind shows the folly of removing morals from the schools. He has no understanding of anything but how to take advantage of any particular situation. What is worse, his Father Old Tom Gradgrind tries to cover for him. How is that not relative to today's world?Besides getting the novel, one also gets the critical articles in the back, which help make sense of the whole thing. I am not saying that Dickens, in any of his works is hard to understand, but I especially like the articles from the time period in which the works were written.

If you want a fluid book that is more this type of story,read Great Expectations,which is not my favorite book but it certainly makes more sense. Personally, my favorite Dickens is Oliver Twist."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"_Hard Times_ is a familiarly sentimental work by Dickens. This is especially the case regarding the character of Sissy Jupe, an overly sweet, innocent young girl who is abandoned by her father. Dickens seems determined to tug at the heart strings with this character.Dickens does an admirable job in covering new ground concerning the factory owners and bankers exploitation of the poor, as well as exploring the beginnings of labor unrest in 1850's England. There is much for the factory laborer to be unhappy with in Cokestown, where the factories belch out dirty, polluted smoke all day long. Dickens combines these issues with his examination of the difficulties inherent in parenting and gives truth to the old adage that how the branch is bent, so grows the tree. Through much grief and contrition years later, school master Thomas Gradgrind learns that a cold, no nonsense approach to bringing up his daughter Louisa and his son, Tom, was wrong. Louisa has a good heart and dotes on her younger brother, but is otherwise very distrustful of humanity and exists in the world suffused in apathy; Tom is simply, as Dickens calls him, \\"a whelp\\", and a dishonest one at that. Louisa marries Josiah Bounderby, a banker who turns his nose up at the factory hands and mocks their aspirations to move up in the world. Bounderby refers to these individuals as trying to put a \\"gold spoon\\" in their mouths. The actions of Bounderby and the Gradgrinds directly lead to tragic consequences for Stephen Blackpool, an honest and courageous loom worker, who merely chooses not to be involved with the townspeople or their labor leader. Another old truth that there is no justice in the world is as real today as it was in Dickens' time."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"This book isn't Oliver Twist. This book reminds me of Animal Farm, only not as comical, but the social commentary is the same. What would the world be like if children were raised without that magical sense of wonder and pretend? What was the world like before the working class was not respected for all the hard work they do? Those definately would be hard times. This is just the scenario in this book. In this book, Coketown is a hard place. The factory workers toil day in and day out yet get no respect from &quot;civilized society&quot;. Louisa and Thomas Gradgrind are raised with books and facts and no room in the world for emotion, and then Sissy, a carnie orphan, enters their world as each spiral in different directions due to their upbringing. What happens? Hard times indeed but in the end, the human spirit triumphs even if not everyone gets to see that wonderful ending."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"It's the way things happen, not the pizzazzy prose or the dialogue, that sets Charlie up to be read by every high school student alive. While not hideously exciting to the modern reader, there is a lot to be gleaned from this compassionate narrative about the unhumanness of the modern world."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"&quot;Death by verbosity&quot; describes the critic's failure not Dickens'. There are no such things as neat conclusions in Dickens, note the several rewrites of the the final chapter of &quot;Great Expectations&quot;. Dickens expanded the concept of character in the novel to embrace the socially situated type as a means of understanding the relationship between society and the individual. This helped to forge a self-conciously social literature and thereby making the link between art and politics textually explicit."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"I initially lamented the fact that Hard Times was assigned to me in my British lit. class. I had read some of Dickens's melodramas like A Tale of Two Cities and Oliver Twist and enjoyed them, but everything I heard about Hard Times said this was nothing like those. This was supposedly just strictly social commentary. My interpretation of that: BORING.But then I read it.Hard Times isn't like Dickens's other novels, but I don't think that it has any less heart than those masterpieces. In fact, Dickens endured himself much further to me with this novel as he has his characters perform Thomas Carlyle's enduring philosophy.The novel follows the Gradgrind family who is raised adhering to FACTS and living in a society which worships the manufacturing machine. As the novel progresses, connections are made and broken, and the characters come to the realization that there is much more to reality than the material facts.Hard Times is told so compassionately. The reader cares for these people and their tragic lives. The story is also told with biting humor that still cuts at today's society (this novel feels really modern), and the underlying philosophy is one which is so needed in our post-modern world. I would certainly recommend this novel to fans of Dickens and to fans of the truly literary novel."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"\\"Hard Times\\" belongs to the second half of Dickens's writing career, in which his work becomes rather more somber and, by common critical assent, more mature and satisfying. Personally, I prefer his earlier work and his very first novel, \\"Pickwick Papers\\", is to my mind his greatest. Surprisingly, \\"Hard Times\\", despite its title and reputation, contains some brilliant flashes of Dickens humour, especially in the earlier part. The descriptions of Bounderby and Gradgrind, and the early dialogue with the circus folk, are genuinely hilarious.This is Dickens's shortest novel, about a third of the length of each of his previous four. Themes, subplots and characters are introduced without being fully explored. The author was perhaps feeling the constraints of writing in installments for a periodical, although he was well used to doing that. This relative brevity, together with the youth of some of the central characters, make this book a good introduction to Dickens for young readers.There are the large dollops of Victorian melodrama and the reliance on unlikely coincidences that mar much of Dickens's work. Also the usual tendency for characters to become caricatures and to have names that are a little too apt (a teacher called Mr. McChoakumchild?).The respected critic F.R. Leavis considered \\"Hard Times\\" to be Dickens's masterpiece and \\"only serious work of art\\". This seems to me wildly wrong, but such an extreme opinion may prompt you to read the book, just so that you can form your own opinion.I read it because I had just finished \\"The Jungle\\" by Upton Sinclair, which deals with the plight of Chicago factory workers, and I wanted to compare the two. Sinclair's book has greater immediacy. It takes you much closer to the suffering of the workers. In the Dickens novel, the mill workers and their plight are distanced; they are relegated to being the background to a family drama, which is what really interests the author. A third, and still greater work, that examines the same themes, is Zola's \\"Germinal\\". I recommend all three. Together, they give real insight into the social conditions that led to the proletarian political and revolutionary movements of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"Dickens creates a novel that virtually revolutionizes literature of the 1800's. At a time where most writers wrote in a stuffy prose full of unrealities and a jaded outlook, Dickens dares to tell with honesty what he sees through his window.Hard Times has yet a misleading title. It gives one ideas of harshness, depression, poverty, and social decline--although the actual reality of then-London, still not something you would choose to read. However, Hard Times has as much depression and poverty as any of Dickens' other works. It is just in this case that Dickens chooses to remind the world that in the deepest despair there is beauty yet to be seen.Dickens was a strange author. In his supposedly inspiring books, you get an overdose of sadness, and in his depressing books, you find beauty. It is this case with Hard Times.It is a poor, honest man's search for justice in a world where only the rich have merit. It is a girl's search for true love while battling the arranged marriage for money. And lastly, a woman's search for recognition against her favored, yet dishonest brother. It is these searches that at last come together and become fufilled. And, while at the same time telling a captivating story, it comments on the then--and still now--presence of greed and total dishonesty one has to go through for money.The title of this review sums up Hard Times. Its beauty comes from the pure searches for truth, the sorrow comes from the evil the characters most overcome to get there, and the honesty is both the truth with which Dickens portrays life and the the overwhelming truth that these protaganists create.Holly Burke, PhD.Clinical Psychologist, Abnormal Psych. ProfessorGeorgetown University, Johns Hopkins Inst."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"Always concerned with issues of class, social injustice, and employment, Dickens shows in Hard Times, written in 1854, a broader concern with the philosophies and economic movements which underlie those issues. Three parallel story lines reflect a broad cross-section of society and its thinking.Mr. Thomas Gradgrind runs a school founded upon the principles of rationalism, a belief in the importance of facts, the antithesis of romantic \\"fancy\\" and imagination. Basically a good man, he denies the importance of emotion--for himself, his children, and his students. Only Student #20, Sissy Jupe, the daughter of a circus clown, fails to conform to his notions, and in a hilarious, satiric scene at the beginning of the novel, Dickens shows the absurdity of Gradgrind's teachings.Gradgrind's friend, Mr. Bounderby, is a banker and factory owner, aged fifty, who claims to have risen from the gutter to his present lofty position through hard work. Bounderby treats the employees of his Coketown factory as machines, rather than as humans, and his eventual marriage to the teenaged Louisa Gradgrind is seen by both as a marriage of \\"tangible fact,\\" having nothing to do with affection.The third story line involves Stephen Blackpool, a worker in Bounderby's factory, trapped in a marriage to an alcoholic who periodically appears and extorts money from him. Stephen is in love with Rachael, an adoring factory worker, but his appeal to Bounderby for help in ending his marriage is met with cold, rational pronouncements. Shortly after, Bounderby fires Stephen \\"for a novelty,\\" forcing him to seek employment elsewhere.As the story lines overlap and intersect, often with consummate irony, Dickens keeps a light enough hand to prevent the story from becoming a polemic, though his criticism of hypocrisy, corruption, and \\"progress\\" at the expense of humanity is clear. His humor, often dark, keeps the plot moving, and several of his characters, which are often caricatures, do grow and change. Characteristically, Dickens uses names symbolically-Gradgrind grinds the emotions from his graduates, hires Mr. M'Choakumchild as a teacher, and lives at Stone Lodge. Mr. Bounderby proves to be a bounder. Some of the circus performers, like Sissy, live at Pegasus Arms.The dramatic conclusion, which involves the pursuit of an innocent character widely believed to have committed a robbery, draws all the themes together, showing the parallels, contrasts, and ironies which connect these characters, regardless of their social level. Less epic in plot than some of Dickens's other novels, Hard Times provides an intimate look at a changing economy and an important commentary on the philosophies of the times.

Dickens.There's no way that any self-respecting booklover, as I style myself to be, can take a Charles Dicken's novel and tell you that it's &lt;shudder> boring, or even not all that great. Unless the book lover in question happens to be a particularly honest one who doesn't mind the Dicken's squad clicking \\"unhelpful\\" over and over again...Let's proceed.Hard Times begins promisingly, as it slams the education system about as hard as I've ever seen (and almost as hard as it deserves), as teachers Gradgrind and Choakumchild (yeah, I know) try to throttle the imaginations of their charges and fill them instead with sand-dry \\"Facts.\\" But then, Hard Times loses the trail of its narrative, following one of the school kids for a while, then another couple of kids, then another character, then another.... It skips around so often for so long, introducing one character or another (and pausing for social commentary) that it seems as though it might never develop a plot.Near the end, it does take on a plot utilizing all of its developed characters, and the energy of the novel picks up considerably, but less-hearty readers will likely have given up long before then. One of the current \\"Spotlight Reviews\\" for this novel currently states: \\"[The] relative brevity, together with the youth of some of the central characters, make this book a good introduction to Dickens for young readers.\\" No, no, no. A million times no! It's not that the novel is awful--it's decent, despite the dismal pacing of the first three quarters, and some of the comedy is gold (Josiah Bounderby of Coketown is precious!)--but this is *not* a good novel for children, most of whom won't have had enough experience with real-life Bounderbys or perspective on formal education to fully enjoy the satire. This is not the novel to use as an introduction to Dickens for just about anyone, let alone a young reader.Unless, of course, you have sympathy with M. Choakumchild's pedagogical philosophy.In the hands of a child, this novel will likely stifle any appreciation for classic literature, Charles Dickens, and perhaps reading, itself, that might otherwise develop. Start with A Christmas Carol--it has ghosts--and then move on to A Tale of Two Cities--all around better book (and it has decapitations!). Hard Times is for mature, well-read individuals who want to see \\"what else Charles Dickens wrote.\\"A decent novel with some genuinely great moments, but on the whole fairly dry. As with medication, a blessing and a boon to mankind, it's best to keep this out of the reach of young children."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"HARD TIMES has its own special place in world literature, even as it does in Dickens's own oeuvre. Its brevity contrasts with the longer works for which Dickens is more famous, and its satiric skewering of rampant capitalism leaves an imprint on the reader's mind not soon forgotten.Dickens holds up Thomas Gradgrind for us, Sir, a singular member of the industrial community of \\"Coketown,\\" a man who is so obsessed with Facts that he never allows his children to Feel. They are to \\"discard the word Fancy altogether.\\" To ensure this strict materialistic philosophy, the children are taught by a schoolmaster named \\"McChoakumchild.\\" In Gradgrind's friend Josiah Bounderby Dickens gives us possibly the most layered, complete and abhorrent hypocrite in all of English literature. Moliere's Tartuffe is the height of sincerity compared with Bounderby, who seems really to have convinced himself of his own myth after many years of browbeating others with his pompous false modesty. The fact that he is a factory owner who mercilessly exploits his workers only makes him the less endearing. And this is the man Tom Gradgrind gives his daughter to in marriage!The book's narrator clearly distinguishes the good guys from the bad guys, all in an effective effort to show that humans need to appreciate sentiment and sympathy much more than they need to worship dollars and cents. In 1854 HARD TIMES showed the triumphalist British industrialists their dark side. It stands today as a treasured statement against cost-benefit ratios and anti-intellectualism in a world where CEOs \\"earn\\" $10 million bonuses the same week 4,000 workers lose their jobs. It will stand tomorrow anywhere people are scorned for showing their feelings, beaten down in body and spirit, or victimized by rank injustice."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"Dickens' shortest novel is an attack on utilitarianism, the squelching power of schools and factories to eliminate joy from life among the rich and poor alike. (Dickens perhaps prefigures Orwell with his Coketown of horror.) While some of the business about labor unions is unsuccessful, the love/despair story of Louisa Gradgrind is superbly rendered. A very good novel for those unsure of themselves in life!"},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"This novel, like much of Dickens, is hard to pin down in a concise statement as to what exactly it's about. Dickens is often accused, by his critics, of being a sentimentalist and two-dimensional character scrawler. This judgment, I would submit, is quite correct as far as it goes. But the greatness of Dickens, it seems to me, is that each one of his novels conveys a feeling, envisions a world, that is far greater than the sum of its parts. This is especially true of Hard Times.The most common interpretation of the book is that it is anti-utilitarian. This take on the novel is quite true, to an extent, but to say that this stance constitutes all that the book concerns is, in itself, a utilitarian interpretation! It reduces the book to a fictionalised polemic. And the book is surely far more than that!There are always, in Dickens's works, depths opening up amidst the simple plots and the simplified (and whimsically named) characters that bring one to a stop. When Louisa finds out from her brother Tom that Bounderby (the most deliciously named character herein) is set to propose marriage to her, the chapter ends thusly:\\"Old Time, that greatest and longest-established Spinner of all, would weave from the threads he has spun into a woman. But his factory is a secret place, his work is noiseless, and his Hands are mutes.\\"This passage alone should serve notice that something deeper is going in the world of Coketown. I truly don't think I can proffer to the prospective reader a glimpse of the depths that lie beneath the simplified characters and simplistic narrative structure than by quoting the last words of Stephen Blackpool, addressed to his Muse-like Rachael, as he lies dying, after having been raised from the disused mine opening known locally as Old Hell Shaft:\\"I ha' fell into th' pit, my dear, as have cost wi'in the knowledge o' old folk now livin, hundreds and hundreds o' men's lives - fathers, sons, brothers, dear to thousands an' hundreds...When it were in work, it killed wi'out need: when \`tis let alone, it kills wi'out need. See how we die an' no need, one way an' another - in a muddle - every day!\\"Coketown, perhaps, resembles our own world a bit too much for our own comfort and self-satisfaction. Look at the tag on the shirt you are now wearing. It was most likely made in a Southeast Asian sweatshop by a human being, with hopes and dreams much like your own. More importantly, for the significance of this book, gaze out into the world around you where people die, \\"thousands an' hundreds\\" every day, for no particular reason other than that they fell in a sort of shaft or hole: financial, medical, physical.Why is Coketown, why is the world as it is, with no apparent rhyme or reason? Why is it, in short, a muddle? That is the deeper question which Hard Times leaves us mulling: Why must they always exist?"},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"Dickens was a great rhetorician, but not a very deep social thinker. _Hard Times_ is the novel in which he tries to tell us that there are a Whole lot O' Things Wrong with Britain in the nineteenth century.

When Dickens is taking on each of these subjects individually in his other works, he's wonderful; when he sews up his complaints against them into one big bundle and convinces himself that it's a Social Theory, he's a tiresomely shrill satirist and all of his characters turn as flat as paper before one's very eyes.This doesn't, of course, mean that the book isn't worth reading - after all, it's Dickens. There are some very sweet and descriptively rich passages about a traveling circus and although one finds it difficult to give a hoot about any of the characters aside from Mr. Gradgrind (who might have been developed much more richly if Dickens had cut down on the windy deploring a little and worked harder to make him seem like less of a cipher) the plot thunders along at the usual absorbingly breathless pace. But if you haven't read _David Copperfield_ or _A Tale of Two Cities_ yet, then for God's sake don't start out with this relatively second-rate effort."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Structural Readers)","review":"In this novel set in industrial revolution era Great Britain, Dickens is about as subtle as a sledgehammer. Unlike some of his other social commentary, where he wraps his point in a gripping, twisting, and entertaining plot, Dickens goes right for the jugular in &quot;Hard Times&quot;.In this novel he lashes out against the dehumanization of our children through &quot;education&quot;, as well as the still very real gulf between the well to do and impoverished. Even the names of his characters are none-too-subtle jabs. The local teacher, Professor Gradgrind, seeks not to educate or enlighten, but to hammer home facts and turn his children into automatons. His counterpart in the business arena is Bounderby, a blustering, egomaniacal, and ultimately vacuous man. Their countermeasure is a young orphan girl named Sissy Jupe. She is a lovable character that embodies compassion and humanity, but is very nearly broken by the their overbearing influence.This is not a &quot;fun&quot; book to read, and if you're looking to be entertained in traditional Dickens fashion I strongly reccomend looking elsewhere (i.e. David Copperfield). The novel is relatively straightforward and simple of plot, and his scathing social commentary cannot be missed. The most compelling reason to read &quot;Hard Times&quot; though is the fact that the same mentality criticized here is still very much in existence today, and this makes the novel just as relevant for the 21st century as it was when first penned."},{"Title":"Luther and the Old Testament","review":"This book was written at the height of the pre-WW2 Nazi attempt to take over the Christian churches of Germany. At the time, the Nazis tried to 'do away with' as much of the Jewish origin of Christianity as possible, especially with the Old Testament (there were actual attempts to remove the Old Testament from Biblical cannon, and down played Martin Luther's reliance of the Tanak scriptures). German Lutheran professor Bronkamm then wrote extensively of Luther's absolute reliance on a Christ-centered understanding of the Old Testament, that the Old Testament cannot be done away with and still understand Luther, or follow the Christian church. This book was refused publication until after the war was over, on which time it became a basic textbook of many a Lutheran seminary.

Cleopatra is the well-known romantic-tragic figure who was the last of the Ptolemy dynasty that ruled Egypt from the 300s till their defeat by Rome.This first volume tells a very detailed, apparently well-researched story of the Ptolemy Greek dynasty of Egypt, beginning in the campaigns of Ptolemy with Alexander the Great. It carries through to the second generation of the Ptolemy family and the end of the \\"Successors,\\" the generals who parceled out the empire of Alexander, then fought each other for more.This story is a novel, but appears to be well-researched and utilizes vivid personal and environmental detail to bring to us an ancient, very different period of life and culture. The story is told by Thoth, the Egyptian ibis god of knowledge and writing.But much of the story is necessarily from the perspective of Ptolemy, who became Ptolemy Soter (Deliverer, Saviour), the founder of the Egyptian Greek dynasty. He was declared a god in his own lifetime by the Greek oracle of Zeus in Libya, as well as agreeing late in his kingship to become the King of the Egyptians, which meant he was deified as the representative of Ra, the Sun God.But in a Mitchneresque pattern, the author explains and fills in much background and helps the reader make connections. He provides an extensive family tree, lists of the lineages, a glossary explaining the names of the gods and other terms, and a long cast of characters. He does a very good job keeping identities clear in such a saga involving cultures and dynasties that used a variety of names.Sprott provides good cultural insights, and deals with the ethnic attitudes of the various cultures and classes. I have been watching for the followup volumes in the series."},{"Title":"House of the Eagle: Book One of The Ptolemies Quartet","review":"I am so glad there are historical novels written of such quality as this one is!

What are we to call the God of Jews and Christians? This collection of essays does an excellent job in providing thoughtful, argumentative, and logical arguments in favor of traditional \\"God Talk\\". Even though it is not in favor of saying, \\"Glory to the Parent, Child and Spirit\\", it does not dismiss those who believe such in a flippant or disrespectful manner. Taking their cue from the modern controversy in literature and lecture, the contributors of this volume leave the reader with much to think about. I would also guess that most readers, regardless of their position on the matter, will be forced to rethink their own ideas of God by reexamining their own assumptions or prejudices.Here are a few quotes:\\"Thus our knowing of God rests not on a center in ourselves but on a center in God, not on the ground of our own being, but on the ground of God's being. Our ability to know him is grounded not in some capacity of our own but in the activity of God in opening himself to our knowing and actually making himself known to us through his Word.\\"&quot;By contemplating, participating in, and imitating the saving activity of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in the oikonomia of creation, salvation, and deification, human persons can discover what it means for them to be men and women, fathers and mothers, husbands and wives, brothers and sisters in the image and likeness of God the Father revealed through Christ the Son in the Holy Spirit, who makes creation to be God's bride, the wife of the Lamb, and whose presence in the church is already the anticipatory pledge . . . of the &quot;Jerusalem above&quot; which is &quot;free&quot; and is &quot;our mother&quot; (Gal. 4:26).&quot;&quot;Just as God is the first teacher of Trinitarian truth, so also is it God who provides the first lesson in Trinitarian grammar: &quot;When we cry 'Abba! Father!' it is the Spirit himself bearing witness with our spirit that we are children of God&quot; (Rom. 8:15-16). . . . The speakability of the otherwise unspeakable mystery of the triune God presupposes the gift of God's very self and depends on resources that come with that gift.&quot;This is THE book to start with when coming to the question of naming God."},{"Title":"Freebirds","review":"Finally somebody has written a book about Skynyrd. This was a story waiting to be told. There's a lot of details and the interviews with the band members and others give you a lot of food for thought. There's a lot of trash talk, but that's the people being interviewed, not the author of the book. Pretty controversial stuff. Interesting story."},{"Title":"Freebirds","review":"Lynyrd Skynyrd is a band I remember from my childhood as being always on the radio or playing big shows to which I, at age 11-12-13, was too young to go. I do remember the big plane crash, which happened right around my 14th birthday, and was sad about it but the band kind of dropped off my radar screen after that (particularly because I did not grow up in the South) and with the onslaught of new wave, punk etc. I didn't think about them for many years. As an adult I found myself thinking, \\"Hey, y'know those Skynyrd songs were actually pretty dern good\\" and when this book came out, I was curious to learn a bit more about the band I remembered but never really knew.I don't doubt that there are some factual and/or personal inaccuracies in the book, because of the sheer number of band members, relatives and other personal observers involved and because the level of details in these types of books is a fact-checker's nightmare. It's also clear that some of the band members did not/ do not get along, and while the author does appear to have tried to provide a balanced picture, I know there will always be fans close to the group or people who know the musicians involved who will take issue with the portrayal. (I know this because I have a few bands who I was close to and I have gotten wound up myself on a number of occasions about how journalists or more casual listeners interpreted those band's work, personalities, interband relationships, etc.) However, being a casual Skynyrd fan, these are not the types of errors that would affect my enjoyment of this book. It was easy to read, featured a lot of quotes from band members and other involved parties (which make a book much more readable than an editor telling you so-and-so did this, and then the band did that) and also had a user-friendly format with lots of awesome pictures.Since this book came out, there have been at least two other books released on Skynyrd and one of them was written by someone intimately involved with the band on the road. I haven't read those yet so can't say how this book stands up to them for accuracy and quality of information, but from the standpoint of \\"My First Book About Lynyrd Skynyrd\\" I wasn't disappointed with this book and enjoyed reading it. I would be interested in checking out some of the other books as this one was fairly short - not a fat book, and a lot of the space is taken up by those awesome pictures - and, given that this band had many members and the author may not have had equal access to all, there were details, particularly personal ones (such as the information others have noted about Ronnie Van Zant's upbringing and relationships) that weren't fully covered."},{"Title":"Freebirds","review":"First, I'd like to mention the author, Marley Brant, she is from Atlanta, and she also wrote the book \\"Southern Rockers The Roots and Legacy of Southern Rock\\". This is a very comprehensive book, that covers Skynyrd, from their humble beginning, to the pre-plane crash \\"glory\\" days, all the way up through the late 1990's, including the Johnny Van Zant, Rickey Medlocke, and Hughie Thomasson version of Skynyrd. Rickey was also in the band, way back in the early days, but he left to form the Southern Rock Band, Blackfoot, also, form Jacksonvile, Florida. He was not on their first commerically released album \\"Pronounced\\", but Rickey has been on every album from the late 1990's through their most recent release, \\"God + Guns\\". Marley covers all the members of Skynyrd, including Billy Powell, Leon Wilkeson, Arimus Pyle and all the others from the very early beginning, up through the late 1990's. She does not get into the \\"old band\\", versus \\"new band\\" controvery. She is a true Southern Rock fan, jounalist, and record producer. She loves all versions of Skynyrd. This is a great book, and essential reading for any true Skynyrd fan. Thanks!!!"},{"Title":"Freebirds","review":"From the three LS-related books I've got (Gene Odom's, Lee Ballinger's and Marley Brant's) this is the weak one. Though it tells the story of the band there are some obvious mistakes:1. It says The Honkettes came on board for 1975's Nuthin' Fancy. False. They didn't join the band until a year later.2. It quotes Jimmy Reed's Bright Lights, Big City as being featured on the same album. ?3. Allen Collins' last car crash happened in 1984. Everybody familiar with the group knows it was in 1986.How can you trust this book if the person who has written it can't even spell the pilot's name correctly? (It quotes his second name as McClary when it's actually McCreary.It's also disappointing how the band's history is mixed with quotes from current members of the group. The book should tell the original group's history and not the numerous post-crash lineups, that haven't done anything but cashing on what the Ronnie-led band did. Both Ed King and Artimus Pyle would admit this. Matter of fact, it's kinda sad how many fallouts these two guys and the post-crash band members have had. For some reason I tend to be on their side and not on Gary's.One of the most outrageous (and fictitious) facts told in the book is that one night the band was performing while raining and 'casually' the sun came up to Sweet Home Alabama's chords, only to give way to rain again when the song was over. Yeah, right!!!! Seems the author is so fiercely devoted to the band that let her imagination do the job this time.But not all is lame or fantasy - the pics included are nice although once again I don't see the point of having some from Rickey Medlocke or the out-of-tune Johnny Van Zant, one of the biggest masters of grave robbery in the world.In a nutshell, buy the two books first quoted above instead. This is for diehards only.3/5."},{"Title":"Freebirds","review":"This is the only book I've ever taken back to the store because the writing wasn't good enough to be read -- no exaggeration, this reads like a sixth-grader wrote it; it's awful.

They most certainly deserve more than this crummy book offers."},{"Title":"Freebirds","review":"This book is an interesting conglomeration of the \\"In their own words\\" vein, soapbox mud slinging and cut-and-paste rock journalism. Brant obviously fawns over the members by the selection of her quotes so she isn't exactly an impartial observer. There is too much padding and back slapping when the members of the pre and post 1977 lineups are discussing the merits of one persons musical ability over another. (King seems to have the most critical musical eye though) The book would have been one third shorter without this. We don't really get any insight into Ronnie Van Zant as well, all we find out is that he and his father didn't always get along. The trials of Allen Collin's life are examined a bit better but Brant could have asked some incisive questions. Why did Dale Krantz drive a wedge between Gary and Allen? Furthermore, some of King's, Pyle's and Hall's comments do leave you wondering why the post-77 lineup has not treated their own very well. (I was shocked to learn that Powell's VH-1 BTM quote about Cassie Gaines demise was a total fabrication) Is there any merit to the claims of continuing drug and alcohol abuse? Brant shrugs it off as if the boys are blowing off some steam. Besides Judy Van Zant Jeness, Brant should have interviewed Lacy Van Zant and Allen Collins' mom to get an insight into the people involved. This book is akin to a blurred photograph, we never really get the full picture of the band and the demons that haunted them and still do.

The band never had a member that wasn't as loyal and trustworthy as they come, they never forgot where they came from, they took good care of all their friends and familiy, and never let the fame, money, women, and all that get to their heads and interfere with their ultimate goals...Even if you don't care for their music, this is a story of blood, sweat, and tears, and how hard work and efficiency pays off in the end.... because you only fail when you give up!!!With only FOUR YEARS of professional recording under their belts, the material they produced is simply astounding... they truly are the perfect example of how a band should be put together and orchestrated in all aspects, reguardless of what kind of music you play...R.I.P. to Ronnie VanZant, Steve Gaines, Allen Collins, Leon Wilkenson, and the rest of the freebirds that are STILL TO THIS DAY helping people through their problems and touching their hearts!!!!!"},{"Title":"Freebirds","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I do not read music books very often as they are usually written by &quot;someone in the know&quot; who just wants to tell their own side. This book is written objectively.

Marley has done the research required to account and portray the historical facts to a certain degree, but the good work is often tainted by her obvious influence from disgruntled ex-band members and embittered rivals of the band who have done nothing more than attempt to disrespect and ridicule the surviving band members with their childish insults and accusations. Had this book been written with a professional and objective perspective, I think it would have been a respectable biography, albeit disjointed and anemic. As it stands, I think it is a mediocre but good effort, only marred by the fact that some used this as a relentless and pathetic soapbox in order to air their own bitter opinions as to their being 'wronged' by Gary Rossington and the band. They should be embarrassed when they read their rampant insults and complaints, knowing in their hearts that the music and the legacy of Lynyrd Skynyrd cannot and never will be affected by their slanderous remarks. Those of us who know the Skynyrd band know better...if you can't run with the big dogs, y'all stay on the front porch."},{"Title":"Freebirds","review":"This book may please casual fans or beginners to the Southern Rock genre.

Feels like a lot of gossip and hearsay. Definitely not satisfying. One star is for doing a book on Southern Rock."},{"Title":"Freebirds","review":"Hardcore Lynyrd Skynyrd fans will be overall disappointed in this book as it is not the hard-charging, tell-all, behind the scenes book that it is talked up to be. One of the biggest problems appears to be the fact that no one in the band, other than Artimus Pyle, was willing to open up and tell it like it is. The author herself seems to be so starry eyed over inteviewing the band members that at times the book comes off as fawning. Casual fans will find the material interesting but the hardcore fan has seen this material before. A much better story was published in MOJO magazine several years ago entitled THE SOUTHERN DEATH CULT. The true Lynyrd Skynyrd story has yet to be written."},{"Title":"Freebirds","review":"I agree with John Haury's review. This could have been a good book, but is written so poorly that it's painful to read. And the obvious bickering amongest the band members has only dampened my enthusiasm for this great band. Only my fanaticism kept me going thru the book....and my belief in what Ronnie Van Zant was trying to do with his music. Despite it's short-comings, this book compliments Lee Ballinger's book well. They contain some of the same info but are somehow different. Brant should have kept his opinions to himself. What a misuse of a great opportunity. If your a LS fanatic, read it. If your a RnR fanatic, read it. If your just looking for a good read, move on."},{"Title":"Freebirds","review":"I have been a Lynyrd Skynyrd fan for 25 years, and I waited a long time for a biography of the band. I don't think that this book qualifies as a biography. Ronnie VanZant was the heart of Skynyrd. Yet, the author tells us next to nothing about his childhood, first marriage, his relationship with his wives, family or anyone outside of the band. As a matter of fact, we don't really know that much about his relationships with band members either, unless of course holding a gun to the drummer's head when he doesn't want to rehearse a particular tune qualifies as the nature of a relationship. Maybe the author isn't interested how this squares with the man who wrote &quot;Simple Man&quot;. I, however, expect a biographer to tackle such interesting contradictions.If VanZant's personal life got virtually no attention, the band members got none. For instance, having read the book I now know that Allen Collins was 1. the greatest guitar player in the world, 2. that his wife died in childbirth, 3. that he became a hard core alcoholic afterwards, 4. that while driving drunk he had a solo accident in which his girlfriend died and he became paralyzed, 5. he died. Doesn't a biographer have a duty to scratch beneath the surface? Isn't there a responsibility to put bare facts into perspective, to analyze them and omit blatant stupidty? At one point the author quotes someone as saying that Dale Krantz (the lead singer of the Rossington Collins Band) could sing as well as Aretha Franklin.Born to Run, Dave Marsh's 1970's biography of Bruce Springsteen, shows the problems of this book. Clearly Marsh was enamored of Springsteen, but we got loads of insight into Bruce's childhood, relationship with his father, pivotal influences, demons, etc. After reading such a book, one has some insight into the man. After reading this book, I now know that Ronnie VanZant liked to beat the hell out of anyone who crossed him - or sometimes just liked to beat the hell out of someone just for, well, the hell of it.

CREEM and Rolling Stone kept watch. Cameron Crowe offered his tip-of-the-hat to them in \\"Almost Famous.\\" But the real story? The real people? Finally, it's here. And it's every bit as compelling as Skynyrd's timeless compositions.FREEBIRDS is a fascinating book about the roots and evolution of Lynyrd Skynyrd from its beginning through present day. It was never as simple as blue collar rough neighborhoods and kids with a dream. The book reveals a highly kinetic mix of intelligent, complicated individuals and their talents, friendships, differences and colliding fates. Not to say there wasn't the private or very public fight here or there... The actual events are discussed by the people who were there. Brant maintains an even hand in presenting different sides of the same story. Contradicting recollections of events (whether through past \\"impairments\\" or 20-20 hindsight) are examined and placed before the reader for consideration.The information in the book far exceeds anything published before (or that probably ever will be) by virtue of the sheer depth and number of events discovered, disclosed, investigated, tales told and recollections shared. It is evident Author/Biographer Brant had the professional credibility and respect to write FREEBIRDS. It was a book that needed to be written and the author has given the reader both solid fact-finding and spellbinding story telling blended together artfully in top notch writing.FREEBIRDS \\"reads\\" very well -- it's comfortable and engaging, evenly paced and balanced in it's approach. I was very drawn in by it.

As you would expect with the money and ego involved, the many characters involved with Skynyrd over the last 25 years have a different perspective on events. They are not hesitant to give their versions. The author has not taken sides, nor tried to interpret, the sometimes destructive relationships that were defined by casual sex, drug addiction, alcoholism, and money. Instead she lets the band tell the story. The reader is left to his own conclusions. In my opinion, these are talented, but not very nice people. This is a fan's book, and there is much to enjoy about the band's story. The author has obviously talked to many people, and the story is very interesting. The message I get from the book is that Rock and Roll, for all it's glamour, is a tough business, for tough people. Skynyrd has suceeded while most have failed. These guys have a lot to offer.

Ronnie confided to Crowe he was fed-up with a certain member of the band and wanted to fire him, but couldn't bring himself to do it because of loyalty. That got me really interested in reading something about Lynryrd Skynyrd! I've always enjoyed a good Skynyrd tune, but knew next to nothing about the the band members. This is a great book with lots of first hand accounts and interviews. I have nothing to compare it to, as this is the first book I've read on Skynyrd. I do know it kept me interested from beginning to end, and I'm not even what you'd call a &quot;hardcore&quot; fan. It's just a well-written and interesting book, very insiteful look at this band."},{"Title":"Freebirds","review":"I liked this book. The stories are very entertaining and I learned a great deal about the Band from the very early days until now. It's quite a story and much deeper than I had known. For that alone, I appreciated the book. While everything obviously hasn't been rosy and there are disagreements today, I felt the book was fair. I enjoyed the pace of the book and would recommend it as a &quot;must read&quot; for any Skynyrd fan."},{"Title":"Freebirds","review":"I waited a long time for a book about Skynyrd and this one is good. Tells me a lot about what I wanted to know behind the scenes and the quotes from past and present band members are really interesting. Don't know why there are a couple of one star reviews here. Especially ones that don't really criticize the book but criticize the things being said by the people being interviewed. Hearing how people really feel make the book that much more interesting and these guys don't hold anything back. Can't believe these one-starrers say the book is boring or badly written. Stories like Ronnie Van Zant putting a gun to the head of the drummer during rehearsal and Artimus Pyle turning Linda Blair's head around are funny as hell. The one about Pyle saving Paul McCartney's life is priceless. Makes me think the one-starrers had another agenda or maybe didn't read the book (or at least the same one I did!) This book tells you what you want to know about Skynyrd right up to 2002, and tells it mostly through the people who lived it. The author provides a lot of background material too. It's a good book."},{"Title":"Freebirds","review":"This was my first read about Skynyrd, and I think I picked the most information-packed and readable one out there at present. You can tell that the author went great effort to provide an objective and detailed account of Skynyrd, from Ronnie's childhood (as well as Allen's and Gary's) to the nearly present day incarnation of the band. Being an ol' southern boy myself, It was very easy for me to connect with the stories of the band when Ronnie was at the helm. I learned details about the accident, as well as differences in accounts of the crash between Billy and Artemus. The meeting with Gary and Allen with Ronnie's and Steve's widows after the crash was a little shocking. And, of course, the '87 tribute tour and beyond. I had no idea that there was such bad blood between some of the surviving band members. I also learned about the multitude of replacement members that have come and gone, and some of the circumstances surrounding their departure. Nonetheless, the author tries to tell the reader the stories from all angles as best as possible. After reading this book, I've kinda come to the conclusion that Lynyrd Skynyrd being around and touring present day (and doing damn well I might add), is a miracle. And the fans come out the winners. This will not be my last or only read on Skynyrd by any means, but I definitely recommend this book as a start point."},{"Title":"Freebirds","review":"This is a very interesting look at a very complex band. The book is written in a way that makes you feel connected to Lynyrd Skynyrd in a new way. Much of the story is told using the band member's own words whether those words are brutally honest, controversial or revisionist. Ballinger's book is a good quote book but this book gives more history. I really recommend this book for Skynyrd fans and rock and roll lovers in general. Great band, great read."},{"Title":"Freebirds","review":"This is a greatly indept book that was highly researched. Although some events in the book may sound questionable, Marley Brant clearly states that he took all sides of the stories and put them in there. This book is so direct that it actualy stired up some bad blood with the band today. The book tells the story of the band from its days as One Percent to the rebirth of the band after the plane crash. Along with being a great read it is also accompied with alot of rare photos. CLEARLY A MUST HAVE FOR ANY SKYNYRD FAN!"},{"Title":"Freebirds","review":"LYNYRD SKYNYRD is an enjoyable, well written book. It tracks the band from its scrappy beginnings to international recognition, honky tonks to stadiums.I liked quite a few things about this book. Author Brant conducted many personal interviews and the resulting first person accounts made for very interesting, often amusing and occasionally poignant reading. There were also wonderful photographs, many I had never seen and I am a longtime fan. The story was told chronologically and that made for easy reading, as the book has quite a cast of characters.I would recommend this book to a friend without hesitation."},{"Title":"The Elusive Embryo: How Men and Women Approach New Reproductive Technologies","review":"This book is great at laying out and discussing a variety of issues related to infertility, the complex technologies used to treat it, and the emotions that arise from these things. However, I was continually frustrated while reading this book because I felt that the author did not analyze very well the things she said. She would point out interesting comments made by couples seeking fertility treatment, but then give the same anaytical comments over and over again about the different couples' feelings. Also, I felt she was too biased and critical in her assessment of fertility treatment. It seemed like every couple (indeed, virtually everyone in the book was a married couple, very little representation from anyone else) felt the same way, ultimately -- disillusioned, doubtful about themselves, cynical about the process, and overall disappointed, even angry and bitter. This has not been my own personal experience, and I have a hard time believing that everyone in her large study sample was so dismal. It just wasn't a sophisticated, layered analysis. But it will probably be interesting to non-academics who would like to get a foundation for some of the negatives associated with infertility treatments, and with having problems with infertility."},{"Title":"CliffsStudySolver Algebra I (Pt. I)","review":"This is one of the best math books on Algebra I I've seen so far. This is an excellent guide for both A students wanting to brush up their math and students who are having a lot of trouble with math. This book will help students establish a strong foundation in math, and it helped me do so.The explanations in this book are clear, unlike the ones you see in all the other textbooks. It isn't just all examples, there is a lot of textual explanations. I've tried going through various textbooks and study guides, but this one seems to be one of the most helpful.One complaint I have about this book is that it is not actually thorough enough. There are not a lot of problems for you to work on. This isn't a workbook at all, but a study guide designed to explain math concepts and computational methods. The stuff covered in this book only goes from beginning to intermediate, and doesn't have any advanced stuff. When independently studying math on my own, I usually use the school textbooks if I want to get more work problems, challenge, and enrichment topics.Like any other book, this book is only a tool. You can't give a good book to a student with poor study skills and expect him to succeed. A good student with a good book brings good results. So if you are teacher who wants to give this to a failing student, the student would probably first need to be motivated and get better study habits before he succeeds with the book. In other words, what I'm saying is that this book isn't magic.This book has done a really great job helping me ace math tests, but I really think it shouldn't be your only math study guide. Great deal!"},{"Title":"CliffsStudySolver Algebra I (Pt. I)","review":"I purchased this book as a review book for one of my students (who happens to be in Calculus, interestingly enough). The pre-test is a great diagnostic tool, and the book does cover all the topics in Algebra I that I would expect it to. Highly recommended as a review/practice/study book."},{"Title":"CliffsStudySolver Algebra I (Pt.

The same series worked for the K-8 MTEL for science also."},{"Title":"CliffsStudySolver Algebra I (Pt. I)","review":"I bought this book and the Algebra II version to review for a math placement test (I'm going back to school, hooray!), as well as CliffsQuickReview for Geometry. The study solver series is so wonderful because each problem is worked out CLEARLY with explanations along the way. The study solver books were key for me in reviewing 5 years of high school math in about one month.The only downfall in both the Algebra I and Algebra II books was that there were a few errors. The good side of that though--I knew without a doubt they were typos in exponents or signs simply because the books explained how to work problems (and why they're worked certain ways) so clearly."},{"Title":"CliffsStudySolver Algebra I (Pt.

If every book of Cliff's is like this one, I am Buying them!!!"},{"Title":"CliffsStudySolver Algebra I (Pt. I)","review":"This is the worst Algebra book that I have ever come across. I love Algebra and I bought this book just for brushing up and enjoyment purposes. There does not seem to be any rhyme or reason as to the order of the book and the instructions are very confusing.Don't waste your money on this book a much better book is Maran's Illustrated Effortless Algebra. It is a basic Algebra book that is excellent. Its directions are easy to follow and the illustrations are excellent. College Algebra Demystified is also a good book with lots of practice problems, but the explanations are best in Maran's."},{"Title":"CliffsStudySolver Algebra I (Pt. I)","review":"In several weeks time, I've been going back and forth with Cliffs notes and Schaum's outline of algebra. Thus far, I'm happier with Schaum's than Cliffs. Cliff's is incredibly vague (as is Schaum's, but less often) and so much so that it hampers the scholar from fully grasping the concepts. A major, albeit reoccurring issue I encounter with math guides is that they are way too vague, or they're missing some steps, which happen to be critical in the comprehension of the topic. I can assure you that if you purchase Cliffs notes that you will be overwhelmingly frustrated and irate. Take my word despite other reviews."},{"Title":"CliffsStudySolver Algebra I (Pt.

Unfortunately, the unthinkable happened and both Charlotte and her baby died during childbirth, leaving the kingdom in a quandary. For though King George III had many children, they were all well into middle age and none had any legitimate children to secure the continuation of the Hanoverian dynasty.This turn of events galvanized the unmarried sons of King George III to marry suitable wives, so as to have legitimate children and secure the line of succession for the House of Hanover. William, the third son and Duke of Clarence, as well as Edward, the fourth son and Duke of Kent, did so. William married Adelaide of Saxe-Coburg Meiningen, while Edward married Victoria Mary Louisa of Saxe-Saalfeld-Coburg.

All of the available German princesses were rounded up and distributed to the marriageable princes of England. After that, it became a race to who would get the crown.This book was very interesting and entertaining. I especially liked to hear more about George III's other children. It is very hard to find such information elsewhere. Jean Plaidy did an excellent job recreating the atmosphere and the urgency of the time."},{"Title":"Victoria in the Wings","review":"The last book in the Georgian Saga by Jean Plaidy this is worth the wait to read, if you were reading in chronological order like I am.Princess Charlotte is now dead and the remaining sons of George III must race to find wives and begin bearing children. It's an intense race for the heir to the throne of England, to keep the throne in the hands of the House of Hanover. And what an exciting race this was.There's William, Duke of Clarence, bumbling and bluff as a sailor married to Adelaide, a woman meek and mild, but not very pretty. There's Edwards, Duke of Kent, set to marry Victoria, haughty and proud; but dying earlier than anyone imagined and leaving the way open directly for his daughter, Victoria to come to the throne. Then there's Ernest, Duke of Cumberland, and the villian of the piece, married to a woman with as sinister a past as his own. He wants to rule England, as well as Hanover, and doesn't have a problem with removing the young Victoria to accomplish this goal either.The whole tale is very exciting and I hated having to stop at any point to do anything. Life totally interrupted my reading time with this book.This is not one to put down if you don't have to. I'm so glad this saga went out on a high note. Plaidy does a masterful job pulling you into the excitement to see who would produce the heir and who would get the spares."},{"Title":"The Sky at Einstein's Feet (Springer Praxis Books / Popular Astronomy)","review":"A grand book illuminating our understanding of the cosmos, and the amazing techniques used in an array of astronomical observations. Over 100 topics are addressed in a concise and clear style that managed to hold my attention and not leave me hanging, even for the more difficult subjects. Many images are incorporated to help in his subject presentation, and some are used to help build on the wonderful historical perspective inherent in astronomy.Keel also adds warmth to his book by often giving short and personal stories of some specific men and women dedicated to astronomy and physics, as well as, on occasion, share some of his own personal and interesting experiences. As an amateur, I was not overwhelmed with any complicated presentations thanks to his careful explanations of even the tough, thought provoking topics. I definitely recommend this book to any who are hungry to go a little deeper in getting to know how astronomers have been able to ascertain so many new truths about our universe that once stood before Einstein, and now stands before you and me"},{"Title":"The Sky at Einstein's Feet (Springer Praxis Books / Popular Astronomy)","review":"The best aspect of this book is how it explains to an educated reader, who is not an astronomer or physicist, the latest results that confirm Einstein's theories. It is still not a light breezy read. While non-mathematical, you do still need to pay attention to the various concepts as Keel explains them.Some of the observations are very elegant, like gravitational microlensing. And the analysis of the vast data accumulated from IRAS, Hubble and Chandra. What is impressive is how lensing is now no longer used as a test of General Relativity, but as an extremely powerful \\"telescope\\" in its own right."},{"Title":"Dark Reckoning","review":"This product was shipped in a timely manner, and was exactly the conditionthat was promised.

These two facts show that you are interested in this book. This is a vital necessity, because the 'Kojien' isn't just a book you buy on the fly. It is a book to work with, but also a book that affords you to work on.'Kojien' means 'wide garden of words'. Under this title, the reader has a single-volume Japanese-Japanese dictionary in his hands, with all entry headings being set in hiragana - a feature, which enables even a student of Japanese with just basic knowledge of the language to access all items. In the main entries, the reader will encounter standard Japanese explanations though, which affords both a basic understanding of kanji and acquaintance with tools to lookup unknown ones. This makes the 'Kojien' a tool for the intermediate or progressing learner of Japanese as well as people well-acquainted with the language striving for expanding their knowledge.The 'Kojien' doesn't make use of too much of encyclopedistic cosmetics: Abstaining from fanciful multicolor charts it offers its concise information in a compact manner, with few small graphics in the text implying a sharp space cost to information value consideration. Now the fifth edition has been published, updating the information to a state-of-art level. It is a tool of work, and it doesn't pretend to be otherwise. It affords the reader and/or learner of Japanese to use other tools, to look up kanji, thus broadening his horizon even more. It definitely doesn't belong into a starter kit for Japanese, but those who are sure to stick to this language will find it very useful."},{"Title":"Kojien","review":"The Kojien is a very good dictionary and is usually considered THE definitive source about the Japanese language by the Japanese people themselves.

His adventures with the other competing knight, being a paid mercenary for several kings, his love interests, etc. All of these interesting stories were woven into a nice fictional novel.The outcome of this book is astonishing.

If there is a weakness in \\"Heretic\\", it is the absence of historical events to lend even more credibility to Cornwell's authoritative depiction of the culture, religion, politics and especially the warfare of the period. Where \\"The Archer's Tale\\" and \\"Vagabond\\" were based upon the famous battles the kicked off what was later known The Hundred Year's War, \\"Heretic\\" is mostly pure fiction, wrapping up Thomas' quests, both spiritual and personal.In this final episode, the title refers to Genevieve, an innocent and beautiful young girl sentenced to be burned at the stake for heresy. If there is a central theme in the series, it is the virtually absolute power of the Church, and the influence the Church wielded over the masses, from the most powerful kings and barons to the lowliest of peasants. If Cornwell's treatment of the religious hierarchy is a bit heavy-handed, it is difficult to argue the well-recorded abuses of an institution that twisted the word of God to attain rewards that were anything but spiritual. From the barbarous tortures of the Inquisition delivered by the hands of pious priests to fraudulent relics and \\"absolution for sale\\", Cornwell skewers the corruption heaped upon an uneducated and superstitious populace - practices which would lay the foundation for the Reformation in the centuries to follow.But setting religion aside, \\"Heretic\\" is at its core simply a terrific story of love, adventure, and war in a fascinating period of western civilization. As expected from Cornwell, battle scenes are as vivid and deep as the rivers of blood he cascades through battlefields of broken men and horses. Cornwell's primer on the impact and influence that the virtually impregnable English archer held in Medieval warfare was riveting - one wonders what course western history would have taken were it not for these humble bowmen who would strike terror in opponents far greater numbers, launching stream upon stream of goose-feathered ash missiles capable of penetrating the thickest shield and heaviest plate armor.In short, a gripping tale of love, betrayal, trusts forged and trusts broken, and ultimately redemption compensate for what \\"Heretic\\" may be lacking in historical underpinnings. This and the two titles that proceed it are simultaneously the most educational and entertaining works of historical fiction I've ever read - I couldn't give Cornwell and the Grail series a higher recommendation."},{"Title":"Heretic (The Grail Quest, Book 3)","review":"Unlike the some of the other reviewers this was my first Bernard Cornwell book and won't be my last!! However I wasn't aware, when I read it, that it was the last in a trilogy so it might be preferable to read the other two first.I found myself getting gradually absorbed into the story, feeling compelled to follow the main characters through their quest for the Grail, honour and acceptance.The battle scenes were very descriptive as was general life in mid fourteenth century France, all making this an excellent and persuasive read."},{"Title":"Heretic (The Grail Quest, Book 3)","review":"Bernard Cornwell continues to roll out reliably good historical fiction. I originally became a Cornwell fan through the great Sharpe series. Heretic is the third in the Grail Quest series, but can be read and enjoyed as a stand alone. Thomas of Hookton seeks the Holy Grail in 14th century Gascony and it's a bloody nasty business. Along the way he again encounters the evil black knight Guy de Vexille. And there's a castle to be seized and a beautiful young woman to save from being burned at the stake - not to mention avoiding the plague, the Inquisition, and leprosy!Highly recommended for all Cornwell fans, or any reader with an interest in historical fiction, especially concerning the Middle Ages or the Holy Grail."},{"Title":"Heretic (The Grail Quest, Book 3)","review":"The Grail Series (Archer's Tale, Vagabond and Heretic) were great fun to read.Maybe comparisons to the Sharpe Series is unfair - in my opinion they and O'Brien's Aubrey/Maturin Series are the best historical fiction out there.Having said that, these 3 books were up to Cornwell's standards and did the time period and characterization justice."},{"Title":"Heretic (The Grail Quest, Book 3)","review":"The first book, An Archer's Tale, is the best, more action and we get to walk along side the protagonist as he literally grows to fit his longbow. Vagabond is next and the pace begins to slow though the other characters who cross his path help to carry the book. Heretic is the third and final entry in this series. Heretic slows even more and seems bogged down. It was at times frustrating though the author pulls the pieces together for a fitting climax. Bernard's famous knowledge of the times and attention to detail carry all three books. Having read his epic Angincourt, other books pale by comparison. This is a good little trilogy and I know I will read it again."},{"Title":"Heretic (The Grail Quest, Book 3)","review":"The third and final volume of Cornwell's Grail Quest saga, our hero Thomas finds himself in southern France, near his ancestral home of Astarac. By happy coincidence, his nemesis, cousin Guy Vexile, arrives as well as some unexpected (and unwanted) guests: plague rats. A friend and companion turns on him (and is redeemed), an old friend dies, but the battles are won and the grail? Well, I won't spoil it.The series is a great read for those looking for an adventure set in medieval times. The story takes place early in the Hundred Year's War between France and England, and does a good job illustrating how shifting loyalties meant it wasn't a simple war between two established nations.

He is also seeking out his sworn enemy Guy Vexille, who he believes may lead him to the Grail.I found this book just as enjoyable as the previous two in the series, perhaps, even more so. I was worried that this book might be too similar to Vagabond, as Thomas was still in France searching for the Grail. However, the introduction of new characters, such as Genevieve, Abbot Planchard, and the Count of Berat, meant that this was not the case.As for the battle scenes in the novel, they were excellent, as usual.

One point that should be made up front is that it is definetly part 3 of an on-going story and if you have not read the Archers Tale or Vagabond then you are not going to get the most from the story. The plot line is rather involved and Cornwell does not spend much verbiage on a recap. Also if you are a fan of the Sharpe novels (as I am) it is not long before you start seeing the similarities (ex: Sharpe with faithful Irish sidekick Sgt. Harper, Thomas with faithful Scots sidekick Robbie Douglas). This however is a minor quibble, Cornwell is a master at blending history and a good yarn into a seamless enjoyable package."},{"Title":"Heretic (The Grail Quest, Book 3)","review":"Set in 14th century France, where the peasants trying to survive were beset by greedy barons exacting rent and taxes, invading armies that pillaged and burned villages, a corrupt church, bands of unemployed soldiers who occupied areas for their own profit, gangs of bandits who preyed on everyone else, and the plague which appeared and decimated entire towns. Thomas of Hookton returns to France during the last stages of the seige of Calais. He reports to the Earl of Northampton, and leaves on a search for the Holy Grail.It is an interesting tale, and does raise a question. How would you recognize the Grail if you happened to find it? It was a cup, but there were hundreds of thousands of cups lying about. The quest is joined by various people who have their own interests in finding the Grail, some for personal profit, and some for power. Friendships are uncertain, and people sometimes form unlikely alliances (an enemy of my enemy is my friend). The main criteria for being a hero seems to be the ability to survive, and Thomas survives unusual perils while people around him perish.The novel has an interesting epilogue about the Grail. Readers are referred to Mercedes Lackey's short story \\"Once and Future\\" about a man who wakes up one morning to find himself in possession of Excalibur (it is found in her collection, \\"Fiddler Fair\\"). Possibly of interest is the fact that Thomas finds a woman companion who also survives. The author has a habit of disposing of women in his novels, although Sharpe also eventually settled down with a woman who seems to survive.I originally became interested in the series because the Earl of Northampton was a distant ancestor. The author has done extensive research into the history of time period, and his novels seem a good depiction of conditions."},{"Title":"Heretic (The Grail Quest, Book 3)","review":"Recently I have found some of Cornwell's books disappointing. Don't get me wrong, I've read all of his books and buy them as soon as they come out, particularly the Sharpe and Grail series. However, what was original in the first several volumes of either series seems formulaic after a time. Heretic carries the formula to the extreme, almost to the point of being a caricature of Corwell's own style. He continues to be a master of military fiction, and in particular the dramatic battlefield narrative. However, he persists in injecting a romantic aspect into the story which, in Heretic, seems to dictate Thomas' choice of action past the point of reason and credibility. Thomas is, like Sharpe, an individual raised on brutality and military pragmatism. On rare occasion, it would be possible for such an individual to make decisions with the heart rather than the head, but with these characters it has become repetitious. The series is not a romance series, but military historical fiction, and now the main characters have become predictable romantics. When there was a decision to be made by Thomas in this story, I knew what it would be pages before it was made. That is a disappointment.Such a romantic sideline should not be necessary to effectively tell such a period piece. Neither Thomas' story nor Sharpe's was without apparent inspiration (for Sharpe, The Rifleman by C.S. Forester, and for Thomas, The Bowman of Crecy by Ronald Welch). Those tales did not include romantic distractions, and managed to tell very compelling stories with complete characters.Cornwell would do well to avoid falling into the trap of always using the same plot complications and devices. Every once in a while, it would be refreshing for Thomas or Sharpe to do something pragmatic and avoid acting like an idiot for every pretty face that comes along. Mix it up a little, Bernie."},{"Title":"Heretic (The Grail Quest, Book 3)","review":"The Middle Ages need more expousureThis does it!

True, seiges which took days in the book seemed to take a day or two in the audiobook. Marches that took weeks in the book seemed to take a week in the abridged version.

Great!Heretic (The Grail Quest #3)."},{"Title":"Heretic (The Grail Quest, Book 3)","review":"With \\"Heretic\\", Cornwell concludes his Hundred Years War/Grail Quest trilogy. Although quite different in tone from the first two books in the series, this is still an exciting, page turning read. Thomas continues his quest, picks up a new love interest, gets excommunicated, escapes the plague, settles old scores, and comes to understand the true meaning of the grail. What is different from the previous two books in the series is that he does this outside the context of real historical battles and campaigns. For Cornwell fans there is no question, if you've followed the quest this far, pick up \\"Heretic\\" and finish it."},{"Title":"Heretic (The Grail Quest, Book 3)","review":"Mr. Cornwell writes a gritty account of life during the turmultuous and violtent times of knights, archers and their constant struggle for land, power & wealth. Thoroughly enjoyable for the glance into the minds of the common man (no so much woman), who takes on the life of an archer. Loved all three books and plan to read more of Bernard Cornwell's work."},{"Title":"Heretic (The Grail Quest, Book 3)","review":"Like Cornwell's Starbuck series, you must read THE ARCHER'S TALE and VAGABOND before reading HERETIC. And of the three, this is the worst.I read with relish THE ARCHER'S TALE. Likewise, VAGABOND, though at times a little gruesome, had all the ingredients of an interesting historical novel: great battles, interesting characters, betrayal, redemption, evil churchmen, a quest, etc.However, the first thing I noticed about HERETIC was that the visualizations were gone. With scant detail, I couldn't visualize the castle in and around which much of the action takes place, the face of the &quot;most beautiful woman&quot; they ever saw, nor any of the other people and places of the book. Cornwell gives one of the least visual descriptions of Yersinia Pestis ever.And even though there was Thomas' usual love interest present (a different woman each time), no endearments passed between them.What I most missed were the battle scenes. Oh, there were some but neither a satisfying number nor of the scope and pagentry that characterized those in the earlier two books.Finally, you will have to read the first 2 novels in this series to understand who is who and why they are doing what they're doing in this one. In fact, I think a better course may be to read those two, and to wait until this one can be found in a used book store."},{"Title":"Heretic (The Grail Quest, Book 3)","review":"This book is great except for its anti-Catholicism. The portrayal of the Dominincan Order is very false. But as an adventure story it is great."},{"Title":"Heretic (The Grail Quest, Book 3)","review":"I am a big fan of Bernard Cornwell's novels, however, the last of the Archer trilogy was a bit of a disappointment. The story seemed hurried and the characters are either undeveloped or out of character from the earlier two books (what's up with Robbie?) It is as if Mr. Cornwell rushed to finish the book too quickly. The entire series lacks the grit and intensity of the Sharpe novels and fails to match the sophisticated story telling of the Arthur (Winter King) trilogy. There is such a thing as being overly prolific. Hopefully, Mr. Cornwell will slow down next time out."},{"Title":"Heretic (The Grail Quest, Book 3)","review":"HERETIC is the third(and perhaps last)novel chronicling the adventures of English longbowman, Thomas of Hookton, during the early years of the Hundred Years' War. It will be more enjoyable if one first reads ARCHER and NOMAD. The siege and capture of Calais is glimpsed briefly at the beginning, but most of the story involves the capture and defense of Castillon d'Arbizon by Thomas and some of his comrades from NOMAD. There Thomas and his evil cousin Guy Vexille have their final confrontation. It is the search for the Holy Grail that drives the central characters in HERETIC.As usual, Cornwell gives the reader a trove of detail about the way war was waged and life was lived in the mid-14th century. We learn about the wearing of plate armor, about special-purpose arrow points, the fortification of medieval castles, and the loading and firing of primitive cannon. We watch a craftsman doing wax-replacement casting. What is missing, for this reader, is Cornwell's usually brilliant evocation of landscape. Gascony does not come alive the way Normandy and Durham did in the earlier books.HERETIC also gets bogged down by too many grails, counterfeit and (perhaps) otherwise. Cornwell explains how the grail came to a remote fortress in Gascony by quoting a legend that connects it to the heretic Cathars, but fails to trace its whereabouts during the first Christian millennium. Nor does the &quot;true&quot; grail, once found, exhibit any special properties to verify it authenticity. Why let it be found at all, if you aren't going to provide some supernatural fireworks a la Tolkien or Indiana Jones? Cornwell's message seems to be that the grail's only power was its hold on men's imaginations. When Thomas takes the predictably high-minded course, one is likely to wonder, like Peggy Lee, &quot;Is that all there is?&quot;Earlier Amazon reviewers assume that HERETIC concludes the Thomas of Hookton series. This is reasonable if you think the story of the grail was the real heart of the story. If, however, one believes that the real subject of Cornwell's series is the apogee of the English longbow as a weapon of war then we might expect to follow Thomas at least through the Battle of Poitiers. He certainly deserves a more rousing send-off than HERETIC."},{"Title":"Heretic (The Grail Quest, Book 3)","review":"I've been a fan of Bernard Cornwell since the Sharpe series appeared in the States. As of late I've found the Sharpe series repetitious post-Waterloo. But this latest effort by Cornwell brings back the frailties and strengths of being a soldier using &quot;quaint&quot; weaponry. The battles scenes,as always, written with taut naration but full and richly detailed. This latest is one of the better ones yet I found Vagabond to be the better of the three so far."},{"Title":"Heretic (The Grail Quest, Book 3)","review":"The concluding part of Cornwell's trilogy, Heretic, promised to provide a fabulously roaring end to the tale of Thomas Hookton, English Archer during the early years of the Hundred Years War. But, unfortunately, it went out with a tired whimper rather than the exciting bangs of the previous two novels.It opens with Thomas' rescue of the overly adventurous Earl of Northampton at a skirmish at Calais and his subsequent orders to go to Astarac and locate the Grail, ensuring his cousin, Guy de Vexille, is aware of his presence.So, Thomas takes his new band of archers south and captures the Castillon D'Arbizon in a nighttime raid and manages to avert the superstitious and fear induced heretical burning of the Church-condemned beghard, Genevieve, who is, luckily for Thomas, also very beautiful (inducing a fit of jealousy in the ever present Robbie). Meanwhile, the evil Dominician is back, this time in the guise of Louis Bessieres, Cardinal Archbishop of Livorno, with his brother, Charles and they are seeking, in a tower at Soissons, to create an artificial Grail. This they achieve and Thomas and Genevieve are evicted from D'Arbizon by a group of his own men, led by Robbie who's unrequited lust for Genevieve allows his religious fervour to flourish. Thomas is subsequently excommunicated, takes up with a band of corredors led by Phildin, and spends much of the time moving through the Berat countryside before returning to D'Arbizon.Meanwhile, the Count of Berat is murderd by his nephew, Joscelyn, who turns out to be another Jekyll. Joscelyn promptly takes his cannon to D'Arbizon, aided by Charles Bessiers and Guy Vexille to both remove the English garrison under Sir Guillaume and capture the grail. As Thomas reenters D'Arbizon, killing Bessiere's on the way, they discover the false grail and destroy it before most of the protagnists die either from the ensuing battles or the Plague which has arrived in France. We also finally get to see Thomas, archer, in a final duel with his cousin, Guy, swordsman, with the inevitable result. At the end Thomas and his Genevieve ride into the English sunset, with Robbie reconciled to them and they locate the true Grail.All in all, a good final part to the trilogy with the exception that Cornwell has taken the safe option that most modern Grail stories follow. In true Indiana Jones style, the baddies fall for the fabulously wealthy cup whilst the hero realises that it the Grail is liable to be a simply crafted vessel and then it ends up being removed for all time so that evil men can't kill more for it. A tad cliched and hence the earlier statement that it ends with a whimper.Nevertheless, Harlequin and Vagabond provide an excellent foray into the Hundred Years War and Thomas of Hookton is a character well worth following and if Cornwell were to write more of him I'd eagerly wait for it to hit the shelves."},{"Title":"Heretic (The Grail Quest, Book 3)","review":"First, the positive: this book vividly portrays the superstition and gross spiritual darkness of people living in the 14th Century, and it does so better than anything I've ever read or seen. We see an innocent young girl condemned to be burned at the stake, after having been tortured by a sadistic Dominican monk. Our hero, Thomas of Hookton, rescues her from that fate, but soon his command is falling apart because the men are terrified to have a condemned heretic among them, thinking it is bad luck. Thomas cleverly calms their fears by touching a crucifix to the girl's forehead and showing that she is not burned or struck dead. Nevertheless, later on, after the girl has killed her Dominican torturer, and Thomas is excommunicated for harboring her and keeping the church from burning her, the problem arises again, with a vengeance. That much of the book (about the first half) was gripping reading. After that, the novel just kind of fell apart and lost all its direction.Now the negative: There are major continuity problems between the second and third books of this \\"trilogy.\\" Jeanette, \\"the blackbird,\\" who was Thomas' love interest in the first two books, simply disappears and is never heard from or even mentioned in the third book. That was a major disappointment, because she was an interesting character who had been developed over the first two novels, and it seemed that she and Thomas were destined to be together. In the second book, \\"Vagabond,\\" Sir Guillaume D'Evecque lost his estates but, in the battle of LeRoche-Derrien depicted at the end of \\"Vagabond\\", D'Evecque had captured his own landlord, the wealthy Count of Coutances, and was in a position to extract a large ransom and get his estates returned to him. His exact words were that Coutances' \\"wife and daughters will have to whore themselves to raise his ransom!\\" But at the beginning of \\"Heretic\\" there is no mention of this at all, and Guillaume is depicted as landless and only able to retain two men-at-arms. But by far the worst offense in this regard was Robbie Douglas, who turns out to have half a dozen severe character defects in \\"Heretic\\" that weren't even hinted at in \\"Vagabond.\\" For example, he suddenly has a gambling problem, and loses his own ransom money not once but twice! His character is all over the map, doing crazy things that don't make any sense and have no consistent motivation. It is as if Cornwell hired someone else to write the final book of the trilogy, and that person read the cliff-notes of the first two books, and not the books themselves.Another problem with this book, and a major reason why it is much weaker than the first two, is that there is no real history here after the first 26 pages. In the first two books, Cornwell skillfully wove his story around major engagements of the 100 years war, and very accurately depicted those engagments. This is just pure novel, with no redeeming history lesson about actual battles (although, as described above, it is probably an excellent depiction of the gross spiritual darkness prevailing at that time).By the end of this volume, I found myself having a great deal of sympathy for the arch-villain, Guy Vexille, Thomas' cousin, and the man who killed both his father and his pregnant first wife. He's the only character in this mess who knows exactly what he is doing (trying to find the grail), is doing it for noble reasons (he genuinely believes it will make the world a better place), and is single-minded in his pursuit of his noble goal. Everyone else just wants to kill, plunder and rape, including Thomas, who just wants to sleep with pretty girls and kill people with his bow. Yet Thomas is the hero and Vexille the villain of this trilogy! Wow. What a disappointing end to this trilogy. Out with a whimper, indeed."},{"Title":"Heretic (The Grail Quest, Book 3)","review":"Bernard Cornwell's Grail Quest trilogy concludes with \\"Heretic,\\" and a bloody conclusion it is, too.Thomas of Hookton lives in violent times. In \\"The Archer's Tale,\\" Thomas's father was butchered by Thomas's cousin, Guy Vexille, and Thomas's woman, Eleanor, was also murdered by Guy in \\"Vagabond.\\" Thomas has survived several vicious battles and an even more vicious round of torture at the hands of a Dominican priest. And through it all, Thomas has sought the holiest of holy relics, the Grail . . . although Thomas has not always pursued his quest with vigor.Now, in \\"Heretic,\\" Thomas at last closes in on the object of his quest by returning to his ancestral home of Astarac. By pursuing the Grail here, Thomas also hopes to draw out his cousin so Thomas can avenge his father and Eleanor.Cornwell, as usual, keeps Thomas the Archer occupied, wielding a new, mightier bow with the same lethal efficiency. For those who have not yet read this series, the archer was not the little guy standing in the rear picking off foes with little pinpricks. The archer was king of the battlefield, using a variety of arrows to slaughter men and horses, perforating even the strongest armor with cannon-like shots. The arrival of primitive cannon technology in this series does not alter the balance of power.Thomas, being Thomas, gets sidetracked with romance by falling in love with a beautiful woman (who always seem to turn up for Thomas . . . oh, well -- it pays not to overthink such things). This woman was falsely accused of being a heretic and has been tortured at the hands of an evil priest, much like Thomas. For his chivalry, Thomas is excommunicated. Cast out, he nevertheless pursues his twin goals of revenge and salvation.Cornwell vividly describes the world of the Hundred Years War. Not only does Thomas have to contend with dastardly kin and mighty men-at-arms, the Black Death is screaming across the land, with horrifying results. Cornwell describes it all with his usual straightforward yet captivating style.\\"Heretic\\" is not a great departure from the earlier two novels in the series. Sharp-eyed readers will have spotted clues in earlier books regarding the Grail and its location, but the mystery is still captivating, and the conclusion is unexpected.While not exactly a \\"feel good\\" book, the Grail Quest series is a fun read, and a rollicking ride across the battlefields of Britain and France.

Bernard Cornwell, the author of numerous historical chronicles, extends his stories from THE ARCHER'S TALE and VAGABOND to a further quest for the Grail in HERETIC. Thomas of Hookton, the bastard son of a noble family, is the archer who leads the Earl of Northampton's archers to the shores of France.Thomas distinguishes himself in battle for his lord and is given a new challenge. He is to take a small force deep into southern French territory, capture a fortress, defend it and hope to capture his evil cousin, Guy de Vexille. He seeks Astarac in the county of Berat to explore and find the Grail for Northampton. The ransomed Scot leader, Robbie Douglas and Sir Guillaume, an English nobleman, accompany Thomas to France.Thomas's father was a priest who had kept secret the location of the Grail, if it had existed. The clue to its whereabouts lay in the Latin words he had inscribed on papers left behind before his murder. Thomas doubted its existence. His father had rambled and been considered a lunatic.The journey becomes complicated when the archers conquer Castillion D'Arbizon and become involved in local politics. To administer justice in the enclave, the conquerors must carry out orders from the Church's governing bishops. A heretic, a young vagabond girl, has been judged and sentenced to death by fire. Thomas, as civil authority, hears the facts and decides that she should live. Local priests disagree with his judgment and excommunicate him from the Church.Cornwell's vivid imagery of the time and setting in HERETIC places the reader directly in the action. Each pull of the powerful bowstring follows with an adrenaline rush inherent with victory. His description of the warmongering mechanisms are graphic pictures of their times. The book is fiction based on general facts, but is a believable panoramic view of real events.Priests ruled their local abbeys with ironclad domination and were not to be disobeyed. HERETIC shows the majority as self-serving and mean-spirited. Father Planchard is an exception --- he befriends Thomas. Planchard produces a wooden box, inscribed with the Latin words Thomas's father had ingrained in him, \\"Calix meus inebrians.\\" The interchange between him and Planchard is coy wordplay at its best.The accused heretic, Genevieve, is the pivotal figure in the story. Thomas discovers through her that his quest for revenge and reinstatement in the Church he knows diminishes in importance. He learns that peace can be found without the discovery of the Grail. One hopes that future books will expand this fascinating Grail Quest series. HERETIC defines the men of the era and thirsts for more.--- Reviewed by Judy Gigstad"},{"Title":"Heretic (The Grail Quest, Book 3)","review":"The Holy Grail was the most sacred of all treasures in medieval times, sending armies on quests for the fabled cup all over Europe. Thomas of Hookton, a young English archer of some considerable skill, finds himself in France searching for the grail, but instead finds himself a bundle of trouble.Thomas saves a girl from being burned at the stake for witchcraft and suddenly finds himself excommunicated from the church, and an enemy of his friends. To make matters worse, English archers in France were popular amongst bandits- because of the high price on their heads. Thomas and his newfound love soon find shelter in a monastery, which holds further clues to the whereabouts of the mythical grail.The monastery proves to be an unsafe hideout, as Thomas' ambitious and ruthless cousin also seeks the grail, and would quite like to see Thomas and his heretic girlfriend dead. Things come to a head when Thomas is reunited with his former friends, but ends up besieged in a castle. While the English longbow was the most deadly infantry weapon of the era, it was no match for the early cannon, subtly named Hell Spitter, dragged in from Italy to knock down the castle. The Italian gunners however bring something far more deadly with them in the form of the Black Death.Bernard Cornwell brings to life a number of aspects of the medieval age, like the deep reaching influence of the church, and how allegiances among soldiers were made and broken. He also offers a view into the harsh realities of medieval life, like the desperate poverty of peasants, who were an easy target for both soldiers and bandits alike. Cornwell pulls no punches when it comes to graphic descriptions of violence and war, and how something as simple as a broken limb could prove fatal.While Robin Hood may have been noble enough to steal from the rich and give to the poor, Thomas of Hookton stole from the poor when he had to, and killed the rich when they deserved it. This is a fast moving and historically accurate story with characters flawed enough to be real people, tangled in one of the most futile but enduring treasure hunts of all time."},{"Title":"Heretic (The Grail Quest, Book 3)","review":"Let me preface this by saying that Bernard Cornwell is probably my favorite living author. I am a huge fan of the Sharpe series, his Warlords trilogy, and his new Viking/Alfred the Great series promises to be his best yet. However, his trilogy about Thomas of Hookton and his adventures in the Grail Quest series have left me unsatisfied. This series started out well enough with the Archer's Tale, which was a riveting account of the English armies in France during the Hundred Years war. Cornwell's usual incredible attention to detail transported the reader back in time (like he always does) and really explains to you why things happened in the historical context. In this case, why the longbow was king of the battlefield. Thomas was your typical Cornwell hero, young and inexperienced but quickly a veteran in the arts of war. He was surrounded by the usual cast of battle hardened but friendly (to Thomas) veterans along with the usual well born foes looking to foil our heroes dreams. Hey, its a formula that works and I have no problem with Cornwell recycling this in different historical eras. He even added a very interesting female character in Jeannette and Thomas was caught up in the events leading up to the Battle of Crecy. Great stuff.The second book, Vagabond, continued a good story, but started to really delve into the quest for the Grail and the historical events in France, while still relevant, were starting to take a back seat to the Grail quest. My biggest problem with this book is that Thomas would have been crippled for life following a certain episode (an episode I really hope Cornwell doesn't start using on his protagonists - we have George Martin for that). So for me, the book starts to take on a bit of a unrealistic format.Finally, we come to the final book Heretic, and in my opinion Cornwell loses control of the story. First, he almost completely ignores history. This is more or less a fantasy novel set in France about the Grail. England and France reach a truce, and Thomas' liege the Earl of Northhampton sends him on an improbable task to take a castle in southern France and look for the Holy Grail. Ummm...OK. A shaky start, but the story is engaging as Thomas has his first command and we have a great scene where a castle is stormed and several good episodes of raiding. Then Geneiveve comes in and the story falls apart. She's a heretic condemend by the church and set to burn. She falls into the hands of Thomas and he defies the church and won't burn her, eventually getting excommunicated and losing all his men in the process. Cornwell has never written women well so I give some leeway on his female characters. However this is just sloppy. Someone else pointed this out but it bears further mentioning, I don't think Geneiveve has more than 100 words of dialog in the book. Who is she and why would Thomas throw away his soul and the duty to his liege lord (something conviently overlooked in his decision process) for this girl? All we know is she is anorexic thin and beautiful. Empoverished girls who bathed maybe one a month in the 14th century were not beautiful and its surprising that someone normally so attuned to period detail just lets this pass.After Part One, the book moves in one confusing circle around the land of Astarac, the historical home of Thomas' ancestors and his cousin Guy Vexille, who I wish would have had a bigger role because he was actually the only interesting character in this book. Instead, we get chapter after chapter about a stereotypical and boring French Knight Joscelyn who we never for a moment suspect is a match for our hero. Vexille meanwhile is consumed by a religious quest and a warrior monk mentality that makes him dangerous (and ruthless). In the meantime, one of Thomas' best friends from the series goes completely insane and illogically turns against him and everyone he's fought with for the last several years. The conclusion isn't bad but it doesn't make up for the several hundred pages of aimless wandering it took to get there.Lots of good history of course, as always. In particular I like how God and the belief in God is portrayed in the 14th century, even among vicious killers. But Geneiveve has to be one of Cornwell's worst main characters and Thomas slips several notches down the list of Cornwell heroes by the time this book is over. I can see myself rereading book one again, but I'll pass on the 2nd two books in this trilogy. Maybe Cornwell should pick up the war in the 15th century and try again."},{"Title":"Heretic (The Grail Quest, Book 3)","review":"Bernard Cornwell is a great writer of historical fiction, particularly when it involves armed conflict at the personal level. Indeed, some of his works send readers running to the dictionary to look up obscure terms for armor, arms and tactics. Some may find that tedious but I find it fascinating. This book is no different in that respect. It is also a good story.The action takes place in France during the Hundred Years War. The protagonist is an English archer charged with leading a group of men to take over a small town that was one the possession of an English noble. The real reason is that the noble suspects that there will be found information leading to the recovery of the Holy Grail. It seems that many others have the same idea and the situation is ready for medieval conflict: bloody, brutal and harsh.One of the things that makes this an interesting book is the characterizations. Often, the \\"good guys\\" are found doing bad things for bad reasons. The \\"bad guys\\" occasionally have very laudable reasons for their actions. Things don't seem so simple when viewed through a medieval lens.The title refers to the love interest of the protagonist. She is a girl falsely accused of heresy and condemned to burn. Instead of burning herself, she is rescued and inflames the libidos of various characters thus causing even more chaos and conflict. That much at least has not chanced since the Hundred Years War.It is a good story and Cornwell does a good job of making the reader feel at home in times long past."},{"Title":"Heretic (The Grail Quest, Book 3)","review":"Heretic, like the first two stories in the Grail Quest series, was equally historically believable. That means a lot to history buffs like me. Once again, the hero faces evil nobles and suffers incredibly. This time, however, the events that Mr. Cromwell puts the him through are not as believable as all that. In addition to many things, like the savvy Jewish doctor being in the right place at the right time, for instance, is just a little too unlikely. Again, events in the story are possible, remotely, but Mr. Cromwell stretches credulity.I enjoyed the historical elements, and the depiction of the times was solid. If you've invested time and effort in the first two books of the series this one does wrap things up."},{"Title":"Heretic (The Grail Quest, Book 3)","review":"Cornwell has completed the Grail quest trilogy, Harlequin (The Archer's Tale in the U.S.) Vagabond and Heretic, with a wonderful climax that leaves every loose end tied up and every person, evil or good, dealt their final hand in life.The story continues to follow Thomas of Hookton as he endures the weight of the family burden (protectors of the grail), and his position as an archer in the English army; now commanding a garrison of men that are charged with taking a castle for the Earl of Northampton.The battles are, as with both of the first 2 books, well described and equally explained from both sides of the battle-line. Cornwell has presented a far more fictional book than the first two, which were described as historical fiction. This book, according to Cornwell's historical notes at the end of the book, presents some fictional towns and fictional battles that were used to bring the book to a close. As much as I enjoyed the historical portions of the first 2 books, I was not disappointed by the liberty that Cornwell took with the final chapter of the trilogy. Cornwell created places, people and battles that could be used to reach the necessary climax.The story, despite the lack of historical fact from the time period (the hundred years war), still manages to grab ahold of the reader's attention and hold it until the epilogue is complete.I was definitely disappointed when I reached the end of the book. I wanted more of the story but, alas, it would seem that the grail quest is complete and I must move on to other Cornwell novels.The entire trilogy is excellent and is highly recommended for anyone that enjoys history, grail stories, medieval mythology, early catholic history or plain, old good story writing."},{"Title":"Heretic (The Grail Quest, Book 3)","review":"Heretic is the final installment of Cornwell's Grail Quest series that started with The Archer's Tale and continued with Vagabond. In Heretic Thomas continues his quest for the Holy Grail and his cousin the Harlequin. This time Thomas and his band head south to Gascony as the tale takes him back to his ancestral lands of Astarac searching for answers to the Grail mystery and for Guy Vexille. In this stunning conclusion to Thomas of Hookton's tale Cornwell does a magnificent job of tying up all the loose ends of the story for a very satisfying conclusion to the tale. The best book of the Grail Quest series, Heretic is a must read for any fan of Thomas."},{"Title":"Heretic (The Grail Quest, Book 3)","review":"Cornwell does a good job explaining the historical time and making the Dominicans look like the sadists they must have been in the Inquisition."},{"Title":"Heretic (The Grail Quest, Book 3)","review":"Is a great book as all the others from Bernard Cornwell.It is really interesting to learn a little about the wars and the importance of the arches!"},{"Title":"Heretic (The Grail Quest, Book 3)","review":"I am still reading Bernard Cornwell since the first book of his that I bought. He blends history with fiction to the point that you can't wait for his next book to come out. Currently I am reading his Sharpes series on my kindle and as I finish one (so far up to #11), I then order the next one. I have read most of his books from his Arthur series to Sharpes with the Grail Quest as well. Definitely well worth the price!"},{"Title":"Heretic (The Grail Quest, Book 3)","review":"I have just finished this brilliant novel. I think his work has to be judged more from its insightfulness than its plots. The world he writes of has very few of the crises that today's world has so the plotsa are limited. However, the real ability and fascination of this author is his study of the time. He relates the religion, the foul smells, and short stubby lives of the people with their pocked and scarred bodies. This is the complete briliance of Cornwell. May he write even more from his fertile brain to remind us how far we have come or how far we have not come. ."},{"Title":"Heretic (The Grail Quest, Book 3)","review":"Cornwell's final book in the trilogy tied up all the ends but the series as a whole just didn't give me characters that I would want to go back and revisit. Still, a solid series but I don't think I will ever reread any of these books."},{"Title":"Heretic (The Grail Quest, Book 3)","review":"the third book in the Grail Quest series was just as good, if not better than the rest. In it, the hero,the Archer, found what he was looking for and the story ended perfectly. The historical lessons learned from this book are why I read such books. The English long bow is a weapon I have often heard of, but never knew they were as rare in those times as Conrnwell describes them to be. And as war is described in these books, war in those times, it makes war exactly what it really is, not to be undertaken lightly. More can be learned from reading these books of this subject than in any history class I ever attended. And far more interesting. Pity is, that history classes need to be just as involving to children as these books, so as not to forget our history, or that of others. \\"he who forgets his history is often doomed to repeat it\\". One may not forget history if war were described as it is in these books. A GREAT READ, A MUST ALMOST!"},{"Title":"Heretic (The Grail Quest, Book 3)","review":"Bernard Cornwell is by far the best historical fiction author of our time. I have read 10 or 12 of his books and have had a hard time putting them down after starting them. Amazon got the book to me in two days and I was done with the book two days later. Great book!!"},{"Title":"Heretic (The Grail Quest, Book 3)","review":"As with most other Cornwell books I enjoyed reading \\"Heretic\\". But it's not a book I would keep in my library.I see it as an enjoyable story to read and then I put the book in the recycle bin."},{"Title":"Heretic (The Grail Quest, Book 3)","review":"I ended up liking this one - Cornwell had a good plot resolution albeit one that I saw coming. But overall, I'm glad this trilogy is done.Arriving back in France in time to help the English fend off French efforts to retake Calais, Thomas of Hookton is sent by the Earl of Northampton to retake his onetime fief deep inside France. And, as it happens, it's not far from the ancestral home of the Vexilles - Thomas' ancestors, tied to the Cathar heresy and rumored to have at one time owned the Holy Grail.Thomas and his men retake Northampton's castle. Meanwhile, the Cardinal of Bessieres also schemes to find it, thinking it can make him the next Pope. And if he can't find it, Plan B is to create a counterfeit, aided by his rotten ruffian brother Charles. Also getting into the act is the Count of Berat, a local noble, religious and erudite, who thinks finding the Grail would be the miracle that would help him, late in life, father an heir. Berat's nephew Joscelyn, a powerful, boorish knight, meanwhile angles to inherit the estate for himself. In the background is Thomas' nemesis and ruthless cousin Guy Vexille, searching, too, for the Grail.As they take the castle, Thomas and his men stumble upon a girl - beautiful, of course - who is about to be burned as a heretic. Thomas predictably (in no Cornwell novel has this ever not happened) falls for Genevieve and saves her, but his Scots pal Robbie Douglas wants her too, and the girl's presence not only drives a wedge between the pals but starts to split the company. Protecting her costs Thomas dearly, as churchmen in league with his opponents excommunicate him. Meanwhile everyone wants to poke around the ruins at Astarac, now occupied by not much more than a little monastery run by the saintly Abbot Planchard.I'm a big Cornwell fan, but tired of this trilogy a bit. I think the Grail story and the cat-and-mouse game between Thomas and Guy Vexille was extended too long, like a soap opera plot getting endless twists and turns just to keep it going.Cornwell does everything possible to elaborate the warfare angle - archery's advent tilting the medieval balance of power in combat - but he doesn't really have enough there to keep it interesting over three books. Yep, the bowmen's arrows could punch through armor. Yep, they come in sheaves of 24. Yep, rain ruins the bowstrings. Yep, this arrowhead for this, that one for that. And lots of details about armor, powerful war horses, newfangled cannons and crossbows. After a while, though, we feel we've heard it all, and the battle scenes are inevitably made dramatic when the archers with their long-distance killing power turn the tables on the annoying French knights in shining armor. (Ni!) In Cornwell's other series, he is more inventive in his battle sequences.Warfare is Cornwell's strong suit, but in the Grail Quest series the religious angles trump it. Thomas' religious agonies don't hang together well. Cornwell's main characters are usually religious skeptics. In Thomas he has to blend that side - Thomas doubting the Grail's existence, meanwhile witnessing awful acts including torture committed by churchmen - with a side of him that does believe, that frets religiously when he is excommunicated. All his internal rumination gets tedious. He's suspicious of Genevieve's free-thinking ways: she's not the heretic that the church says she is, but meanwhile she's sort of a pantheist, the type that dances naked during thunderstorms. (Bernard, do you have her phone number? Just kidding.) Religion has a role in all of Cornwell's series, but in this one, what with the medieval setting and the Grail legend and all, it's overwhelming. It also keeps our hero from having the sort of devil-may-care side to him that make Starbuck, Uhtred and, most of all, Sharpe, so appealing.On the positive side, the Abbot Planchard is the finest of all Cornwell's religious characters - a clergyman sympathetic not because he's one of the boys, a hearty warrior, or humanized by his appetites (we see all of those in the also-medieval Saxon Chronicles) - but because of his wisdom, and a courage to do the right thing regardless of Church dogma or material consequence.There were other things I liked here. Cornwell hints throughout the series at the Black Plague, which you know is coming from the 1340s dates. Periodically a character sneezes and you think, \\"Here it is,\\" but then it isn't. Yet. He saves it for this one and weaves it well into the plot.But all in all, I had to push myself through these books, a first for me with a Cornwell series. Still worth reading, but Cornwell has set impossibly high standards for himself with his other series - even Patrick O'Brian only had one major series with Aubrey and Maturin - and this one falls short of what we've come to expect."},{"Title":"Heretic (The Grail Quest, Book 3)","review":"Excellent middle ages blood and thunder wrap up of a thrilling three part series.

The title is derived from Thomas of Hookton's encounter with Genevieve, a woman condemned (unfairly so by any modern standard) of heresy. And it is the very premise of her guilt or innocence that I found least convincing.The notion that any ordinary soldier would take it upon himself to challenge the church, including a Cardinal and his surrogates on the interpretation of heresy is preposterous. Particularly, one who is the bastard son of a priest. True he is better educated than nearly everyone around him but education in the 14th century was a tool to enforce uniformity not to instill independent thinking. The notion that an archer would defy a Bishop beggar's belief. Eternal damnation was believed to be precisely that and was the unequivocal domain of the Church. People didn't jeopardize their souls over disagreements with a Bishop so a \\"love at first sight' story line is concocted to bolster a dubious story line.It's no small drawback in my estimation but Cornwall is a superb story teller and Heretic offers ample opportunities for him to display his talents. Like others I expected Cornwall to wrap up the story line of a character like Jeanette who played a significant role in parts one and two. That he didn't is disappointing. But if you can get past such oddities and some misplaced modernism,. Heretic is definitely worth a read. Even when Cornwall isn't at his best, he is better than most."},{"Title":"Heretic (The Grail Quest, Book 3)","review":"Another historical novel by Bernard Cornwell, as readable as most of his others and more so than some.

Even given the notable lack of self-control of Cornwell heroes when it comes to women, in this case the major plot line was Thomas abandoning his course for the woman. The only motivation offered for Thomas's attraction is her beauty. But there is absolutely no indication of any character lurking beneath the body! I haven't counted, but I doubt she has more than 30 words of dialogue in the entire book. For the hero to make a 90-degree behavioral turn for a woman, one has to understand the woman to understand why he would do so.

Many books have been written to assist the readers with everything from selecting an ERP solution to implementing the solution. None have addressed these issues as completely as this book.The simple, concise, easy-to-understand way in which the author, Travis Anderegg, presents the information slowly \`strips' away the layers of mystery and misunderstanding that have often been associated with ERP projects - small or large. Not only does a reader gain insight into the history of ERP but also is introduced to definitions and terminology associated with Enterprise Resource Planning.It is a known fact that approximately 80% of all ERP projects fail. Many times, companies will blame the vendor (they misled us), the software (it does not fit our business), the consultant (they should have told us not to pick this package), etc. Often times, no one was \`truly' at fault; it is a matter of not understanding how to plan, select, implement, maintain, and take ownership of an ERP system. This book covers all these areas from the initial decision to consider a company's ERP software strategy through planning, evaluation, decision, negotiation, implementation, and change management. Various critical success factors are identified throughout the chapters.It also provides diagrams, charts, and questions to aid the reader in \`gleaning' the pertinent points from the chapters. The book also points out the \`pitfalls' and how to avoid making costly mistakes. The concepts presented in this book can be applied not only to ERP but also to other major IT procurements, such as HR/PR systems, CRM, and DPM. This book can also prepare individuals to pass the CIERP examination and be recognized as CIERP (certified implementer of enterprise resource planning) certified.As the book shows ERP is very much a people system - not just software. The more educated people are, in regards to ERP, the more likely that a company will be successful. This book is an invaluable resource for anyone who is or will be involved with Enterprise Resource Planning:Business executives, senior decision makers, IT/IS managers, Department managers, and Project managers who are or will be in the market for an ERP solutionConsultants, industry analysts, software vendors, and their staff who are in some way connected with the sales of ERP, as it provides insight into the buying cycle and the \\"contortions\\" that companies go through when purchasing this type of technologyCollege and University level professors or students in Marketing, Information Systems/Technology and Project ManagementThis book is filled with all the knowledge anyone would need for preparing and successfully implementing Enterprise Resource Planning."},{"Title":"ERP: A-Z Implementer's Guide For Success","review":"This is a great introduction to the world of ERP.

The author starts with a clearly written intoduction to ERP and follows this with a detailed overview of concepts and design. The third chapter covers functional modules that need to be incorporated into ERP systems, which completes the foundation.Chapters 4 through 8 cover the implemention details, beginning with life cycles and sequences, addressing project teams and transition strategies, and the nuts and bolts considerations of data conversion, prototyping and testing. The information in these chapters is a good basis for an implementation work breakdown structure.I liked the chapters on organizational change management and consultants, which are critical success factors for implementing an ERP system. I also thought that the chapter on project planning sessions was a highlight of this book and something that anyone who is involved in managing the implementation needs to carefully read.The remainder of the book covers developing a request for proposal and evaluating vendor responses, total quality management, ROI and other factors that are extremely important to ERP (or any system) implementation project.Some of the things that make this book invaluable include: (1) clear writing and innovative use of graphics to display relationships, comparisons and workflow; (2) the fact that each chapter can stand alone as a focused and complete discussion of the topic covered, and (3) the common sense approach taken by the author.I strongly recommend that this book be augmented by Scorecard System For World Class Enterprise Resource Management by the same author.

Maxwell","review":"Based on how much I've enjoyed Neal A. Maxwell's written and spoken words over the years, I had high expectations for this book...and I was not disappointed. Bruce Hafen did an excellent job of making it an easy-to-read, yet substantive, book. Not only does it capture Maxwell's personality, but it also gives an interesting window into many monumental events in the Church over the last few decades. I recommend it to all."},{"Title":"A Disciple's Life: The Biography of Neal A. Maxwell","review":"I have heard that you become like those you spend more time with. This is a great way to, in a sense, spend time with a wonderful man. It has been a pleasure to get to know Neal A. Maxwell through this book, to see his human side, hear about his past, and see how he has grown throughout his life. It has truly made me want to be a better person. Great book, and even more, a great person to learn from and be inspired by. He truly knew his God."},{"Title":"A Disciple's Life: The Biography of Neal A. Maxwell","review":"I like Neal A. Maxwell as much as anybody, but this book has disappointed me. There are many interesting stories, good teachings and insights, but I didn't enjoy reading it at all. Hafen's grammar is sometimes quirky, and his use of quotations is often awkward. In addition, he goes off on completely unrelated tangents, telling stories, for example, about James E. Talmage playing golf. Finally, he can't tell his story in anything that resembles chronological order: he talks a bit about Neal's father's childhood, and then a bit about Neal's childhood, and then he goes back to talking about Neal's grandfather as a young man, and so forth--it's difficult to keep straight at times.Given Maxwell's own literary talent, and that Maxwell personally asked Hafen to write his biography and reviewed the entire thing--albeit near the end of his life--I found the quality of writing left much to be desired. I'll leave this on my shelf, but I'd only recommend this book to someone who had a particular, specific interest in Elder Maxwell--otherwise, I expect there are other, better written books you haven't read yet."},{"Title":"A Disciple's Life: The Biography of Neal A. Maxwell","review":"I had no idea when I bought this book how much I would truly enjoy it. Being an English major myself, I have always appreciated Elder Maxwell's ability to make every word he uses--spoken or written--part of a concentrated, multi-layered whole message. At the same time, I had no idea, really, what his life experience was, and how each aspect (including among other things his converted (to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) father to his work in the U.S. senate) has helped to mold not only his character and wordsmithing, but his spirit and discipleship. What an incredible story. What an incredible man. This book tells an often moving story of a humble life, within which can be found gentle counsel about discipleship. How this man follows his Savior, our Savior, has inspired me to work to greater depths in my own life's ministry.Savor--and enjoy!"},{"Title":"A Disciple's Life: The Biography of Neal A. Maxwell","review":"President Gordon B. Hinckley has observed that Elder Neal A. Maxwell &quot;speaks differently from any of the other General Authorities.&quot; This is a significant understatement. Probably no other latter-day saint speaker or writer of the past century has such a unique voice. Elder Maxwell's sermons and writings could never be mistaken as coming from the mouth or pen of any other person.This is a richly told life of a complex and many faceted man. Bruce Hafen's work has both breadth and depth. The book is amazingly detailed, but also contains deep insight. This will surely stand as the definitive work on Elder Maxwell's life.Some additional thoughts:1. Many readers will discover here for the first time the amazing variety of Elder Maxwell's activities. Writer, Administrator, Political Activist and Athlete -- here is surely a true Renaissance Man.2. If this biography has a theme, it is Elder Maxwell's triumph over the cancer that beset him in the mid 1990's -- a personal Odessey from which he emerged with powerful new richness and depth of thought.3. One is struck upon reading this book that Elder Maxwell's path to the leading councils of the Church is one of the most unique things about him. Aside from serving briefly as a bishop of a student ward as a fairly young man, Elder Maxwell had virtually no ecclesiastical leadership experience when in a bold and startling move he was &quot;plucked&quot;, as it were, by the First Presidency to head up a dramatically revamped LDS education system."},{"Title":"A Disciple's Life: The Biography of Neal A. Maxwell","review":"Neil Maxwell is among the most influential intellectuals of the Church of Jesus Christ (Mormon)of the 20th Century. J. Reuben Clark, Hugh Nibley, Bruce R. McConkie, and Joseph Fielding Smith all had great influence and all wrote many books but Maxwell's influence continues to expand.The author (Hafen) is himself a high Mormon authority so reader's shouldn't expect a lot of criticism. However, Hafen did include what others thought of Maxwell and some of this included criticism of subjects from Elder Maxwell's personal style to his love of alliteration and lots of big words. Overall, this book is not a fulsome litany of praise, but a balanced, serious, and scholarly summary of Maxwell's life.My major criticism of the book was that it flowed more slowly than I would have liked. The recent biography of Nibley flowed more smoothly and made the reader able to concentrate more on the subject matter than the manner of telling the story. I would also have like to see more about Maxwell's expectations for the future. Hafen documents the insight of Maxwell that was ahead of his time in so many areas.What does that insight say about future challenges to the Church of Jesus Christ? What about English language and America being less of an influence in the church now that Spanish is the most common language of the Church and most Mormons now live outside the US? What about education in the future now that public schools no longer maintain &quot;an acceptable moral and educational climate&quot;?However, these minor criticisms do not compare to the strengths of this book in detailing Maxwell's life and thoughts. There is plenty of meat in this book and I made a several page list of Maxwell quotes as I read this book. This book is so superior to books like the biography of J. Reuben Clark by an apostate historian who included lots of little digs at Clark in the name of &quot;fairness&quot; but completely missed the grandeur and depth of the subject.Overall, the second best Mormon book I've read this year. (Nibley's biography would be first)"},{"Title":"A Disciple's Life: The Biography of Neal A. Maxwell","review":"This book is not only the biography of one of God's true Disciples in the latter-days, it is also the story of a successful son, husband, and father who loves to learn. The biography begins with the inspiring account of Neal's battle with cancer in the past five years, then backtracks to his days in the service and his experiences in Okinawa, to his beginning days in Washington D.C., and his administrative years at the University of Utah. Towards the conclusion of the book, the author mentions Neal's love of words and his remarkable writing ability. I am LDS (Mormon), but I recommend this book to everyone. Neal is truly a renaissance man and can be an inspiration to us all. He truly is a Disciple of Christ."},{"Title":"A Disciple's Life: The Biography of Neal A. Maxwell","review":"I loved this book. It is not a glossed over version of the life of an LDS apostle but it gives a wonderful all around view of Elder Maxwell.

I highly recommend this book for the person who wants to know about the life of Neal A. Maxwell."},{"Title":"A Disciple's Life: The Biography of Neal A. Maxwell","review":"Ironic that a man so incredibly unique and unquestionably authentic is probably viewed by much of the world as a quaint Christian blindly following the religious crowd. We learn from Neal A. Maxwell, however, that many ironies will ultimately be realized by humanity, such as the beautiful truth that the meek followers of Christ who submit to God's will can experience the greatest peace and joy in this life and will eventually receive \\"all that God hath.\\"Elder Maxwell's struggles with, for example, impatience and \\"not suffering fools\\" provides useful context for his personal path of discipleship and offers hope to individuals who are beset by weaknesses and failings impeding their own walk of faith. People can change. Positive character traits that are not innate can be developed through concerted effort and, most importantly, reliance on the Lord.The narrative is so fluid that potentially dry topics such as the Church's Correlation Department (which Elder Maxwell was instrumental in guiding) were actually quite fascinating to read about. Anyone that has an interest in 20th century developments within The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the role played by one of the Church's foremost orators, mediators and examples of true discipleship should read this biography."},{"Title":"A Disciple's Life: The Biography of Neal A. Maxwell","review":"Neal Maxwell was a leader in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. This biography was written with the cooperation of Maxwell, his family, and his fellow church leaders. It begins with sketches of his parents' lives and finishes near the ending of his own life. Although it includes Maxwell's ideas about suffering, discipleship, and the use of language, it does not deal extensively with philosophical and ecclesiastical matters explored in his own numerous publications. It is the story of his life.Maxwell's parents provided regular exposure to religious ideas, writings, and leaders. Young Neal did not always have a taste for church meetings, however--a weakness he overcame. From military service in the Pacific during World War II, he learned to find strength from prayer and to lead older and more experienced soldiers. His leadership development continued into his Canadian missionary years. We also learn about his marriage and experiences as a college student. One theme emerged in his studies that would remain strong throughout his career--the thoughtful integration of \\"sacred and secular\\" perspectives.After college graduation, Maxwell worked as a senator's aide and contemplated a career in the nation's capitol. But his strong identity as a \\"Utah man\\" convinced him to return to his home state. Maxwell then worked at the University of Utah, as Dean of Students and as a university vice president. He then made the shift to the white shirt and tie culture of the LDS Church, holding positions such as Commissioner of the Church Education System. Building upon his experience as a church employee, Neal Maxwell was called to become one of the General Authorities of the Church. Since then his distinctive styles of writing and speech--particularly his playful and periodically painful alliterations--have become widely known.This biography includes inspiring achievements, glimpses of church leaders' personalities, and amusing anecdotes. Everything pretty much expected from a biography one church leader writes about another. To the author's--and subject's--credit, it also candidly addresses some personal faults. By many accounts Maxwell's intelligence was coupled with an impatience for those who thought or acted more sedately. His preference for structured dinner discussions wasn't to everyone's liking--causing one friend to ask why he couldn't just let his guests enjoy spontaneous conversation. And his love of language sometimes became obsessive, as he spent hours crafting the ideal phrase for an article or talk.Hafen also captures the good-natured meekness of a man who recognized his faults, strove mightily to conquer them, and laughed about his imperfections. Hafen notes of his writing: \\"Stylistically, he has gradually tamed the ornamentation that some of his friends once thought was simply too much.\\" Maxwell himself is more direct about all-too-frequent alliterations: \\"I'm down to two packs a day.\\"The book is worth reading for its perspective on the life and career of a man determined to learn hard lessons and use this experience to serve others. There are also instructive accounts of how LDS general authorities seek inspiration and consensus, share responsibilities and burdens, and mentor less experienced colleagues. Readers can decide whether Bruce Hafen's biography matches Neal Maxwell's own standards: \\"We must be careful . . . not to canonize [our role] models as we have some pioneers and past Church leaders not to dry all the human sweat off them, not to put ceaseless smiles on their faces, when they really struggled and experienced agony.\\""},{"Title":"A Disciple's Life: The Biography of Neal A. Maxwell","review":"I read this book at the same time as a friend, and then we would discuss each chapter every other day. It was great. It kept my interest from day to day and strengthend my testimony of the way God prepares us for future events and callings. Elder Hafen writes very well. Elder Maxwell's life is worth studying regardless of who writes about him, so this book was a bonus!"},{"Title":"How to Be a Yogi","review":"This 1940 book influenced the life of Yogi Berra, perhaps the greatest baseball managers ever. Read this book, it will change your life, like it did his!"},{"Title":"How to Be a Yogi","review":"Yoga is interconnected with the Hindu religion and and philosophy, and a Yogi is a person who practices that. These are lectures Swami Abhedananda (1866- 1939) gave in America. The chapters are: (1) Introductory (2) What is Yoga (3) Hatha Yoga (4) Raja Yoga (5) Karma Yoga (6) Bhakti Yoga (7) Jnana Yoga (8) Science of Breathing and (9) Was Christ a Yogi.A major theme that runs through the author's writings and lectures is that knowledge, whether it is science, philosophy or psychology, has to have utility and must be practical otherwise they are useless. Yoga then has to be studied, learned and practised. Keen students should read the Swami's Yoga Psychology and True Psychology. Both are more technical than those lectures of his famous brother monk Swami Vivekananda (1863- 1902). Swami Abhedananda came to America at his request and met many of the famous western intellectuals of that day, Max Mueller, such as Paul Deussen, and William James."},{"Title":"The Sherbrooke Twins (Bride Series)","review":"This is mediocre at best. I have read many works of Coulter's, and this simply is not among her greater novels. The back plot detracted from the love story of James and Corrie, and I never got a sense for why Jason loved Judith. I admit, the ending was very nice and sad, but it was too obvious a set up for a sequel. I'll read the sequel, of course, because I think Jason will prove to be the more compelling twin now that his heart has been broken already. My only disappointment is that James and Jessie Wyndham are going to be involved, apparently, and I hated the Valentine Legacy with a passion. Ugh. I just don't like those Wyndhams. Especially the Duchess. I could have sworn I'd scream if I read the word &quot;ditty&quot; one more time. Hopefully they won't figure too much into the novel. I guess my biggest complaint is that I wish I could have seen more of the romance developing and a more coherent back story. It was easy enough to see there was something shady about a certain handful of characters that I won't name so as to not spoil the novel for others, but it just left me flat. This was no Sherbrooke Bride or Scottish Bride. It was nice to see Alex and Douglas still happy together--but I still believe they would have booted that old woman out of the house much sooner than that. This novel was a nice attempt and a decent way to kill some time on an airplane, but little more than that. I wanted more of the twins than what I had received."},{"Title":"The Sherbrooke Twins (Bride Series)","review":"Coulter's recent historical romances have been pretty half-hearted, when compared to her \\"classics,\\" but this was a true low point.This book, in short, has the flaws of her other work without any of the charms. These flaws include the strange, stilted dialogue which she seems to feel is endlessly witty (curses using animal parts, characters \\"hitting each other over the head\\" with zingers or suggestive asides, male characters insulting female characters' intelligence based on their \\"womens' parts,\\" etc.) as well as the strange tendency towards sexual violence that Coulter has always been drawn to. Many of her erotic scenes over the years have been, effectively, rapes and the love scene in Sherbrooke Twins is no exception. While a little excess passion once in a while can be interesting, a lot starts looking kind of dark and unhealthy. Why does Coulter think her reader wants her heroes to turn every wedding night into a scary, sticky, sore, demeaning experience for her heroines? It's 2004-- it's okay for female characters, even regency females, to enjoy sex right off the bat now! They don't have to get through a gauntlet of pain and humiliation first. They don't have to get abused by hubby just so we can feel bad for them and then revel with them in hubby's guilty and sincere apology (and his generous peace offering of belated foreplay and tender lovin'). I just don't find that all that sexy time after time. In fact, I find it a little medieval and mysogynistic. Paging Dr. Freud!You'll also find some overused Coulter phrases in this one, such as the infamous \\"fat as a stoat.\\" Catherine, a stoat is a weasel. A weasel is a relatively thin animal. Why must you use this expression in every novel? Why the constant comparisons to animals in general? And I have to say, though cat racing is cute, and I love cats, why bring it up in every, single book-- even when there is no actual cat racing of any kind taking place?Finally there is the problem that this book feels like both the Sherbrooke family annual Christmas letter \\"Dahling made a 1480 on her SAT's and Ryder got a big promotion at work!...\\" and an infomercial for the next book-- we're hardly interested in the characters of James and Corrie because they're fairly one-dimensional and we learn relatively little about them due to the fact that we're too busy wondering about Jason and worrying about our old friend Douglas. (And as it turns out, had Douglas ever had the opportunity to read any other Coulter regency, he could have figured out preeetty quickly who the \\"mole\\" in his household was-- to call the \\"twist\\" in this book unoriginal is no stretch.) That may, in fact, be the crux of the problem: the central crises in The Sherbrooke Twins have much more to do with the secondary characters than the primary ones. James and Corrie could have done with their own personal crisis to overcome, instead of an inherited one. We're a little more curious about Jason and his entirely-new dilemma than Corrie's/James' hand-me-down drama, and maybe I'm cynical but it seems like that's how Coulter meant it to be.Because of the very leading ending, it seems pretty obvious that we'll be seeing the twins again soon. Maybe we'll actually get to know them (and Coriander) in the next novel, which will be less a sequel to this novel than a tardy conclusion, but I'm not going to rush to buy the book and find out."},{"Title":"The Sherbrooke Twins (Bride Series)","review":"I suspect that Coulter's next book will be simply spectacular. Indeed, when it comes out, I may even find myself glad to have read this book, as it seems mainly to consist in providing backstory for what comes next. In the meantime however, I am sadly disappointed. Coulter had the makings of a real winner here, but between bringing us up to date on the last generation of Sherbrookes and setting up one of the youngsters for a story of his own, the love story of James and Corrie as well as the developing relationship between Jason and Judith, is left with very little substance. I have to give Coulter credit, for the denoument of the mystery subplot takes one by complete surprise, and the interplay between Corrie and James, what there is of it, is charming and amusing. These together almost make the book worth a read. Almost that is. . . but not quite."},{"Title":"The Sherbrooke Twins (Bride Series)","review":"I am a long time fan of Ms Coulter's all the way back to her early medieval novels. One of my favorite novels is the Sherbrook Bride and I am not a fan of her FBI thrillers so I was excited to see her revisit the Sherbrooks. The first part of the novel I found myself totally getting confused as to the point of conversations and who was speaking. Ms Coulter has a talent for writing whitty conversations but this was over the top. An example of taking a good thing way too far. Every character seemed to have to throw a whitty remark into every sentence it quickly got confusing and annoying. The story is mildly interesting and has it's moments but obviously a set up for that $20+ hard cover novel about the second twin."},{"Title":"The Sherbrooke Twins (Bride Series)","review":"I genuinely enjoyed the story of Alexandra and Douglas Sherbrooke's stormy relationship, and how the finally settled into a decent couple. So it came as a complete shock to find that the qualities that drew me to them (their tempestuousness, spark and vigor) were completely devoid in this novel. Their children were equally as tepid; the only calling cards were their handsome good looks, which we were constantly reminded of. For every good Coulter book, there is an equally bad selection, and unfortunately this is one of the bad ones. On the plus side, it does set up the potential for a good Coulter book to come next."},{"Title":"The Sherbrooke Twins (Bride Series)","review":"I'm mad that Catherine Coulter actually put such a weak novel together.Don't waste your money buying it or waste your time borrowing it from anyone."},{"Title":"The Sherbrooke Twins (Bride Series)","review":"I couldn't believe how much I disliked this book. I gave it two stars just because Coulter is such a usually fine author. However, she missed the boat on this one. I read about 100 pages (or less) at the beginning and maybe about 30 pages at the end just to get my money's worth."},{"Title":"The Sherbrooke Twins (Bride Series)","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book when I first learned it was coming out. Then after reading some of the reviews, I was nervous. Some of CC's book lately haven't really appealed to me and I was afraid that she would ruin a story about a family that I absolutely loved. However, this is not the case. I enjoyed the story and I loved learning about Alex and Douglas. There could have been more story between James and Corrie, but I still felt there was enough to see their connection. I have to say that my only gripe (if you can call it one) is that the title shouldn't have been &quot;The Sherbrook Twins&quot; since it was mainly James' story. At least, there better be a future book about Jason. CC wouldn't leave us hanging, would she? Anyway, you will not be sorry if you buy this book. My heart broke for Jason at the end, not only for his loss, but also for the coming separation of him and James. I hope we don't have to wait a year for the next book."},{"Title":"The Sherbrooke Twins (Bride Series)","review":"I thought it was pretty good - not as good as the original Sherbrooke Series. There were some really funny parts with the Cinnamon Bread that had me laughing out loud but I saw another reviewer say they thought this was a filler book for the next book which will probably be about Jason the younger twin. I think she is right.I was left thinking that Catherine wasn't really into writing this book.I agree with other reviewers too that poor James and Corrie's story could have been amazing but was just boring since they were basically part of a filler story. I would have much rather had the story without all the other junk put in there; At least with more of James and Corrie's thoughts. There was no thoughts from either of them for example James struggling with his new found attraction for Corrie or vice versa. It was like oh we need to get married - okay. I felt really cheated by that - and I know Catherine has it in her to write amazing books with great characters! I just felt that she made James and Corrie 2 dimensional and boring because she wanted to use the book to build up to Jason's story.The sex was so glossed over too - first off there was no sexual tension - no even with the first kiss - for either twin and their beloveds in the books. And I know Catherine can write better love scenes. Once again I just think this was a book to fill people in on what was going on to start the next generation of Sherbrooke stories - and poor James and Corrie's characters were the sacrificial lambs -with a shabby love story - that could have been amazing!Of course I will read the next one though - because I think it will be much better.I also hope that Devlin gets his own story too!"},{"Title":"The Sherbrooke Twins (Bride Series)","review":"Let me start by saying that it was a challenge to keep reading this book. The first half was just awful but the second half made for an easier read. The main characters made me feel as if I was reading a teen novel. The twins especially James came across as a nineteen year old and Connie well, she acted like a spoiled twelve year old tomboy who never matured into a woman mentally. James practically raised her, really raised her and taught her about her body. The girl dogged his heals thirteen years to the point where he found her pathetic and childish. The girl was obsessed with James. It seemed like they only got together because they were compromised and they were comfortable with each other. It was remarked upon on several different occasions they were like brother and sister and how weird it might be on there wedding night. The whole romance to me was incestuous. As for James and Jason at age twenty-five, living at home with there parents instead of having there own place and becoming independent men. What was that about? Maybe if they had moved away and came back five or more years later and saw the girl who'd become a woman it would have been different. I agree that this by far the worst Catherine Coulter book I've read."},{"Title":"The Sherbrooke Twins (Bride Series)","review":"I've only listened through the 3rd CD and I can't seem to get into the story. I don't know yet if its the story line or Ms. Flosnik's grating voice. But her voice interpretation for James, Jason and Douglas (and all the men) make them sound ridiculous. Ms. Flosnik (as well as all female readers) should not try to sound like men -- just read it straight. I think I'd rather read this one. I don't recommend the sound recording."},{"Title":"The Sherbrooke Twins (Bride Series)","review":"This book was so boring. I was very, very disappointed. The relationship between the twin (what's his name) and Corrie seemed almost incestuous. She was more like a kid sister to them. I never, ever saw the relationship and the passion grow or ignite between these two. Waste of time. Catherine Coulter played her readers with this mess. She could have had more respect for us than to put this book out there."},{"Title":"The Sherbrooke Twins (Bride Series)","review":"Very cute book. I've been looking forward to the Sherbrooke twins' story and Ms. Coulter does not disappoint. She does a lovely job of breaking the romance rules while keeping the story light, sweet, funny, and satisfying. CANNOT wait until the next one. Within the limitiations of the genre, this is one of the better romances I have read."},{"Title":"The Sherbrooke Twins (Bride Series)","review":"Another great book by Catherine Coulter.

I loved earlier regency books by the author, but \\"The Sherbooke Twins\\" did very little for me."},{"Title":"The Sherbrooke Twins (Bride Series)","review":"After just finishing the book, I have to say I liked it, but am deeply confused. The title led me to believe it would be about the Sherbrooke Twins, when in fact it seemed to be more about their father and mother. The wording at times seemed confusing and the plot a little jumpy. But I did enjoy it once the plot got rolling. I can't wait to find out what happens with Jason."},{"Title":"The Sherbrooke Twins (Bride Series)","review":"I happen to be a twin...I love Catherine Coulter books...so I just had to get it.For me, it grabed me from the start, and while many may not find it to be a good read, I find it very difficult to find romance novels that I like. I know that Catherince has never disappointed me, and she did not here either. I could relate to the main characters as a twin myself, and I think Catherine got down what it is like to be a twin rather well.I would recomend this to anyone that is an historical romance fan."},{"Title":"The Sherbrooke Twins (Bride Series)","review":"This is the story of James and Jason Sherbrooke, loving twin sons of Alexandra/Douglas book. They are too beautiful by far ...and the reader certainly tires of hearing over and over how beautiful they are...and are steering clear of the marriage trap. Suddenly they are involved in protecting their father from an assassin and everyone joins together to this goal. The story line is weak and for some reason the characters never really come alive. They're \\"nice guys\\" and a nice family but the characters never grab you. The writing is very stiff and what little romance is in this isn't very inspiring. Certainly the 2 sex scenes are not impressive. Basically, don't bother with this one. In fact I think I'll be slower to pick out CC's bks in the future."},{"Title":"The Sherbrooke Twins (Bride Series)","review":"Like many readers, I have been a fan of Coulter's work for many years. I anticipated the lastest historical romance installment. This book was worth the wait. I loved the look at the previous Sherbooke characters (i.e. I found Tyson Sherbrooks's take of the Virgin Bride fascinating).I stayed up all night reading this gem. While the mystery was engrossing and the romance between Corrie and James sweet; it was the story of Jason and Judith I found to be the most powerful. It raises a lot of moral questions (what is love, how does one know if it is love or lust, how does a person deal with depression, etc).This reader is awaiting the next installment of the Sherbrooke saga. I want to see more of Jason, as well as find out more about the smuggler. I wouldn't mind hearing more about Jessie and James Wyndam either."},{"Title":"The Sherbrooke Twins (Bride Series)","review":"These books are not a bad way to pass the time.

This book was a failure. Everything was drawn out. Things that could have been explained or written in a few words were drawn out for pages and pages. Ms. Coulter tried too hard. There was no natural flow that she is know for. I couldn't even finish it. I never thought I would say that about a Coulter book. I guess everyone has their moments. I am still a fan and this book was written years ago. I am sure she got an earful already."},{"Title":"The Sherbrooke Twins (Bride Series)","review":"There is not much danger to Corriander (Corrie), the love interest of the first-born twin. And not much show of possessiveness, jealousy, nor romance between the two. No sign of pain nor struggle when apart. Just a flat \\"love\\" story. And surprisingly, how it is titled, the Sherbrooke Twins, would suggest to readers that both the twins would find love. Unfortunately, only one does and its James. I think the author started out wrong with naming it the Sherbrooke twins and should have a book title more fitting for James and Corrie's story and not get too focused on the part of the sons being twins."},{"Title":"The Sherbrooke Twins (Bride Series)","review":"Well, I read it. Hated Corrie. Sure, she was brave--or maybe just plain foolhardy and reckless! James was rather flat and boring. Oh, yeah, he's handsome, that's all that matters, right? No character development necessary if the hero's handsome. Corrie was too cheeky, rather annoying most of the time. And the whole scene at the beginning with the hero spanking the heroine was a little scary. I understand why he did it, I wanted to slap her myself, but come on, the hero is supposed to sweep me off my feet, not make me step back with fear and loathing. Could have been a great read, but it was . . . tedious. I love CC and usually buy anything she writes in the historical genre. This one, however, I had to force myself to finish. Gave up caring about Corrie and James halfway through, skimmed alot and just stuck with it to find out about the murder mystery. I'd skip this one. The writing was trite, the dialogue confusing. I had to re-read the character tags just to figure out who was speaking at times, because after a while they all sounded alike, no distinctive voice. The men were just as chatty as the women, and it seemed like everyone just blurted out whatever idiotic thought happened to be in their head at the moment, no impulse control. I was thoroughly, and utterly disappointed that it took Douglas that long to stick up for his wife and demand that his mother show her respect. 27 years! Douglas, Douglas, you disappoint me sorely."},{"Title":"The Sherbrooke Twins (Bride Series)","review":"I don't know if it's because Coulter prefers to write FBI Thrillers...but it seems that the recent historicals that she has released are lacking. By the way...wasn't Alex pregnant during the Heiress Bride? What happened to that baby? Maybe I missed it, but this book made it seem that Jason and James were the only children Douglas and Alex had.This is a book that was supposed to be about the devastatingly handsome twins James and Jason. Also in this book is Corrie, your typical tomboy (rather than girl) next door. It's important to note that Corrie is like an obnoxious little sister to James. Also in the story are Alex, Douglas, and the Virgin Bride.THE PLOT: Someone is trying to kill Douglas, and the twins are trying to figure out who it is. If you read the Sherbrooke Bride, then you will remember the character of Georges Cadoudal. It is believed that his children are trying to kill Douglas. Anyway, James gets kidnapped and Corrie saves him. Corrie becomes compromised and James has to convince Corrie to marry him. (There were parts of this book that reminded me of The Valentine Legacy) Meanwhile, Jason is falling in love with a Judith McCrae. The ending has a \\"twist\\" but readers may figure some of it out on their own. Coulter focuses on so many different characters that at times it is hard to distinguish who are supposed to be the protagonists in this book.Personally, I loved the beginning of this book...well sort of. I really liked Corrie's character. I thought that she was sassy and fearless. I liked the banter between James and Corrie but it never really got out of the brother/sister phase in my opinion. I felt like there was so much potential for a great love story between these two. To be fair, Coulter did drop hints within the book that Corrie is in love with James (she's jealous of girls that like James & she changes the things about herself that he criticizes). James needed more depth and while he loved Corrie, I felt like he never really fell IN LOVE with Corrie and really the same could be said of Corrie. This was the primary/only romance in the story. The relationship between Jason and Judith was boring and secondary and I really didn't like how Jason's part of the story unfolded. Every time, Coulter began focusing on these two...I skipped a few pages.The problems that I had with this book include the lack of romance between Corrie and James (I'm not talking about love scenes...although there weren't many of those either). There was no building up to the two characters falling in love. We don't even learn that they really love each other until the last paragraph and it felt like it came out of nowhere. That last few paragraphs were awkward and uncomfortable in my opinion. Afterwards I thought, \\"That's it?\\" Another issue that I had with the story is the problem that Coulter selected the characters to face. The fact that it involved Douglas and Alex caused the story to stray away from James and Corrie which is probably why the characters weren't really fleshed out. Also, there were waaay too many bad guys/gals and what was up with that one smuggler who tried hurting Corey and James? When do we find out who that is?***My biggest problem with this book is that I felt like Coulter was so busy trying to write a book that had a crazy twist in it that she left out all of the romance.***Unless you're an avid Coulter fan, I suggest you borrow or check this book out at the library before shelling out the $7.99 it costs to buy it."},{"Title":"The Sherbrooke Twins (Bride Series)","review":"This is another example of a \\"family\\" of romance novels, one I got sucked into long ago. So, when I saw the latest book I just had to buy it.

All in all, a pleasant way to spend a Sunday afternoon!"},{"Title":"The Sherbrooke Twins (Bride Series)","review":"I have read all of her romance novels and have to say this is not her best. It is good in parts but others aren't worth reading.

Too many storylines for such a short book. If Ms. Coulter wanted this to be an good book she would have been better off spending more time developing the relationships between the characters. Corrie is the only character that was adequately developed (note adequately development is just that merely adequately) You dont get the opportunity to feel the stresses and the emotions b/c you dont really understand the characters. Granted this is a mere romance novel and one shouldnt expect much. But this is definitly the worst book I've ever read. I felt more emotion out of the stoic Edward Wilson in the Movie \\"The Good Shepard\\" Fortunately \\"Jason\\" was developed a little more towards the end to allow \\"Lyons Gate\\" to be a potentially decent Romance nove.

About three-quarters of the way through the book, There she was! I knew Ms. Coulter would show her head and writing expertise! The last quarter of the book, woohoo. That's what I was expecting.

However, when I picked this up I expected to reading about Jason and James and their respective ladies.Unfortunately the story between James and his annoying neighbor, Corrie is left as a backburner while the plot against Douglas takes front seat. IT is so annoying!! I already read the Sherbrook Bride! I know that they end up happinly ever after! I dont need to know that they have a love life 27 years after they've married all I wanted to know was how James and COrrie come to fall in love. The middle part of the book is great Ms. Coulter picks up steam after a hum-hum beginning and the action that occurs in the middle is great, I won't spoil it for you but let's just say that Corrie and James were in for the ride of their lives. But then once again Douglas and Alex step in an act as overly affectionate parents towards their children, it made me want to step in and tell them to BUG OFF!!All in all I think that Corrie and James story couldve been something great (even if their story sounded a bit too much like THe Valentine legacy storyline) but with the constant remnicsing of the past by Alex and Douglas their story wasnt fully able to stand on its own without being overshadowed by the parents.I know I whined quite a bit about the story but I cannot wait til next year whenever Jason's story is released (it just has to!). Hopefully Ms. Coulter will write a novel about the mysterious &quot;vampire&quot; Devlin as well.

Corrie dresses like a boy as she wildly rides throughout the countryside. James' parents decide that Corrie needs a season and his dad Douglas will select the wardrobe her.When James sees Corrie in a dress he first needs to recover from the shock that she has breasts before he can catch his breath as she is beautiful. Meanwhile Jason races home after a visit from the Virgin Ghost that warns him that his beloved parents are in trouble, which proves prophetic when someone shoots their father. As they try to keep dear old dad safe, James falls in love with Corrie who loves him back and Jason falls in love with Judith McCrae who he met at a gala. However, the family remains unsafe as someone wants Douglas dead and the plan is a perfect snake in Eden scheme.This is an exciting late Regency romance starring two fabulous antagonists who turn into loving protagonists though his early on spanking of her seems inappropriate. The story line starts off like a typical sub-genre entry, but turns into a terse suspense once the first attack occurs and goes even tauter when treachery places the family and Corrie in danger. Catherine Coulter has provided a wonderful tale that hopefully will lead to a fabulous sequel.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Sherbrooke Twins (Bride Series)","review":"I have always enjoyed the Sherbrooke stories, but I couldn't stop thinking about the fact that in Sinjin's story Alex was definitely pregnant - and the twins James and Jason had already been born.

Her conversion story (covered partially in her introduction - pages 17-20) is a beautiful example of God's sovereign grace.The term \\"Historical Criticism\\" is really only defined by the translator - page 7. This may be because Historical Criticism is a more well-known term in the German. It does not seem to be the same as \\"the Historical-Critical Method\\" which Edgar Krentz writes about in the Fortress Press offering in the \\"Guides to Biblical Scholarship\\" series. Rather, it includes all the higher criticisms, such as form and redactional criticism. Textual criticism is an example of lower criticism, which, used honestly and properly, glorifies God because it is aimed at ascertaining what the text of the original languages actually says, rather than dodging the commands of a holy God. Good introductions to Textual Criticism are Clayton Harrop's \\"History of the New Testament in Plain Language\\" and D.A. Carson's \\"The King James Version Debate\\". The latter is not simply a polemic against the KJV, it is also a very helpful primer on textual criticism. For those who want to get more serious (or who have slightly deeper pockets), Bruce Metzger's \\"A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament\\" is indispensable.There are three reasons why I was lead to this book:1) It is in the \\"For Further Reading\\" section of \\"Theological Liberalism: A Handful of Pebbles\\" by Peter Barnes (along with Machen's \\"Christianity and Liberalism\\", Murray's \\"Evangelicalism Divided\\" and Shaeffer's \\"The Great Evangelical Disaster\\". After having read Barnes' excellent book on theological liberalism I decided to work my way through his whole \\"For Further Reading\\" section.2) I enjoyed, Linnemann's \\"Is there a Synoptic Problem?\\", which is also translated by Yarbrough.3) The overall importance and urgency of the subject matter that Linnemann covers.I thought that the rather lengthy proposal for evangelical learning centres should have been in the latter part of the book, rather than the former. But this is a minor gripe, and the book thoroughly deserves 5 stars."},{"Title":"Historical Criticism of the Bible","review":"Eta Linnemann studied under Germany's elite biblical scholars--Rudolph Bultmann and Ernst Fuchs, Friedrich Gogarten and Gerhard Ebeling. She passed the exacting hurdles which grant entrance into academia, ultimately becoming an professor of New Testament at Philipps University in Marburg. Along the way she published books and articles espousing the \\"historical-critical\\" methodology she'd been taught. In Historical Criticism of the Bible: Methodology or Ideology? (Grand Rapids: Baker Book House, c. 1990), she announces her repudiation of that methodology--which she now insists is an atheistic ideology or \\"theology\\"--and sorrows for the damage it's done to the Church of Jesus Christ.She also laments the young people historical criticism has harmed: \\"We have put generation after generation of believing Christian young people, who were willing and eager to serve God, through this fire, sacrificing them to the Moloch of an atheistic theology. The result has been generation after generation of misguided guides\\" (p. 117). In her introduction, which reads much like an impassioned manifesto, Linnemann declares: \\"My 'No!' to the historical theology stems from my 'Yes!' to my wonderful Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and to the glorious redemption he accomplished for me on Golgotha\\" (p. 17). Furthermore, \\"on the basis of various observations, discoveries, and a resulting self-awareness, I was forced to conclude two things I did not wish: (1) no 'truth' could emerge from this 'scientific work on the biblical text' and (2) such labor does not serve the proclamation of the gospel\\" (p. 17).On a personal level, her lifelong immersion in biblical studies, following the \\"historical-critical methodology,\\" resulted in a \\"profound disillusionment\\" which led her into a variety of \\"addictions\\" (TV and alcohol). Graciously, God brought some believers into her life who cared for her, prayed with her, and helped her find the living Lord. In time, \\"By God's grace and love I entrusted my life to Jesus\\" (p. 18). That surrender resulted in a deliverance from her addictions and an entrance into the life she'd long longed for. It was as if she emerged from the fog into the sunshine. \\"I was able to recognize sin clearly as sin rather than merely make excuses for it as was my previous habit. I can still remember the delicious joy I felt when for the first time black was once more black and white was once more white; the two ceased to pool together as indistinguishable gray\\" (p. 18).Concurrently she discovered the integrity and supernatural inspiration of God's Word--\\"I recognized, first mentally, but then in a vital, experiential way, that Holy Scripture is inspired\\" (p. 20). Quite a revelation for a German university New Testament professor! Eyes opened by miracles taking place even today, her \\"scientific\\" biases against biblical miracles quickly dissolved. She also found Christ's atoning work for sin on Calvary freed her from her own sins. In view of all this, \\"That is why I say 'No!' to the historical-critical theology: I regard everything that I taught and wrote before I entrusted my life to Jesus as refuse\\" (p. 20). She has tossed into the trash, with the emotional zeal of a new convert, all the books and articles she earlier wrote--and she urges all who have them on their shelves to do likewise! She turned her life over to God's guidance and went to teach in a Bible college in Indonesia, hoping her biblical studies could contribute to spreading the Faith and furthering Christ's Kingdom.In the first chapter, she evaluates the modern university and its impact on biblical studies. In her judgment, universities since the Enlightenment have been atheistic in their assumptions and pagan in their functions. Thus any education which hopes to be truly Christian \\"can be established only by conscious dissociation from the modern European university and its history\\" (p. 49). That dissociation must be radical! Simply gathering Christian teachers and students together will not suffice. Beginning classes with prayer may be pius, but not efficacious. \\"The content of the activities must be fundamentally transformed from the ground up. Entire areas of intellectual inquiry must be grounded in God's Word\\" (p. 49). The Bible must be brought to the heart of every academic discipline. She writes as an advocate, it would seem, of Bible colleges--or at least Christian colleges completely suffused with Scripture.For only the Bible is forever relevant to man's endeavors. In a profound sense, Linnemann takes Luther's adamant sola scriptura principle with utter seriousness. In fact, the Bible is more \\"modern\\" than the illusions which were judged \\"up-to-date\\" two decades ago! The \\"modern man\\" of the French Revolution, worshipping the goddess Reason, seems curiously antiquated compared with father Abraham! For Linnemann it's back to the Bible if we're to deal with what's to come.Having critiqued the university scene, she then discusses, in Part Two, \\"God's Word and Historical-Critical Theology.\\" Here she insists that biblical scholars, seeking to be respectable and \\"scientific,\\" have deserted their true calling. \\"The Bible is no longer esteemed as God's word in the way it is handled. It is taken for granted that the words of the Bible and God's words are not identical\\" (p. 83). \\"Using grotesque literary methods\\" which would be shoveled aside in other disciplines, university researchers capriciously label \\"inauthentic\\" (i.e. non-Pauline) such canonical books as the pastoral letters, Ephesians and Colossians or dismember the Pentateuch with variations on Wellhausen's scheme.At the heart of this endeavor, lies a \\"faith in theology,\\" a \\"fundamental presupposition\\" which dictates all that follows: \\"that the final authority regarding what is true is the trained, professionally informed, regimented critical intellect. That is, holy Scripture is subordinated to reason\\" (p. 107). Such a presupposition clearly leaves God the Holy Spirit, both as inspirer and interpreter of the text, out of the inquiry. So it's time we call it what it is: \\"Historical-critical theology is heresy\\" (p. 124). Though usually guarded and gracious regarding individuals, lamenting rather than lambasting their errors, Linnemann leaves no doubt that she considers her former mentor, Rudolph Bultmann, utterly heretical!What Linnemann urges is a \\"theology of faith\\" rather than a \\"faith in theology.\\" Only when we're surrendered to the Word of God, open to its truth, submissive to its instructions, can we rightly read it. Consequently, \\"Questions are solved on one's knees, not through ransacking commentaries\\" (p. 112). Certainly it helps to study carefully, to master the original languages, etc. but a \\"theologian does not, by virtue of his academic study, occupy the judge's bench. God does\\" (p. 113).For her, Scripture is verbally (though not mechanically) inspired, inerrant \\"not only in the area of faith and life but also in all other areas\\" (p. 147). How interesting to find a onetime \\"higher critic\\" ending up a virtual Fundamentalist!"},{"Title":"Historical Criticism of the Bible","review":"Etta is a brilliant scholar, but she writes so the average reader can understand her point.

That's why I bought it, really...there is a lot of down time in the story, but the battles are intense and you get the sense of what it's like to be a soldier waiting for the bureacracy to OK his every move. I had thought that special forces today had the ability to act without the command BS that bogged down Vietnam, guess I was wrong. Also, the Wedding Party massacre was incredible reading - the soldiers basically refute that it was just some gunfire in the air that attracted the airstrikes that killed the civilians in that infamous incident. Also, it was depressing to read about all the Mullahs they caught and were told to let go by the chain of command, including that one Mullah who, from a safe hideout in Pakistan instead of in US custody, recently said bin Laden was in good health. Overall a good read, and when it was slow it was still interesting to read about how the soldiers survive every day in the heat, dust, and fighting in Afghanistan. Anyone interested in the war there or special forces I think will like this book. A special bonus that I did not learn until I got the book home - on the reverse side of the jacket is a military map of the operation zone in Afghanistan, it's excellent for this book but I also use it to follow battles and movements I hear about in the news."},{"Title":"Hunting al Qaeda: A Take-No-Prisoners Account of Terror, Adventure, and Disillusionment","review":"This is a \\"hands-on\\", first person account of the courage, tenacity, and valor of America's Special Forces, in this case, drawn from our citizen-soldiers, the Reserves/National Guard. It personalizes and damns the way the military hierachy [REMFs] has impersonally and dangerously blunted the effectiveness of its most effective fighting forces against today's unconventional opponents for their own personal career gains. It is an excellent companion book for \\"Not A Good Day To Die\\", by Sean Naylor, which presents the same problem from a slightly different perspective. It is criminal that the military hierachy is allowed to spend enormous amounts of time and money to recruit, train, motivate, and deploy the best our nation has to offer, and then burden them with administrative, make-work assignments; micromanage their field operations; and try to smother their initiative and effectiveness. What is needed is for the military, all services, to shift field decision responsibility down to most the most effective common demoninator - the platoon/squad leader on the ground in the enemy, and do it immediately!"},{"Title":"Hunting al Qaeda: A Take-No-Prisoners Account of Terror, Adventure, and Disillusionment","review":"...but it is a good read for war junkies who like to know the nuances of modern day combat. This book has a very hard start and tends to vilify why the army recruits 18 year old soldiers who have not formulated strong opinions about the military.If you wish to gain insights into the minds of a more aged reservist being call-up for war in the Gulf, then this would be of interest to you. It also does a good job of pointing out the inefficiencies of the military and our war doctrine to date. The author's indictments of the military are timely yet are not unique in whole or in part over the past century of warfare.One could become dismayed over the lack of military progress as articulated this book but it should be noted that save one, every member of the bull returned to tell the story. Not every soldier over the years could make such a claim. Good or bad, this operational outcome was far more appealing then a Gallipoli.As for future readers of this book, enjoy the nuances of modern day warfare and remember that even if the author has an axe to grind, he is at least alive to share it with you."},{"Title":"Hunting al Qaeda: A Take-No-Prisoners Account of Terror, Adventure, and Disillusionment","review":"Definitely a book worth reading! With all the focus on Iraq, most have forgotten the earlier and still on-going battle of U.S. efforts in Afghanistan. Considering that the mission is fairly the same...stability, peace, and friendly relations with the U.S., I am surprised by the lack of media coverage in analyzing the successes and failures of Iraq's predecessor. For those who are seeking fast-paced adventure and action heros, stick to Tom Clancy and Hollywood. For those who want to try to understand how the U.S. is running military operations over in Afghanistan, then I would highly recommend this book. It is an unique opportunity to be able to read a first-hand account of what occurred to our men on the ground in a battle that continues. Instead of just buying into whatever the administration tells us, every American should inform him/herself on what our government and military are doing and not doing. Of course this book is just one SF team's account, but the truth it reveals should not be dismissed as \\"griping, whining, and complaining,\\" especially by those who have not been in the same shoes. A salute for all the men of the Special Forces Team 2085 of the Virginia National Guard...and I commend the two authors for putting together their story despite the criticisms and backlash that they will undoubtedly have to face."},{"Title":"Hunting al Qaeda: A Take-No-Prisoners Account of Terror, Adventure, and Disillusionment","review":"A Special Forces soldier's life is filled with waitings and emergencies. Yes, the 14-hour drives through bleak terrain, the (sometimes) lengthy ethnic, historical and cross-cultural considerations may be boring to some (though not to me) ; but the intense firefights that ensue are great stuff. If you prefer 100% action, then read Tom Clancy. But then this is the only book that truthfully captures the experience of Special Forces in Afghanistan, their victories, their self-doubts. Congrats to the men of Beast 85 for braving the military bureaucracy and coming out with such a rare, truthful account."},{"Title":"Hunting al Qaeda: A Take-No-Prisoners Account of Terror, Adventure, and Disillusionment","review":"When pressed, I have to rate this book 3 stars for two reasons. (1) It was a very easy and enjoyable read. I read it in one sitting (7 hours), therefore I have to give kudos to the author(s) writing style. (2) At least the authors had the courage to stand up and tell the world not all military soldiers think going to war is perfect.However, instead of calling this \\"Hunting for al Qaeda\\" a more apt title may be \\"Whining about War\\". I'd have to say about 3/4 of the book was deploying and arriving in theater, and how \\"this is messed up\\" and \\"that is messed up\\" and everyone is \\"messed up\\"..that is of course, everyone except the author(s). It became a bit irritating after a while. I used to tell my troops if they weren't part of the solution, they were part of the problem.As far as the account of \\"terror, adventure and disallusionment\\"..I found this a bit lacking also. I did not find their situation any different than the hundreds of thousands of other soldiers who have rotated through Iraq or Afghanistan. But being military myself, I could be a bit biased.The most most interesting thing about this book is the fact it is written by reservists. Their successful \\"hunts\\", and the fact they were quite adept at wading through the BS to get the job done...should put this book on the weekend reading list of all West Point freshman."},{"Title":"Hunting al Qaeda: A Take-No-Prisoners Account of Terror, Adventure, and Disillusionment","review":"\\"Hunting al Qaeda: a Take-no-Prisoners Account of Terror, Adventure, and Disillusionment\\" by Anonymous lives up to its title. This is the story of 'Beast 2085', a National Guard Special Forces Operational Detachment - Alpha -- or more commonly known as an \\"A-Team\\". This is the story of their hunt for the terrorists in the mountains of Afghanistan in 2002 and 2003.Two of the team members collaborated on the book, which is a memoir of their experiences. Yearning to make a difference, the team tested the limits imposed on them by higher headquarters. By establishing a rapport with the locals, they gained access to actionable intelligence resulting in operations to snag \\"high value targets\\". In their relatively short time in Afghanistan, this team certainly made a difference.Coalition forces in Afghanistan are formed around two different task forces. The majority of coalition forces serve in the task force that is concentrating on providing security and rebuilding the country. The second task force is primarily American, and focuses on 'kinetic' operations. I highly recommend \\"Enduring the Freedom: A Rogue Historian in Afghanistan\\" and \\"Confronting the Chaos: A Rogue Military Historian Returns to Afghanistan\\" by Sean Maloney for an outstanding study on these organizations and the contributions of the coalition Special Forces. Also of note, Maloney's works corroborate the value of human intelligence for gaining the truly actionable intelligence. SIGINT is good enough in a non-permissive environment, but we absolutely need a human intelligence capability.There are two common rules of thumb about conversations with men who served in small units in the military. Most service-members will tell you how much they loved what they did. The second group of conversations will focus on complaining about something, be it the food, lodging, or how the 'system' let them down. This book would have been much better if it focused on only the first, because it is an incredible story about men who succeeded in making a difference."},{"Title":"Hunting al Qaeda: A Take-No-Prisoners Account of Terror, Adventure, and Disillusionment","review":"Great book! Has wonderful insight about SF operations and shows the ingenuity SF guys will use in the face of adversity to accomplish their missions. Those who are in the military and understand the frustrations that regular army and Special Operations guys deal with, will fully appreciate this book. Civilians who are not in the special operations community and those who are just looking for a pure adrenaline rush from start to finish, will not find it in this book. Needless to say, this book needed to be written and I wish more people had the \\"balls\\" to expose things that are inherintly wrong with our military today. This book should be required reading for all special operations commanders. I know the commander of beast 85 personally and he is an incredible person, to say the least. It is people like him, who continue to sacrifice day after day for this country, that allow us all to sleep well at night. Keep up the fight Alan, and Good hunting!Go and buy the book!!!Zap"},{"Title":"Hunting al Qaeda: A Take-No-Prisoners Account of Terror, Adventure, and Disillusionment","review":"On the one hand, I found this book really optimistic, I mean it shows \\"average Americans\\" going off to war and fighting in Afghanistan against Al Quida. I found that aspect really kind of uplifting, because it shows the strengths of America. But it is depressing to learn that even in special operations areas, the U.S. military is dominated by careerist officers and bureaucracy. The fact that our \\"tip of the spear\\" forces have to ask for permission many hours before engaging the enemy (filled out in triplicate, etc.) is just depressing. In end effect, bureaucracy no doubt helped Al Qaeda escape. So the book is a mixed bag. It is a very honest look at the \\"war on terror\\". One reason I gave it only 4 stars is, the pictures made me want to learn more, but the writing didn't go into it. For example, one picture details how good the M4 rifle is, \\"much better than what the enemy has\\", etc. But I didn't find anything in the book about that. I expected the text to go more into that. Still a really good book, that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Hunting al Qaeda: A Take-No-Prisoners Account of Terror, Adventure, and Disillusionment","review":"I purchased this book last year and read it in a few days. As a former Guardsman I totally understood their plight and sentiments. Treated as the 'red headed step child' by their active duty SF counterparts, even though they all underwent the very same training process and some were former active duty SF, the book tells of their adventures in Afghanistan and how they made the best of a war bungled by career minded beauracracies. This team in fact found tons of munitions and captured one of the more notorious terrorists during their tour, all due to personal initiative instead of sitting around. That aspect of the story does in fact remind me of another excellent book I recently read, 'Roughneck Nine One.'As a footnote, the book reveals that in fact this particular Guard unit was used as a \\"test run\\" to see how the National Guard SF component compares to their active duty counterparts."},{"Title":"strange evil","review":"Well That ole China Mieville is a strange duck. He chose this novel for a Gaurdian list of the top ten weird fiction books he'd come across which is how I picked it up. He stressed, as did the publisher in the preface, that this was written by a fourteen year old, and frankly that made the reading experience. I wasn't a trillionth this aware as a freshman in highschool, and though Judith, the artist's model from London who gets kidnapped by her fairy cousin to another dimension, does some awfully silly things- there's simply a thrill from reading the work of a mind just hovering around the brink of total self awareness. The truth is I've read much, MUCH worse science fiction and fantasy in my day.True in this novel there's lots of semi-tedious descriptive passages of exotic birds, green leaves, butterfly covered fields, and long and winding passages. And its true there's one too many characters with the letter \\"z\\" in their name, and the sexy fairy who captures Judith's heart is a palindrome for Jane Gaskell's first name. True that the heroine experiences less a state of wonder at discovering her cousin is a faerie than she is concerned with female rivalry with her. And also true that there are charming lapses in narrative priority- Judith discovers that many are dieing around her but she doesn't let that get her down- no she goes and takes a nap in another beautiful glade. But that's part of this work's charm. Every time the characters start talking it's very entertaining- the book takes on topics of promiscuity amongst the aristocracy, social welfare amongst satyrs and faeries, and the ever dangerous Baby Worship. But when the plot revolves around a war for access to a crystal meth-esque substance that sustains life how can you go wrong with such a work? And the climax is TO-DIE-FOR.So yes, read this if you come across an out of print edition somewhere. It makes me want to read more books by teenagers. It was utterly charming."},{"Title":"strange evil","review":"This is a strange and imaginative book about an Earth woman from London who is sort-of abducted by cousins from another world. She is taken to a fairyland full of satyrs and giants and faerie-like humans, and finds herself caught in the middle of a war between those who live inside the magical mountain that is the source of the faerie beings' immortality, and those who have been exiled to the outside.This book was written by the author when she was fourteen. They decided to publish it on the strength of her storytelling and her imagination; it wasn't on the strength of her writing, which is quite immature and often just plain ungrammatical. It takes a while for the story to go anywhere and there is a lot of irrelevant description, but there is an imaginative story and some sparkle of brilliance buried beneath the adolescent purple prose.I want to give it a higher rating, taking into account the fact that it was written by a fourteen-year-old, but objectively, it's not a great fantasy novel and not really that original, and it's marred by the poor writing. If I were judging it relative to, say, NaNoWriMo novels and other output from teenagers and amateurs, I'd give it a higher rating, but compared with professional published fiction, it just doesn't have that much to commend it aside from the novelty of having been written by a kid."},{"Title":"Swamp Fox Insights: Innovation and Entrepreneurship in a Time of Profound Change","review":"John ties the wisdom he's found from being on the boards of several highly successful start ups with the entrepreneurial/economic theory found in some of the best books on the subject in a way that is both very readable and concise.

(He tries a gig as a go-go boy, with pictures, he talks about being admired by a group of men as he tries on a sexy swimsuit, he lets us know that Jennifer Garner complimented him on his bicep.) Richard, you are very handsome and look great but your constant need for affirmation shows that apparently the self-esteem has yet to catch up with him, and inadvertently showcases the less savory side of the gay world's oobsession with looks.

Pax Romana2. Fascism3. Love of political power4. Global protection5. \\"Interests\\"6. Cost externalization7. Manifest Destiny8. The White Man's Burden (now Washington DC's Burden)9. Alliances10. The glory of warSome other things I found interesting about the book:- People often say that there is no way to win a guerilla war. Maybury shows that there is a way, and the US Government used it to win the war in the Philippines.- Who made the first move of aggression, the US Government or Japan?- How did the US Government get the land to build the Panama Canal?- Why were the German people so supportive of Hitler after WWI?- Why was the US Government (particularly Woodrow Wilson) responsible for prolonging WWI and creating the conditions for WWII.Maybury draws a distinct difference between America as a country and the US Government and he states that unfortunately \\"patriotism\\" is often seen as support for one's government instead of love for one's country. It reminds me of GK Chesterson remarking that \\"My country right or wrong\\" was like saying, \\"My mother drunk or sober.\\"After reading this book, you'll never be able to hear phrases like \\"make the world safe for democracy\\" and \\"project power\\" again without feeling nauseous. Maybury shows how the propaganda for interventionism developed in the late 19th century and has continued up to the present. It's amazing how much Bush's current rhetoric sounds like Woodrow Wilson's before WWI.Maybury describes the book as \\"anti-war letters written by an extreme militarist.\\" He does not take the view of Orwell's pacifist who thinks that the enemy will treat him well because he did not put up a fight. But he also is not ready to fight other nations' wars and get involved with their land grabs. \\"The best defense is a good offense\\" is only true when you're keeping score on the football field, not when you're talking about killing people.Some people get indignant at the phrase \\"American Empire,\\" but a quick look at history shows how accurate it is.

Even if you don't agree, read this book to test your point of view--does it really hold up? Do you need to reconsider? What really IS worth fighting and dieing for?I remain a firm believer in the need for national defense and the sobering reality that war will sometimes visit itself upon us whether we want it or deserve it. However, I am utterly convinced Maybury is on to a way of thinking we would be fortunate to pursue as a nation--and without sacrificing our freedom.Do yourself a favor and read this book.

How many understand the mistakes that were made that led up to these wars? Unfortunately, many of us don't. But, thankfully, Richard Maybury, who calls himself \\"Uncle Eric\\", has written books on these wars that attempt to answer these questions. While this book is about World War One, it is about much more than that particular conflict. Uncle Eric lays out the root causes of war, and reading this book will also aid in your understanding of many other wars.In this book, Uncle Eric lists what he calls \\"The Ten Deadly Ideas That Lead to War.\\" The list is as follows:1.

He says up front he has a bias, but my husband considered the book biased to the point of dishonest propaganda - something Maybury says the US Government has used almost since day one.

Entitled &quot;The Promethea Puzzle: An Adventure in Folklore,&quot; Moore explains how the character of Promethea has appeared in works from the epic sentimental fantasy &quot;A Faerie Romance&quot; by the New England poet Charlton Sennet to the comic books written by Steven Shelley. Next thing you know you are off doing a Google search to find out more about these &quot;real&quot; people and finding out that what you should have been thinking in reference to Moore's work is &quot;The Watchmen&quot; with its memorable group of faux super heroes.Book 1 of &quot;Promethea&quot; collects the first six issues from America's Best Comics with the script by Moore, pencils by J. H. Williams III, inks by Mick Gray, and lettering by Todd Klein. The story begins with a prologue set in Alexandria, 411 A.D., in which a strange old man with mystical powers saves his daughter from a group of killer monks. We then jump ahead to a New York existing in the year 1999 that has cabs hovering without wheels, police in flying saucers, and a successful comic book about the &quot;Weeping Gorilla.&quot; Here we meat Sohpie Bangs, who is writing a term paper and visits Barbara Shelley, the widow of the last guy to write the Promethea comic book. However, Sophie gets a big time brush off and the following advice from Barabara: &quot;You don't wanna go looking for folklore. And you especially don't want folklore to come looking for you.&quot;There is something of misdirection to this advice, not only because it is too late for Sophie, who is gong to become the new &quot;host&quot; for Promethea, but also because ultimately Moore is not really writing about folklore here but about the female super hero. In modern times that pretty much takes us back to the creation of Wonder Woman, but Promethea harkens back to ancient Greece and elements of Artemis, Athena, and Atalanta. However, in a similar way Moore is also dealing with the archetypal nature of comic books, which is where the folklore part really comes into play in his concept of the Immateria, a realm where stories are real. If you can believe in the power of Story, then it can transport you to the Immateria, as young Sophie finds out.The first three stories deal with Sophie getting indoctrinated into the ways of Promethea, although there are always more questions than answers. Meanwhile the city's resident superheroes, the Five Sweel Guys, are dealing with their arch-enemy the Painted Doll. But in issue #4, &quot;A Faerie Romance,&quot; Moore adds a great conceit to the mix, as the various incarnations of Promethea sit around in the Immateria discussing the newcomer. The idea of the archetype becomes reinforced, not by going back to the beginning, but rather by showing how each generation has had a Promethea it could call its own. This is where the series slips into the next gear and exhibits the most promise.There is a Promethean movement, which is &quot;dedicated to advancing human life through self-expression, augmented by authentic freedom, experimentality and individualism.&quot; Now, I am not really sure if looking at these comic books as valuing the liberated and realized person while opposing repression, orthodoxy, and collectivism is the way to go, but the important thing is that you need a foundation for approaching Moore's work. Fortunately Moore is always worth reading and you can get by the scholarly mysticism by just taking the story at face value. After all, Moore is just making this up as he goes along."},{"Title":"Promethea (Book 1)","review":"Alan Moore's America's Best Comics has spawned several wonderful titles (along with the middling Tomorrow Stories), but Promethea stands out. The art is outstanding, the color perfect, the lettering spot-on for the different speech types employed, and the writing entertaining while also waxing philosophical. Sympathetically drawn characters tie up the whole package in a beautiful ribbon.Moore dares to tackle the very nature of creativity and comes away with much more than the Wonder Woman clone some were expecting. While exploring the world of fantasy, he examines through the changing face of comics (the tribute to Little Nemo is marvelous), sexuality, religion and pure wish fulfilment. Comics are still growing up, maybe, but this may be some of the most mature work from the man who brought us The Watchmen."},{"Title":"Promethea (Book 1)","review":"The plot: Promethea is an idea - the goddess myth that changes depending on who sees her and how. \\"If she didn't exist we would have to make her.\\" Yes this plot is tenuous and mystic and intends to be deep. We follow the story of college student Sophie, who is doing a term paper on the Promethea character, who reemerges in literature, pulp fiction and comics. Strangely many of the people involved in creating the art that shows Promethea also claimed to have met her. Sophie soon finds an idea that can enter our world (or at least her world - a very technologically advanced 1999 in which cars fly through a world of neon billboards).The plot and story here were surprisingly coherent. First of course Sophie meets Promethea and begins to understand how an idea can enter the realworld and become physically real. Interspersed are back stories on how Promethea originally came to be and on the artists she has touched in past manifestations.The graphics: The artistic style is the normal comic booky style done very well. However the layouts are spectacular. Often there is a border surrounding the frames on a spread - and in that border part of the scene is taking place. Almost any spread of two pages hangs together as one coherent whole. Anyone interested in graphic design and comics should check this one out.Overall Promethea was a good comic book. The graphics were spectacular. Even though the plot is a bit artsy and pretentious, by about half way through I was hooked. There is enough action and \\"good parts\\" to keep things flowing well."},{"Title":"Promethea (Book 1)","review":"Wow, this is a wild ride. If you are a long time reader of comic books like myself, this book is a dream come true. Veteran comics writer Alan Moore is at the top of his game with Promethea, weaving romantic, modern and post modern styles into a classic &quot;reluctant heroine&quot; storyline and along the way paying homage to a multitude of fiction writers (and artists). An entertaining read with great artwork as well. For those of you that have always dreamed that you too could be a superhero...read this book, and believe it again.Forgive me for not going into more detail, as I don't want to accidentaly include spoilers."},{"Title":"Promethea (Book 1)","review":"Sorry, just had to say that to the review below. SUPERHEROES and pseudo-mysticism. You're dismissing the fact that many, many comics have nothing to do with spandex.Promethea is an incredible story. No, it's not for everyone, yet it's one of the deepest, most complex stories that Moore has ever created.The most recent issue was AMAZING. It's all about to wrap up, and like all of Moore's larger works, everything has a point. He's been building to this incredible finale.The artwork is just gorgeous as hell, too. One of the most ambitious talents in the industry. I'm so surprised at how well he changes his style to mimic other styles depending on what's happening in the script. His covers are the best, too."},{"Title":"Promethea (Book 1)","review":"The layouts are beautiful, the Weeping Gorilla idea is great and darkly funny, and Promethea is even somewhat interesting except that the long prose foreword is repeated graphically in the first issue or two. My biggest problem is that 12 bucks and 6 comics later not much has really happened - it's like reading the first 3 chapters of a 400 page novel. So if you're looking for any kind of closure - it's not here. I picture myself reading _Promethea Book 12_ two or three years from now saying, &quot;She *finally* understands her destiny and her powers.&quot;I would recommend waiting for a compiled version or at least waiting for book 3 to come out so you can feel like you read and finished a book rather than just sampled it."},{"Title":"Promethea (Book 1)","review":"Alan Moore is, and deserves to be, a highly regarded author of what we should still call comic books (other names seem largely a reflex action hide embarrassment - which makes me annoyed to see them referred to as &quot;the graphic story medium&quot; in this book). He has in more recent years created a line of comics under the imprint &quot;America's Best Comics&quot;, of which Promethea is one of those titles. This volume reprints the first five issues of that comic.'Promethea' is an attempt to render the female super hero in an archetypical form. This book has a strong mystical or spiritual theme, with the female lead cast in a pluralistic role: she is both Sophie Bangs, student, and Promethea, imagination personified. Our Promethea is not the first, there is a whole line of Prometheas stretching back to ancient Egypt, and we get to know some of the earlier ones in this book.What's good: as Promethea, Sophie doesn't know all the answers although, it seems, Promethea does (sounds confusing? Sophie is Promethea, but Promethea isn't Sophie). Indeed, Sophie finds herself thrust in to a broad canvas full of elements that she doesn't know about or understand. The book allows for Sophie and Promethea to be intellectual, rather than just wiping the enemies off the face of the Earth (and the Immateria) with her caduceus - even where she does that, it is thought through.What's not so good: I gave it 5 stars, so not much. My main complaint is that it finishes at an inopportune moment. Sophie is learning about the four weapons she has, and learns about two and then it stops. The comic book has continued, so the rest will be in volume 2, but it still a bit inconsiderate.Lots of thumbs up, and also check out Alan Moore's male archetype in 'Tom Strong'."},{"Title":"Promethea (Book 1)","review":"I can't possibly give this series enough praise. Quite simply it is an easy to read primer on modern Hermetic magick in the form of top rate sequential art. Whenever I meet someone not familiar with ceremonial magick, the occult or the Kabbalah I recommend Promethea. This isn't just a pretty book that portrays magick's philosophy with great insight and a surprising level of subtlety, it really uses the medium itself to its own advantage. The scene with the pair of Promethea's walking around the moebius strip in volume 2 (I'm almost sure it's there) was awesome enough but the scene with them on the sphere in the sephiroth Tihareth (also in volume 2) blew my mind. It portrays a conversation that isn't just circular, it makes sense no matter where in the circle you decide to start reading and it makes sense whether you decide to read it clockwise or counter clockwise (I know it's hard to understand but when you see it you will see why I had so much difficulty explaining it). These as well as dozens of other examples of storytelling mastery all support the aspect of magick being explored in the specific instance by enhancing the mood or suggesting something that would be almost impossible to portray in a classical literary format. In addition to this, it almost hits that level of genius that suggests the creation of a modern myth is a real possibility.For those who gave this a bad review I should point out that it wasn't Allan's purpose to write a simple super hero book but to portray a part of his life that he finds extremely interesting and worth portraying in a format that is much too often derided for it's lack of substance. This book shows that the medium of sequential art is much more flexible than most give it credit for and can be used to bring the more abstract aspects of philosophy to life in a way that isn't possible otherwise. basically what I'm saying is that telling people this book isn't good because it wasn't what you expected is like saying the Fillet Mignon you ate was bad because you thought you were ordering meat loaf.In short, if you are looking for a book that is little more than a fun no brainer, why are you looking at an Allen Moore book in the first place? By the way this isn't a no brainer. If on the other hand you are looking for a unique work of sequential art that combines deep philosophical insight with a pop art expression and not just a small bit of occult history added to the mix you would be hard pressed to find a better example.There is nothing like this series in all of comics. I half seriously want to track down all the original issues in this series, pull out the staples and bind it in leather in a medieval style just to give it the respect it is due (no I'm not kidding, it is really that good)."},{"Title":"Promethea (Book 1)","review":"First, I own every GN/collection from Moore. When he's on, he's the best story-teller, period. And this book held so much promise--an interesting idea, unique setting combining science and the fantistical, and intriguing support characters. All told, I'm forced to characterize it as a slippery slope, however, because the series just gets more and more abstract and unappealing.An \\"action\\" comic this is not. Moore is a phenomenal writer--one of only a few that superbly combines heroics/action and complex myth-building. In this case, though, too much emphasis is on myth-building and not enough on storyline. The series ulitmately morphs into an surreal expose on tantric sex (Promoethia and a magical old man), the Tarrot, black magic, and the afterlife. It just gets too surreal (it's like reading Ursula LeGuin when you are accustomed to Tolkien). There are some interesting ideas, but all told, it just goes on and on, and on. This book is 4 stars--I'd buy it again--but then quit while I'm ahead. Unfortunately, I bought all 5 at the same time. First time I've ever felt I made a mistake on a Moore collection."},{"Title":"Promethea (Book 1)","review":"There is no other comic out there today like it. I already knew I loved Alan Moore (I became a fan after reading 'Watchmen'), and I was excited when I learned that he had written a series involving a female protagonist. The art is exceptional -- very surrealistic, although it becomes even more so in subsequent issues, as the story becomes more complex. It was refreshing to see a comic artist mix so many different medias. I can only imagine what it must have been like when the writer and illustrators got together and the creative juices started flowing. Additionally, while the manner in which the spiritual philosophy ('Kabbalah') presented is, by Moore's own admission in another review I read, \\"didactic\\", the material is still very interesting. I had the same feeling of 'being let in on a secret' that I had when I read Dan Brown's books, particularly 'The DaVinci Code' and 'Angels and Demons'. As I was reading some parts of 'Promethea', particularly in issues two and three, I'm wondering, \\"Should I be reading this?\\" It's like being on an intellectual archeological dig, or eavesdropping on some clandestine meeting. And all the other bits and pieces of information that he drops along the way (references to Greek mythology, famous literary characters and writers, etc.) made me want to keep my lap top nearby so I could Google stuff he was talking about left and right. That's my take on it anyway. I hope you enjoy it."},{"Title":"Promethea (Book 1)","review":"If you like Alan Moore's metatextual explorations of fiction, you'll love his creation of Promethea, a female archetype of power and imagination who exists primarily as a story, reflected in other artists and writers over the centuries.My main quibble of this story is that Moore seems to get tired of Promethea after her newest incarnation appears and switch the focus to hermeticism and magickal philosophy. The development of the character gets lost in a horde of Goetic demons and otherworldly realms.One thing that puzzles me is the idea that somehow Promethea is a more authentically female superhero than those who have gone before, instead of being a &quot;man in a woman's body&quot; like Roger of the 5 Swell Guys. How is Promethea/Sophie (created by two men) more a real woman than Wonder Woman (created by William Moulton and Charles Gaines) or Buffy the Vampire Slayer (created by Joss Whedon)? At least the Bride of &quot;Kill Bill&quot; was created by a man and a woman.However, Moore on a bad day is still levels above plenty of other writers, so this is worth checking out."},{"Title":"Promethea (Book 1)","review":"I will be the FIRST to rave all over Moore's work on Vendetta, Watchmen and Batman. They are brilliant and redefined my world.But I tell you true that Promethea reads like someone who can't write trying hard to sound like Neil Gaiman while revamping an old superhero. Don't waste your money on this one. Maybe once Alan has time to season the heroine."},{"Title":"Promethea (Book 1)","review":"This first issue of Promethea is not as bad as my rating suggests but the further installments are so irritating that I found myself going back and re-reading the first one until I hated it as well. Not only is this a little too close, thematically speaking, to the sandman series, but it is also far to heavy handed on the descriptions of the immateria. After the first paragraph on this \\"immateria\\" as Moore calls it, I had gotten the point. But it goes on and on for pages (and continues into the second, and third volmes), as if I were some dumb putz who couldn't figure it out. The series is almost insulting. However the art is absolutely stunning, especially in volume three, but that is not enough to save the series in my mind. Sure it's fun in parts, and mildly interesting as well, but all the heavy handed [stuff] about magic, and Crowely really got on my nerves after awhile. In retrospect I am very glad that Moore keeps his magic fetish out of League, and his other comics, or at least mostly out. If your into magic then this is a fantastic read, I'm sure, but if you think of magic on earth as some kind of bad joke, steer clear of this ..., it might ruin your appreciation of Moore's better comics."},{"Title":"Promethea (Book 1)","review":"Alan Moore teams up with J.H. Williams III and Mick Gray to create this graphic novel series. The story is set in a modern-day, yet futuristic, New York, where a coed gets more than she bargains for when she researches a literary heroine. While Moore stays on his A game for this one, Williams' colorful, psychedelic art makes every page stand on its own. It seems that once again, Moore combines a weird premise with an alluring style and fantastic illustrations. Volume I features a two-page written excerpt of the history of the Promethea phenomenon.This comic is unrated: Graphic Violence, Adult Language, Adult Situations"},{"Title":"Promethea (Book 1)","review":"Alan Moore and J.H. Williams have outdone themselves on this beautiful series. Not only does the series have multiple interesting, believable female characters (a rarity in comics, in my opinion), but the plot reflects a deep understanding of the way story and symbol create meaning. _Promethea_'s truly gifted team of artists has allowed Moore not just to explain and articulate some sophisticated philosophical ideas, but to demonstrate them visually and with an emotional impact that mere text lacks. Sophie's transformation into a goddess each month reminds me (as another struggling urban college student) that there is a spark of the divine within each of us, as well as the ability to transcend our ordinary, day-to-day selves in favor of something greater. While the series takes a few issues to begin to delve deeply into its material (this book covers issues #1-6, while my favorite issues are #7-10), this collection contains important character development and set-up that I think is quite enjoyable and sets _Promethea_ apart as one of the most innovative superhero comics ever conceived. Can't wait for Book 2..."},{"Title":"Promethea (Book 1)","review":"alan moore is a master of storytelling, overall architecture, and dialgoue; on top of that, all of the characters are completely believeable and interesting; give this book a chance"},{"Title":"Promethea (Book 1)","review":"Take Wonder Woman. Strip her of all the baranacles. Then think about all the mythology flowing through her adventures. Then stop and let Alan Moore show you how it's done.Moore marks his return to deconstructionist super-hero comics with this gorgeous, often brilliant series. While even the most diligent reader is likely to get a little lost as the star of comic learns about the legends of Promethea while taking on her mantle, the journey - at least at the beginning of this series - is truly worth it. Moore, helped by the team of Williams and Gray, forges a stunning futuristic but believable world, creates a diverse and likeable cast, and has a lot of fun.These issues are Promethea went it was still brilliant, before Moore's penchant for injecting his own religious and philosophical views into this book made later issues hard reading. But for fans who missed the Alan Moore of V for Vendetta and Watchmen, this is must reading. For fans of Wonder Woman who long for more than just action tales, this is must reading. And for fans of great art with women as real as they are sexy, you can't go wrong either."},{"Title":"Promethea (Book 1)","review":"Promethea takes place in a futuristic setting in which a college student becomes a goddess and has to learn how to use her powers. The story takes the cliche \\"ideas have power\\" to the superhero level, and I appreciate that the superhero in question is also a woman who is more than just eye candy.Promethea is a superhero comic with a brain. It is philosophical without being preachy or too abstract. Typical for Alan Moore, it runs a bit slowly for my taste, but is worth your patience.I enjoyed the artwork and it had a lot of little details and fine touches that were a nice addition to the story."},{"Title":"Promethea (Book 1)","review":"Alan Moore has a way of being intelligent without being pretentious and allowing the love of storytelling come through in everything he writes. I remember howWatchmenimpressed me most with the after-comic additions like the autobiography of the one character and interviews. I found the series less interesting when it switched to the main storyline. With Promethea, his storytelling ability is much better syncronized with his intellectual aesthetic.Beginning the series with a bogus biography of the character, he sets up his tricks from the beginning and its still fun watching them. The character of Promethea is both a reality and a story and part of the main imagination. The character becomes more prominent when someone writes about her. Or draws her. She takes on the aspect of the era and the writing. The 18th century poet creates a bathic love type of Promethea and he begins an affair with his maid who has taken on Promethea. In the early 20th century, a children's cartoonist becomes Promethea and she saves the soldiers of the Great War. The Pulp Fiction version of Promethea is both a sexist fantasy and a platform to mock the inherent sexism of male dominated literature (\\"do your breasts ever heave\\" she says at one point and at another Alan Moore name checks Helen Cixious).This is an amazing series that wraps around itself and celebrates literature while creating its own thing. I love how he does it in LXG, but I dare say that this might be better executed."},{"Title":"Promethea (Book 1)","review":"I bought this book after reading a few teaser pages in this free CD I got from DC Comics which had a few teaser pages each for a wide variety of their comics. it left me intrigued, so I decided to try this book.I was NOT disappointed. This book was fantastic. I learned quite a few new things, and the art and the writing go hand in hand beautifully. At the end of this book, I did not hesitate to order the second book. Bravo to Alan Moore for this beautiful story!"},{"Title":"Promethea (Book 1)","review":"Perhaps my expectations were just too high. I found Promethea by Alan Moore to be pretentious, indulgent, and except for a couple flashes of brilliance, just plain boring. In the first two pages of prose, he tells the story of various ways the Promethea character was written by authors through the years. Usually I can't wait to get through these introductions to get to the really good stuff - the comics. But this book was the opposite; the introduction was the best part of the book.The art was cool, and the little details in the panels, used to great effect in Watchmen, was interesting. I loved the use of color and the imagery.Let's be honest, anything from Alan Moore is already in the ranks of the best comics out there - hence the three-star rating. Perhaps in this book he attempted to make too much of an idea devoid of plot. Promethea is still a stranger to me after 150 pages.Like Promethea herself, this book is a great idea, but not much real material."},{"Title":"Promethea (Book 1)","review":"Alan Moore has consistently proven to be one of the most interesting and engaging writers in the comic book medium. Longtime fans will never forget his &quot;Watchmen&quot;, &quot;V for Vendetta&quot; or his stint on &quot;Swamp Thing&quot;.Since these mid-80s triumphs, Moore's labored a bit in obscurity. The gripping &quot;From Hell&quot; didn't appeal to the comics mainstream, nor did &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot;, but were still well-written and worth the read.Then Moore started &quot;America's Best Comics&quot;, marking his return to the superhero genre, with a distinct Moore-ish twist, of course.&quot;Promethea&quot; is Wonder Woman as seen through a realistic lens. The daughter of a sorceror rescued by mythological gods when her father was murdered, she is immortal, but lives only through possessing the bodies of mortals. Naturally, she has some supernatural foes to take on and some rather exotic powers, yet the world she inhabits is quite similar to our own in all its ragged glory.I won't reveal any of the plot but will note that it is quite good and reveals Moore to have fallen in love once more with the superhero genre which spawned him. The illustrations are wonderful as well."},{"Title":"Promethea (Book 1)","review":"Philosphy as the setting for the drama of a comic book? Or is that the other way around: a comic book as a setting for philosphy.

As long as he can maintain the drama in this complicated form he'll be fine.The characters are intriguing and touching, with a degree of surreal clarity that grabs hold and won't let go.Unfortunately this collection has the first 6 issues but the initial story arc doesn't climax until issue 8 where events are resolved and it prepares to pick up again.Allow me to mention the high marks for the book's excellent production values: good paper and color printing, excellent binding, solid construction."},{"Title":"Promethea (Book 1)","review":"Must have for Alan Moore fans and the ones interested in his views on magic and symbolism. The art of J.H. Williams III is amazing!"},{"Title":"Promethea (Book 1)","review":"I was expecting great things from Promethea, considering it comes from Alan Moore, and overall I'm disappointed with this graphic novel. The visuals are stunning, truly beautiful inking and coloring going on here, but the storyline is conventional fantasy with nothing new to contribute. I expected more from Moore. The plot line involves a young college student who is researching a legendary hero called Promethea, who appears in artistic works over the ages as a heroine. On her way to doing this research the college student, one Sophie Bangs, becomes the latest incarnation of Promethea and fights off various sorcerors, demons, elementals and so forth that have been sent to kill her by various entities that have crossed paths with Promethea in the past and have grudges to bear.I thought this book was pretty much predictable, once you settled into it, but the first-rate art earned it an extra star. The book is pleasant to look at and read, and that helped make up for the dull storyline. I can truly only recommend this book if you're deep into comics and nothing better is available to you or if you're a dedicated Moore fan and want to check out ALL his works. Otherwise you can safely give this one a miss, and only be out some good artwork."},{"Title":"Promethea (Book 1)","review":"I'm up to Promethea Part IV by now so I should back up and rein in my thoughts on Volume 1 (which collects the first 6 comics from back in 1999 it looks like). Anyway hats off to Alan Moore for serving up another variation on his \\"superwoman\\" ideal, as if Mina Harker from LXG wasn't enough. Well she isn't enough of course. PROMETHEA wouldn't be as interesting as it is (and in fact it's captivated me for the past three days) without its back story, New York in the last days of the last century, but a different New York with far more elaborate architecture and a set of new technologies that makes it seem like something HG Wells prophesized. On top of this strange, baroque background, seeing Stacia and Sophie act like regular co-eds at a place like NYU is what gives it its special, endearing brand of gotcha.It's a daring, risky book where many lesser talents would have come undone, and as a matter of fact Moore's storytelling here is not exactly his finest, and his allegorical sense isn't altogether on point. OK, so Sophie encounters Little Red Riding Hood and the wolf in her past-our-bourne travels into the underworld... Little Red is snarky and snippy, and the wolf is super terrifying, but isn't this a story Angela Carter did already like, a zillion times, not to mention the Stephen Sondheim of INTO THE WOODS? I feel like I'm missing the point from time to time... Also the \\"5 Swell Guys,\\" five science heroes who swank around the skies of New York at night in their bubble car. Moore fans help me, did they appear in some other comic and so all of you know about them already? Lord love a duck, I haven't been able to distinguish them any better than my fingerprints, except for \\"Kenneth,\\" the psychic one, who must be named after \\"Kenneth what's my frequency?\\"Will evil and all seeing Marto Neptura be back later on in the saga? He's the one who scares me the most, him and his army of alligator men, they will haunt my nightmares forever! Or is he a false bogey, already vanquished, the way the great Wizard of Oz dwindles to insignificance once one goes beyond the screen?

It's hard to criticize such a fine work."},{"Title":"Promethea (Book 1)","review":"Unlike Moore's ground-breaking work on Watchmen and From Hell, Promethea is more traditional fare. However, because it is by Moore, this is still above the majority of comics/graphic novels being produced today. In some ways, this is Moore at his post-modern best, as the very nature of this character (channeled through the years by the artists that imagine her best) allows him to discuss the power of the creative imagination, while still indulging in the kind of esoterica that has filled his other work."},{"Title":"Promethea (Book 1)","review":"I just finished this seminal work by Alan Moore and I cannot advocate it strongly enough. Alan Moore is generally recocnized as the unmitigated genius of the comics medium, and while this book does not rival the sheer awe-inspiring brilliance of From Hell, Watchmen or V for Vendetta it is still an instant classic in the field (let's face it, even a mediocre Moore is more brilliant than the best works of other authors, no sleight intended to their talent). It contains a rarity in the field, or indeed in any body of literature, not only one strong, independent heroine but rather a whole sleight of them. It also contains the rich, layered writing emanating from every panel that we have come to expect from Alan Moore. In short, I urge you to go out now and pick up this brilliant piece of literature for who knows, tomorrow you might be dead and then you'll never experience the sheer rapture of reading this book."},{"Title":"Promethea (Book 1)","review":"I looked at this for a long time, picked it up off and on, and kept dismissing it as looking way too girly or frilly.

But it's still about three floors up from most of the other stuff on the market. And maybe it's just a longer story, and all I've read so far is the first book.Promethea is a living idea, and she can posess people - but there has to be an asking for it, a looking for it. And she has enemies who have nothing to do with her body; other living ideas and organizations.I'll be getting books two and three now. I want to know what else happens."},{"Title":"Promethea (Book 1)","review":"This is all I expect in a comic: characters, plot, and action to pull me along, story and art that work together, and situations that don't tax the mind too much. This one is a bit more than a typical super-heroine with mystical powers and a brass bra. Her off-duty persona is bookish, a feature that I empathize with, in an urban world that satirizes what ours might become. When that college girl takes on the Promethea role, she doesn't know who she is, or what or where - she just knows that she's under a bizarre attack, defending herself in ways that she finds equally bizarre, even to herself.The artwork in this book is very competent, and supports the story well. I can't say that I find it memorable, though. The story's allegories are a bit heavy-handed, and mystical symbols are deeply piled everywhere you turn. They are so pervasive that I find they lose meaning, becoming background decoration rather than signs with real significance. The story comes down to mis-understood good vs. mis-perceived evil, mysterious advisors of uncertain loyalties, a mousy alter-ego, and a few other staples of the genre.Still, the pieces come together well. The book is good amusement, and worth coming back to. It won't be the centerpiece of any collection and won't shake the world of comic art or story. That's OK - it's still a pleasant and undemanding way to fill an evening."},{"Title":"Promethea (Book 1)","review":"Readers who know Neil Gaiman's Sandman universe will find a lot of familiar territory in the world of Promethea. Like the Sandman saga, we find a narrative set on the liminal landscape between the psychic realm and the material realm. Here we have the &quot;Immateria&quot; instead of the Dreaming. Also like the Sandman, the premise becomes a vehicle for exploring both worlds and their intersection. Unlike the Sandman, the chronicles of Promethea are flat, dry, two-dimensional, and predictable. A lot of superhero-style action will disappoint readers looking for the sophisticated antiheroes of Watchmen or the visionary storytelling of From Hell. I recommend that new Moore readers look to those works instead."},{"Title":"Modern verse, 1900-1940 (World's classics)","review":"For some of the well- known poets here , Hopkins and Yeats for instance the selections made are of their finest work.

Nowicki is brutally (and I mean brutally) honest about the predilections, motivations, and basic assumptions of liberals and does not beat around the bush in pointing out where their ideas come from and where they lead. He is especially astute in exposing the myth that is &quot;tolerance&quot; as that term is commonly used today (for a similar analysis, see Paul Griffiths, &quot;Proselytizing for Tolerance&quot; in First Things 127 [November 2002]: 30-36). As he surveys the current cultural scene, Nowicki thinks things willl get worse before they get better, yet it is difficult to classify him as a pessimist through and through.

The book pokes fun at both Italian and Soviet politics through the antics of the irrepressible Comrade Camillo, a mischievous priest who has his own agenda in accepting the invitation to visit the Soviet Union. Guareschi wrote a number of other successful books, including a series of Don Camillo books, but I don't know how many of them were translated into English. If there were, I never saw any of them, but I enjoyed this one, and it now stands as a window into another era of Cold War politics that is rapidly receding in the wake of the Berlin Wall's coming down and now the events of of 9/11."},{"Title":"Comrade Don Camillo","review":"Giovanni Guareschi's irascible, irrepressibleDon Camilloworms his way into a select groupchosen by his rival Peppone (nowa Senator) toreceive a guided tour of Kruschev's USSR.Can Don Camillo turn the hearts of a few&quot;godless Communists&quot; without bringing ruinon his old friend?This fifth Don Camillo book dates from 1964and is the only one to take the belovedcharacters from their Po Valley setting, butGuareschi still works his magic on the reader."},{"Title":"Comrade Don Camillo","review":"I have just finished rereading this book for the umpteenth time.Even after all these readings, the lump in my throat and the tears in my eyesare bigger than ever.

Since where I live, no library has Guareshi books, I shelled out the money for 'Comrade Don Camillo' and wasn't disapointed. Even if you have not read any of Don Camillo's adventures, no matter, as you Guareshi immediately pulls you into his world. There is a chuckle on every page (small chuckles, but nonetheless). Here father Camillo finagles his way onto a communist-sponsored trip to the Soviet Union and sets upon frustrating/annoying Peppone--all to allow the Italian comrades on the trip to see the light. There is even a quite touching episode concerning an Italian and his Polish wife stuck in rural Soviet Union. Setting part of it in the Soviet Union allowed Guareshi to take the gloves off againts communism at another point--although never in a way that detracted from his humor.I was thinking of giving it four stars.

Ms. Browning has a delightful sense of humour and she creates heroes and heroines that are loveable, quirks and all. The chemistry between Val and Mac works wonderfully and the back story adds to their tension to make this a riveting read.

Which is how he ended up in the Outer Banks, posing as a handyman for the young socialite who could clear his stepbrother's name. As a marine archaeologist, Mac was used to digging deep for clues, but nothing had prepared him for the gorgeous woman he suspected of wrongdoing. Only Val Bonnard wasn't the spoiled heiress he'd been expecting. She seemed gentle and caring -- and one look at the dazzling beauty had Mac regretting his promise to play detective, especially when it involved being her live-in Mr. Fix It! Because one way or another he'd get what he wanted -- until he realized that what he wanted more than anything was the woman herself...."},{"Title":"The Search for Solutions.","review":"This discusses the tools of science as modeling, theory, and prediction, but also quests for principles of pattern, feedback, and chance. The blur between model, theory, and reality and the non-linearity of scientific method were presented. By looking at both historical examples, and conversations with modern (as of 1980) scientists the book offers examples of what Judson calls &quot;The Rage to Know&quot;. The photographs offer startling juxtapositions, like derailed train cars and a meandering Cape Cod salt marsh, or a rhinoceros and rhinoceros beetle. The book may not grant the reader the enlightenment needed to answer Judson's &quot;Eight problems in search of solutions&quot;, but there is an appreciation of the effort."},{"Title":"The Search for Solutions.","review":"This is one of those masterpieces of readable science and more importantly, it's about how science is actually done and had been done successfully historically by many of the leading scientists including insights to their mental processes and inspirations. The illustrations and general presentations are most delightful to anyone who appreciates nature as well as science. I am fortunate enough to have a hard copy edition."},{"Title":"The Search for Solutions.","review":"How is it that new discoveries are made in science? Well Judson shows us that it is hard work as well as fortuitous circumstances which create new ideas. Mr. Judson is somehow able to draw from nearly all the scientific fields to relate his ideas.The book covers many different disciplines and shows that underlying all of them are discoveries waiting to be found and understood. His examples are refreshingly beautiful and amazing. I found myself captivated from the start.In some ways reading this book has enabled me to form a more concise mental picture of my own searching and feel at ease with the slow pace of my discoveries. The greatest discoveries in our history come only after significant effort.I would encourage anyone in the sciences or becoming a scientist, or even just a science lover to read this book and enjoy the fresh ideas and insights Mr Judson is able to impart."},{"Title":"I Hate Georgetown (I Hate series)","review":"Do not buy this book.

Pow, she resigns from her job, and starts designing clothes for a living, which becomes a success; along the way, she gains and loses things and people, as well as a whole new outlook on life; As a first wife who hit the road herself, I found it great refreshing, enjoyable and empowering; If you are that phase of life and need a pick me up, this is it; I have also read Ms Phillips \\"Something in Common\\" which came out a few years back, and some of the characters in that novel are back to join us; Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Nice Wives Finish First","review":"This book went above and beyond the expected. I enjoyed watching Ashley bloom, she basically went from a daffodil to a full fledged beautiful rose! This woman lived for everybody else for so long, and her husband of 20+ years took it and spit in her face. Like Donnie McClurkin sings, \\"We Fall Down...\\" and Ashley did indeed \\"Stand.\\" She found her inner strength and not only did she lose her security blanket called marriage, life had additional hills, valleys, and cliffs for her to travel. But the journey was well worth it in the end. Family drama is in full effect, and how she overcomes all obstacles and is finally rewarded in the end, it's inspirational. Ms. Phillips writes a very intricate tale that keeps you entranced with the challenges Ashley faces daily and at a time when she's weakest, but she triumphs over all adversity.

She works a full time corporate job and goeshome to put in overtime as the picture perfect suburban wife. Having acceptedthe diminishing passion in her marriage as part of becoming comfortable withone another, Ashley is happy without all of the glitz. She no longer expectsthe romance and wanderlust of her youth and she embraces the less than perfectimage of herself as well.

Ashley's foundation is rocked like it washit by a horrific earthquake.

Ashley discovered that with age the dream is still there and attainable. I found myself cheering for her through out the book!!"},{"Title":"Nice Wives Finish First","review":"The perfect marriage, fact or fiction? In author Patricia Anne Phillips' latest novel Ashley Lake has no reason to believe that after 25 years her marriage will come to a screeching end, nor does it make sense to her the excuse that hubby Marcus uses to leave. She has always done what a good wife does, and have been known to go to reasonable lengths to do what any wife would do in a comfortable and seemingly balanced marriage. Fade to Marcus and he would adamantly tell you that he is fed up and wants some added spice to this life, moreover, he wants the wife that he first married...you know, less trimming, more pizzazz and certainly more sex.It's a fact that in any marriage time is the barometer to measure substance that will be in place to stick and stay, but when the things that got you to where you are today has suddenly gone south, is it time to look for greener pastures on the other side of the fence? NICE WIVES FINISH FIRST is the kind of love story that would pique interest and have you turning each page for redeeming value, coming full circle with just the right amount of heart to give your wife more of what got you there in the first place. Waiting for the ending result to see how they handle this real dilemma is icing on the cake. It's pure fiction (telling a good story!) when you can find a writer who can craft a different type of story where the characters are looking for more than feel good, or physical love devoid of premise for rhyme or reason.Marcus learns as time progresses why going deeper can be the thing needed to keep her. It's about doing what's necessary for both of their behavior patterns dealing with time-honored sensibilities to come full circle. My compliments to Ms Phillips for writing something that can have others searching for hope and self-worth and they discover inner love and strength at the most trying times. A plethora of issues are examined within the context of the story from infidelity to family secrets, to misplaced integrity. I loved But what shines brightest in this tale is the display of strong friendship and familial love that carries Ashley through some of the most difficult times of her life.

Just days after his 50th birthday party, he tells Ashley he is not happy and wants a divorce. Ashley was the type of wife who did everything for her husband, and nothing for herself, so she was quite surprised to find out Marcus was not happy. Ashley's biggest concern was how would she be able to continue her life at age 45 and after 25 years of marriage. After coming to terms with the demise of her marriage, Ashley takes on a new persona. She decides to open her own dress making business, lose weight, get a fresh new hairstyle and new clothes. She becomes a new woman with a new attitude.Attorney Elliot Douglas is stuck in a loveless marriage. His wife Janet has threatened to take him for everything he has if he divorces her. Elliot drowns himself in his work to forget about what he is not getting at home. When he meets Ashley, he instantly becomes smitten with her. She is on his mind constantly. Finally, Elliot finds a reason to end his misery.Phillips had a good premise for an interesting story. However, there was too much telling versus showing and this technique made the characters appear cold and without emotions. I could not connect with any of the characters and found myself not liking any of them. Ashley's obsession with becoming a size 8 and being 45 years old was tiresome. Aunt Cora and her wig, I am sure was meant to be comic relief, but it was hard to find the humor. I also found the behavior of the characters inconsistent and unreal. The only thing that really moved me throughout the whole book was the death of Ashley's father, Daniel Lake. For those who read Something In Common, Ms Phillips first novel, Helen Graham and Robert Wilbertson make appearances in this book as well. I have read other books of women changing their lives for the better and really enjoyed them, unfortunately for me, this one fell a little short.JeanetteAPOOO BookClub"},{"Title":"Captain Nemo","review":"Captain Nemo is one of those rare titles that captivated me from the first few pages. After reading many stories and many books, it has become less common to find a title which draws me in so quickly and so easily from the first few pages, but this has proven to be such a title and from that early rare moment it never let me down, becoming also one of the few that demands to be read without being putting down for even a moment.Every aspect of Captain Nemo, the way in which it touches the realms of fantasy, science fiction, and even the alternate reality within which this story takes place, are done in a manner that blends them into a perfect harmony. The alternate reality, within which this story takes place, is developed very logically and explained early in the story, allowing one reading Captain Nemo to dismiss questioning thoughts about how such a world came into being and why does such a world exist at the time it does within the story. This allows the reader to fall into the simple enjoyment of the story itself, which is yet another reason I believe Captain Nemo to be one of these rare stories well worth your reading time.Story wise Captain Nemo is excellently developed and when presented with stunning and often breathtaking artwork it has, brings to mind in great sci-fi stories, both movies and novels, of the all time, as well as everything that was wonderful about those movies, and novels, everything which helped to make them timeless.Captain Nemo starts in the year 1893, within a world that is very different than the 1893 of our world. Due to a change in the outcome of historical events, the French winning a battle that in our world they had lost this world of 1893 falls under the oppression of Emperor Napoleon IV. Having won that one battle, France was able to extend its tyrannical rule throughout the world, forging a vast Empire, one which in size and power rivals that of ancient Rome. However, it is not a world in which all accept France as being their rightful supreme rulers, and being one such man is young Captain Nemo. Nemo along with other members of his crew are now considered rebels and outcasts by the French Empire for standing in defiance of Napoleon IV's Empire as they roam at will beneath the surface of the oceans aboard the Nautilus II.Add to this story a cast of characters which truly leap off the page, from Captain Nemo himself, his loyal crew, the man obsessed with finding Nemo, the accidental, but very beautiful visitor to the Nautilus II and you have a better understand of what has made this story so magical for me and what has left me wanting more with each page I have read of Captain Nemo."},{"Title":"Captain Nemo","review":"I loved the spin on this story! Very fun! And yes there is some romance afoot too! Drawings were great too."},{"Title":"Captain Nemo","review":"This English-language manga that was the first volume of a discontinued series in one of Seven Seas Entertainment's numerous original American titles.This is about the son of the original Capt. Nemo fighting to raise an army against Napoleon IV to free Europe from his tyranny in an alternate 1893. Sent to apprehend the revolutionary pirate, the Minister of Security looses his lovely daughter Camille to Nemo Jr. and his crew of the Nautilus II. Nemo claims her to be a captive, but treats her with gentlemanly respect, which woos her to the part of them making out more than once. A visit to the underwater sunken continent of Lumeria reveals one of the last of an ancient race of sea creatures, which is also where Nemo stores a lot of his loot. The book ends with the crew going to Japan to buy weapons for their cause, which was going to lead into material with hot springs and samurai.This is a visually agreeable manga, and sure to please your average steampunk fanatics.

However, I am married to a retired Navy man and I too spent entirely too much time solving problems and raising 2 children while my husband was away. My career was being a Mom and a Navy wife. And, I too was left with an empty nest and a \\"now what?\\" time in my life. In fact, I'm still finding my way, like the heroine in this novel.The mystery is entertaining and the introduction to genealogy is interesting, but the real jewel of this book is the story of Katharine's awakening to find that she is more than someone's wife, mother, or daughter."},{"Title":"Death on the Family Tree","review":"Excellent new series and better written than her other books.E. Ferraro"},{"Title":"Death on the Family Tree","review":"\\"Death on the Family Tree\\" is a great mystery and a little darker than your normal cozy. The main character, Katharine Murray, has much room for growth throughout this series. She is only beginning to question who she is now that her children have left the house, & her husband is away most of the week on business. She is a real delight to watch, & I am sure we will be seeing more of Hasty, her love interest from high school. I am excited to see how Katharine comes to terms with her marriage & her feelings for Hasty."},{"Title":"Death on the Family Tree","review":"If you're standing under it, you should be careful about shaking a tree. You never can tell what might fall out of it. You might even discover things you'll later wish you hadn't. That's the case with Katherine Murray, who is an appealing 46-year old woman living on the outskirts of Atlanta.Like all too many women, she's been daughter, wife and mother, but now it's time to find out who she really is -- just for her own self. The tree she shakes--inadvertently--is her family tree.It seems obvious that the author Patricia Sprinkle is very familiar with Atlanta and its environs and Southern traditions. This book could not have been set anywhere else, it's that grounded in Atlanta's red earth.Genealogy is a truly fascinating topic, and Ms. Sprinkle explores it quite capably here. I found a couple of minor glitches, however, to go along with all the marvelous descriptions and excellent characterizations. One is the necklace of moldy peach-pits. Sounds yucky, and it probably was, but if so, why was it mentioned in the first place? And Lamar Franklin. He played a rather important part in the first third of the book, then fell right off the edge. Of course, why would Kate choose Lamar over Hasty -- the tall, dark and handsome dish from her younger life? And just happens to be a history professor now, and in a field pertinent to her searching! And even if she IS happily married to Tom, with two adult kids to her credit.Oh, well, minor quibbles. Truly, Death on the Family Tree was a very engrossing and enjoyable read, mixing as it does a touch of the fantastical along with the mysteries of centuries or decades ago. I'm off to find volume two in this engaging new series."},{"Title":"Death on the Family Tree","review":"I love both genealogy and mystery novels, so was tickled to find a book that combines the two. What I didn't expect was such a sympathetic protagonist -- a middle-aged woman who literally wakes up one day to realize that, having lived to care for children, husband and aged relatives, she is suddenly in a position to \\"live for herself,\\" and she isn't sure just how she wants to go about that! Katharine also reacts surprisingly (for a mystery novel!)realistically to the events with which she is confronted... if she goes to question someone, it is because the author provides her with a legitimate reason to do so, not just because she is nosy and it is the only way to advance the story. I mean, don't you sometimes get tired of the amateur sleuth that shows up on the doorstep of a complete stranger to question him even though its none of her business, and dangerous, besides? Also, Katharine shows some actual emotional maturity in her relationships and observations about others that is very refreshing... just because she's been a homemaker most of her life doesn't mean she is naive or empty-headed, a novel approach.I love Katharine Murray and can't wait to find out what she does next... do we really have to wait a whole YEAR, Ms. Sprinkle????"},{"Title":"Death on the Family Tree","review":"On her forty-sixth birthday, Katherine Morrow wakes up feeling alone and unwanted. Her husband works during the week in Washington DC and her children have grown up and left leaving her with nothing to do. She has a beautiful home in the Posh Atlantic superb of Buckhead but nobody to share it with. Her dull life suddenly gets more interesting when a box containing a necklace and a diary is delivered from the nursing home where her aunt recently died.She learns that her aunt had a brother that she never knew about who owned the two items she just received. He got them in Austria when he visited there in 1938. Katherine makes no secret about the items but someone obviously wants the diary because her home was broken into while she was there. The robber never saw her but he stole a collection of jade and the diary. Katherine feels lucky that she made copies of the diary but her house is broken into again and this time was totally destroyed. She believes thieves are looking for the necklace and the diary. Two people who knew about the objects were murdered and if Katherine isn't careful, she could be the next victim.Patricia Sprinkle who writes cozies that have no violence in them has started a new mystery series that is every bit as good as her Judge MacLaren Yarbrough and Sheila Travis series. The protagonist copes in one week with more traumatic incidents then most people do in a life time. She earns the admiration of the audience by her actions and the way she copes single handedly with events that are very frightening. The storyline is totally absorbing and the fast paced plot will keep readers turning the pages.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Death on the Family Tree","review":"As a long-time genealogist, I usually find historical research in mysteries entertaining, and this book's story along that line was pretty good. Katharine really did little research -- most everything dropped into her lap -- but she was a beginner. I hope her skills pick up as the series continues. I agree with other reviewers that the number of secondary characters made keeping track of relationships more difficult than it should have been, and some were simply introduced and then faded away -- to turn up in subsequent books? What really irritated me was that too much of the book dealt with Katharine's indulging herself on her husband's dime -- lots of clothes and home decorating descriptions -- but then her whining that his job kept him away too much. For a woman in her mid- to late 40s with an education and two grown kids out on their own, I would have thought by that point she'd have enough inner resources to go get a job, volunteer, something besides wandering around her huge home bemoaning she never uses her pool anymore and that her professionally decorated music room really isn't \\"her.\\" As a single working mother, I guess I couldn't find much sympathy for her plight. Also, I considered some of her decisions just plain dumb. I'll give her one more book to redeem herself with some gumption, self-reliance and the ability to put two and two together."},{"Title":"Death on the Family Tree","review":"I was unimpressed with my earlier reading of Patricia Sprinkle, and decided to give this one a try, as I'm a fan of genealogical research myself. This will probably be my last one, because the novel didn't really click. Perhaps the cozy genre itself isn't my thing.Kate Murray is appealing enough as a main character, with some unexpected edge as she pushes back at her unsupportive husband and flirts with a little action on the side. She sounded a bit like those astronaut wives who, when asked to comment on how difficult it was for their husbands to be in space, remarked that you should realize how hard it was to stay behind and deal with everything. Naturally, our underestimated heroine comes through.The mystery itself and plot are also reasonable, with some surprises in store regarding family relationships. In fact, there are so many characters and relationships by marriage that one might get a tad confused.Two weaknesses were rather clumsy observations about political and religious topics and some silly scenes. As an example, when Kate first goes to the research center and meets two gentlemen who later come to blows, that whole stretch made little sense."},{"Title":"Death on the Family Tree","review":"Jonesing for a good mystery, I picked this book up out of sheer curiousity. It sounded interesting, with it mixing genealogy & murder. I figured that it would at least be good for a lark. It stumbled for a bit in the beginning, but after a while I was hooked.The story follows Katherine, the wife of a wealthy mover & shaker in D.C. who is only home on rare weekends. Following the death of a beloved aunt, Katherine discovers a mysterious journal & a strange green necklace amidst old photo books & souvenirs. What Katherine doesn't know is that despite having been in a musty box for years, these items will spark off a chain of secrets,murder & deceit that will leave her reeling.While I liked this book, it did have a few flaws. First off, the book seemed to stumble about as the author went about setting up the real meat of the book. The flow just didn't seem to settle down until Katherine discovered the items & got started on her research. The other flaw of the book is that Katherine just seemed a little whiny at times. She complains about her husband spending all his time in D.C., yet never does she think about flying down to see him or moving to where he is. (With how inattentive her husband is & with him spending 95% of his time away from her, I kept expecting Katherine to call & find her husband cheating on her.) Perhaps that's why I didn't really get into the first part of the book- it's hard to emphasize with a well to do lady who refuses to do anything to fix her own personal situation. During the course of the study Katherine does start to get a little of her own back, but I can't help but think that one of the next steps should be Katherine trying to fix her marriage & moving to D.C. (Especially since obviously they have enough money to afford her flying down & staying in their second home in D.C.) The other thing about this book that seemed a bit out of whack is the slight supernatural twist the book took at times. It's a very minor plot point, but it just didn't fit in with the rest of the plotline. Maybe it'll be picked up on more in a future book?The mystery is nicely done, although parts of it were a bit obvious at times. Still, it's a nice book to while away a few hours if you are bored. This isn't exactly the type of book you rush out & right away, but it's something you should keep your eyes out for if you want a nice vacation read."},{"Title":"Death on the Family Tree","review":"\\"Death on the Family Tree\\" by Patricia Sprinkle is the first of a series. Katharine Murray is an empty nester. Her children are grown, one in college and one in China for two years. Her husband, Tom, works in Washington, DC and returns to his home in Atlanta only on weekends. The book starts on Katharine's 46th birthday.The characters in this book are very well drawn and the plot situations are realistic. One likes the protagonist and her family and friends. Reading the first book made me want to read the second, \\"Sins of the Fathers,\\" which I have done. Again I like the descriptions and the characters.I do have a problem with the mystery part of these books. I have some trouble understanding the motives of the murderers.

Living in the posh Atlanta suburb of Buckhead, Katherine has all the time and money she needs, but wakes up on her 46th birthday feeling as if she is not needed or wanted by anyone. Then a package arrives from an aunt who passed away, containing a diary and a necklace. Katherine immediately goes on the hunt to find out more about these items, placing her life in danger when her house is broken into. Someone clearly wants the necklace and diary, but who? It all has to do with family secrets that have been buried far too long. Will Katherine survive long enough to find the clues to this puzzle? This story is full of intrigue, scandal and a hint of romance when Katherine's ex-boyfriend shows up to help her solve the mystery.This is a great first installment to a strong cozy mystery series. As a lover of both mystery novels and genealogy, I was so excited to uncover this series by Patricia Sprinkle, who was already one of my favorite mystery writers. This book did not disappoint, and kept me thoroughly entertained! I quickly proceeded to pick up the other two family tree mysteries and devoured them quickly! I'm so sorry that she has stopped writing this series, and hope that she might consider picking it up again. I have enjoyed Katherine's adventures, and would love to read more!"},{"Title":"Death on the Family Tree","review":"As an amateur genealogist, I looked forward to seeing how Patricia Sprinkle would handle this subject, particularly due to the fact that if you're not interested in genealogy the subject can make the eyes glaze over. Ms. Sprinkle did manage to insert some very basic information, but it really wasn't incorporated into the story with good effect. I did read somewhere that as she learns more about historical research, her characters will, too.There seemed to be a lot of loose threads. For example, what happened to Franklin and why was he dropped so abuptly after intruding so irritatingly? And after all the angst about Katherine's mid-life crisis and unsatisfying long-distance relationship with her husband, their ending certainly lacked closure.In addition, it seems for the lack of a new motive in murder mysteries or the lack of new evidence for a haunting, today's mystery writers have latched onto homosexuality as the cause. The last three or four mysteries I've read have this theme.Ms. Sprinkle does \\"get\\" the cadence and idioms of our Southern culture, and I enjoyed the Atlanta backdrop, which is the only reason I gave it three stars; however, no more in the series for me."},{"Title":"Death on the Family Tree","review":"A new series by cozy author Patricia Sprinkle introduces the reader to modern methods of engaging in a favorite Southern sport---searching the family tree.

However, 3 things bothered me about the book (maybe 4 if I include her husband): 1. What was with the supernatural aspects that just never developed into anything? She sees a woman and then has I guess a dream/experience but then that storyline just disappears when she mails the necklace. What was the point? 2. The two guys chasing her in cars was stupid. Fighting outside the copy store? and then one just disappears and is never heard from again just like the ghost lady.3. Other than hiding in the closet space, Kat seemed to make incredibly stupid/passive decisions. Hesty sounded like a hot-head creep to me. Was she really that lonely? 4. How important could her husband really be? I think he just thinks he's important. Come on, he's so rushed all the time they can't alk and he can't come home after all that happened to her? Didn't like him at all. All that said, I like the character and enjoyed finishing the book. I think she writes well, but maybe an editor could have suggested that she tie up some danggling ends."},{"Title":"THE POETRY OF ROCK The most comprehensive collection of great Rock Lyrics ever assembled...from Chuck Berry, Roger Miller, Lennon-McCartney, Paul Simon, Donovan, Leonard Cohen thru the Doors and beyond..plus 16 pages of freaky, familiar Rock heads!","review":"A true treasure that anyone who enjoys old rock will appreciate and cherish.

The consistency between the propaganda tools used during WWII and after the war during the occupation was intriguing and well illustrated, and the use of primary materials gave me a glimpse inside WWII Japan I've never seen before. This book isn't for everyone, but if you're interested in the topic, there's a lot to learn here."},{"Title":"The Thought War: Japanese Imperial Propaganda","review":"This book is a pretty good overview of the Japanese Propaganda campaign during the 15 year war. It cites a lot of primary sources to support the author's goal of breaking down the vision of a Japan completely subservient to the Emperor in a hive-mind fashion. I thought that it was an enjoyable, but not easy read. This is the author's first book and that was made readily apparent throughout by the lack of transition between major points and the constant rambling without achieving any real transmission. If this is a subject you are interested in you will most likely enjoy it, although might find a few of his historical points ridiculous and unsupported. I think the real problem is a first time author trying to tackle the newly available and massive amount of information that covers 1) the entire 15 years war 2) the entire Japanese Empire 3) the growth of propaganda from its birth in Japan and how it evolved PLUS including American views and questioning them throughout the book."},{"Title":"The Thought War: Japanese Imperial Propaganda","review":"I am an avid fan of all film in general and Japanese film in particular.

Once you know the theory (marxism, uses &amp; gratification, etc.), you pretty much know the rest without reading it. Such is not the case with this refreshing book. Cyberspace is still a relatively new phenome non and it is a serious mistake to take our old theories and methods and force them into a mold that doesn't fit. That sort of work produces overdetermined results that are boring. Markham's book is NOT boring. It is a fun and thought-provoking account that will serve as a terrific starting place for serious inquiry about on-line experience. It would be useful and interesting for academics and nonacademics alike. If you are interested in thinking seriously about what happens to our &quot;selves&quot; when we go on-line, and you want a book that is well-written and engaging, you will like this book.I normally don't write these reviews but the reader from Cleveland is so out of line that I just had to offer my two cents worth. This book is an ethnography, so if you are open to such research you will enjoy this book.."},{"Title":"Life Online: Researching Real Experience in Virtual Space (Ethnographic Alternatives)","review":"I first read this book in 1999 and enjoyed the narrative style and the accounts of various Internet users. After re-reading this book, I realized that Annette Markham has completely captured my attention theoretically. The prose is quite easy to read, which makes this book easy to skim. But a slower and more focused read gives quite a different picture, which I missed in my first reading. There is quite a lot of theoretical work which occurs under the surface of the narrative account.I highly recommend this book for anyone wanting to study the Internet from an ethnographic perspective. It provides sound methodological advice and addresses some important issues for anyone conducting qualitative research. But it doesn't address these issues in a direct textbook fashion, which is why it requires close reading. I recommend that this book be read slowly and deliberately, in order to catch the underlying theory which informs this work."},{"Title":"Life Online: Researching Real Experience in Virtual Space (Ethnographic Alternatives)","review":"If you never expected a book that bills itself as an &quot;ethnography&quot; would be an enjoyable read, let alone a page-turner, prepare yourself for a pleasant surprise. Markham's experiences online are lively, funny and weird -- sometimes all at once, and her insights into the meaning of self in the last years of the twentieth century are alone worth the price of the book. &quot;Going Online&quot; is a real testament that academic writing, in the right hands, can be positively invigorating."},{"Title":"Life Online: Researching Real Experience in Virtual Space (Ethnographic Alternatives)","review":"A triumph of flimsy style over hollow substance. There is nothing of value in Markham's book except for the fact that it is just one more addition to the increasing ahistoricism of new autoethnographic work in communication studies. The author contradicts herself with abandon and seems to be tranquilly unaware of the history of social studies of technology. The repositioning of self, testfied to so glibly in the text, is not explained with reference to anything other than the author's own experience.How and why the self is positioned as such under modern capitalism and new technology is not a question that the book bothers to address. Surely theory-building in an academic discipline amounts to more than exploitative recounting of one's own online experience. What of context? What of theory? What of accuracy? If Markham's book serves any purpose at all, it is to reduce academic research to tabloid-like investigative journalism. Some of us might be averse to such a move, but Markham clearly is not."},{"Title":"A land","review":"The book, written a half century ago, should be more widely known than it is. The author, a professional anthropologist, traces out the history of Britain geologically from the time of the first vertebrates, and anthropologically from the first human settlement during the last ice age more than 40,000 years ago. This is an eminently readable treatise, with rich, beautifully written prose throughout and accompanied with a touch of poetry. The book lacks illustrations and maps, and may be slightly the poorer for it to some readers, though not to me. The first part covering the Paleozoic and Mesozoic Eras suffers from the inevitable omission of two subsequent discoveries; one is plate tectonics which bring about continental drift, and the other is the sudden and dramatic end to the dinosaurs and most Mesozoic life in a fiery asteroid impact 65 million years ago. The latter reintroduces us to catastrophism in earthly science, after uniformitarianism had held sway for more than a century and in this book. Nevertheless, Hawkes is remarkably free of much need for revision, despite these omissions, with prose that carries all before it. Nature and man appear all of a piece to Hawkes, even if this unity cannot be sharply defined.

It's a cute story showing a kid (actually a little critter) who remembers to do some things, but forgets to do other things. I like how the story shows a young child doing chores around the house. Sometimes my girls don't want to help out the family, and this book shows that there are children who have jobs just like them. I also like how the mother expresses a variety of emotions when reminding her child what he needs to do. At times it is clear that she is disappointed, but at other times she is very gracious and encouraging to her child. The story has a nice ending when the boy expresses that he never forgets to have his mom read him a bedtime story and give her a goodnight kiss. My only complaint is that the father has an almost nonexistent role in the family. The only time he is introduced in the story is when he comes home from work; he is sitting down waiting for the newspaper. Way to interact with the family dad! Perhaps the other Little Critter books do a better job showing dad in a more positive light."},{"Title":"I Just Forgot","review":"My little guy is five, and we've been reading this book since he was three. Usually he likes to read long books, and has little interest in what he calls \\"short stories\\". This book is short; it only takes a few minutes to read. Mercer Mayer books have a special exemption, however - he loves the stories and this is one of his very favourites."},{"Title":"I Just Forgot","review":"The artistry is delightful, but I don't think I want my child to cherish a book where the mother often looks angry at the child and the child doesn't do what he is supposed to do because he just didn't want to. I wanted a sweet story for my child to go to bed with. This is not that story."},{"Title":"I Just Forgot","review":"In the beginning of Mayer's book, our hero looks straight at the reader, slightly lifts both arms, and states: \\"Sometimes I remember, sometimes I just forget.\\" For example he (or she?-it's difficult to tell the gender in this \\"Little Critter\\" book) puts his dishes in the sink, but forgets to put away the milk. Humorous twists on the \`I remembered this, but forgot this' motif lift this book above the ordinary. For example: \\"I didn't forget to feed the goldfish, he just didn't look hungry,\\" and, after a bath, \\"I didn't use soap, but I didn't forget to. I just don't like to.\\" His mother is alternately tired, frustrated, and amused, and the clever story ends on a warm note. This is a sweet and simple story that manages to cover many familiar situations with honesty and empathy for all involved. Watch for the little mouse friend on every page!"},{"Title":"I Just Forgot","review":"Mercer Mayer has created another wonderful book in the Little Critter series. He has an uncanny ability to connect with children on their level. This book has wonderfully bright pictures that reach out and grab the child's attention. It will bring a smile to your face as you learn that it is okay to forget, because every child forgets sometimes."},{"Title":"I Just Forgot","review":"This book taught kids it's ok to forget somethings in life, but it also teaches them they cannot forget a lot of things, like how much they love their parents. but if you forget minor things like washing the dishes it's ok. I enjoy reading Mercer Mayer books, he can really connect with kids and get on their level, I think kids pick up on the morals. You may get into trouble if you forget things, but all kids do.."},{"Title":"I Just Forgot","review":"This was a funny book. It reminded me a lot of myself and how I leave things on or don't put them away on accident. Another part that reminded me of how I am is how little critter said they didn't forget to close the refridgerator he was just not done eating. I always leave the t.v. on in a room and come back to it because I'm still watching it. This book I think was made to say that you never forget the important things and the things that really matter. It also lets kids know that everyone is forgetful."},{"Title":"I Just Forgot","review":"Overall, I was very impressed with the book. It has bright colorful pictures that will immediately grab the childrens attention! I think all young children should read this book. It teaches them that everybody forgets things, and it is okay. The difficulty level was good for young children, it is at a level where they can understand the book and comprehend it. It is a very cute story and I suggest that everyobody takes the time to read it."},{"Title":"I Just Forgot","review":"I bought several Little Critter books because they received so many great reviews. This is the 4th book I've read and I just can't rate it 5-stars like so many before me have done. Little Critter just gives one excuse after another as to why he didn't do something he was supposed to do. The illustrations are good and this should begin some pretty good dialog between adult and child about how to remember. The reviews really had me expecting more."},{"Title":"I Just Forgot","review":"This book explains to children that it is ok to forget things sometimes most all kids do. But like in the book most kids never forget who or what is most important to them. This book reminds me of me and my brother because we always forget to do our chores but we never forget to tell our parents we love them and tell them goodnight."},{"Title":"I Just Forgot","review":"This was the opinion of my grandaughter (4 years old) after reading the book with me (grandmother)Maria Cecilia explained to me:\\" look , Little Critter behaves very bad -she didn't like the disorder around the Little Critter-, &iquest;why the mother allows him to through things in the floor?; also she didn't like the image of the Critter when is not obeying his mother. She asked me is he is not going to school where one learn good things.At the end, I asked: &iquest;Did you like the story? \\"She said, yes, but I do not want to read it again\\"."},{"Title":"I Just Forgot","review":"I got this book for my niece for Christmas, but I have to admit to like reading it for myself. It brought back memories of elementary school. Maybe I should just grow up...or not! Recommended for your elementary school relatives/children."},{"Title":"I Just Forgot","review":"We have a lot of Little Critter books in this house. They're short, they're funny, they're topical, and they're cheap.This book is a very realistic portrayal of how children remember things, or forget things... or remember what they should do but decide not to do it anyway :)Like, Little Critter forgets to feed the dog, but not the fish - the fish just didn't look hungry! (In the illustration, we can see the fish eagerly eating all the food Little Critter is giving it.) He didn't forget to take his boots off - he's going back out in the rain! He won't forget to put away his toys - oops, maybe he *did* forget.Pretty funny stuff, if my nieces are any indication."},{"Title":"Eden","review":"This is a compelling and exceptionally well researched book that tells the story of one of Great Britain's finest statesman during a period of great change and informs the reader of the background and complex interplay of the forces and characters that influenced Eden's decisions."},{"Title":"Eden","review":"Few reputations in British political history have suffered more than that of Anthony Eden. A rising young star of inter-war British politics, his career was hindered, if not crippled, by his extended tenure as heir-apparent to Winston Churchill for the leadership of the Conservative Party and the nation. Defined for a generation by his resignation in response to Chamberlain's determined policies of appeasement, his premiership will forever be remembered for the disastrous misjudgment of the Suez invasion. So tarnished has his reputation been that his family has commissioned two official biographies since his death. D. R. Thorpe's is the second, following on Robert Rhodes James' biography from nearly two decades before.Thorpe's book is a noticeably sympathetic account of Eden's life, one which helps the reader understand the nature of his appeal. Born to a family that Thorpe characterizes as \\"minor aristocracy,\\" he enjoyed a privileged childhood that was punctuated by service in the First World War. Interested in politics at an early age, he won a seat in Parliament in 1924 where he soon gained a reputation for ability in foreign policy. A little more than a decade after winning his first election, Eden was appointed Foreign Secretary. Over the next three years he faced the rise of an increasingly aggressive Germany, during which time he embraced policies that placed him increasingly out of step with his more conciliatory colleagues but did his reputation much good later on.After his resignation in 1938 Eden quickly became a focus of Conservative dissent in the House of Commons. He was even seen by many as an alternative to the existing prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, though his slow return to office after the start of the Second World War meant that he was not a candidate when Chamberlain resigned in 1940. Eventually returning to his old job as Foreign Secretary, Eden soon emerged as Winston Churchill's successor as leader of the Conservative Party, a position he would occupy with increasing discomfort for the next fifteen years. Though eventually succeeding Churchill as Prime Minister in 1955, he faced a host of problems, most notably Nasser's nationalization of the Suez Canal the following year. Determined to regain the canal, the resulting operation proved a humiliating reversal, crippling Britain's international standing and costing Eden his premiership.An accomplished political biographer, Thorpe offers a solid account of Eden's life, one rooted in a considerable amount of research, including numerous original interviews with people who knew Eden. Yet the book is burdened by an annoying degree of repetition of little details that seems prematurely introduced and then brought up again just a few pages later. Thorpe also seems never to have encountered a quote or an anecdote he didn't like, regardless of its relevancy to the topic being examined. Such matters distract from the overall focus of his point and diminish the broader effectiveness of Thorpe's writing.Despite these flaws, Thorpe has provided what is the best biography of a controversial and disappointing prime minister. Though not as well written as James's earlier study, it benefits from Thorpe's extensive archival research, much of it in collections which was unavailable earlier. As such it stands as a well-supported defense of Eden's career, one infused with much respect for the man and consideration for his achievements."},{"Title":"The British Counter-Culture, 1966-73: A Study of the Underground Press","review":"Nelson's academic approach to the subject renders her treatment of exceptionally lively and fascinating subject matter dry, but fails to be insightful. Her style is pedestrian, sometimes pedantic. Jonathon Green's 'All Dressed Up: The Sixties and the Counter-culture'(1998) and 'Days in the Life: Voices of the British Underground, 1961-71'(1988), Nigel Fountain's 'Underground'(1988), Roger Hutchinson's 'High Sixties'(1992)and Richard Neville's 'Hippie Hippie Shake'(1995) are all so much better. Perhaps part of Nelson's problem is that she is based in Australia, remote from the scene she describes, whereas the authors I mention above were all protagonists in the London counter-culture."},{"Title":"BLUE MOON","review":"Blue Moon is John Leslie's weakest outing with his \\"Conch\\" detective Gideon Lowry. Faced with upcoming wedding of an old flame, Lowry investigates her fianc&eacute; and finds that he has a few skeletons in his closet. The problem with this mystery is you will see the ending coming very early in the book as the foreshadowing makes it blatantly obvious. Leslie still creates a wonderful setting, but Gideon's constant depression starts to wear on the reader. Hopefully this is a trend that will stop with this book and Lowry will be back on track with his next appearance."},{"Title":"BLUE MOON","review":"John Leslie is an extremely good novelist in the mystery genre. That is evidenced by this, his most recent work in the Gideon Lowry series. What Mr. Leslie does is stray from some of the &quot;traditional&quot; elements of mystery, and that makes his work simply excellent.The use of present tense in this novel (the other 3 Gideon Lowry's were written in past tense) had me guessing about the fate of PI Lowry until the very end. It is easy for me to see that Mr. Leslie had fun writing this novel. I laughed out loud when Gideon called Dave Robicheaux (James Lee Burke's character) on the telephone for assitance with the case.But that doesn't mean this book is a comedy. Rather, it is an unforgettable and enjoyable portrayal of a Conch detective trapped by his own roots. I completely enjoyed this work, as I did the other 3 Gideon Lowry books, and am anxiously waiting for more.Thanks, John Leslie. You keep writing them, and I'll keep reading them."},{"Title":"BLUE MOON","review":"I really enjoy continuing character mysteries and I am going to back and read Leslie's previous Gideon mysteries."},{"Title":"BLUE MOON","review":"I've read all of John Leslie's series of detective stories set in Key West and involving the piano-playing sleuth Gideon Lowry, and the most recent one, Blue Moon, is the best of the lot. Lowry has a lot of old girl-friends, and spends a lot of time saving them in interesting ways. Blue Moon is very quick-paced, nuanced and almost gentle. Gideon flies to the mid-west, probing into the past of a man who is threatening the life of a lost love, and then comes back to Florida for an exciting conclusion. Lowry is the most believable private eye in the business. He seems to have the same aches and pains the rest of us suffer, but he still beats up bad guys when the occasion demands. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"BLUE MOON","review":"In this book Gideon Lowery becomes more human to the reader by possibly falling deeply in love with the main character Gaby. In this Cross-Country caper Gideon comes in contact with families that have faced tragedy and they want revenge as well as Gideon himself. As the novel concludes it becomes so intense at the end that you start holding your breath. READ THIS BOOK !!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"BLUE MOON","review":"Fifteen years ago when he was forty-five, Key West private investigator Gideon Lowry had a torrid love affair with Gabriella Wade, which remains one of the top highlight films of his life. When Gabriella, owner of a successful restaurant, asks Gideon to investigate her fianc&eacute;, Roy Emerson, he still is unable to refuse his warmest memory anything.As he inquires into Roy's background, Gideon also has to contend with vicious realtors, who have burned out the store of his neighbor and damaged his own house. Still, these incidents do not slow down his investigation into Roy's life, which makes Gideon feels that Gabriella is marrying a slick dealer with no ethics. However, he wonders if he feels that way because he still has deep affection for Gabriella and believes no one except himself is good enough for her.BLUE MOON is a fun to read South Florida cozy that will elate fans of regional mysteries. The complex sub-plots neatly tie together in a fulfillin! ! g climax. Gideon is a great character, whose flaws (overweight and cellulitus, etc.) make him even more fun to read about and the support cast add to the mood of the story line. With the abundance of South Florida sleuths who run wild throughout the state, John Leslie scribes a more laid back, gentler tale that is an interesting and cerebral change.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Girlfriends (Pop-Up Book)","review":"How can I review unless I have the item?

Lots of theory. Jazz explained from the top down.If you are trying to learn jazz bass from the ground up, as I am, you may want to look elsewhere. The fine print in this book makes the examples hard to read when you sit down to practice.There is so much information presented so thick and fast that, unless you have some solid grounding already, you'll simply get lost or frustrated.Maybe it depends on your learning style. And maybe I'm too much of a beginner It might be used in a classroom situation or as a reference book. But I have not been able to use it to practice and learn walking lines. I have found Jay Hungerford's book more useful."},{"Title":"Mel Bay's Complete Jazz Bass Book","review":"There are very few times in my life I have come across a professional teacher in ANY field who was willing to show the student as much as possible within the limits of time and space. Earl Gately definitely tops this category, for his book is CRAMMED with excellent material, guidelines that flow beautifully from understanding the nature and strengths of the various areas of the fretboard, to simply having a unique layout to the whole book.Now, it is clear that when a teacher WANTS to give his 100% and is limited by those boundaries of space and time- it is possible that one or two wrinkles may not be ironed out. The first time I went through this book, I didnt understand why he didnt tell us immediately how to invent (for lack of a better word) walking jazz basslines, instead of going through all the 15+ positions on the neck first. Then the light came on! I remembered how I went to brazil to study arranging and composing, and instead the wonderful master musician taught me the guitar and all its intricacies ONLY! I was almost peeved till I realized without him saying directly- until you stop being a slave to your instrument, how can you be its master? And the light thus went on, for Gately is TEACHING us the instrument so very well first! And then, further in the book the lessons on basslines feel oh-so complete!I adore this book. And most of all, I love that the author has been so very unselfish. One can go thru this book many times before fully getting the most out of it. I know I will. Thanks Earl!

At the end of the day, I still want to know what I'm eating and over spicing the food takes that experience away. The book is great and has some great recipes and ideas, I especially liked the 5 minute wonders and the section on salads. So, to all you Jamie Oliver fans out there, buy the book, it's still wonderful!"},{"Title":"Jamie's Dinners","review":"We don't all live by farmer's markets or in big cities. Too many ingredients (some hard to find in many places) and too long preparation time for stressed out families. I'm sorry Jamie, but I don't have time when I come home from work to crack open a coconut and shred it for fixing a sallad which, by the way, my family won't like. The amount of fat, especially saturated fat in the recipes is astounding. Fine for once a week, but for everyday? I was very disappointed in this cookbook, I'm sorry to say."},{"Title":"Jamie's Dinners","review":"Jamie Oliver writes cookbooks I look forward to reading and this fifth volume from the Anglo wunderkind chef fully satisfies my expectations.Julia Child, Marcella Hazan, Paula Wolfert, James Beard, and Diana Kennedy write great cookbooks from which I always learn something. Thus, it is always rewarding to read works from these writers. But, Jamie Oliver's books belong to a very select few which are not only educational, they actively make you want to put down the book and go to the kitchen and start cooking. The select group of writers who can do that for me is lead by Jacques Pepin and has recently been joined by Tony Bourdain along with Peter Reinhart, Chris Schlesinger, and his nibs, Jamie Oliver. Even my culinary idols Mario Batali and Alton Brown can't evoke my passion for cooking as well as Messers Pepin and Oliver.Appropriate to this grouping of writers, Oliver's latest effort, \`Jamie's Dinners, The Essential Family Cookbook' is a perfect companion to Jacques Pepin's latest work, \`Fast Cooking My Way'. Both books highlight the way the two chefs cook at home, with the focus being as much on simplicity and readily available ingredients as on speed. As I rarely cook with the intention of being done quickly, but I do appreciate a simple dish with high rewards on the palate, Oliver's book promises AND delivers on exactly the kind of book I like to go to on a regular basis, just like Jacques' work.The theme of Jamie's last book was wrapped around his effort to train 15 deserving unemployed young people and staff a restaurant, \`15' with his graduates. This book is based on a similar socially active theme of improving school lunch meals. Jamie states that he has been doing a documentary on school food programs and how they may be improved. The book gives little information about this film, but it does have a lot of material on food appropriate to school lunches.The first third of the book is devoted to unconventional material and presentations of recipes. The first chapter gives us recipes for Jamie's \`Top Ten' dishes: Sausage and Mashed Potatoes with Onion Gravy; Burger and Chips; Baked Lasagna; Jacket Potatoes (stuffed potatoes for us Yanks); Apple Pie; Roast Chicken and Roast Potatoes; Fish, Chips, and Mushy Peas; Chicken and Sweet Leek Pie; Tomato Soup; and Chicken Tikka Masala. Jamie often likes to offer some dishes as \`the best'. And, I have never been disappointed with any of his \`best' dishes. Many are now part of my standard repertoire. But, whether many are \`the best' may be a matter of taste. His \`ultimate' burger for example includes cumin, coriander, Parmesan cheese, mustard, and raw onion mixed into the burger patty. I am perfectly happy staying with my classic Julia Child recipes incorporating nothing more than saut&eacute;ed shallots into the patty. But, I am sure that Jamie's version is \`a tasty burger'. Even these simple dishes offer interesting techniques. The chips, for example are not fried, they are parboiled, then baked. The lasagna is bulked up butternut squash. The chicken potpie is topped with puff pastry instead of conventional pate brisee. One thing these dishes exemplify is that simple is not always easy. Jamie is not going for speed here, he is aiming at tasty, popular dishes. And, aside from the mashy peas, I suspect every dish will appeal to American tastes as much as it will appeal to our Brit cousins.The next chapter develops an idea I have had for a book for close to a year now, and Sir Jamie got to it long before it was anything more than a notion in my head. This is a presentation of related recipes that begin with a basic preparation such as pesto, then builds on this to create four or five related dishes which use this basic preparation. Ming Tsai wrote a whole book, \`Simply Ming' on this idea. Ming promoted the idea as a method for saving time. I thing Jamie is closer to the practical matter for home cooks when he pushes the ideas as a means for building a good repertoire of dishes from a few simple techniques such as a marinara sauce, roasted lamb, stewed fruit, and puff pastry.Jamie's next chapter is on \`5 minute wonders', that are very similar to the 26 recipe snippets at the beginning of Pepin's \`Fast Cooking My Way'. For this chapter alone, I would have a copy of this book at my desk at work so I could pick up the ingredients for these dishes on my way home. True to Jamie's passion for fresh ingredients, most of the dishes need at least one fresh green or protein.The chapter on sarnies (sandwiches for us Yanks) is meant to elevate this humble preparation to a level which will satisfy even the gourmet palate by being nutritious, fresh, and interesting. I am pleased to find the selection is not limited to Italian influenced Paninis.These chapters alone are worth the price of admission, but we have 200 more pages of Oliver recipes to go. His salads are as interesting as usual with lots of original stuff and a few old standards. The chapters on soups, vegetables, pasta, meat, fish, and desserts are all up to his usual standard.There is a rather unusual chapter at the end of the book entitled \`Kitchens That Work'. It is an uncommon subject for the typical cookbook, but it fits the theme of this book, that being cooking at home. Jamie's primary premise is that his recipes can easily be done in a relatively small home kitchen, which is what he actually has in his home. There are a few simple ideas that I am sure I will include in my long-awaited kitchen renovation. Leading the pack is the notion of a cutting board tabletop for veggies, with separate plastic boards only for meats and poultry.Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Jamie's Dinners","review":"I'm a big JO fan, and ordered this book from the amazon.co.uk site, so I've had it for a few weeks now.

The way Jamie writes, and even the way he uses approximate measures, like a \\"handful of basil\\", encourages the home cook to have more confidence, imagination and fun in the kitchen. A complete beginner may need a book with more exact instructions, but for someone a bit comfortable and practiced, this book can really recharge the way you make everyday meals. i'm grateful to have it in my kitchen!"},{"Title":"Jamie's Dinners","review":"I wasn't sure about getting this cookbook, but WOW is my stomach grateful that I did!

I tried lots of fish and chips recipes before by hoo-ha chefs, all over-complicated, disappointing messy and not-tasty muck, but this one by Jamie was SIMPLE (3 ingredients for the batter) and tasted like perfection! (p.s-try it with a tartar sauce with mayo, mustard, lemon-juice, pickles, onions and a freshly crushed garlic clove...Y-U-M)After trying the fish, I had a drive to try out some of the others so I tried his \\"Roast chicken with lemon and rosemary roast potatoes\\". Now... I make a great variety of roasted chicken dishes, complicated and simple, all BIG hits, and I really thought there was nothing new in the roasted chicken world, until this!!! Wow! My husband and I gorged the whole dish ALONE while quickly abandoning the fork and knife for our hands, licking our fingers every trip to the mouth! The recipe includes stuffing the chicken with garlic cloves and a pierced boiled lemon oozing it's juice...OH MY...speechless is the word! I recommend to eat this dish alone or with the hubby/wife, because it's too good to share with guests! It's our new favorite chicken roast (p.s-stick with fresh herbs, you'll taste the amazing difference!)After two amazing triumphs with Jamie, I went on to \\"The ultimate burger and chips\\". Had it with the hubby and a friend. This burger should have been on that show Oprah had, where her friend explored the top 50 burgers to eat before you die! B-L-I-S-S! This recipe calls for a pestle and mortar, which I never owned and was weary about, but I got one and I am loving it (bye-bye aggression!)We added fresh avocado slices to the bun, besides Jamie's other recommendations...\\"druel-icous\\"! This one makes the \\"junk food/snack\\" reputation of the burger vanish and become 100% Meal!The only danger with Jamie's cookbook is that you can forget about all conventional table conversation period...the eating experience becomes only EATING THE FOOD...AND TALKING ABOUT HOW GOOD IT IS...and having a very sudden urge to be thankful to God for food! (shouldn't that be the correct way anyhow, if you're cooking like you should...or could with Jamie?) This is my idea of an eating-lifestyle one must experience before they die! Life is too short to just eat to fill!It is so refreshing to come across a chef who does all the normal meals we all know and love, but has a deep-food-loving twist that makes it feel like it's the first time ever eating the meal, and who has such a passion for food that you can taste with every bite! Plus, I gotta hand it to him for sticking to the fresh veggies and herbs as opposed to all the dried, frozen and over processed junk there is widely offered today! Don't be afraid to try out new tastes and new herbs...with Jamie they'll become an inseparable part of your meals that you'll marry with the rest of your dishes too!Suggested food blessing for Jamie's dishes: \\"Hallelujah, thank you God for Jamie! Amen.\\""},{"Title":"Jamie's Dinners","review":"This is my first Jamie Oliver cookbook. His TV shtick never appealed to me, but when I read about his really admirable work at improving school lunches in the UK and providing training for school-leavers at \\"15,\\" his London restaurant, I decided he merited some support. Besides, we definitely needed to widen our repertoir of home dinners.I've been very favorably impressed by the book. I've made about seven or eight things out of it now, and all have turned out to be excellent. Unlike some reviewers, I didn't mind the lack of precision in some recipes (I've always relied more on just using a \\"lug\\" of olive oil than measuring it, anyway), and I've learned to deal with the occasional editing lapse--if you read the whole recipe before starting (good advice I don't usually follow) you discover the \\"beaten egg\\" called for in the Spanish roast chicken isn't actually part of the recipe anyway.So I recommend this book very highly. I should mention that although there are a number of recipes that the author describes as hits or favorites of his children, we've yet to find recipes in the book that will enchant young and old alike. (I don't rule out that this is only because he prepares them better than I do.) But I'm happy to keep plugging away at it, because literally everything has pleased the old, and that's who's doing the cooking!"},{"Title":"Jamie's Dinners","review":"This is a gorgeous cookbook...to look at. The pictures and lay out are fantastic but I found the recipes to be a bit \\"out there\\". I was expecting awesome, easy , family recipes. I found maybe four or five recipes in the book that my family would eat. I mentioned the \\"squahed fig, basil and parma ham sarnie in tomato bread\\" to my husband and he just looked at me with a blank stare. I also doubt that my three year old will go near the \\"Sweet Duck Legs Cooked With Plums and Star Anise\\" but I will try some of the recipes.JO does provide an excellent chapter on vegies, how to select and prepare etc. Don't get me wrong, I will enjoy this book, I won't regret spending the money however it will not become the family cooking bible that I had hoped for."},{"Title":"Jamie's Dinners","review":"I like this cookbook a lot. It's full of recipes I'll actually be able get my family to eat. The recipes call for ingredients I already have in my cupboard or refrigerator. The recipes don't use fatty or over-processed foods (like cheese and sausages) as main ingredients -- and the recipes that DO call for such foods can 'swim' without them. He gives hints that I can choose to use or not. There are a lot of fish, beef, and vegetable recipes... with fun, colorful ideas. And his recipes are fun to read! These are all attractive options for my family because I have to avoid using corn derivatives, which are in every food item that's been packaged in a US plant... so it's nice to finally find a cookbook that sticks to wholesome, unprocessed ingredients that food allergy sufferers can work with."},{"Title":"Jamie's Dinners","review":"This has to be one of my favorite cookbooks, not only because the recipes are healthy, tasty and family friendly, but because one really becomes absorbed in the ambiance of the book.There is a rustic, hominess and familiarity to the recipes, pictures and descriptions that makes one feel that they are included in Jamie's quirky, British style.I love the pictures of Jamie eating a sarnie on the street curb and the lasagne pictures with the cheese melted to a crisp along the edges of the pan; and someone has already dug in!My kids and I love the bowtie pasta with peas -- whoever thought they'd agree to eat a pea? This pasta is the only way they'll do it.Certainly not classical cuisine fare, but good, homey rustic eating and lots of Jamie, as well! How can you beat that?!"},{"Title":"Jamie's Dinners","review":"This is a great cookbook. The organization and ideas are very good, and the recipes I have tried tasted great. (The recipe for the roasted chicken alone is worth buying the book!) His recipes are not overly complicated, and there are a lot of easy modification ideas included with most of them. There are two reasons I did not give it a full 5 stars. The first is that the vagueness of his measurements is a little annoying. (ie, \\"knobs\\" of butter) The second is that an earlier reviewer said that the recipes are fairly healthy. While many are, or could be modified to be healthy, many are not. I was hoping for a little less cheeze and cream. Over all though, I am thrilled with this book!"},{"Title":"Jamie's Dinners","review":"I completely lack any culinary talents but I made the porkchops entree and it turned super! Exactly like the picture - which looks like a gourmet dish - and so very delicious! The recipes are easy to follow and easy to modify to your tastes!

He is very charming, love the accent!"},{"Title":"Jamie's Dinners","review":"You can never go wrong with Jamie,I own all of his books and this is my favorite. He makes the simplest ingredients come to life. Gives you a whole new perspective on english food."},{"Title":"Jamie's Dinners","review":"I absolutely love Jamie Oliver, let me say that, and when you watch him on tv, he makes cooking seem so simple. This book would require a whole shift of thinking for Americans, in food. Not saying that is a bad thing, mind you, but I had hoped for a book that I could actually use, and this isn't going to be it. I don't have children, but I can't imagine American children eating this food, so the premise that it's for family dinners had me feeling a bit doubtful. I don't think I could even get my husband to eat anything in this book, even if I could cook it. It was just alot more intimidating that I expected. And, I've never seen creme fraiche in a store here, ever. I know alot of cooks on foodnetwork use it too. I enjoyed the photos and reading Jamie's style of talking, but there is maybe 1 or 2 recipes I could even attempt in this book. (and I'm not a novice cook) I'm going to try to check out some more of Jamie's books from the library (as I did with this one) and hopefully can find something that I could conceiveably use."},{"Title":"Jamie's Dinners","review":"This is a great, easy to follow book. It's not too complicated, and the end result is always wonderful.An excellent buy!"},{"Title":"Jamie's Dinners","review":"This is my frst cookbook by Jamie Oliver but it wont be my last.I enjoy his style of cooking which is about using healthy and good foods and making delicious but not complicated food.The cookbook itself is full of yummy color pictures of the dishes and was gorgeous just to look at."},{"Title":"Jamie's Dinners","review":"Jamie Oliver aka \\"The Naked Chef\\" is my favorite celebrity chef and former Food TV cooking show host. I learned to cook watching his shows. This cookbook is chock full of recipes for parties and family events. There are 120 recipes beautifully illustrated with color photos and simple instructions. Jamie Oliver makes cooking fun, fast and easy. You don't need to be a pro to have a hearty, healthy meal in minutes. Buy this book!

Good foods to entertain your family and friends!"},{"Title":"Jamie's Dinners","review":"After buying this book I have become a huge Jamie Oliver fan. It is by far the best cookery book I have ever bought. The recipes are easy, the ingredients aren't too weird or difficult to find, and he uses a lot of the same ingredients for different recipes. The results are amazing! Even my 3 year old and 18 month old love the recipes from this book.I highly recommend Jamie Oliver's book - the man is a genius in the kitchen!"},{"Title":"Jamie's Dinners","review":"I love this book.At first glance, many of the recipes look a bit \\"out there,\\" but they are all pretty intriguing so you want to try them out. Once you try them out a) you are surprised at how simple the recipe actually is and b) you are hooked on the book. At least, that's how it worked for me.Personal favorites: my finicky son loved the mac 'n cheese. In fact, it has loads of tomatoes and then, I added spinach to it. So it was healthy in terms of macs.The South Indian Seafood soup was a hit. As was the chorizo/chickpea soup.Looking forward to more cooking with this book!"},{"Title":"Jamie's Dinners","review":"i got this book a few years ago when i first wanted to cook professionally. i am now a dinner chef at a cafe, and this is my go-to cookbook when i cant think of the last dinner special or salad for the night. everything is presented in an easy to follow, throw together style, and you rarely have need for a mesuring device other than your hands. i dont think ive made any recipe in this book that i havent liked. i have bought this book as a present on a few occassions for cooks of all levels. i definately recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Jamie's Dinners","review":"This is a different kind of cookbook in my opinion, in a good way.I LOVE reading Jamie's comments, he writes just like he sounds on TV which makes the book VERY enjoyable. I often read it before I go to bed. I didnt actually want this cookbook, but I got it last year as a X-mas gift and I am gald. Some of the recipes are ummm different, that is why when I saw it for the first time I didnt buy it. I think that is me though, I am still new to cooking and I dont think I could pull some of these recipes off. With that said after I actually took time to read it there are penty of recipes I plan on trying. It is a HUGE book and it took me some time to thumb through. As a newbie to cooking there are lots of good meal ideas and ones to aspire to. It is worth the money just for a good read :)"},{"Title":"Jamie's Dinners","review":"I loved this book. I live on my own and wanted a book that was no frills, easy, healthy cooking and not for 6 people at a time! His 5 minute wonders are meals you can make for one in five mins and I've tried all of them. Fantastic, I'm never getting fast food take aways again cos these taste better and are far far healthier. I can't praise this book enough, it's all about taste taste taste...yum."},{"Title":"Jamie's Dinners","review":"This is one of his best and his most practical for the amateur chef who likes to eat well and, on the whole, healthily. Really helpful and interesting recipes (even if we have seen some of them before) chosen with great imagination and told with his usual wit and charm. Beautifully designed and illustrated as usual. My only crits - of all Jamie's books - I wish he were more accurate about some measures: what exactly does he mean by a \\"slug\\" of oil, or a \\"handful\\" for instance? For American readers (who must far outnumber the Brits) alternative measures by cups are almost essential. We don't need/want to be dragging out the scales all the time, do we? And finally, Jamie, isn't it time for an index of ALL the recipes in ALL your books? It's maddening having to search through five of them to find a recipe. Maybe this could be a slim and inexpensive volume attached to some interesting, out of the way, specialized recipes. Apart from those two things, wonderful addition to the cook's library. Thanks, Jamie!"},{"Title":"Jamie's Dinners","review":"This is a great, fun book. It really captures Jamies love of cooking, and presents it in a way that isnt hard to understand or intimidating at all for the novice cook. The recipes are very relaxed, the presentations are real looking in the photos. and there are photos of everything in the book..I sat down and read through the whole book like it was a novel. The only reason i gave four stars is that i tend to agree with another reviewer who said some of the ingredients arent readily available to us here in the US. I personally dont live in a town with a fresh food market, although i wish i did! All told, i was certainly inspired to try serveral of the recipes right away..yum! It gave me a new perspective on what i buy in the grocery store-fresh is best!"},{"Title":"Jamie's Dinners","review":"It's a great book, plenty if recipes really easy and with a lot of variety. It has influences from a lot of different countries and the plates are very healthy. A lot of good ideas."},{"Title":"Jamie's Dinners","review":"I am a medium-skilled cook who enjoys cooking and hosting. I don't like overly simple recipes, but I also don't like to spend all day making something. I like food of all types, particularly Asian and Indian. I tend to be a healthy eater who prefers cooking with natural ingredients.I have found some of my all-time favorite recipes in this book. There is an Indian seafood stew that is really amazing. Another favorite dish includes tortillas with hummus, beef and a simple lettuce salad inside. I also really love the simple Quesadilla recipe. There are also basic recipes like great guacamole and pesto.One thing I like about this cookbook is that it isn't exact in it's measurement. It tells you to add an ingredient without really getting finnicky about how much. Of course, this requires a little knowledge of ingredients, but I have found it empowering to need to use my brain rather than simply following a recipe.Many cookbooks have a bunch of recipes I'll never use alongside a few favorite recipes I'll make all the time. This book has a higher percentage of recipes that I actually make on a regular basis. I find that they are original but not too far from classic. Really unusual food is fun to make once but maybe not to make again. This cookbook doesn't stray too far, so the recipes are attractive to repeat.One of the greatest things about this cookbook is it has show me the beauty of parsley. I never cooked with parsley and thought it was just something you throw on a plate to make the fish sticks look healthier. Jamie uses a lot of fresh ingredients, so it is easy to eat healthy from this cookbook. The cookbook isn't full of lean recipes, but at least the recipes are made from natural ingredients and accompanied with lots of fresh herbs.Overall, very happy! I also own Jamie at Home, and so far I prefer Jamie's Dinners."},{"Title":"Jamie's Dinners","review":"I've been getting into family-themed cookbooks lately and purchased Jamie's Dinners having looked at it many times in the bookstore. Made The Ultimate Burger and Chips (p.6) last night. Prior to this recipe, I used the master recipe from another well-known cookbook. I had always received the usual: \\"thanks mom, that was good.\\"My family came to me after having Jamie Oliver's burger dinner and said: \\"We'd Like to Thank JAMIE OLIVER\\". That was a first! It was one of those devour-experience-swoon kind of experiences. If it's any indication of what the cookbook offers, it is a very good start indeed.The burger/fries preparation was different to what I was accustomed to. I wondered if the burgers were going to hold up to the heat because the patties (fries were parboiled) had several wet ingredients introduced to it. They came out perfectly moist and flavorful and had minimal shrinkage in the pan. These burgers stayed flat instead of morphing into round pucks in the pan like most burger recipes.It was a pleasure to prepare this recipe - I'm of the camp that looks at a recipe and, to use Jamie Oliver's word, - uses a \\"glug\\" here a \\"glug\\" there - this is the kind of recipe book that has an easygoing but basic straightforward approach to cooking and isn't whacking you on the head for \\"perfection\\". One doesn't feel the need to fret or worry about how it's going to turn out. It turns out all good and to me that is the essence of the family meal experience."},{"Title":"Jamie's Dinners","review":"This is my ultimate favorite in recipe books. The recipes are easy and the instructions perfect. Jamie is one of the best chef's of his day. He just keeps surprising us with everything he does. These days he's gone organic and is gardening is own vegetables and fruit...excellent. I have other books by him too but this one I really like because the recipes are soooo easy and there are so many ideas for variation. Well done Jamie (once again)!"},{"Title":"Jamie's Dinners","review":"This is another one of Jamie's excellent cooking books. No complicated cooking or deep knowledge is necessary to achieve what Jamie does."},{"Title":"Jamie's Dinners","review":"I just love this book! I'm an experienced cook and have tried tons of different recipes from books, cooking magazines, etc. but Jamie's Dinner still gave me new inspiration and great, healthy, esay-to-follow recipes. Best of all, his recipes are also designed for frugal chefs and emphasize seasonal ingredients. It's an awesome book for beginning cooks (think: your kid in college) and a beautiful gift for even the experienced cook. Two thumbs up!"},{"Title":"Jamie's Dinners","review":"As usual Jamie drives you to his amaying world of easy, fun and joyfull cooking!A good item to start your cookbok collection"},{"Title":"Jamie's Dinners","review":"I like the book!

I bought this book a few years ago on a whim...I've always loved cooking and this was my first cook book i bought. I had moved out on my own and i found it a great book AND i didnt have kids at the time...i loved reading what he had written in between and i found the meals i made great and adjustable to my own tastes. In fact i still flip through it now for a brush up on the roast chicken recipe that has been my main dinner that I've made and altered off of his!I loved the pasta recipes...I lived and grew up in Italy for 8yrs and although they're not exactly authentic they're still great versions for people just starting out or wanting refreshers on recipes...in all i like the book. The only reason I didnt give it 5stars is because of the presentation and that it wasn't \\"girlie\\" enough for me.lol. BUT it's still used and is still a staple in my cookery book collection. :)"},{"Title":"Jamie's Dinners","review":"God I love Jamie! As if his being so darned cute wasn't enough, it seems he does not know how to come up with a recipe that isn't fabulous. Well, granted, while I have about 5 of his books, I haven't done too much cooking out of them, mostly just because I also have another 100 or so other books to cook from. (and yes, alas, more on the way...can I help it?)Anyway, a friend introduced me to this cookbook last year by preparing the \\"Jool's Favorite Beef Stew\\", and being that I'm not really a fan of stew, I didn't think I would like it that much. Usually I'm more of a soup girl, and stews just end up feeling like overcooked soup where all the water accidentally got cooked out. Much to my surprise, this stew blew my whole idea about stews being yucky.His recipes somehow have a way of being so simple and homey feeling, even when the list of ingredients can be quite long. He captures the essence of comfort food, and even though his foods fall into what I call \\"healthy gourmet\\", they will fill up even the most ardent \\"meat and potatoes\\" guy (of which we have lots of here in the Rocky Mountains!)If you're tired of your other homey-foods cookbook and need one that will put a new twist on familiar ingredients, give this one a shot! Oh, and make sure you try the stew!!!"},{"Title":"Jamie's Dinners","review":"I love cookbooks. I collect them. They hold the promise of beautiful pictures and great food. and if all goes well, inspiration.Jamie Oliver's Jamie's Dinners delivers in droves. I purchased this and his My Guide to Making You a Better Cook atthe same time. I havent opened the second one because I have become so enamoured with this one. I have had the books for about a week, and I have cooked out of Jamie's Dinner every night. The results have been delicious.The recipes are clear, and still conversational. You can tell to a point he cooks by feel, and he lets you get away with it as well. There's also a good deal of experimentation, and twists on old favorites in here. All are lovely.Another great thing is that the recipes are easy, with non strange, or hard to come by ingredients. (Granted living out in the boondocks makes for a few challenges, but still..)A fantastic cookbook. It's one you really will want to cook out of every day, and one that will inspire you to cook more and become more acquainted with your food.Everything in here is exceptional.

I have seen many books about airplanes because my 3 1/2 year old seek out everything we can find on the subject. This book is exceptional.The illustrator is a liscensed pilot and does an excellent job of capturing the magic of airplanes in flight. The style is realistic, but not photographic. There is a delightful variety of colors, perspectives, and lighting, and the intricate detail in some of the illustrations invites you to take a good long \\"drink\\" with your eyes.What knocked me over with this book, however, is the fantastic poetry. This is no amateurish rhyme. The words flow easily off your tongue as you read aloud to your child. The text is arranged on the page without punctuation (no capitalization either except for the words Mach and Navy), which adds to the readability and the artistry of the page. Each page is devoted to a particular type of plane, although they are described by what they do, rather than by their specific names (e.g. \\"sly planes, spy planes\\" on the page showing a SR-71 Blackbird).The information that has been unobtrusively incorporated into the rhyme avoids simple classification of airplanes by name. In fact the names of the planes aren't part of the text. Instead, the focus is on what different planes do and all the different places you will find them. This isn't done in a dumbed down way. My son already knows the names of many of the planes illustrated and delights in identifying them. We didn't need another catalog of planes, so this book fills an empty niche in our library.This book is unique among those I've seen so far in that it beautifully introduces youngsters to airplanes and draws them into the magic of flight while satisfying \\"veteran\\" plane loving kids with references to what they already know. I can't say enough about it."},{"Title":"Plane Song","review":"After having enjoyed sharing Train Song, by Diane Siebert, with both my toddler and my husband, I looked forward to reading Plane Song. Siebert delivers again with Plane Song! Words take flight in fanciful form, illustrating through language the poetry of planes in flight. The beautiful paintings by Vincent Nasta stir the imagination of readers young and old. Because of the perspective of each painting, the reader feels as if they are flying, too. From jet planes to bombers, fire-fighters to bush planes, crop dusters to &quot;rag bags,&quot; the lyrical sound of Siebert's words read aloud invites readers to &quot;spread their wings in flight.&quot; Plane Song is an excellent choice for young readers or plane fanciers."},{"Title":"Plane Song","review":"Vincent Nasta was my art teacher in highschool. He was kind, smart, talented and very funny. I am a successful artist today because of the encouragement he have me in highschool, as well as the practical painting and photoshop skills he taught. In 2008 he died while flying a plane in an airshow [...]. I purchased this book after returning home from his wake, and when it arrived, I held it to my chest while crying uncontrollably for several hours. I liked to do this a few times a day for the entire mourning period. The shape of the book and its relative thinness made hugging it very easy, but unfortunatly I have barely gotten to enjoy the artwork as I haven't wanted to ruin the pages with the tears of an infinite sadness, since they are amazing paintings of planes."},{"Title":"Plane Song","review":"Like so many of our children's favorites, this book sweeps the reader off in lilting rhyme, and is beautifully illustrated with very accurate paintings of a host of different types of aircraft: huge jets, crop dusters, commuter planes, tail draggers, etc. The book truly engenders enthusiasm and appreciation for the magic and diversity of flight. My husband and I both are pilots, and found it a wonderful way to introduce our young twins to the excitement of aviation. My only reservation is that the illustrations depict male pilots only!"},{"Title":"The Blueberry Saga: Confederate Gold","review":"With a written essay to introduce the Blueberry Sage so far and a two-page bio of the writer and the artist respectively other than the additional 14-page story &quot; three black stones&quot;, this paperback collection of Mr Moebius' masterpiece is a must-have for both new and die-hard fans alike. Yet the big drawback of this book is that it's considerably downsized to 7&gt;&lt;9 inches and printed in B &amp; W.

North. Written without accessive jargon, this book is accessible to any intermeidate level student of Economics and Political Science. North argues that institutions (laws, rules, regulations) in their fromal and informal varieties determine economic performance. North has an almost guru-like status in the eyes of the World Bank. Third World countries remain poor, argues new institutionalism, because their institutions foster corruption and distort incentives. But what is the solution?It is hard to imagine that one can graft institutions. How can the rules that function in the U.S. function under all kinds of social and political circumstances? The other troubling point is that it is still hard to integrate this approach with mainstream economics. A serious economist today is trained to shy away from anything that cannot be mathematically modeled. More troubling, however, is the following: neo-institutionalism argues that rules, laws, and regulations structure incentives, which in turn determine economic performance. A thoughtful person probably guessed this a long time ago based on common sense--one does not need a scholarly approach to advocate this position. &quot;Incentives are the underlying determinants of economic performance,&quot; says North (p. 135). It is hard to disagree."},{"Title":"Institutions, Institutional Change and Economic Performance (Political Economy of Institutions and Decisions)","review":"i used this book for my capstone class, i swear i read it about 3 times, it was very informative and drew references from other parties who spoke about the work before him... check it out"},{"Title":"Institutions, Institutional Change and Economic Performance (Political Economy of Institutions and Decisions)","review":"In this book, North outlines the precise features of the neo institutional economics school, which includes Coase, Williamson, Olson, Fogel, among others. This book is mainly about the theory itself and its origins and features, not about applications in particular, though the author does address that issue at the end of the book in the section about eocnomic performance.I believe this book is great reading for the literate economist. It is difficult to follow for the non-economist, which I believe North focuses on in his other book, &quot;Structure and Change in Economic History&quot;. That work is earlier and I believe not as complete, but it is much more readable. Either way, North's work is among the most important advances in economics in the 20th century (for which he got the Nobel Prize), so knowledge of it should benefit one and all."},{"Title":"Institutions, Institutional Change and Economic Performance (Political Economy of Institutions and Decisions)","review":"Douglass North is an amazing writer. If you are purchasing this book, you probably already know what this book is about and its impact. This book, I would argue is largely responsible for his receiving the Nobel Prize in 1993.His new-institutionalist view links together history, economics, political science, sociology, and every other social science. This book truly inspired me to specialize in institutional economics. Every social issue can be approached from the institutional perspective, namely that institutions determine actions and the market determines institutions. Though my professors are all old institutionalists, they agree this is the best book by far on the subject and most research papers in the subject thus reference this book.For more information on New Institutional Social Science, visit the website at http://cniss.wustl.edu/people.html"},{"Title":"Institutions, Institutional Change and Economic Performance (Political Economy of Institutions and Decisions)","review":"This is a really good and insightful book for anyone interested in economics, especially as it relates to determining factors in economic growth. In about 150 pages, North presents an interesting and thought provoking theory of economic growth."},{"Title":"Institutions, Institutional Change and Economic Performance (Political Economy of Institutions and Decisions)","review":"As a fan of the economic focus on institutions, I was excited to read one of Douglass North's books. North is the founder of this school, it would seem, and won a Nobel for it.Unfortunately, North's book hasn't enough mathematics to satisfy those with a quantitative bent, nor enough elegance to captivate anyone. I had to put it down after 80 pages (of 140 or so). I haven't felt like precious moments of my life were being lost so viciously since I last hurled Cryptonomicon across the room. I'm told that I should read North's papers rather than his books; this seems wise.If you want to read books that refocus economics on institutions, I'd strongly suggest starting with Bowles's \\"Microeconomics: Behavior, Institutions, and Evolution.\\" It's the best synthesis of the subject that I've seen, bringing in threads from evolutionary game theory and probably every major economist from the last 75 years."},{"Title":"Institutions, Institutional Change and Economic Performance (Political Economy of Institutions and Decisions)","review":"Very dissatisfied, simply i paid for a new book and recieved a used one. I do not recommend dealing with the seller."},{"Title":"Institutions, Institutional Change and Economic Performance (Political Economy of Institutions and Decisions)","review":"These are strange times in the economics profession. Most economists insist upon representing actual economic systems with mathematical models that bear little resemblance to reality. The results of these models are often quite strange. Government deficits are offset by taxpayers who save more money in anticipation of higher future taxes. Monetary policy is neutral; it has no real predictable effects. We are in equilibrium in every phase of the business cycle. Investors might as well pick stocks by throwing darts. Economic analysis is judged by its formalism, not its realism.This book by Douglass North is a refreshing change from \`economics as usual'. Here the factors that matter most are real institutions and actual history. North draws upon the right kind sources for his theoretical underpinnings (Coase, Hayek, Ostrom, Olson, Veblen- yes Veblen too). North also focuses on an issue of primary importance- economic performance through time. How does economic development happen? Why does it happen in some nations and not others?There are some important ideas here. We need to think in terms of adaptive efficency (p80-81). Incremental changes in institutions comes from entrepreneurs (p8). We should understand institutional change in terms of transaction costs, relative prices, and ideology (p86). North has constructed a theory of institutional change using a blend of common sense and subtlety that is rare in modern economics. This book should be required reading for all econ grad students.There are some historical examples sprinkled through this book. Personally, I would have liked to see more history. But it is still the case that there is more history here than one typically finds in contemporary economics. Institutions, Institutional Change, and Economic performance is not easy reading, but it is easier to read and vastly more informative than the math models that most economists try to pass off as proper economic analysis."},{"Title":"Institutions, Institutional Change and Economic Performance (Political Economy of Institutions and Decisions)","review":"North's work attempts to show how hard-rational choice theory and neoclassical economic theory are weak in that they argue that cooperation and coordination are not fundamental to transactions. North writes that in the \\"zero transaction-cost world, bargaining has no place, however, in the real world, institutions, bargaining and cooperation are necessary\\" (16).The author argues that the rigidity of the human behavior described by hard-rational choice theorists is not practical in a real-world sense. For example, actors do not have perfect \\"computational power\\" and as such they don't have a perfect description of the world. Rather, the situations faced by actors are complex and uncertain. As such, transaction outcomes are unpredictable. North writes, \\"Uncertainties arise from incomplete information with respect to the behavior of other individuals in the process of human interaction\\" (25).In order to protect oneself or maximize his or her individual utility, an individual must collect information regarding a transaction. The costs of transaction \\"consist of the costs of measuring the valuable attributes of what is being exchanged and the costs of protecting rights and policing and enforcing agreement\\" (27). Institutions are created to generate regular patterns in human interaction. Doing so decreases the costs of transaction, or \\"playing the game.\\"However, the game is never stable and as such institutions are malleable; they are capable of change. Yet the changes occur slowly, by increments. In the later chapters of the book, North takes a historical look at economic development, stability and change. Had all things been equal, transaction costs being zero, North argues that little diversity between economic systems would exist. North writes, \\"In a world in which there are no increasing returns to institutions and markets are competitive, institutions do not matter. If the actors initially have incorrect models and act upon them, they either will be eliminated or efficient information feedback will induce them to modify their models\\" (95). However, in real-world situations, institutions do matter and they are in continuous need of minor, or marginal, adjustments. In many ways, it is the behavior of the actors that make adjustments to the institution. North writes, \\"Incremental change comes from the perceptions of the entrepreneurs in political and economic organizations that they could do better by altering the exiting institutional framework at some margin\\" (8).In conclusion, new institutionalism has emerged in response to the concentration on behavioral/rational choice theories in the discipline. The new institutionalism attempts to \\"bring the institutions\\" back in to political science. However, institutional scholars have evolved from the days of strictly studying the political systems of polities. The new institutionalism attempts to blend aspects of behavioral/rational choice theories with the importance of institutional structure and establish a new paradigm with which to study political phenomena."},{"Title":"Institutions, Institutional Change and Economic Performance (Political Economy of Institutions and Decisions)","review":"I have a hunch that this is one of the kind of books such that only people whom have in a sense already specialized come upon it and decide to buy it. First: if you are one of these kind of people, the articles contained in this volume are well written and though not classics, could further your understanding of 'our' field. Second: if you are not already a specialist, there are other books by Douglass North and Mancur Olson that can better illustrate the general principles on which the economic/political hybrid field is based....

How do democracies, with well-defined property rights and education for all com into place? In this Nobel prize winning work, North investigates some issues overlooked by most economists: the role of a society's institutions, defined as formal and informal constraints, varying from written laws to vague values (but important nevertheless) in a society. Economic theory is not able to explain the great differences in wealth between nations, argues North, and that is certainly a shame, because that would be the most interesting explanation it could possibly make. The solution is to include institutions into economic analysis.Institutions determine transaction costs. In neoclassical economic theory, transaction costs are usually assumed to be zero (for reasons of comfort). North assumes transaction costs to make up half of the economy in a modern well-organized Western society with efficient institutions. A major reason for developing countries to be poor is that transaction costs are prohibitive, obstructing the benefits of trade.North asks some extremely important questions in this book, but I was a bit disappointed that he didn't offer more answers. English not being my natural tongue, I found the book a bit hard to read. However, being very interested in the subject, I found it well worth the effort. Without a major (interest) in economics, you should probably enjoy some of the reviews instead. North's main answer to the main question, by the way, is that countries will prosper if the incentives created by their institutions motivate production, and not redistribution."},{"Title":"Institutions, Institutional Change and Economic Performance (Political Economy of Institutions and Decisions)","review":"This is the great founding book in systematic and specific study of institutions as a determinant factor in the economic performance of a nation (or any other kind of polity). The author is a Nobel prize winner, and his book is characterized by an economy of words, as well as precission and clarity in his thought. Although it would seem obvious that institutions play a decisive role in economic performance, it hasn't been the case along the history of economic thinking. North begins by criticizing the cold and abstract Neo-Classical model, a la Robert Solow. Yes in fact, output is the result of the conjunction between capital and labor, plus the further addition of knowledge (technology) to the equation Q = K x L x (e). But this model is really effective only under the assumption of open and competitive markets, perfect and equally accessible information, and zero transaction costs. We know the real world is not like that. We now know also that \\"rational choice behavior\\" is neither absolute nor unanimous, and that each \\"actor\\" defines the \\"rationality\\" of his choices according to his view of the world and himself.There are two kinds of institutions: formal (laws, codes, public policy, business policy, etc.), and informal (traditons, religions, modes of organization, family and social habits). Both are equally important, for they determine the rules of the game. In turn, rules determine what kind of knowledge is worth acquiring, what activities are profitable, and how to relate to others, which, in turn, determines economic performance. An innovation-rewarding society will tend to be technologically advanced, whereas a conformity-rewarding society will stagnate. Another important statement of the book is that institutions change in a marginal and incremental way. Even after revolutions and radical changes in political regimes, informal institutions tend to persist and in any case they change very slowly. North uses the example of the Russian Revolution: even though it is most likely the most radical and sudden social change ever experienced, there is still much of Tsarist Russia in its contemporary society, after the Soviet regime came and left. Tocqueville made the same observation about the French Revolution in his masterful \\"The Ancient Regime and Revolution\\": France ended up with an Emperor and several kings after the republican bloodshed and well into the XIXth Century, and social change came about slowly.By generating winners and losers, institutions create \\"path dependence\\". Even when it is clear that change is needed, those who profit from the status quo (the rich and powerful), will stop or obstruct change. North puts forth the case of the Americas, the Anglosaxon and the Hispanic, to illustrate how, in spite of the fact that many Latin American nations practically copied the American Constitution after achieving independence, the heritage of the decadent and stagnant Spain persists to this day in their instititutions.This is easily one of the most relevant books to read when trying to understand the world's economy (crisis and all). As a further example, although it looks like China has changed overnight, it is most likely that's not the case in institutional terms, and soon China will face the dead weight of its culture versus economic progress. Change does happen, and there may be some kickstarters, but in the long run institutions change in an incremental and slow way."},{"Title":"Institutions, Institutional Change and Economic Performance (Political Economy of Institutions and Decisions)","review":"Douglass North is an excellent writer, and this book is the amazing culmination of a lifetime's work in the area known as New Institutional Economics. This school or tradition is concerned with the role institutions play in the functioning of economies, and in particular, how they influence economic performance. Institutions are defined as rules or constraints, both informal (social conventions, habits, norms, etc.) and formal (legal rules and regulation), on human behavior. Rules, however, only provide the framework for action, and it is here where Douglass North brings in \\"organizations\\", which are responsible for determining the ways in which those \\"rules\\" become articulated, accepted (internalized) and enforced.A lot is covered in this book, but some general themes and arguments can be gleaned from the very short and immensely accessible number of pages. Perhaps most importantly, North argues in this book that conventional concepts like economic efficiency, cooperation, perfectly defined and costlessly enforced property rights, \\"frictionless exchange\\", costless information, and economic rationalism are by no means \\"given\\" in the standard economic modeling framework. These all depend on the \\"stability\\" of the institutions that exist in society. Stability, in turn, also depends on the ability of the agents responsible for measurement and enforcement to reduce transaction costs so that economic performance can be improved. This itself is by no means \\"given\\", because the State (the agent commonly assigned the task of enforcement) typically acts in ways that make property rights less secure, and hence raises transaction costs.If all of this sounds interesting, then Douglass North's book is perhaps the best source to consult on these matters. His prose is eminently readable, and he is a pleasure to follow as he tells his story in fascinating detail. I have explored other books that deal with similar topics, but I still regard this book as the most edifying."},{"Title":"Institutions, Institutional Change and Economic Performance (Political Economy of Institutions and Decisions)","review":"This book blends the concept of human behavior and economic theory. One aspect that I emphasize here is the concept of area. This, I believe , is an important aspect of the book. Why and how one area's cultural practices differ from another area. Example: Why is one democratic capitalist society set up differently than another similar democratic capitalist society ? The author is attempting to answer this and other questions with this book. Therefore, I emphasize the concept of area, city, town etc.. in regards to how the economic structure of a society is developed.This book also describes how organizations essentially shape and create the building blocks of societies. Major organizations such as congress, schools, law and many other organizations shape a society. I theorize that even one of these organizations can drastically alter the way a city, state or area is formed. If you look at the police as an organization and how just and fair they are versus how corrupt they are, it can have a drastic shape on a given area (society) and the given area's economic performance.I believe that having one corrupt police department, in one city, will shape the way an entire city and area is formed. It will shape the politics, the economics, and the way of life of an area ( society ). This is how drastic of an affect organizations can have on a culture,society, or area. I am a believer of this theory so far. I am on chapter three. It is not light reading by any means, but it is thought provoking.One concept I find unusual is North's concept of \\"the game\\" of organizations and social human interaction. Though there are always legitimate rules in any give organization there are a lot of unspoken social norms, expectations and cultural values that are not written, but clearly understood. Unspoken and unwritten rules such as would be found in a corrupt police department.You might expect to hear the term \\"game\\" when speaking with a girl or guy friend about dating. Or the term might seem more appropriately placed in a book on dating.North's concept of \\" the game\\" is incredibly helpful. I have referred to it in daily problem solving ever since I have read this book and it has helped me formulate and solve many \\"problems\\".This book has been very helpful to me on many levels for various problem solving. Initially I was theorizing why a city, such as the one I live in, was hit harder by the recession than other cities. North's book has helped me find answers to this and many other questions.My criticism of this book is not content/subject related but format related. He could have got a better editor. There are a lot of disqualifying words that would be much easier to read without. New technology and writing aims to make learning material easier to understand . Current methods of writing in genres such as psychology and self help make material as easy to understand for the reader as it possibly can. This book could be more popular had the editors and author decided to take that route by putting time into making the material easier for the average person and economic enthusiast to read.(Though I believe he did win the Pulitzer Peace Prize for this particular book, so one could argue my critique is without merit, if you believe Pulitzer Peace Prizes are a good judge of writing.)There is no reason why any genre needs to be overly complex and complicated to prove its merit. It is unnecessary and overly time consuming. In these quick fix and streamlined times, reading like this gets knocked off the list very quickly. People like their information to be quick, convenient and easy to swallow. Their is no reason economic theory, when written in the modern day of today should be any different."},{"Title":"Institutions, Institutional Change and Economic Performance (Political Economy of Institutions and Decisions)","review":"I am a political science student and am used to the literature, but even I have to say this book gets pretty abstract. North makes some interesting points, but I feel it could have used a bit more focus. I felt like the chapters wandered and I never got the full impact of what he was trying to say. I was surprised because North's journal articles tend to be so insightful and focused. The book is probably worth reading once for institutionalist scholars as it does make the important point that transactions costs and other barriers prevent institutional change that might otherwise be efficient. However, the book could have made that point in a short article."},{"Title":"Institutions, Institutional Change and Economic Performance (Political Economy of Institutions and Decisions)","review":"Elinor Ostrom proves in this book that it is possible to write with rigor and still captivate readers with an interesting story. Ostrom's analysis of the governance mechanisms used by communities that manage common pools of resources (CPR)s illuminates many of the behaviors and rules that we have been learning to apply in open source communities.Ostrom's economics perspective is a particularly refreshing one, that I would strongly recommend to technical readers.This is a mandatory reading for anyone interested in understanding the economics of open source software development."},{"Title":"Going To The Zoo","review":"This is one of my classes favorite books.

The text is repetitive and fun and the pictures are colorful."},{"Title":"Statutory construction digest","review":"This is the one and only guide to statutory construction of Pennsylvania legislative law. This is an excellent and comprehensive resource for people wishing to learn about court decisions on Pennsylvania legislative languages.There are many areas explored. A few are listed below from this book's 13th edition. These are presented in more common terms rather than legal terms for general legislative research purposes. People seeking more thorough and accurate legal explantions should refer to the book.Readers learn that when an existing act is amended, changed legislation shows legislative intent, must be germane to what is being amended, is still effective if it doesn't cite references to existing law, is to be construed as applying if in contradiction to existing law unless the legislative intent clearly did not intend this, and should avoid amending something that has been repealed.The courts have not been concerned how a law is classified so long as it is reasonable and was classified in good faith. Classifications for equal protection purposes require a compelling government purpose and must be rational. Compelling state interests were not found in creating one year residency requirements to obtain welfare, classifying Sunday trade laws, and denying medical payments of abortions for fiscal reasons. A Constitutional reference to Philadelphia courts should be \\"Philadelphia\\" rather than a \\"first class city\\". Legislative committees may investigate for legislative purposes but not as a court or grand jury. A legislative subpoena is to be used when there is probable cause that wrongdoing will be discovered. A legislative investigation in special sessions can not continue beyond that special session.The legislature decides how the Constitution may be amended. A legislative special session may adopt a Constitutional amendment. The Governor can not veto legislation approving a Constitutional amendment. The public approval of a Constitutional amendment does not take away the ability of the judiciary to scrutinize it. A procedural failure of not properly publishing a proposed Constitutional amendment does not nullify it. Amending two separate provisions of the Constitution requires two separate ballot votes. The legislature must pass the identical proposal Constitutional language in two separate sessions, yet it need not pass the identical resolution language. Both chambers must approve a Constitutional amendment resolution before one general election and then after another general election.A statute is to be liberally construed as meeting legislative intent, is to be interpreted literally unless it is ambiguous, is to be presumed to have aConstitutional impact, should not be considered to have an absurd result, and is not to be considered with a grammatical restructuring that changes the clear meaning. Official legislative comments, actuarial notes, and drafting commission official comments may be considered in forming judicial interpretations. A bill analysis does not indicate legislative intent. Legislative intent ascertains whether including specific classes is not to exclude others. \\"Including, but not limited to\\" means including similar types of classes. \\"Shall include\\" may or may not apply to something not specifically listed. Specific legal provisions do not permit general legal provisions. The most recently enacted statute applies if there is a conflict with another statute. \\"Shall\\" means something is discretionary. \\"May\\" is discretionary. \\"Will\\" directs but is not mandatory. \\"May\\" is not mandatory unless the clear intent of the legislation is otherwise. The public interest is to be presumed over private interest. A penal provision is to be strictly construed and done so in favor of the accused, unlike other provisions which are to be liberally construed.When considering a definition, a definition in statue is considered first, then a definition in the Statutory Construction Act, then a definition in a legal dictionary, and then a definition in a standard dictionary. The plain meaning of a word is to be considered unless this causes an ambiguity. A crime and its penalty may exist in two different statutes. \\"Statute\\" means statute whereas \\"provision of law\\" means statute and judicial decisions.A definition based on another work refers to the current but not future editions of that work. The legislature can not delegate its power to extend or terminate an agency to a legislative committee. The legislature can not delegate to the courts when a tax is excessive and unreasonable. A regulation can not contradict legislative intent. A statute overrides a conflicting resolution. Lawmaking can not be delegated outside the legislature to an administrative agency or other governmental branch. The legislature may delegate fact finding determining or affairs of state. The Constitution does not allow a private body to appoint government positions.A statute without a specific effective data listed takes effect 60 days after its enactment. When the Governor has ten days to act on presented legislative, the day after the day the Governor is presented the legislation is the first day, and weekends and holidays count as days.A statute changing common law must express that change and is to be strictly construed. A statute violating a common law remedy must have a statutory remedy. State courts are bound by U.S. Supreme Court interpretations but not by Federal District Court interpretations. A state Superior Court construction of statutory language not modified by the Supreme Court shall be presumed to have the same construction on subsequent same language passed by the legislature. A legislative change to an administrative statute changes that statue. An administrative action may interpret legislative intent if it is not explicitly stated in statue. Attorney General opinions are not binding yet may serve as legal force for administrative actions and convincing arguments in these opinions may be used to persuade the courts. A Pennsylvania statute modeled after another state's law may consider the other state's judicial construction in Pennsylvania judicial construction. A similar Federal statute may be used to interpret a state statute.A bond must be issued for only one distinct purpose. The Commonwealth has first lien on judicially sold real estate. An appropriation overrides a statutory provision for payment, so a payment can not be made if the funds are not available. A Governor must issue a death penalty warrant upon judicial notification that the death sentence review is finished.A change in language indicates a change in legislative intent. A clear meaning of a word in a statute has the same meaning elsewhere in the rest of the statue. A word should have the same meaning throughout the act. A word may have different meanings in different tax statutes. A Constitution should be interpreted according to how the public that approved that section of it understood it. A proviso is to be strictly construed and limited to the operations to which it refers.Legislative authority is absolute so long as it is within Constitutional limits. The judiciary is to provide reasonable time to ascertain whether a legislative law is effective. Eminent domain just compensation is not a legislative function. The Supreme Court creates state court rules, practices and procedures, as well as supervising attorney conduct , with the legislature not permitted to enter these areas. The legislature may alter rules of evidence and decide what constitutes a crime. An enacted revenue bill may not be challenged for a procedural objection that it did not originate in the House. Comments of individual legislators may not be considered in determining if a bill was properly enrolled. An omitted word that clearly is meant to be there and adding it does not change the substance of the legislation may be added. A correction to the text of legislation at the slip law stage requires the approval of the House Speaker, the Senate President Pro Tempore, the Legislative Reference Bureau Director, and the Attorney General. A bill may be challenged for violating the Constitutional mandate that it receive three days of legislative consideration. A candidate's nomination petition may not be challenged after the candidate has been elected. A legislative chamber has the jurisdiction of determining whether a person has the proper credentials to become a member of that chamber. A legislator commenting during legitimate legislative activities can not be subject to criminal or civil actions for the comments, although the courts may review the constitutionality of legislative actions. A legislator has standing to bring a Constitutional challenge. Legislative expenses but not salary may be increased during a legislative term. An unvouchered expense that does not reasonably relate to actual expenses is not permitted. The Auditor General can not audit the legislature. The Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes, and not Purdon's, is the official version of statutes. A Governor's veto of language that includes an appropriation also vetoes the appropriation. A Governor may reduce an appropriation without eliminating it. Mandamus can compel the legislature to properly fund the judiciary. The Speaker's office is vacant after sine die.A policy declaration in an act may be considered in construing and interpreting the act's provisions. A policy declaration can not be retroactively changed.The legislature creates political subdivisions, including municipal authorities, which are independent state agencies. The Commonwealth may expand or decrease the territory of a political subdivision, take its property without compensation, and may repeal a political subdivision's charter, and may do so without the consent of the citizens of that subdivision. Commonwealth property within a political subdivision does not fall within the subdivision's taxing authority.A single unifying subject is required for all sections of a bill to follow the single subject requirement. The subjects must be germane to each other. A single subject amendment may amendment different codes. A codifying or compiling bill is an exempt to the single subject rule. Two different laws imposing penalties are germane to the single subject of imposing criminal penalties. The germane standard increases when a stand alone legislation is amended into a code. A broad definition of germaneness may render the definition meaningless and invalid. Different types of act within the Crime Code may amend that Code.A member of an administrative agency appointed to a fixed but staggered terms may not be removed at the pleasure of the appointive authority. A member of an administrative agency appointed to a fixed term that is not staggered may be removed at the pleasure of the appointive authority. A House impeachment committee may continue after sine die. A President Pro Tempore must resign from the Senate upon becoming Governor but not upon becoming Lt. Governor.The words \\"all other acts and parts of acts are hereby repealed in so far as inconsistent with this act\\" will repeal as stated.

Having been in the military, I enjoyed the unique perspective of Jasa Bowser's book. The Life of a Navy Wife... or more appropriately... Helpful Hints for Surviving the Life of a Navy Wife... offered me the opportunity to see the military life from a spouse's point of view. I giggled... I groaned and often nodded my head in agreement. Not only does it offer a sneak peek at the Bowser-Shaw military saga, it also is loaded with hints aimed at making military life easier for the dependent spouse and family. Way to go Jasa. How about a Part II? I'm dying to hear more details of your military life experience!"},{"Title":"The Life of a Navy Wife","review":"I bought this book hoping to find a narrative of the Navy Wife experience. Instead I found a book that was more like a guide to live a life just like the author's.Jasa Bowser-Shaw continually uses the general \\"we\\" (women, navy wifes, etc...) instead of \\"I\\" when talking about her experiences. Because of this, as well as other techniques in her writing style, the reader is continually distanced from the author. It even feels like the author is distancing herself from her own life. There are very few examples of specific personal experiences with details and backgrounds. For instance on page 9 she comments: \\"... which I WON'T elaborate on\\" (Bowser-Shaw, 9). She does this throughout the book. She also does the general \\"I know this from experince\\" repeatedly. I really wish she went more in depth so that the reader could identify with her, or at least her narrative voice.Additionally, I found the sense of humor to be highly gender-biased, clich&eacute;, and bland. It was not an amusing read.There are also many typos and spelling errors.I strongly suggest that people looking for a true narrative on the Navy Wife lifestyle, with humor and real experiences, look to Barbara Keirsbilck Bennet and her book, \\"Anchored Nowhere: A Navy Wife's Story.\\" It is a well written and very personal account of her life, filled with even the most intimate and embarrassing moments."},{"Title":"The Life of a Navy Wife","review":"I read this book from cover to cover twice and also purchased it for holidaygift giving.Jasa is a writer with much style and honestly...This is one of the bestbooks that I have read about the Military life, 1st person.

In judging, it was reviewed by dozens of College Professors locally, along with the other autobiographies in the category, and received rave reviews for its content.Again, everyone has different opinions and views & I appreciate your honesty.

Since such time I have set out to acquire as much Equine Massage knowledge from a variety of Equine massage Professionals. I have learned that Mr. Hourdebaight's education is sorely limited as is his experience. His technique is novice at best, and his ability to write and impart this limited knowledge, is less than adequate after reading numerous additional Equine Massage Therapy books, and getting volumes of useful information from Author's other than, Jean Pierre Hourdebaigt.I thought I learned some things from this book, and unfortunately, wrote my glowing review based on my own beginner understanding of horse massage. Now, my educated grasp of Equine Massage gathered over the past year, has taught me a real grasp of how to help my horse, as opposed to Mr. Hourdebaigt\\"s macro wash over approach, and wordy explanation and descriptions for technique's that he does not have a firm understanding of doing or explaining. Once I re-read this book, I realized why I could not implement his suggestions. They were un-clear and repetitive. The information I have learned since from Authors, and hands on Therapist, have shown me why this book at first read as if I could use his material, but after trying over and over, and since working with Equine Massage Therapist, I have learned a tremendous amount of useful techniques.I regret having to write this review, but upon my acquisition of this new body of knowledge, I feel a responsibility to impart this information to all Equestrian's, regardless if your horse is a pet, or a Grand Prix Horse, don't put all your eggs in one basket with this book.

Having been a CCMT for many years, I knew what to expect and where to find problems in a HUMAN, but this book filled in absolutely every gap I could have come up with in regards to equine physiology, anatomy, kinesiology and the basics of &quot;don't do this around a horse if you want to make it to your next patient&quot; . . .To start off with, it's spiral bound so it's super easy to take to the stable! The illustrations are terrific and the text doesn't speak to you like you're a fifth grader; it assumes that if you're working on horses, you at least know the basics of working on humans. And finally, it's encouraging. . .

He is more relaxed, moves more freely, is comfortable in his own skin now, and more able to learn. It also does wonders for deeper bonding and improving your relationship.This book is well thought-out, easy to use, and the spiral binding is very useful.

Practical hints such as using your bathroom scales to work out what 'X'lbs of pressure feels like, abound.To make the book even better there are then sections which describe what various 'routines' might be made up of (relaxation for instance) and how long to spend etc. There are also recommendations for how to start with a new horse, body signals to look for and when you may need a helper."},{"Title":"Equine Massage: A Practical Guide","review":"It's amazing how easy it is to follow the author's instructions.

Well-researched and extensively footnoted, &quot;Liberace: An American Boy&quot; is a serious attempt at (as Oscar Levant would say) cutting through all that phony tinsel to find the real tinsel underneath. Just why is it that that this curious carnival figure -- odder with each passing year -- so captivated the American public? There's no way to neatly answer such a question, and this book, thankfully, doesn't try to. What it does is delicately take Liberace apart in order to reassemble him with as much of his chintzy glory as possible left still intact. While the author takes issue with the conclusions I came to in my book &quot;Open Secret,&quot; he does quote from it copiously and accurately. Consequently I'm not about to carp. Suffice to say, however, that &quot;An American Boy&quot; isn't the last word on Liberace. It's only the second. Let's hope there's more to come."},{"Title":"Liberace: An American Boy","review":"Carefully researched and well written, this extensive volume details the life of Liberace, peeling away the layers and layers of half-truths, deceptions, and publicity machine myths. A well-loved and talented entertainer, Liberace lived a double life protecting his public image with a fierceness that caused much private agony. Liberace could not even tell the truth in his own biography, lest he be labeled as a liar and countersued by publications he had sued when they reported he was gay. This book details his relationships with friends, family and lovers. Pyron also gives wonderful detail on how Liberace got his start, tracing his career from his start in sleezy Wisconsin dives to his lavish Las Vegas productions. Liberace was smart enough to know his limitations and to exploit his strengths. This books gives a balanced view of the man and the entertainer; in addition, the author gives a detailed historical/sociological background about the lives of gay men in general, which provides an informative backdrop and better understanding of how and why Liberace functioned the way he did. The book may seem rather monotous and dry at times, but that is the author's style; this is a serious, intelligent book, not some gossipy tell-all. Unlike many biographers who write about celebrities, Pyron has great regard and respect for his subject. A must for all Liberace fans and for those interested in the lives of famous gay entertainers."},{"Title":"Liberace: An American Boy","review":"THIS BOOK IS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER LIBERACE BOOKS.

There are several key features common to all of the volumes of this series. First, each includes a two-column, double translation of the Biblical text (NIV - New International Version, and NRSV - New Revised Standard Version) arranged by topical unit or story. Then, they provide commentaries that look at the passages as a whole, as well as verse-by-verse. Third, interesting Reflection pieces that relate the passages to each other, to history, and to current concerns occur at the conclusion of each passage. Fourth, introductory articles for each book are provided that discuss transmission, historical background, cultural setting, literary concerns, and current scholarship. Finally, there are general articles about the Bible, each Testament, and various types of literature (Narrative, Gospel, Wisdom Literature, etc.) are provided to give general placement and knowledge about the text overall.The list of contributors, editors, and consultants on the project is a veritable Who's Who of biblical and theological scholarship, representing all major traditions and schools of thought liberal and conservative. Leander Keck, of the Yale Divinity School, is the primary editor of the series.The volumes were published individually, and can be purchased individually, which is a good thing, given that they are a bit expensive. But for any serious biblical scholar, preacher, student, or enthusiast, they are invaluable. A great way to purchase them, however, is by buying the entire set, as is on offer here.The set includes seven volumes for the Old Testament/Hebrew Scriptures, and five volumes of the New Testament. Interspersed among the first seven volumes are the apocryphal texts. These books are called apocryphal because their status is not canonically clear within the Christian tradition. They are not contained in the official canon of the Hebrew scripture, and so Protestant tradition has tended to leave the books out of the Old Testament. However, these texts were included in the Septuagint, the primary Greek translation of the Hebrew scriptures in the ancient world, and so the Roman Catholic and the Orthodox churches consider the texts canonical.High praise goes to the general editorial staff for working with such strong authors/scholars, that their work fits together well as part of this set while retaining their individual characteristics (much like the writers of the Bible itself!).--Volume contents--The following is a list of each volume in this twelve-volume set, and the contents of each.Volume I: General Articles on the Bible; General Articles on the Old Testament; Genesis; Exodus; LeviticusVolume II: Numbers; Deuteronomy; Introduction to Narrative Literature; Joshua; Judges; Ruth; I & II SamuelVolume III: I & II Kings; I & II Chronicles; Ezra, Nehemiah; Esther; Additions to Esther; Tobit; JudithVolume IV: I & II Maccabees; Introduction to Hebrew Poetry; Job; PsalmsVolume V: Introduction to Wisdom Literature; Proverbs; Ecclesiastes; Song of Songs; Book of Wisdom; SirachVolume VI: Introduction to Prophetic Literature; Isaiah; Jeremiah; Baruch; Letter of Jeremiah; Lamentations; EzekielVolume VII: Introduction to Apocalyptic Literature; Daniel; Additions to Daniel; Hosea; Joel; Amos; Obadiah; Johan; Micah; Nahum; Habakkuk; Zephaniah; Haggai; Zechariah; MalachiVolume VIII: General Articles on the New Testament; Matthew; MarkVolume IX: Luke; JohnVolume X: Acts; Introduction to Epistolary Literature; Romans, I CorinthiansVolume XI: II Corinthians; Galatians; Ephesians; Philippians; Colossians; I & II Thessalonians; I & II Timothy; Titus; PhilemonVolume XII: Hebrews; James; I & II Peter; I, II & III John; Jude; Revelation"},{"Title":"New Interpreter's Bible (12 Volume Set + Index)","review":".... and it takes up a whole shelf in my library....I would like to give this 4 1/2 stars, but five is too many.This is the best Bible commentary I have used. It is not constrained by length as so many are. The dual NIV/NRSV is plus, and of course I read my NJB along with it.I absolutely love the depth of analysis, particularly of the OT Hebrew (I have yet to use this much in the NT, having just started with the set a few months ago). Allowing the author a \\"personal reflections\\" section is a nice plus. Even when I don't agree with the reflection, it stirs good internal debate, and is a source of discussion questions for adult Sunday School.The inclusion of the Dueterocanonicals is also welcome as these are unfortunately missing from most Protestant commentaries.The one negative is that some of the commentary is a little liberal (in some cases, even feminist - e.g., Phyllis Trible) for me, but it does nicely balance out the more conservative International Bible Encyclopedia and the International Bible Commentary. Overall though, as the next reviewer points out, the scholars involved in NIB are from a range of theological camps.This work is also available on CD for a little less, but in the end I decided I like hard copy better.This was a LOT of work and all those involved in producing it are to be praised for their efforts!"},{"Title":"New Interpreter's Bible (12 Volume Set + Index)","review":"The NIB commentary (in twelve volumes or CD-ROM) is basically an extremely comprehensive historical-critical commentary on the entire Bible, including all the books of the OT including the apocryphal books, and also the entire New Testament. The commentary brings together dozens of biblical scholars from different Christian confessions, ranging from Evangelical and Pentecostal Christians to Anglican, Catholic and Orthodox scholars. The series also includes a number of essays on various academic and technical points, ranging from hermenutical theories of Biblical interpretation to feminist questions about biblical interpretation and so on.While at times the overly-liberal agenda of some of the commentators can get a bit tiresome, overall the quality of the commentary is outstanding from both a theological and scholarly perspective, and incorporates the most up to date knowledge of the historical and cultural context of the scripture as well as useful reflections on how it can be applied to modern-day life.The main drawback of this series is its heavy expense, which would put it out of reach of many individual buyers, though in my experience this set is quite easily found in most good university theology libraries, catechist resource centres, and in many parish libraries. Along with the Jerome Bible commentary and a good study Bible, this set in my view is essential reading for any priest, seminarian, theologian or theology student, and also any lay Christian interested in deeping their own faith or in a role where scriptural study or interpretation is required, including Ministry leaders, Bible Study Group leaders, RCIA team leaders and members, or catechists in any Christian denomination. If you have a difficult or obscure point in scripture and are uncertain, these volumes certainly help to get the context and message right, along with useful hints and reflections which would be useful in making a homily or sermon."},{"Title":"New Interpreter's Bible (12 Volume Set + Index)","review":"I first used this set at Duke U. in 1961.

I remember when I first read \\"Fear of Flying\\" I was so taken with the character, so intrigued by her life and her adventures, that I took the book everywhere with me. This book has Chinese food all over it because I would cross the street from my home to the local Chinese restaurant, sit at the table each night, and spill food on it while enjoying every single word. It is hysterical, very moving and gives one a great deal of insight into the world of a neurotic playwright who is struggling with personal demons - and having the ride of his life.

I had never heard of the author before, and this book was recommended to me by Amazon when I purchased a few others in the NYRB series. I loved the title and thought, why not? I was captivated and charmed by this book. Five stars are not enough.The stories take place in or reference a Brooklyn and a New York that no longer exist, the post-World War II decade, when men wore hats, women wore gloves and everyone smoked cigarettes. The characters have all emerged from the Depression- and war-eras and are affected, but not hardened, by their experiences of privation, poverty and anxiety about death and mass destruction. The theme of each story is change, of growing up and growing older, and learning to live with loss and to accept one's mistakes. Each story is melancholic, but never merely nostalgic, about the loss of the past, which takes place through loss of both people and familiar places. To this day, every New Yorker loves to talk about real estate, and how the architecture that made up our youth is constantly being casually ripped down to make room for the new. At what point does the City you grew up in no longer belong to you--or no longer even exist? And what does that mean for you?The stories deftly handle some very difficult topics, including racism, xenophobia, abortion, divorce, child neglect and abuse, infidelity and class distinction. Some of those topics are still taboo today, and reading these stories show how urgent the issues were even then, and sadly, how little the debate has changed. The author was very brave to take on some of these topics at the time these stories were written, and to write about them so honestly: stories about abortion and racism, or women breaking away from husbands who don't understand them and don't care to, probably did not sell well.My favorite story is \\"My Coney Island Uncle\\", about a boy's recollections of his favorite uncle, an unmarried and childless doctor (who lives in Coney Island, natch, at the height of its popularity as a middle-class beach playground), and the summer they spent together when the boy was a young teenager. His uncle is remembered as glamorous, all-knowing and, as a doctor, nearly all-powerful--everything the boy's parents are not. Many years later, the boy, now a man, visits his uncle again. They are both older, and the boy realizes that it is now his turn to mentor another, and to take care of his aging uncle. That story is so full of love and kindness, and it brought tears to my eyes. I had a \\"Coney Island Uncle\\" myself and I miss him every day.Take a break from the bestsellers list and buy this book and enjoy it.

Tackling the difficult, and controversial problem of spirituality, Wolman makes a convincing case for the existence of a new intelligence inherent in the human condition.I approached this book skeptically, but was soon engaged in the range of topics and fields examined and synthesized. From evolutionary psychology, philosophy, and cognitive neuroscience, Wolman makes accessible the most difficult and complex of issues. He then shows how his new methodology for studying spirituality evolved, not from his preconceptions, but from the minds and hearts of thousands of individuals. This new procedure has wide applications in daily life and also in the consulting room.The book is written in elegant prose - almost poetic at times - and reveals the compassion and sensitivity Wolman shows to his patients, his students and his colleagues.

Unlike distinguished faculty, he avoids questions from us bright undergraduates who challenge him on pseudo-science nonsense from the book-- that which translates into using an entire class period to hand out Tarot cards and have us discuss what they tell about our lives. Tarot cards? From a Harvard professor? If any of us males in the class point out that Tarot cards aren't science, he simply shrugs. Perhaps some of the profits from the book could be used to pay us back for our tuition. And they say Cornel West was goofing off last year? Yet there is a silver lining here: self-help gurus usually maintain their appeal by seeming like they walk the talk: reading &quot;Thinking with Your Soul&quot; gives the impression that Dr. Wolman believes in genuine, humble spiritual insights. Yet watching him lecture about the book, one sees how he is entirely wrapped up in his need for the class to like him and think he's a funny, great guy. Forget about honestly answering the questions posed to him about whether a spiritual dimension exists, he would rather avoid direct confrontations and chatter on incessantly about his personal life. Great news: by taking a course with this book's author you can learn ahead of time that you're not listening to advice from a wisened professional, but handing over hard earned dollars to a man who needs to get his own spiritual house in order. Forget &quot;Thinking with Your Soul&quot; and try to remember that this book deosn't live up to its inspiring title. Pull aside the curtain and you have the great and terrible Oz. The only tricks up this author's sleeve are tarot cards and tenure. Don't be fooled. Think with your wallet."},{"Title":"Thinking With Your Soul Spiritual Intell","review":"I love &quot;Thinking with Your Soul&quot;; it is a wonderful book for anyone interested in expanding one's own spiritual awareness through the acts of living. Dr. Wolman invites the reader to open the door that leads to discovery of the relevance of spirituality for each of us not only within the context of the community we live, but also in relationship to larger questions about the meaning of life. His empirically based investigation unites everyday personal experience with the scientific approach to spirituality. Through PsychoMatrix Spirituality Inventory, Dr. Wolman found a way to measure spiritual intelligence not in the terms of numerical value, but as a developmental dimension which increases and deepens with life experiences. For an interested reader, the book is a pleasure to read. &quot;Thinking with Your Soul&quot; turns examining of one's own spirituality to a highly attractive endeavor. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Paranoid Style in American Politics and Other Essays","review":"I read this book several decades ago, but (1) after painfully witnessing the bizarre notions entertained in the Republican primary debates this season (e.g. the Federal Reserve is some kind of criminal enterprise, public health vaccinations reflect coercive gov't power run amok), (2) reading of a recent survey where 26% of those who identified themselves as Republicans also identified Barack Obama as the \\"Antichrist\\" (26%!), and (3) seeing on TV a recently-elected Congressman of the Tea party persuasion reject out-of-hand political compromise saying he was sent to Washington to \\"go to war\\" (with a electoral margin of about 150 votes!), I thought \\"Paranoid Style\\" might bear re-reading. I'm glad I did; this is an excellent and probing analysis, and also beautifully written, of the development of the radical right in American politics around the middle part of the last century. Professor Hofstadter analyzes the underlying premises of McCarthyism in the 1950s and Goldwaterism in the 1960s, and discusses the social and psychological dimensions of these right-wing movements. It was interesting, to me at least, how much in his analysis Hofstadter relies on prevailing sociological notions of the time (e.g., the primacy of status politics over interest politics in times of prosperity) when sociology today appears far less intellectually influential. Thus, this book is worthwhile just as a historical treatment of political and social forces shaping American rght-wing movements at particular points in time.My re-reading was prompted by what the McCarthy and Goldwater movements discussed in \\"Paranoid Style\\" could tell us about the motives and forces underlying the current right-wing resurgence in the Republican party. An observer has said that today's \\"moderate\\" was called a conservative 35 years ago, and that today's \\"conservative\\" was deemed a member of the radical right 35 years ago, and I believe Hofstadter would appreciate the point. He called the right-wingers in his book \\"pseudo-conservatives\\" because they were anything but conservative since they angrily rejected almost everything about their current political / social / economic order and wished to purify America. While daffyness might sometimes characterize the left, anger seems to be a prevailing characteristic of right-wing activists both then and now. Whether you think traitors in the State Department \\"sold out\\" China to the \\"Reds\\" in the 1950s or science teachers / Hollywood producers / liberal judges are corrupting our moral society in 2012, anger is the unifying emotion, and this anger is turned on anybody who's not a full movement adherent, witness the targetting of Republican moderates in primaries as \\"RINO's\\" or Republicans in name only. It also manifests itself as an uncompromising rigidity and Hofstadter acutely noticed this as he states near the end of his essays on the American right wing: \\"Writing in 1954, at the peak of the McCarthy period, I suggested that the American right wing could best be understood not as a neo-fascist movement girding itself for the conquest of power but as a persistent and effective minority whose main threat was its power to create a political climate in which the rational pursuit of our well-being and safety would become impossible\\". I'm not sure the conquest of power is totally off the right wing's radar screen in this post-Reagan era, but the immobilization of government through things like binding no-tax-increase pledges and almost total intransigence during the debt-ceiling crisis speak for themselves."},{"Title":"Paranoid Style in American Politics and Other Essays","review":"Back to the future4 starsHofstader's 1966 collection of essays, written in more of a journalist style than an academic one, is split into two parts: \`Studies in the American Right' and \`Some Problems of the Modern Era'. The first part, which is almost exactly half of the book, is four essays that explore Hofstader's evolving understanding of what he calls \`the pseudo-conservative right', a not very politically correct term for self-described conservatives who are not defenders of the status quo but radicals looking to create a utopia based on uncompromising adherence to conservative values.The first essay is the broadest and most important in the book. He argues that during periods of debate about fundamental values, the US has seen eruptions of what he calls \`the paranoid style' in politics. He is unflinching in dissecting it, not only discussing its broad psychology but its quirks, like its fact-gathering footnote-obsessed research. The following quote gives a good sense of the paranoid style and of Hofstader's:>The typical procedure of the higher paranoid scholarship is to start with such defensible assumptions and with a careful accumulation of facts, or at least of what appear to be facts, and to marshal these facts toward an overwhelming \\"proof\\" of the particular conspiracy that is to be established. It is nothing it not coherent--in fact, the paranoid mentality is far more coherent than the real world, since it leaves no room for mistakes, failures, or ambiguities. It is, if not wholly rational, at least intensely rationalistic; it believes that is is up against an enemy who is infallibly rational as he is totally evil, and it seeks to match his imputed total competence with its own, leaving nothing explained and comprehending all of reality in one overreaching, consistent theory. It is nothing if not \\"scholarly\\" in technique. (36-37)The next three essays focus on pseudo-conservatives proper, particularly as they were galvanized by Barry Goldwater's election campaign. Writing so close to the events, Hofstader mostly buys into the view that LBJ's landslide victory in 1964 demonstrated the fallacy of far right organizing, a view that has been rubbished by history.That said, the phrase that comes to mind first with these essays is \`ripped from the headlines'. These essays do much more to explain the conflicts over the federal deficit between the Tea Party and Obama than anything written today. Indeed, if you had an electronic copy of these essays and you did a \`find and replace' with \`Goldwater' and \`the Tea Party', you could pass them off as something written in 2011 and offer a reasonable trajectory of the 2012 GOP primaries:>The convention showed the nation for the first time how well organized the right-wing movement was, but it also proved, as the subsequent campaign was to prove again, that the right wing, though brilliantly organized for _combat_ was not organized to conciliate or persuade. Having convinced themselves that the forces they were fighting were conspiratorial and sinister, not to say treasonous, they found it impossible to shake off the constricting mental framework of the paranoid style. (111-12)The second half of the book deals with three separate issues, whose only real connecting thread is an emphasis on the rise and fall of what Hofstader might call \`illegitimate political passions': the acquisition of an empire during the Spanish American War, the fate of the anti-trust movement and the great debate about gold versus silver in the late nineteenth century as seen through the personal history of a popular silver crank'. These essays are more about historical puzzles than anything, asking questions like, with the advantage of hindsight, who had a better grasp of economics, the backers of gold or silver? And what did happen to the anti-trust movement anyway? These essays are nowhere near as timely as the first half of the book, but they are still enjoyable, insightful and well-written.This is really a book that deserves more attention than it receives these days."},{"Title":"Paranoid Style in American Politics and Other Essays","review":"One of America's leading historians of his time, and a great instructor and mentor at Columbia University, RH turned his gimlet eye to the question of how and why some conservative voices seem to mutate and metastasize into something more akin to emotional illness.I have little original to add to the reviews precceding this. The book is a series of essays, some historical and other more relevant to the current scene in the period in which they were written [the late 1950s to the early 1960s]. This is one of those indispensible books which every concerned citizen ought to read, it's relevance has scarcely dimmed in nearly 50 years.

The theme of his book is that the American far right has historically been \\"paranoid\\" and that this paranoia has generally come out during periods of severe economic crises such as the Great Depression of early 20th Century and the late 1800s and during periods the country felt under serious external and internal threat (i.e., during the early 1950s). He cites facts that, to him, point out \\"paranoia\\" on the political scene. For example, he cited the views of many that U.N. black helicopters were roaming the skies of the U.S. during the 1960s. Unfortunately he provides little evidence that such views really are \\"paranoid\\". With respect to the previously cited example of U.N. helicopters, he mocks congressional hearings that gathered evidence on the issue while not discussing the conclusioins reached by the commissions.All his views make, as the publishers of this book intend, the current (especially since the government and Obama induced economic crisis since 2008) American right look paranoid. The book clearly has a politically ideological axe to grind. The publishers clearly intend to mock patriotic heroes that have clearly and strongly pointed out, on the basis of strong evidence, Obama's questionanable U.S. citizenship and his Marxist-Leninist views. These views have all been documented in many books (many of which have been best sellers) such as:Gangster Government: Barack Obama and the New Washington ThugocracyBought and Paid For: The Unholy Alliance between Barack Obama and Wall StreetThe Roots of Obama's RageWhere's the Birth Certificate? The Case that Barack Obama is not Eligible to be PresidentThe Obama NationHow Obama Embraces Islam's Sharia Agenda (Encounter Broadsides)The Blueprint: Obama's Plan to Subvert the Constitution and Build an Imperial PresidencyTo Save America: Stopping Obama's Secular-Socialist MachineThe Post-American Presidency: The Obama Administration's War on AmericaConduct Unbecoming: How Barack Obama is destroying the Military and Endangering Our SecurityA Slobbering Love Affair: The True (And Pathetic) Story of the Torrid Romance between Barack Obama and the Mainstream MediaObama Zombies: How the Liberal Machine Brainwashed My GenerationCrimes against Liberty: An Indictment of President Barack ObamaThe Manchurian President: Barack Obama's Ties to Communists, Socialists and Other Anti-American ExtremistsMany of these books have not only been NY Times best sellers but have been written by academics and well known intellectuals such as Jerome Corsi (PhD from Harvard), Dinesh D'Souza (White House Fellow under Bush Sr. and former American Enterprise Fellow) and Newt Gingrich (PhD and leading conservative intellectual). Despite the well documented, in-depth and academic facts put forth in these books they have been nothing but derided by leftists. If Hofstadter were alive today, no doubt he would be doing the same (thus showing his inability to come to terms with facts instead of unsupported political opinions).During the 1960 Barry Goldwater had coined the term \\"egghead\\" to refer to the perversely over educated, such as Hofstadter, who were simply unable to see reality and simply passed it off as \\"paranoia\\". As the reader goes through the book he or she sees where Goldwater was coming from. It's a shame Goldwater is not alive to point this out to today's leftist followers of Hofstadter."},{"Title":"Paranoid Style in American Politics and Other Essays","review":"Don't be put off by the lame cover design. The late Mr. Hofstadter's book deserves your attention, particularly in light of recent American history.'The Paranoid Style' is in fact a collection of essays, the first four of which are thematically-related studies of American hyper-conservatism. (I won't discuss the other essays in this review.) In the first, Hofstadter brings to light earlier historical avatars of conservative paranoia, reaching back to 18th century fears of 'Illuminati' and Freemasons, and 19th century anti-Catholic sentiment. Hofstadter then contextualizes the then-current anti-communist movement and McCarthyism as the latest examples of a 'style' of American political rhetoric that cannot brook coincidence, and that, in contrast, prefers to see historical events, which are largely beyond our control, as the evidence of a vast and perfect conspiracy to destroy America and its values.In the next essays, Hofstadter engages with what he calls 'pseudo-conservatism,' a philosophy embodied in those ultra-right wing movements that do not seek to conserve or guide our social institutions at all, but instead wish to tear them out root and branch, on the grounds of their complete and utter corruption. At the time, Hofstadter's targets were right-wing organizations like the John Birch Society, but above all Barry Goldwater and his supporters. These 'pseudo-conservatives' rejected completely the moderate Republican leadership of the time, and sometimes went so far as to accuse them of treason. What the pseudo-cons offered instead of the generally successful continuation of New Deal social policy or the careful stand-off of the Cold War, was the complete reversal of government intervention into social welfare and a hyper-aggressive stance toward communism that did not deem global thermo-nuclear war to be an unacceptable outcome.The portrait of Barry Goldwater is particularly chilling. Goldwater's instrumentalization of 'moral values' as an electoral wedge, and his Manichean and apocalyptic vision of world politics -- reflected in the title of his book \\"Why not Victory?\\" - thankfully did not seduce the American electorate of 1964. But Goldwater's influence on Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush is beyond dispute."},{"Title":"Paranoid Style in American Politics and Other Essays","review":"During the fifties, and up to the time of his death in the sixties, Richard Hofstadter was one of America's most renowned historians with two Pulitzer Prizes to his credit. He was at his intellectual peak when, as one of America's eminent authorities of his country's political ideologies, he tackled the developing phenomenon of the early sixties' right wing extremism under the guise of conservatism. He differentiates between the traditional American conservatism espoused by the likes of President Herbert Hoover and Senator Robert Taft alongside the venom of Robert Welch's John Birch Society, in which, as the group's idea man, Welch referred to Dwight D. Eisenhower as a &quot;dedicated and conscious agent of the Communist conspiracy.&quot;Hoftstadter delineates how fringe rightist elements took over the Republican Party and rallied behind the banner of Arizona's Senator Barry M. Goldwater, resulting in one of the party's most calamitous losses in the 1964 presidential election against incumbent Democratic president, Lyndon B. Johnson.The work has a timely ring as an historical analytical measuring rod in comprehending the activities of current right wing movements, such as the Christian Right behind the banners of Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson and its link to the militant anti-abortion movement, alongside earlier rightist political philosophies and their vigorous adherents such as Welch and television commentator Dan Smoot."},{"Title":"Paranoid Style in American Politics and Other Essays","review":"I read this book when it was first published in the 1960's. Now, gee, just when I had completely forgotten about it, along comes the Tea Party movement and those wackoes declaring Obama the first Communist president since Eisenhower, and others shouting racial and homophobic epithets at congressmen. As I recall, Prof. Hoffstedter said this kind of uprising occurs about once every 20 years or so (and, here in the Pacific Northwest, I recall the Posse Comitatus crowd in the late 1970's who believed the IRS was illegal because Ohio wasn't a state, or something like that, so this sort of thing seems about as regular as Halley's Comet, just more frequent and less exciting to watch). But I suppose that if the original Tea Party in 1773 had just shortened their slogan to, \\"No taxation,\\" either we would have begun the American Revolution a little sooner, or (more likely)the American revolutionaries would have been written off as a bunch of nut jobs and all the rest of us would still be singing God Save the Queen.But Hoffstedter's book really made sense of these periodic paroxysms in our society and, thanks to the wackoes, the book retains its great vitality and relevance. Be sure to buy the book now, though, before the Stamp Act party returns in 2030. And I can't wait for the Know-Nothings (or are they hiding amidst the Tea Party?)"},{"Title":"Paranoid Style in American Politics and Other Essays","review":"This is an excellent book, in spite of the fact that the original copyright is 1952.

The descriptions of activities draw an amazingly close parallel to our present day situations."},{"Title":"Paranoid Style in American Politics and Other Essays","review":"In an era when hate mongering, fear mongering, and divisiveness seem to be the order of the day, Hofstadter's essays help identify the roots of the paranoid style in American politics. Perhaps, now that this book has been republished, more people will read his essays, and work together to assuage the extreme fears and resentments that drive the paranoid style."},{"Title":"Paranoid Style in American Politics and Other Essays","review":"Throughout the ages the \\"paranoid style\\" has been used to arouse public indignation and to attack established institutions and/or entrenched traditions that have grown ineffectual. Usually, the darkest and most abhorrent aspects of the accuser's personality are projected onto the hated enemy. Moreover, the true menace is sometimes seen as a malaise that lurks in a nation's midst rather than as something that exists outside its borders. And these chimeras tend to be the shadow projections of the idealistic personality (that is deeply concerned with the moral decay of the society around them) rather than realistic assessments of the true dangers that exist in the objective world. It gives the paranoid the illusion of control since there is little or nothing they can do about world opinion outside his or her borders, although they often imagine this to be so. As a consequence, many foreign policy initiatives are doomed to failure because a distorted picture of the world is being refracted through what amounts to a narrow, insular prism. That is, instead of viewing startling political developments throughout the world as complex historical processes that are unfolding for entirely legitimate reasons they might be seen as betrayals or acts of deliberate defiance. Especially when the vital interests of the observer are threatened.Then too, Americans have often seen any failure as the work of people within our own government who allowed such things to happen. For if some of our own people are to blame for our weakness, then we do not have to deny \\"the myth of American Omnipotence.\\"This is an ideal time to read Hofstadter's book. It was written in the 1950s and 60s, so you get an excellent feel for postwar America (after the bomb) and the advent of the Cold War. Hofstadter's account of the McCarthy Era and Barry Goldwater's presidential campaign (of 1964) is quite instructive. An astute reader will notice many parallels with today. But he also discusses earlier periods of our history when the paranoid style was in its infancy, and yet was destined to become the genesis of the \\"liberal-conservative\\" split that is with us to this day.One fascinating period was the 1890s, the era of Populist William Jennings Bryan and the \\"Free Silver Movement,\\" which went down in defeat to William McKinley in the presidential election of 1896. Prior to McKinley's victory there was also public outrage over Spain's oppression of Cuba. And although McKinley did not advocate war with Spain, nor did Republican business leaders that had financed his campaign, he was swept into the Spanish-American War by the spirit of the times. Having filled up the continent with Westward expansion and the dream of \\"Manifest Destiny,\\" many Americans felt a sudden lack of opportunity and purpose. But after Admiral Dewey's sudden victory in Manila Bay Americans began to grapple with their \\"Duty and Destiny\\" in an increasingly imperialistic world that they thought was filled with decadent and dangerous foreign powers.There is no way to summarize the exquisite detail in Hofstadter's book. One must read it and ponder its many lessons. For the sum of its parts are greater than the whole. Good history always makes us realize that there really is nothing new under the sun, and yet, there most certainly IS! Mark Twain said it best when he joked: \\"History doesn't repeat itself, but it rhymes.\\""},{"Title":"Paranoid Style in American Politics and Other Essays","review":"This book is as relevant now as it was when it was first written. An excellent blend of accuracy and eloquence."},{"Title":"Paranoid Style in American Politics and Other Essays","review":"Granted that Prof. Hofstadter's evaluation of the &quot;pseudo-conservatism&quot; of the Goldwater campaign is rather patronizing, and that, too optimistically, he predicted that the paranoid style was condemned to permanent minority status. Otherwise, the book is a prescient and devastating analysis of the breathless mindset on display, mainly from the Right, over the last ten years or so. Just last November right-wing commentators as bright and well-educated as George F. Will were fulminating against Gore's &quot;slow-motion coup&quot; in Florida, and lesser conservatives were passing the word that President Clinton was about to seize dictatorial powers. The fact that the most conservative president since Reagan--maybe since the Roaring 20s--is currently sitting in the Oval Office, courtesy of a hypocritical decision by a quintet of conservative Supreme Court justices, means nothing to the conservatives immersed in the paranoid style. THEY didn't subvert the system; they saved the U.S. from the liberals, the liberals, the liberals.Back in 1964, Prof. Hofstadter noted that people who think like this tend to imitate the massive conspiracies they imagine threatening themselves. Writing in an era that still resembled the stereotypical 1950s more than the stereotypical 1960s, Hofstadter did not forsee the current power of the paranoid style. But the title essay of his book nails it right to the wall. Reading it, I feared for my country."},{"Title":"Paranoid Style in American Politics and Other Essays","review":"What I love about Richard Hofstadter is how well he writes and how well he builds arguments. These elements help explain why he remains as relevant today as he was throughout the 1950s and 1960s. This collection of essays features his classic work on American paranoia as how it impacts politics (birth movement, much?) and several very thoughtful analyses on Barry Goldwater.I found the introduction by Sean Wilentz to be sorely lacking in depth. I also found the second half of the collection to be less useful and dated. However, overall, this is a classic primary source by one of the country's greatest thinkers."},{"Title":"Paranoid Style in American Politics and Other Essays","review":"The lead essay is quite good. E.H. investigates the tendency to ascribe to others underhanded motives that they rarely have, and how this paranoid thinking is common and becomes more common under circumstances such as we have today, circa 2009-2012.You will find keys to understanding the fringes of the Tea Party movement, the hows and whys of our current popular talk shows, and the hallmarks of the style.I've expanded some on E.H.'s work on my blog -- you can find it with a goog search for \\"The Paranoid Style in American Commentary -- Are we 1920s Germany?\\""},{"Title":"Heart of the Night","review":"This is one of my favorite romance books.

Ninety-nine percent of this story was about EVERYONE's never-ending emotional problems and it went on and on. I don't know if this story could have been saved by a psychiatrist... or a good exorcist. It could have been an interesting plot: a kidnap-mystery with a twist, including a late-night sexy-voiced DJ...but it ended being quite creepy (all the female's obsession over the DJ) and extremely cheesy. The mystery was barely mentioned and the \\"twist\\" was made way too obvious early on as it could have been a good \\"shocker\\" at the end.Narrator, Sandra Burr, uses a little-girl, syrupy voice for her females and usually a goofy or nasally voice for her males."},{"Title":"Heart of the Night","review":"The characters are complex, several story lines happening, not your everyday, run of the mill romance -- yet romance it is, with some of the steamiest scenes in all of her books.

Remember when country music was fashionable on the coasts and not just in the middle of the country (no offense, country music fans)? Remember when broadcast radio was a powerful medium that listeners drew their identity from and invested emotionally in? If not, trust me, there was such a time. Women across Rhode Island and southern New England tune into WCIC, the country station, for the sexy presence of overnight DJ Jared Snow. Among these women is uptight career woman and attorney Savannah Smith. Even though DJ Jared is notoriously reclusive, Savannah meets him while investigating a case. This is the unrealistic part - he is incredibly handsome. So much for \\"a face for radio\\"! Jared becomes involved in the case and Savannah's life. The case has its twists and turns and raises issues of class and identity, making it more than the formulaic romance it could have been."},{"Title":"Heart of the Night","review":"&quot;Heart of the Night&quot; by Barbara Delinsky has three romances and suspense, it's a real page turner.

Love, lust, friendship, conflicted loyalties, fraternal twins' jealousies, insecurities, duplicity, real men with you know whats, kidnapping, frame ups and death, and of course the jerks who are bosses and coworkers. The main treat is the pulsating, throbbing voice of Jared Snow the DJ who keeps the ladies in R.I. drooling and doing other things all night long.I can recall having had a &quot;crush&quot; on an all night DJ's voice that was like smooth, creamy, luscious (fill in the blank with your choice) orgasmic-like delight. Mine? - melt in your mouth chocolates! Mmmmm.Well, anyway, although this book was written back in the 80s, it has an aura of timelessness that the author comments upon herself. I agree.

They certainly don't in Little Ego's dreams. Usually she wakes up after her dream with plans to discuss them with her therapist.This book seems like an innocuous little comic strip that serves mainly to titillate. That it does, but it is thought provoking as well. The introduction explores the many ways of thinking about dreams- are they as important as reality? Is reality really a dream? If we dream it, does it come true? Little Ego makes us ask ourselves all of these questions as she embarks on her silly sensuous misadventures.

This novel tells of a future where interstellar travel is a reality, but just barely. No galaxy-spanning empire, just a set of planets, some marginally habitable, full of colonists trying to survive, and sometimes to get ahead.The system was called Heaven, because it contained resources enough to sustain life and maybe even more. But when an outside starship fell into the system on a trade and contact mission, the crew discover how easily people can make a hell out of heaven.Civil war has reduced the once-great civilization of Heaven's Belt to a set of struggling, isolated societies, each too intent on their own survival to help the others. The crew of the starship Ranger must find a way out of the system before their ship is taken and used as the last weapon for the last war.I enjoyed the differentness of this novel. Life in the future may not be as easy as most S/F tales portray it. What would our culture turn into if we ran out of resources?"},{"Title":"Outcasts of Heaven Belt","review":"This is a minor little science fiction novel with a few really interesting ideas. It has the feel of a good author's \\"early novels\\", where they typically put a lot of effort into each book. It is definitely worth reading but not a classic, hence 3 stars.The story may be related to another book, \\"Heaven Chronicles\\", by the same Author, which I have not read.The book is about an interstellar trade mission from a planet in distress to a wealthy neighbor. The starship Ranger arrives in the system of the Heaven Belt to find that war has reduced the fabled space habitat based civilization of the belt to a bare subsistence level. The Ranger represents an extremely valuable commodity to the waring factions of the Heaven Belt and all sides start scheming and jockeying for position the moment it arrives. After lots of intrigue, the crew of the Ranger agree to use the technology of the Ranger to jump start the technological recovery of the Heaven Belt to it's former glory.This book is notable for two ideas: calendars based on the second (e.g. megaseconds instead of weeks), and the political system called \\"The Demarchy\\".Basing a calendar on multiples of the second is a sensible idea for a spaced based civilization, especially one that extends to more than one solar system. We've seen this idea used in a minor way in books like \\"The Mote In God's Eye\\" but this novel uses it consistently.The Demarchy is a totalitarian republic whose every decision is based on constant public polling. The hideously constrictive nature of a government where every decision is subject to accurately measured public whim is an amusingly subversive idea, and the author has some fun with it.The original meaning of \\"computer room\\", a room full of men who manually \\"compute\\" parts of a large mathematical problem in series, is recreated in this book. I liked that nod to the pre-computer age in a science fiction novel."},{"Title":"Outcasts of Heaven Belt","review":"The title of Joan D. Vinge's first novel, The Outcasts of Heaven Belt (1978), is an homage to The Outcasts of Poker Flat (1869) by the turn of the century western writer and poet Bret Harte. He is famous for his depictions of resourceful women in California pioneer settlements. Vinge creates a resourceful female captain of a powerful but weaponless spaceship who finds herself beset-with only a depleted crew-by a series of challenges in the decadent, grasping, and fractured pioneer societies of Heaven Belt. Although the often less than amicable conflict between the egalitarian society with powerful women and the male-focused pioneer cultures could be the focus of the novel, Vinge is less interested in exploring the social ramifications (&agrave; la Le Guin and other works of the previous decade -- the 1960s). Instead, this conflict provides a suitable world-building backdrop for a traditional space opera -- a bedraggled but technologically sophisticated spaceship beset by numerous factions which wish to take it by force.Vinge is at her best evoking the decadent world of Heaven Belt but her attempts to create convincing characters/motivations/tension is less sophisticated. The Outcasts of Heaven Belt is an uneven but readable first effort -- masterpieces such as the Hugo winning The Snow Queen (1980) and Hugo nominated The Summer Queen (1991) were to follow.Brief Plot Summary (limited spoilers)In the far future pioneers from earth, after a nameless period of political upheaval, settled less than perfect asteroid belts and planets of the galaxy. Heaven Belt, a series of asteroids, is considered by the settlements on marginal planets nearer to earth as an utopian expanse replete with natural resources. Betha, the captain of the Ranger and her crew (her husbands and wives), set out from Morningside to settle in the Heaven Belt. Little do they know that the region was previous beset by a devastating civil war. The few remaning survivors huddle in the wreckage of the asteroid settlements with dilapidated ships, failing technology, and severe radiation poisoning which creates stratified societies dependent on preserving the few remaining fertile women.The Ranger is immediately attacked by the Ringers. Most of the crew (Betha's family) is killed. Soon afterwards they gain new members -- Shadow Jack and Bird Alyn, young pirates of the crumbling Lansing settlement who attempt to capture the vessel. Eventually they come into contact with the Demarchy, a \\"pure democracy.\\" This society utilizes the remaining communication network surviving from the civil war to voice the opinions of all Demarchs. Swarms of newspeople follow everyone around but charisma and show dominate the politics. Ideas are seldom discussed in length before they are immediately voted on. I was intrigued by Vinge's discussion of this unusual political environment.In short, each society is in an advanced state of collapse. They are no longer self-sufficient and depend on each other for necessities (water, etc). However, the crumbling wrecks of spaceships prevent efficient trade. The inhabitants of Lansing asteroid huddle under their tent canopy. Those who are not plagued by deformities caused by radiation stay underground while the deformed tend the remaining gardens on the surface and are prevented from marrying or producing children. The Demarchy proclaims to follow the rule of the people but in reality, the intensely charismatic and the news agencies are the real political motivators. Other asteroid settlements are blessed with ice and supply the rest with water but choose their customers, effectively killing their rivals. For each society capturing Betha's spaceship with its production facilities is a tangible way to emerge triumphant from the wreckage of the war.Final ThoughtsThe societies Vinge creates are vividly realized. Unfortunately, the novel contains little tension. Despite numerous attempts to capture Betha's vessel, the decayed state of the societies encountered cannot challenge the vessel even without weapons and a limited crew. Also, Vinge frequently resorts to ineffective melodramatic moments replete with clich&eacute;d prose (\\"there are more stars in the galaxy than there are droplets of water in the Boreal Sea\\") and stilted poetry (\\"Understanding comes from learning / no one ever changed a world).\\" Betha's clan-based society which defines who is allowed to marry who, modeled on Native American cultures (Vinge was educated as an anthropologist), is too obviously \\"perfect\\" and \\"utopian.\\" Why would anyone leave to settle a bunch of asteroids out in the wilds of space?The world of Heaven Belt is admirably realized setting the stage for a moving work of space opera. However, the parts do not combine effectively. It lacks emotional depth and effective characterization. An intriguing first novel by an author finding her footing. I suggest tracking down her 80s and early 90s classics first."},{"Title":"Winning Mindshare : The Psychology of Personalization and One to One Marketing","review":"CRM'S goal is to build better relationships, and relationships are built on better communication.

Bookchin details his theories of history, ecology, and political organization, with other subjects along the way, within his &quot;Remaking Society.&quot; The language and the point are quite straightforward and the book serves as a handy reference to his prolific writing career."},{"Title":"Remaking Society: Pathways to a Green Future","review":"The author looks back first to ancient tribal structures and finds a very egalitarian ethos in all aspects of life. The growth of hierarchies related to age, gender, wealth, etc, to a large extent eliminated that egalitarianism. These hierarchies seem to have began with age: old people could claim special powers for their accumulated wisdom and knowledge of tribal customs. Then war was made necessary to defend the attacks of aggressive neighboring communities: hence men with their specialties in military affairs gained dominance over women and their sphere. This need justified the centralization of power. Male chiefs who had functioned as generous community leaders and in whom any concentration of wealth or arrogance was an ultimate taboo, became despots. But many communities retained an egalitarian ethos and some communities even reverted to non-hierarchal forms of society after undergoing a despotic phase, such as the American Mound Builders and the Mayans. He notes that a good example of egalitarian indigenous values was on display when Hopi Indian children were attempted to be instructed in competitive sports by the whites sent to \\"civilize\\" them but they couldn't understand the concept of keeping score.The bourgeoisie was significantly thought of as a marginal and anti-social element in every area of the world before capitalism emerged in Europe In the middle ages, markets were largely local, carefully regulated by guilds of craftsman. The nobles mainly sat on their on butts and took huge rents from their miserable serfs. It never occurred to them to horde poor people in factories and not uncommonly drive them to death to make goods and then make sick money from those goods whose wealth was created by their slaves. The marginal bourgeoisie class seems to have aspired to accumulate enough wealth to buy estates so they could live like the nobles.The bourgeoisie became most powerful in England in the early Renaissance years. The nobility had largely destroyed itself trying to loot and ravage France during the War of the Roses. The new nobles were appointed from a lower class, the bourgeoisie and other middling sorts who had the instinct to relentlessly accumulate wealth and find new ways to exploit the inferior classes. With the growth of the bourgeoisie, the power of the state grew. There was serious resistance to the growth of state power by the nobles and rural communities, the latter who might have initially seen state power as buffer against abuses by the nobles but quickly discovered the bourgeois state was in many ways worse. He points to the interesting obviously flawed but still relatively egalitarian utopian visions of people like Thomas More.The author has some interesting things to say about Marxism. That history goes through automatic stages is bunk. Marxism denies any root of spontaneity for organizing in communal egalitarian fashion. It can lead to the acceptance of plundering the earth's resources and exploitation of labor on the ground that such is \\"progressive\\" development. He gives the example of Marxist social democrat Reichstag members in Weimar Germany in the 20's,vetoing anti-monopoly legislation on the ground that blocking increasing concentration of wealth hindered the \\"progressive\\" development of capitalism. Marx for some reason did not take into account the ways capitalism would have of reforming itself to stave off its destruction such as the welfare state and regulatory agencies.I would be amiss if I did not mention that the relationship between ecology and hierarchy is one of the prime themes of this book. It is not human nature which leads to environmental degradation but the domination of people by people (hierarchy). The hierarchy created by capitalist competion leads to the unhindered power to exploit earth's resources.Well, what is the author's vision of a just society? He is all for technology. He can't stress enough how much he regards as dangerous those tendencies in the environmental movement who move into the forests and worship Goddesses and witches or other such crazy and silly things. His vision of society is rooted in the Greek ideal of citizenship. Yes, he writes, the Greeks had slaves and didn't treat ladies well, but compared to other socities in that era it was pretty progressive for that and much later periods of development of humanity. In Periclean Greece, governance was carried on by direct democracy. Property owning males were able to come to city-wide meetings and determine and vote on policies affecting them. He writes that this had some equivalent in the early town meeting forums in the early Puritan settlements in New England. It was seriously expected that the primary responsibility of a citizen was to take a day-to-day hand in governance, to be very knowledgeable about current affairs, and not to accumulate excessive wealth and to be generous in using their wealth.Interestingly the author is against worker's control of workplaces. Such workplaces should be managed by city-wide assemblies made up all of all people. Workplaces managed directly by their workers or consumers such as in co-opsk, no much more benign than regular capitalist enterprises, still have to enter the destructive realm of competition. Directly democratic assemblies would have the interests of a sustainable environment, just allocation of resources at heart and other human needs, rather than the narrow interests of economic competition. Officials to run economic enterprises (as well as other necessary enterprises) would be appointed and closely monitored and easily recalled if need be.This society is probably not going to happen within our lifetimes, the author stresses. People need to be educated about visions of society where people could freely develop their creative and intellectual potentials and not be hindered by wasting their energy creating products that only capitalists will gain the wealth from.This is an excellent book though written in a prose style that to read is somewhat hard on the cerebrum..."},{"Title":"Remaking Society: Pathways to a Green Future","review":"Not a work replete with big phrases or designed for only the most erudite of readers, this book is a good starting point for just about anyone who wants to &quot;change the world&quot;. Using rational humanism as his basis, Bookchin attacks what he views as the mystical and anti-human approach to social ecology and to politics. While the author definitely points out many flaws in several prevailing belief systems, his excessive dependence on rationality can be a turn-off at times."},{"Title":"First Pressings: The History of Rhythm and Blues : 1950","review":"I own pretty much the entire series of these books.

This can definitely save time with a dictionary (but can also be a crutch - so watch out and discipline yourself). The stories are listed in the product description.I'm assuming that you will be reading this to help study German. After about two years of a language you should be able to read a book on your own (slowly but surely). But many books will still be too complex. These are borderline. The stories here are at a level that could be read during a German 3 class, or between classes to maintain and build skills. I don't recommend this book during a German 1 or 2 class. Instead try Graded German Reader by Cossgrove during German 1. (It is expensive, but is very good if you know almost no German.) At a German 2 level move onto comic books like Tintin and Asterix, which have more complex grammar but use pictures to reinforce. Oh and by the way try replacing .com with .de on large websites for the German version. (This works on Amazon!) Especially look for fashion pages and \\"light\\" reading. You can understand more than you think!Basically if you can already read moderately complex German then this is an economic book to read through. If you can't already pick up a book and read through it then this is not for you. However to get a book at your level ask advice from a German instructor. Chances are they will have had to study German, including literature, in college and will be familiar with the authors here. They can recommend authors to you and tell you if this is over your level.

He's good at what he does but some of his current cases don't look promising. The owners of a toxic waste dump are willing to talk settlement, but the leader of the neighborhood group Eric is representing wants revenge for his son's illness. The muckraking dumpster-diver is holding out for vindication rather than the slap on the wrist that he could get. Finally, a newspaperman comes to him with rumors about insurance fraud involving the man Eric suspects has taken up with his wife. When one of his clients is killed and another suspected of the murder, Eric's life gets more complicated in a hurry.Author Roy Lewis switches between Eric's point of view and that of DCI Charlie Spate. Spate is working the cases for the police and hopes to pin something on a mobster who has his hands in both prostitution and drugs in the northern England city of Tyne. Spate has problems of his own--having been drummed out of the Met and suffering from an acute case of lust for one of his female detectives. Neither man trusts the other and both insist on working the case from their own angles.THE NIGHTWALKER is an interesting mystery filled with characters with histories, pains, and goals that are certain to be frustrated. Unfortunately, Lewis doesn't completely deliver on the potential of his characters or the story. Eric and Spate both seem too beaten by the world to fight back with all of their force--and often seem to approach the mystery with that same attitude."},{"Title":"Paul, Moses and the History of Israel: The Letter/Spirit Contrast and the Argument from Scripture on 2 Corinthians 3 (Paternoster Biblical Monographs) (Paternoster Biblical Monographs)","review":"Scott Hafemann has done an excellent job in presenting a correct understanding of the Spirit/letter contrast in 2 Corinthians 3. The conclusion that he reaches has implications for a whole understanding of the Old Testament and the its relation to the New Testament. The essential message is this... The law was not inherently &quot;bad&quot; or oppression to the people of Israel. The problem resided with the people themselves. Only a remnant were true followers of Yahweh. For this faithful remnant, who had the Spirit operating in their lives, the law was good (cf. Psalm 119, et al). But for those without the Spirit (the majority of Israel), the law was simply &quot;letter&quot;, and a burden. They did not want to keep it, nor could they. Seeing this helps us to understand both &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; statements about the law in the NT writings.Hats off to Hafemann!"},{"Title":"Paul, Moses and the History of Israel: The Letter/Spirit Contrast and the Argument from Scripture on 2 Corinthians 3 (Paternoster Biblical Monographs) (Paternoster Biblical Monographs)","review":"This book is an interesting and original way of looking at Paul's view of the Law, Israel, and Redemption through 2 Corinthians 3. Hafemann's thesis is that contrary to the traditional Protestant understanding of 2 Cor. 3 or the \\"law/grace\\" dichotomy, Paul wrote 2 Cor. 3 to tell the Corinthians that Israel could not obey the Mosaic Law and obtain salvation because their hearts were \\"veiled\\" or hardened. According to Hafemann, Paul did not oppose the Law, but opposed the Law without the Spirit. The reason why many Israelites throughout history were unregenerate is because they lack the Spirit to obey the law as it was meant to be. Many reject Christ and stumble because they want to pursue righteousness through the Law outside of Christ. However, the New Covenant doesn't go against the Law or change it, but provides the Spirit to New Covenant believers so that they can fulfill the demands of the Law and be saved on the Last Judgment. The practical implications of the author's thesis is alarming. This view downgrades the sacrificial work of Christ and undermines justification by faith alone. It is not surprising that Hafemann follows suit with his predecessor Peter Stuhlmacher. Stuhlmacher (who was taught by E. Kasemann) follows the \\"forensic/transformative\\" view of righteousness (as does Hafemann), rather than the purely forensic view held by Luther, Calvin and the Reformers. The view held by Kasemann, Stuhlmacher, and Hafemann is a compromise between traditional Protestant and Roman Catholic soteriology. This is very dangerous and can undermine the Reformation. In many places throughout the book, Hafemann does indeed say that we must obey the Law in order to be saved on the Last Judgment. Traditional Protestants say that we are already justified in Christ and that our stand at the Last Judgment is for that truth to be ratified apart from our works (however, works do define what degree of glory we will possess in the future kingdom as in 1 Cor. 3:10-15). Unfortunately, many within the \\"Protestant/Evangelical\\" tradition have been snared into this new view on Paul and justification. Recent works by Fuller and Garlington reveal where modern evangelicals are plummeting towards. Sola Fide is losing out these days because of these new trends. Also, Hafemann's work is hard to read. Many people will have to pay close attention to every word the author uses to understand what he is trying to say. This book is more geared towards seminarians doing their doctoral thesis. Finally, I would also suggest that people learn Biblical Greek and modern German before reading this book."},{"Title":"The practice of Zen","review":"I couldn't agree more with Ikeda-san. I'd give it \\"six stars\\"! This book was my \\"Bible\\" when I first became interested in Zen. Thank heavens it's now back in print after years of unavailability.Particularly inspiring are the 40-odd pages devoted to discourses of great masters like Hsu Yun and Han-Shan (Nansen), followed by the most inspirational extracts from autobiographies of classic masters from the \\"golden age of Zen\\" in China.Here's Zen straight from the horse's mouth, straight from the living experience of enlightened masters. If I were to have but one book on Zen it would be this one. I'd recommend anyone who takes Zen seriously to get it while you can.Scattered throughout the book are gathas composed after awakenings, such as:Waves and ripples flowIn the cool sky;Fish and birds swimIn one mirrorOn and on, day after day.Last night the moon fell from the heavens.Now is the time to illumineThe black dragon's pearl. .... ( autobiography of Han Shan )."},{"Title":"The practice of Zen","review":"Garma Chang's engaging book conveys a clear idea of what Ch'an/Zen practice actually involves - illustrated by succinct readings from classic Ch'an/Zen texts, spanning centuries. These are not just more 'Zen stories' - presented without rhyme of reason. You get a good spread of teachings, backed up by fascinating observations about certain key terms/idioms,and there isn't a wasted word, from cover-to-cover. While respectful of the Ch'an/Zen axiom - \\"not to speak too plainly\\" (pu shuo pu), Chang's remarks place the practice in its proper context of Mahayana Buddhism. So far possible, Chang takes you 'inside' the minds of the teachers and practicers quoted in this book. This book offers some refreshing 'angles' on Zen practice, which reflect Chang's own experience in mainland Chinese temples and a familiarity with key Ch'an/Zen sources. Chang had an excellent command of English (not always the case with Asian Buddhist teachers/translators), and was thus well placed to present the material in this text. Following the Communist takeover of China, Chang took up American citizenship and eventually became a Professor at Penn State Uni, drawing on his valuable experience with traditional Buddhist teachings.Alas, this excellent book has had a relatively low profile since its publication in 1959, and well deserves reprinting. It was perhaps, ahead of its time, hitting the market before Westerners wanted to practice Ch'an/Zen with any seriousness, or in sufficient numbers, to give it the profile it deserved. The subsequent boom in interest - fostered by the fruits of post-war contact with Japan, brought focus upon the Japanese Zen schools. Still, it is worth noting that - D.T. Suzuki, one of the most seminal figures behind this expansion of interest - based his most successful writings upon the records of Chinese masters of the Tang. I'm not suggesting, for a minute, that we should ignore the good things brought our way by dint of contact with the Japanese Zen schools - but,in some respects, we have become mired in institutional postures which matter far less than we might suppose. Indeed, Philip Kalpeau's Japanese Zen teachers had 'mixed' backgrounds - and, not everyone toes this 'institutional' line.Chang touches on this issue, which had its roots in Chinese Buddhism, but in the final estimate, it isn't such a big deal. Refreshingly, Garma Chang presents Ch'an/Zen Buddhism on a large canvas, reflecting his wide experience (he had Tibetan Buddhist teachers, besides Chinese ones). Besides this book dealing with Ch'an/Zen, he gave us a beautiful translation of Milarepa's Buddhist verses (The Hundred Thousand Songs of Milarepa), a translation of the Maharatnakuta, and a truly groundbreaking translation of key Hua-yen texts, with lively commentary suitable for contemporary readers. These latter works have kept a stronger profile - but, if you value Ch'an/Zen Buddhism, don't miss this precious little pearl of a book - 'The Practice of Zen.'"},{"Title":"The practice of Zen","review":"Garma C. C. Chang \\"was trained in Chinese monasteries, and at a later stage was initiated into Tibetan Buddhism.\\"He wrote in the Foreword to this 1959 book, \\"In the hope of furthering an understanding of Zen and making things easier for those who have been searching for practical instruction, I selected, translated, and presented herein a number of short autobiographies and discourses of the great Zen Masters, from both ancient and modern sources, which ... are generally unknown in the West. From the contents of these documents one may obtain a picture of the lives and works of the Zen Masters, thus getting a clearer idea of how Zen work is actually done... Although as a whole this book is of an introductory nature, it is perhaps more specific on certain problems and in certain fields of Zen study than some other books of its kind available at present in the English language.\\"Here are some additional quotations from the book:\\"Zen can be explained in numerous ways because there are no definite 'instructions' for Zen to follow... However, in order to make Zen a little easier to understand, let us temporarily and arbitrarily allocate ... koans into the following three groups: 1. Koans that illustrate Zen-truth through plain and direct statements... 2. Koans that illustrate Zen-truth through a negating approach... 3. Koans that may be described as somewhat beyond...\\" (Pg. 17)\\"It the phrase, 'Not thinking of good, not thinking of evil,' is considered by itself, this koan is easily misinterpreted as being negative or nullifying. But the real point of the Sixth Patriarch's remark is in the words that follow: right at this very moment, that is your original face.' Nothing could be more direct and affirmative than this.\\" (Pg. 21)\\"One day, however, when (Prime Minister) Kuo Tse I, as usual, paid a visit to the Zen Master, he asked the following question: 'Your Reverence, how does Buddhism explain egotism?' The Zen Master's face suddenly turned blue, and in an extremely haughty and contemptuous manner he addressed the premier as follows: 'What are you saying, you numbskull?' This unreasonable and unexpected defiance so hurt the feelings of the prime minister that a slight, sullen expression of anger began to show on his face. The Zen Master then smiled and said, 'Your Excellency, this is egotism!'\\" (Pg. 31)\\"Buddhist enlightenment is not gained by holding onto or inflating one's self-awareness. On the contrary, it is gained through killing or crushing any attachment to this illuminating consciousness; only by transcending it can one come to the innermost core of Mind---the perfectly free and thoroughly nonsubstantial illuminating-Voidness.\\" (Pg. 44)\\"The work of our Ch'an has no gradual processes or successive stages. This Ch'an is the supreme Ch'an of seeing one's Buddha-nature instantly. But if this is so, why should one bother to practice the so-called Seven Days' Meditation? [We must understand that] people's capacity to practice the Dharma is deteriorating all the time. Nowadays people have too many distracting thoughts in their minds. Therefore the Patriarchs have designed special methods and techniques, such as the Seven Days' Meditation Practice, the koan exercises, the circle-running exercise, and so forth, to cope with this condition and to help persons of lesser capacity.\\" (Pg. 75)"},{"Title":"Leonard Bernstein","review":"A delightful book for Bernstein fans. As the author says in his preface, it's not a biography. It consists of episode after episodes of Bernstein's genius work life. We, the general public, take his work for granted and be amazed by his genius, but we have no idea how much commitment and dedication were given to each work he has delivered. NOt just his dedication but everybody else who had collaborated with him. After reading this book, I can appreciate his work even more.The author never loses good humor and he writes about the most difficult situations he and the maestro had faced with good spirits and wit. Bernstein was a great man, but so was Schuyler Chapin, I should say.Humphrey Burton's Bernstein's biography is a good book to go with this one (it's a great book also, by the way). Just as some episodes made me laugh in Burton's bio, this one made me laugh and smile many times. The dinner party episode, visit with Japanese writer Mishima, the helicopter episode, and many more will tell you warmly and humrously about the man. The great maestro was not only a genius but quite a character.It also tells what and how much effort it takes to put a great performace up on stage for us to enjoy. I shall not complain about concert tickets being expensive any more!Easy read, relaxed and reader-friendly, great page-turner.I didn't want to finish reading it."},{"Title":"Witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart England","review":"For those interested in the history of witch-trials, rather than modern witchcraft practices, Macfarlane's study is a classic and even necessary study. After reading extensively in the anthropological literature of the time, Macfarlane formulates a close reading of documents from Tudor/Stuart England.In essence, Macfarlane argues that accusers usually knew those they accused quite well; they were in fact commonly neighbors. Under older medieval conceptions of neighborliness, one was supposed to offer elderly women (as the accused very often were) charity and the like. But in the early modern period, with the difficult economic conditions all over Europe and the rise of new conceptions of privacy, property, and so forth, as well as tremendous population growth, people increasingly did not feel inclined toward such easy charity. What commonly occurs, then, is that a middle-class landowner turns away a somewhat unpleasant elderly beggar, who then stalks away cursing and muttering; indeed, even if given charity, she may similarly stalk away cursing, perhaps believing the charity stingy, or perhaps angry at a situation which requires her to beg for charity at all. The landowner now feels guilt: he or she has in some sense violated a traditional trust. One way to assuage this guilt, however, is to assert that the woman was undeserving of Christian charity, on the grounds that she is a witch. Thus the accusation of witchcraft could serve to assuage one's own personal sense of guilt.This is an extremely simplistic version of Macfarlane's complex social-historical reading. More broadly, he goes through huge numbers of documents and establishes that difficulties of social relations seem to underlie the majority of accusations in his chosen period and region.While Macfarlane's work has been improved upon for both England and for the rest of the witch-hunting Euro-American world, it is nevertheless a seminal work in the social understanding of witchcraft accusations. The basic problem, you see, is that usually there is no reason to think that the accused witches had actually done anything resembling &quot;witchcraft&quot; -- no, they were not midwives, cunning women, or anything of the kind, as a rule. So the questions are (1) why were these particular sorts of people singled out, and (2) why did anyone level the accusations in the first place?Macfarlane's book should be on the shelf of anyone serious about studying the history of the witch-hunt phenomenon in Europe. If you are a witch, you may find nothing of value here, as suggested by a previous reviewer. If you are interested on an historical level, however, this is a major work."},{"Title":"Witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart England","review":"This book was some what imformative, however lacking in accurate statements.

The book cover usually features a photograph of some dessert guaranteed to strike fear in the heart of even the most intrepid baker, and recipes that promise to be the soul of simplicity frequently reveal themselves to be of a nature as involved and delicate as I would imagine hostage negotiations to be.Ken Haedrich's \\"Simple Desserts\\" looked as though it might actually fulfill the promise held by its title. Of course I expected that the book would hold at least a few recipes that required more than the attention span of a gnat; after all, if a book like \\"Simple Desserts\\" were 100% true to its title, you would open it to find one-sentence recipes along the lines of, \\"Have a nice apple.\\"As early as page 32, though, things begin to unravel. Haedrich succumbs to the temptation of including a Mocha Brownie Cheesecake recipe he developed while making restaurant cheesecakes for a living. He semi-apologetically writes:\\" . . . this is not a snap to make . . . you must bake a crust and brownies ahead, and make the icing if you're using it . . .\\"Haedrich also includes a recipe for Dark Chocolate Fruitcake which requires a whopping 19 ingredients and an overnight rest, and a recipe for Steamed Black Chocolate Cake which, while it sounds lovely to eat, sounds ridiculous to make (lots of melting and cooling of different ingredients, a two-hour steam bath, and lots of checking of the water level during said steam bath. I would imagine that along with this comes lots of chewing of the fingernails). The Lemon Cheesecake Tartlets require the following:\\"Cut 12 strips of wax paper 6 inches long by 3/4 inch wide. Press 1 strip into each [muffin] cup, neatly tucked into the bottom seams. It should run down the sides and across the bottom, with an even overhang on each side of the cup.\\"Just the thought of having to do this makes me want to go stick my head out the window and scream. You may rest assured that, delectable though they may be, these Lemon Cheesecake Tartlets will not be made anytime soon by yours truly.Haedrich thinks nothing of asking you to let a dessert sit before serving, frequently overnight, and fully half of his cookie recipes call for refrigerating the dough before baking. In another cookbook, none of this would offend me in the slightest, but in one bearing the sunny subtitle of \\"Sweet Endings with a Carefree Spirit,\\" I have to say that sweet endings of this ilk make my carefree spirit start to deflate.I have nothing against any of Haedrich's recipes themselves; they look fine, and some even have wonderful twists on the usual (Orange and Toasted Coconut Cr&egrave;me Brl&eacute;e and Semolina Cake with Olive Oil are among the many that intrigued me). I do, however, have to take exception to the fact that quite a number of these were included in a book with the title \\"Simple Desserts.\\" Certainly, simplicity is in the eye of the beholder--but it is fair to say that in order to really fit the book title, the ingredient list, the method of preparation, or the amount of time involved (or, preferably, all three) must be of a lucidity and a conciseness that even a kitchen neophyte could embrace. That is simply (pun intended) not the case here.That said, it is a pretty book to look at, and the directions seem mostly pretty clear. Haedrich is particularly strong on fruit-based desserts, a rarity in our chocolate-obsessed society. While I would recommend \\"Simple Desserts\\" as a nice compilation of yummy-sounding recipes, I would not consider getting it for a beginning cook--or even for a cook who is simply pressed for time."},{"Title":"Simple Desserts","review":"I have only used one recipe from this cookbook so far, but it really is worth the price of the book. His pie crust recipe was the final touch to make my own Southern pecan pie perfect. It's different in that it has some rolled oats (processed until they are like meal) and an egg yolk in it. The dough is a little sticky, so you have to get used to handling it. BUT .... it bakes like a dream - tender, tasty, just perfect.The rest of the book seems to have a broad range of recipes and I plan on trying many of them. The ones in the back for chocolate sauces and ganaches will be the first, I'm sure."},{"Title":"Simple Desserts","review":"This is not the cookbook to buy for the regular dessert fare such as plain chocolate chip cookies and standard apple pie, if that's what you're looking for then the all-inclusive Betty Crocker would be a much more straightforward choice. This book has a wonderfully fresh and creative selection of dessert varieties, many fruit-related, that are beyond your average Betty Crocker recipe. Desserts such as 'Lemon Cake with Wheat Germ' have healthier twists and were absolutely delicious (despite my extreme wariness of adding wheat germ to sweet things and ruining their wonderful dessert-ness). Other recipes such as 'Pumpkin Bread Pudding with Warm Chocolate Sauce' and 'Blueberry Pear Pie' take some of your more standard dessert ideas and add a fresh flavor to them that comes out tantalizingly delicious.The recipes aren't, perhaps, as \\"simple\\" as the title may lead one to believe, but they are definitely easy enough for the average cook to perform. There are also helpful tips scattered throughout the book such as how to neatly cut a cheesecake without having it stick to the knife or what to do about troublesome phyllo dough, and each recipe comes with a brief paragraph about what you might expect from the dessert you're about to make (\\"this is a cross between a pudding and a custard\\" or \\"The cake is black, thanks to the molasses, coffee, and cocoa\\") so that when your cake comes out black, you know that that's ok. He also includes a number of other ideas even within a recipe such as \\"goes well with chopped dried pears or dried cranberries instead of raisins\\" which makes substitutions much easier if you abhore raisins, for instance.Overall a wonderful twist on standard desserts that comprehensively covers pies, crumbles, cheesecakes, cookies, bars, ice cream, and much more."},{"Title":"Principles and Practice of Environmental Medicine","review":"This book has been extremely valuable to me ever since I began working as a hazardous waste epidemiologist.

I found a copy at a local University library-a tiny volume printed in 1927 by Alfred Knopf. I am a diehard Kubrick fan and was thrilled as I turned each page and recognized many scenes seen in the Eyes Wide Shut promo. Leelee Sobrieski's film character in the carnival shop must be the somewhat deranged adolescent kept by the sinister costumer. (This character is never thoroughly explained- indeed this level of teasing ambiguity is what makes Schnitzler's narrative so compelling.) After all the hullabaloo concerning the &quot;supposed&quot; cross-dressing and drug-use in the film, I was pleased to find that Rhapsody is all dark undercurrent and dancing shadows. There are real moments of danger and sexual angst to be sure, but it's so subtle it hurts. The original title Dream Novel is apt- the protagonist's adventures happen within the space of night and the following day. As he journeys through the town in the afternoon glare he begins to doubt that any of the peculiar and frightening things he's been a part of could actually have happened. He strives to understand his relationship to these experiences in a rational way- to no avail. Get the book! It's scintillating and sharp leaving lots to the imagination and plenty of leeway to interpret the characters motives."},{"Title":"Rhapsody: A Dream Novel","review":"&quot;Traumnovelle&quot; is a fine novella which masterfully employs the epic mythological structure to send it's main character Froidlin on a psychosexual odyssey. The character struggles with an attempt to engage in meaningless sexual debauchery in order to cuckold his wife. He finds, however that he can not divorce himself emotionally from sexual activity. Schnitzler is a masterful hand at creating an adult fairy tale the moral of which remains poignant today."},{"Title":"Rhapsody: A Dream Novel","review":"Die Traumnovelle is a psychological novel (in fact Schnitzel and Freud were often in touch) who deals with the need for transgression. The two main characters, married, get bored with their everyday life and routine and so they start longing for what I'd call &quot;adventure&quot;. But eventually, they understand that adventure isn't what we really want, it's just a temptation and once we satisfy it, it seems much less exciting than we thought. In fact what the two characters really want is exactly their everyday life and eventually they get back to it... I'm sorry, I could have explained this a lot better in Italian ;-)"},{"Title":"Rhapsody: A Dream Novel","review":"Like everyone else, I imagine I felt driven to acquire and read this book in the name of the forthcoming Stanley Kubrick movie. To hear such a genius refer so highly to a single work instills a deep desire to see for yourself. After finally landing a copy (without tossing too much from the old wallet), I completed the book in a near single sitting. Schnitzler's Rhapsody mesmerizes. He deftly tapped into the hidden desires and uncontrollable urges, thoughts and desires of us all. To want what we do not have; and when (or if) we seek that which is at most times forbidden - we find ourselves in an often worse position - showing us the damaging course our libidos and dark halves will send us upon. I found myself often times reading with a nervous, yet libidinously charged smile - feeling both the exhillaration and the utmost despair and hatred. The story of Fridolin is the experience which we all are capable of. It is indeed Rhapsody.

It finishes a close second to Flint, the best one ever! Conagher is so true to what the hard, tough life in the Old West must have truly been like. Hostile environments, punishing weather, sinister bad-guys and threatening Indians keep this story moving right along. Included as a very important part of this great story is the sense of overwhelming loneliness experienced by so many of those who packed up and relocated to the West. Conagher's eventual love interest has an unusual way of expressing herself and the depth of her lonely existence. Read it and you'll understand! Also, don't miss the movie version of this story, starring Sam Elliott, his real-life wife Catherine Ross, and the wonderful Barry Corbin. The movie and the portrayals by these actors is simply outstanding. Absolutely no one can portray a western character as realistically as Sam Elliott does! Louis would have been exceptionally proud!"},{"Title":"Conagher","review":"This is the finest novel I have ever read in my life, and I have read a LOT of novels, from Hawthorne and Twain to contemporaries like King, Koontz, Clancy, Grisham, Hillerman, etc. But this is absolutely the best. This novel proves that Louis L'amour, at his best, could do in 152 pages what most other writers struggle to do in 552. It is full of loneliness, heartache, honor, integrity, toughness, redemption, and action. Read the book and then watch the movie with Sam Elliott and Katherine Ross. You will LOVE them both. A masterpiece."},{"Title":"Conagher","review":"An exceptional book, quite possibly one of his best. &quot;Conagher&quot; brings to life the dangerous and lonely life that was the &quot;Old West&quot;. This books has it all, from its vivid portrayal of the rugged country and harsh lifestyle, to the characters themselves. L'Amour has a nack for drawing his readers into his stories and making them feel like they are actually there cheering the heroes on."},{"Title":"Conagher","review":"There are only two requirement for buying this book: 1) You have to like Westerns; and 2) You like an easy read.\\"Conagher\\" is not an all-time great like \\"Lonesome Dove,\\" by Larry McMurtry, nor can it compete with just about any of Elmore Leonard's offbeat Westerns, but it is the kind of book you'd like to take along for one of those quiet nights in the middle of nowhere, with the campfire as your only light.Conn Conagher is getting a bit long in the tooth, has a code all his own (a loyal man, he rides for the brand), and he's beginning to feel it might be about time to settle down. Amid plenty of action -- shootouts and fist-fights abound -- he meets recently widowed Evie Teale and her two children, a family struggling away on the range, all on their own after Jacob Teale meets the lonely fate of a many a cowboy out on the trail.A more demanding reader might call the novel a bit hokey. For that type of discriminating reader, there's always Camus or Sartre and whatever kind of highly acclaimed, arsty-farsty stuff the critics in downtown New York currently rave about.But if you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of city living and go back to a paradoxically more simple but tougher time in the Old West, then this book is a fine example of Louis L'Amour at his best, painting a nice picture in his own easy, uncomplicated way. It's a book for the everyman, one any cowboy (or wannabe cowboy) should enjoy."},{"Title":"Conagher","review":"Conagher is the name of the main character in this western by Louis L'Amour. He is a loner, who as he is growing older, needs to find a permanent place to hang his hat.Mrs. Teale, a woman who has been widowed without knowing it, runs a stage way station and dreams of raising cattle when her husband returns with the stock he is supposed to be buying. Taking care of her two step-children, she shows courage and foresight. Once she realizes that her husband is not coming back, she welcomes Conagher into her home and heart.The descriptions of the western landscape and the people who lived there in the late 19th century make this book worth reading."},{"Title":"Conagher","review":"Conagher made for fun and inspiring reading, which is what I've come to expect and appreciate from L'Amour. The fun is found in the exciting events and how L'Amour unfolds them; the inspiration comes from seeing the characters in tough situations holding fast to their ideals and mustering up the strength to press on.I read this book over several days on my morning bus ride into work. Waiting for that bus in frigid five-degree weather gave me a great appreciation for Conn's trek through the snow searching for the rustled ST cattle. L'Amour described it and paced it perfectly. It served to show Conn's integrity and commitment to his word, to his employer and to a higher ideal of right and wrong.But Conn isn't a one-dimensional white-hatted cowboy, he's introspective and questions his unflagging commitment to the brand. He knows his romanticism resulted from reading too much Walter Scott as a boy. He does a lot of thinking and dreaming while alone on the range.The first chapter, in which Conagher does not even appear, is perhaps the highlight of the book. It can stand alone as a short story and I'd highly recommend its inclusion in a Norton Anthology of American Literature.I can give Conagher only four stars because of several shortcomings that stuck in my craw. First a major continuity error that would have been caught had L'Amour gone back and revised/tightened the book (something for which he's famous for not doing). In the closing chapters Kris Mahler states that the man Conn killed in the hills back of Teale's was his riding partner Hi Jackson. In fact, Conn killed Hi Jackson on the Seaborn Tay ranch far south of the Teale homestead. (The man Conn killed in the hills was never identified.)A second major shortcoming was the rushed pace of the conclusion. After a several-page blow-by-blow account of a barroom brawl, L'Amour suddenly whizzes us through Conagher's epiphany, throws us a Dickensian coincidental meeting (a textbook example of Deus ex machina), and ushers the reader out the door.Other more minor complaints include the lack of grief and concern expressed from Jacob's children after their father's disappearance and the inexplicable noble turn taken by the loathsome Smoke when the Ladder Five gang has Conn down and vulnerable. These are the cowards who earlier shot Conn in the back!These flaws are frustrating because with a little refining L'Amour could have better fulfilled the book's potential. Nonetheless, despite everything, and with a tip of the ten-gallon to Louis' talent, Conagher is great reading. I recommend it highly (especially to women looking to sample the Western genre). I'm already enjoying my fifth L'Amour novel (Reilly's Luck) and am looking forward to tackling many more in the future."},{"Title":"Conagher","review":"I particularly liked the characters in this book and the way the ending brought it all together. One of my favorites of his."},{"Title":"Conagher","review":"This is a good read. As authentic and gritty as you expect from L'Amour, but also a romance. I really enjoyed this story. It gives the perspectives of both the cowboy, Conagher, and the widow, which is interesting and a little different from the L'Amours I'm used to reading. Of course, being L'Amour and really a western rather than a romance there isn't really any actual romantic scenes, but I didn't miss them. I'd recommend this to any L'Amour fan, or western fan in general."},{"Title":"Conagher","review":"This is a good western with a lot of heart. Conagher is a man of few words, yet by his life and by the few words he speaks, he is able to change the lives of the people around him. Young men know that meeting Conagher is a turning point in their lives; they can either learn from Conagher and become better men, or reject him and slide into a life of thievery and disgrace. Conagher is just a leader of men no matter where he meets them.The love story is a good one too, very subdued and quiet, like the man Conagher himself. He is just a cowboy of the trail, with little money and less future. Will there ever be any woman who sees his true worth?"},{"Title":"Conagher","review":"As others have said, this is one of L'Amour's best books -- with a stronger romantic plot than usual. It's certainly one of the best ways to start reading this author -- or to start again if you haven't read his stuff lately. And Sam Elliot is fabulously cast as Conagher in the movie made of this book. Truly worth watching."},{"Title":"Conagher","review":"L'Amour, one of the great American West Storytellers of our time, did a good job with this story about a down-and-out drifter and a recent widow, both trying to survive in a harsh world. He went the extra mile by adding the part about Evie writing her thoughts on scraps of paper and attaching them to tumbleweeds. Half the cowhands in the area are chasing tumbleweeds, dreaming of the lonely woman who must be writing them.

First it starts out you hearing about a stange man who nobody had a good fealing about. People had heard bad things about this man and some had eye wittnessing experiences with this man his name was Mr Hyde. Mr Hyde was always seen going into Dr. Jekylls house and no one new why one day Detective Utterson decided to investigate for he was a very good friend of Dr Jekyll. Dr. Jekyll was a very rich man he lived in a very big house with cooks and servents. One day Detective Utterson decided to go and question Dr. Jekell. The real reason he went to talk to Dr. Jekyll was abou this will it gave everything he owned to Mr. Hyde. Detective Utterson wanted to know why he was a good friend of Dr. Jekylls and had never met only heard o this Mr. Hyde. When Detective Utterson spoke to Dr. Jekyll he assured him everything was alright and that he wanted Mr. Hyde to get everything. when Detective Utterson pushed more to know what was going on and why he was doing this Dr. Jekyll became angry and didnt want to talk about it any more and invited Detective Utterson to leave his house. Detective utterson did to later find out that late that night Mr. Hyde killed a man. As soon as he found out what had happened he went to talk to Dr. Jekell. Dr. Jekyll sad Detective Utterson and assured him that he had no more contact with Mr. Hyde. Detective Utterson accepted that and he left. Later Detective Utterson said that he saw a diffrence in Dr. Jekyll he was a happier better person. a few months later he had announced that he was going to die and that he didnt want any visitors to see him in such a state of life. Detective Utterson decided that that was not an excuse so Detective Utterson went over to see Dr. Jekyll. When he got there he was denied and nobody would let him see Dr. Jekyll. When he was just about to leave Dr. Jekyll pulled him aside and he said that is not my Master Dr. Jekyll that man is who i belive to be Mr. Hyde. Detective Utterson did some investigating and found the man to indeed be Mr. Hyde now there only problem was that they needed to catch him. they did and to there horror they discovered it to be DR. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde for indeed they were the same man. As the real Dr. Jekyll was explaining this he said he had made a concouction that made men turn into a new man.

Through a string of events involving a murder, a trampled child and Utterson's encounter with an 'evil' man named Hyde, Mr. Utterson becomes involved very much in his client and friend, Dr. Jekyl's, life. In the end you find out that Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde (the 'evil' man who turns out to be the murderer) are really one person. Mr. Hyde is part of Dr. Jekyl and Dr. Jekyl has only to drink a concoction of chemicals to become Hyde, in shape and mind, until the drink is drunk again to reverse the change again. Jekyl comes to despise Hyde and he knows that the only way to be rid of Hyde is to kill himself. Jekyl kills himself in the end and both Hyde and Jekyl are no more.The way this book is written in somewhat confusing and bland at times.

Rather, it is a tale of Dr Jekyll, a man who invents a potion that allows him to transform himself into a more assertive, albeit fiendish being (Mr. Hyde) for a small period of time where his original personality is suppressed. These periods grow longer as Jekyll loses control etc. etc. It's not a bad concept but I found it not to be much more deep than that - it seemed kind of on the same level as spin-off versions of the concept, like the film \\"The Mask\\".This had the potential to be a much more punchy, psychological story but psychology is not Stevenon's special trademark.

He has left us at least two masterpieces: \\"The Treasure Island\\" (1883) and \\"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" (1886) and some other good novels such as \\"The Black Arrow\\" (1888).It is amazing how writers and poets are able, thru intuition, to anticipate events or discoveries. When this book as first published, Sigmund Freud was studying with Charcot and not so many years later will produce his theoretic corpus of the human psyche. At some points the present story touches Freud's conceptualizations.Dr. Jekyll suspect evil burdens every human soul, being an obstacle in its way to goodness. So he investigates and produces a drug that \\"liberates\\" the evil spirit and doing so he intend to be relived of it.But Evil starts to grow each time more powerful and emerging Mr. Hyde ends cornering Dr. Jekyll into impotence and fear.This story has captivated the public's imagination for more than a hundred years. Movies, comics and theater pieces had evolved from it. His tortured dual character is now a well known icon as Stoker's Dracula or Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.Even if you know more or less the story and its ending, reading this very short book is a powerful adventure.A Classic you shouldn't let passes by unheeded!Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"A quick, enjoyable read, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde provides something of a reflection on the end of the spirit of alchemy which strove to connect the physical and the metaphysical through an almost-mystical mingling of the sciences with spirituality. Without cutting into the deeper considerations of philosophical schools, it is without question that humanity exists as a combination of various good and wicked impulses, although the promptings of such impulses will forever be relegated to the reflections of theologians and philosophers. In any case, the story of Henry Jekyll and his desire to remove from himself the inherent weakness of our somewhat duplicitous, multi-faced nature is the story of each member of humanity. It is our combined quest to always aim higher and to overcome those weakness which chain us to the lower strata of the waking world.However, Henry Jekyll's story is also that of each fallen man who often attempts to ameliorate his condition by using his own power. It is also the story of a society which believes that it is within its collective power to create the world anew in holiness without the internal rectitude necessary to affect true change. His isolated alchemical processes expose him to the dubious character of Edward Hyde, an apparition of his dark, untamed humanity, which arrives on the scene precisely as Jekyll attempts to create himself anew by his own strength alone. The story of the good doctor's fall into a fancy for this darker side of himself is a fine example of the destruction of spirit which comes when the individual believes himself to be the sole master of his own amelioration. His own individualistic tendencies and their ultimate end are a continuous warning to all of humanity, for the same character flaws which are expressed with such noble intentions in Dr. Jekyll's character are those same well-intentioned hopes of all humanity which often lead to our own power-derived slip into the bowels of hell."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"This is another classic that has seeped into popular culture. And, although the ending is a foregone conclusion, this book is still an enjoyable read. Stevenson does a stellar job of keeping an air of mystery about Mr. Hyde and his vile acts. He presents vivid imagery that enhances the overall environment. Throughout the novel, the supernatural conflicts with science and logic. It is not until the very end when the full scope of Jekyll's experiments and actions come to light.It's also interesting to think about what Mr. Hyde's terrible actions were, that lent him an evil aura in Victorian London. Let's see. . . He describes countless acts of undignified and secret pleasures, youthful indiscretions, highly irregular behavior, a morbid sense of shame. Couple that with the fact that all the men are unmarried bachelors . . . Hmmmm . . . .Anyway, there are a couple of weak points in the book. The idea that Dr. Lanyon would become ill and succumb to death after seeing Jekyll's transformation seems far-fetched, even for this tale. Also, Utterson's lack of desire to find the truth seems a bit odd, although perhaps it is a reflection of the Victorian era which put respect and honor above truth.This novel is still relevant to today. Although there are no magical elixirs, the news wires are, unfortunately, littered with stories about the dark underside of man. A seemingly normal person can suddenly go \\"postal\\" and destroy countless human lives. Overall, I would highly recommend this book for a quick and easy read."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"This is one of the greatest books from English (Stevenson was actually Scottish) literature. It is one of the best reads I have ever plunged into.READ IT DAMN YOU!!!"},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"After watching THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN, I realized I had no idea what these character's stories were. Well, I had a peripheral memory of seeing a DORIAN GRAY movie, but...So I dive into this book first. Stevenson's language clips along very cleanly - the narrative perspectives are always true to their narrator. These older men - their friendships - their distress over some shadowy character that has come into and is ruining the life of a beloved friend... I never had the impression that this was what the JEKYLL/HYDE story would contain.This is no &quot;monster story&quot; - it is the story of the parts of ourselves that make us whole and what happens if that balance is upset - if one side is given favor - or perhaps if the other side is constantly supressed and never let free to express itself.And a side note: Doctor John Fell (1625-1686) is a symbol of &quot;an instantaneous, intense, visceral, irrational dislike for another human being. Hate at first sight, one might call it.&quot;"},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"In my opinion, I have found that \\"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll &amp; Mr. Hyde\\" by Robert Louis Stevenson has been a rather intriguing piece of eighteenth century literature. For this entire piece of literature is seen through the eyes of Mr. Utterson, Dr. Jekyll's best friend.If you do not already know, this book is about a good-natured Physician who found himself wanting to be evil. Thus, he (Dr. Jekyll) begins to experiment with chemicals in order to create a serum that will make him take on a different form (so he will not ruin his reputation or get prosecuted for his wrongdoings) and allows him become evil; Dr. Jekyll names his evil half Mr. Hyde.After Mr. Hyde commits murder, Dr. Jekyll stops taking the serum; however, Dr. Jekyll would find himself changing into Mr. Hyde during the evening. It was too late, for Mr. Hyde's evil intentions became more dominant than the good-natured intentions of Dr. Jekyll.Ashamed at what he had done and running low on chemicals, Dr. Jekyll begins to recreate the serum in order to cease the process of becoming Mr. Hyde. Upon recreating the serum, Dr. Jekyll finds out that the salt he used for the experiment was impure and that batch out salt is no longer available. In the end, Dr. Jekyll commits suicide leaving only his notes on the case study of Mr. Hyde as well as Mr. Hyde's lifeless corpse.In retrospect, I conclude that this book might be difficult to read for those who are younger than fourteen or for those who have a disliking for eighteenth century literature. I have arrived to this conclusion due the fact that most of the sentences are extremely detailed and use scientific phrases. One may need to reread a paragraph in order to understand its full meaning.On the other hand, the book was very well written which makes it easier for one to conjure up an image of what is going on in the text. Not to mention that each chapter leaves the reader in suspense until the next chapter is read. I recommend that people who are in love with a good mystery should read this book because the plot progresses at a steady pace. One could read this book in four days, reading one and a half hours each day."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"this has been considered one of the real classics in horror. it's about a doctor going to far in his experimentations. he is actually good natured, but drinking a certain elixir he becomes pure evil, mr. hyde. one would perhaps think that jekyll was not ineterested in becoming mr. hyde, but it has certain advantages. desires can be satisfied, without distress for the doctor. so he adjusts to his new two lifestyles life, supporting mr. hyde. ti his friend, it is only known that jekyll has some strange contact with hyde. how long will it take before hyde goes too far? can jekyll give hyde up? stevenson's style is good,, and the plot interesting, the suspence kept. although he sadly does not explore the plot's true potentiality. this is a very misunderstood book. it is interpreted as man being of good and evil (which is right) and that jekyll simply divides these two sides between his two lives (which is wrong). what people forget is that jekyll was a nice guy, doing nothing bad, before becoming mr. hyde. he wakes his evil side, which lures him and grow in him. the book is about the power of evil more than the duality of man. if we surrender to evil or awaken it, we are going on a path of no return."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"I was excited to read this book for soley one purpose... to read Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

I was satisfied with this story, though the person who needs constant action to keep their attention shouldn't read this as much of it is Utterson investigating.THE BODY SNATCHER:This book started out shaky and was at first hard to follow, but once you get some pages behind you, you'll understand it well enough. The ending (I won't give it away) is also VERY strange and it is hard to understand.MARKHEIM:Ah! Markheim! One of the better written of these tales. It is easy to understand and is cleverly written, and does not drag on and on like some other tales in this book. It is a VERY GOOD story.OLALLA:This was one of those books that you couldn't wait to find out what happens and then it suddenly just lets you down. It leads up to so much and then doesn't deliver!THE EBB TIDE:The longest of the tales in this book...which makes you wonder...why wasn't the book named: The Ebb Tide and Other Stories? (Because Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde was best known of course!) The first few chapters in this tale make you wonder whether this story will turn out to be good, but then as the story progresses you realise that the tale is getting better and better (this is probably due to fact that Stevenson worked on this with another author and the more chapters written became more and more Stevenson, the first few chapters being the other author, and the end being all Stevenson.)So your question now is: Do I buy? Don't get me wrong, some stories in this book are good, but others dragged on. If you are interested in the following:-Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde-Markheim-Ebb Tide (Last few chapters are best)...then by all means get this book!

So, I made the assumption that I knew the true story. Then I read this book. Was my assumption ever wrong!!!This particular book (published by Signet Classics in Sept. 2003) of less than 150 pages has five parts:(1) Opening Pages. They include a brief biography of Robert Louis Stevenson (1850 to 1894). (Takes up 4% of the book.)(2) Introductory Essay. This was written by the late, famous Russian author Vladimir Nabokov. (Takes up 20%.)(3) The Actual Story. Its original title is \\"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" (1886). (Takes up 65%.)(4) Afterword to the Story. It is written by a modern writer. (Takes up 8%.)(5) Selected Bibliography. Outlines great works by and about R.L. Stevenson. (Takes up 3%.)The introductory essay was an actual lecture Nabokov gave when he was associate professor at Cornell University from 1948 to 1959. It gives a thorough, detailed analysis of this \\"seldom read\\" classic.The afterword consists of a shorter analysis of this classic by the modern writer Dan Chaon. I felt that this afterword provided valuable insight regarding the story of Jekyll and Hyde.Chaon sums up the entire story: \\"The structure of ['Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde'] follows a path as indirect and elusive as its multiple narrative voices. With its obliquely recorded incidents, its eyewitness accounts and sealed confessions, it resembles...a [police detective's] casebook--a collection of gathered clues, fragments, through which the clever detective may be able to...project a complete narrative. Perhaps one of the most compelling aspects of this novel [of ten chapters] is that, in fact, there's so much left here for [the reader] to fill in, so many scenes that [the reader] can only imagine. Such a structure creates fertile ground for allegory [a story with symbolic meaning] hunters, and there are indeed many convincing interpretations of this novel...The puzzle-like structure of the novel [which only has eight major male characters] creates a kind of Rorechach test, open to various interpretations.\\" (A Rorechach test is where a person interprets inkblot designs.)The inspiration of this short novel is said to have come from a dream (or, perhaps more accurately, a nightmare) Stevenson had. His actual writing is amazing and skillful in all chapters. The writing especially of the last two chapters, chapters nine and ten, stood out for me. Here, for example, is his actual description of what happened when somebody observed someone using Dr. Jekyll's concoction: \\"He put the glass to his lips and drank at one gulp. A cry followed; he reeled, staggered, clutched at the table and held on, staring with injected eyes, gasping with open mouth; as I looked there came, I thought, a change--he seemed to swell--his face became suddenly black and the features seemed to melt and alter--and the next moment, I had sprung to my feet and leaped back against the wall, my arm raised to shield me...[and] my mind submerged in terror.\\"Finally, the cover of this particular book is interesting. It shows the shadow of a man in a top hat behind a window shade. This can be taken to represent Hyde who is a shadowy character.In conclusion, this particular book has it all: an introduction by a late, well-known author, an intriguing mystery/horror story by a late, famous nineteenth century author, and an afterword by a gifted, modern writer. Be sure to read this book to learn the true story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde!!!+++++"},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Since I am a contributor to this volume, I will not offer a \\"review\\" in a conventional sense, but I will offer a list of contents, which this website otherwise does not offer.

Readers who come to the story from these adaptations, however, will very likely be surprised: few of them do more than borrow Stevenson's central concept.Unlike the numerous stage and film adaptations, Dr. Jekyll is not a young or remarkably handsome man, nor the book does not contain any of the romantic subplots to which its adaptations are prone. At approximately one hundred pages, the story is very direct and extremely well suited to Stevenson's very precise style, which is very clean yet extremely evocative and very readable.That said, modern readers are unlikely to be shocked by the book. For one thing, the story is too well known; for another, it contains very little of the graphic horror typical of current horror stories. But more than anything else, DR. JEKYLL is very distinctly a novel that draws from the Victorian era, and much of its impact was due to that society's remarkable hypocrisy; it was a world in which appearances were everything and a double life \\"acceptable\\" as long as you were not caught at it.The same concept arises in two other novels from the same era, Bram Stoker's DRACULA and Oscar Wilde's THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY, albeit in distinctly different forms. But whereas the Stoker and Wilde novels transcend their era, Stevenson's tale does not, and with the passing of Victorian attitudes the work has lost a great deal of its power to shock. Even so, Stevenson does touch a nerve with his chemically-induced transformation; then as now, drug abuse was a scourge, and in addition to this the work is somewhat similar to Mary Shelly's FRANKENSTEIN in the sense that it anticipates a host of ethical concerns that have become more and more pressing with the passage of time.Although it has not held up as well as the other titles named, DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE is nonetheless unavoidable for any one who has an interest in gothic or horror literature because it had--and continues to have--such a tremendous influence on later works. Stevenson's prose is elegant, it is \\"an easy read,\\" and I think most contemporary readers will enjoy it if they make the effort to see it within the context of its era.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"This is another first-rate critical edition from Norton. The text is cleanly printed with careful and accurate annotations. Both the critical and the backgrounds and contexts essays are well chosen. Sections on performance adaptations on stage and screen and on literary, scientific and sociohistorical contexts are particularly useful.One of the best critical essays is the editor's own. A detailed Stevenson chronology and an accurate selected bibliography conclude the volume."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"This book is a nice collection of Robert Louis Stevenson stories. Included is the main attraction, \\"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,\\" and the following short stories:A Lodging for the NightThe Suicide ClubThrawn JanetThe Body-SnatcherMarkeimObviously Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is the selling point of this book. Stevenson crafts a wonderful tale of mystery surrounding a few characters in England. I truly wish that I never knew anything about Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde prior to actually reading the book because I think that Stevenson did a spectacular job of keeping the mystery alive. Unfortunately, I already knew the relationship of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.The other stories included are nice little additions to this book. I personally did not enjoy them that much; but, it is still nice to get a little bit more with this collection that just getting Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. I found \\"Thrawn Janet\\" particularly interesting, almost thrilling. It is written in the old English dialect which made for more difficult reading, but a more cultural experience.Also included in this edition is a nice timeline and of RLS's life and accomplishments. I found the introduction to be particularly intersting because it talks about the culture and the reactions to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, both the book and the play.Overall, this is a nice book with a lot of extra information about RLS and his works. However, the short stories, in my opinion, are not worth buying this book only for the short stories. It is worth the entire collection though, with all the resources therein."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"The tale of Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde has been quite familiar to me for as long as I can remember, but only now have I read the original short novel by Robert Louis Stevenson. It is unfortunate that familiarity has robbed modern readers of the suspense that almost certainly was engendered in Stevenson's contemporary audience. Nor can I attribute a strong hint of terror in these pages, partly because of the plot structure. This is not a straightforward story; we don't follow Dr. Jeckyll in his experimentation. Rather, we are introduced to Jeckyll and Hyde through Jeckyll's lawyer Mr. Utterson. Having drawn up Jeckyll's will to leave everything to Hyde should he disappear, he is most concerned for his client and friend upon learning that Mr. Hyde is a misshapen monster of a man responsible for trampling a young girl in the street. The first half of the book follows Utterson's attempts to discover this Mr. Hyde for himself. The final half of the book contains the story of Jeckyll and Hide, told first in the words of a mutual friend and doctor and ultimately in an account of events penned by the unfortunate Dr. Jeckyll.It goes without saying that the heart of the story revolves around the duality of the human mind. Each of us has a dark side as well as a good side, and the majority of individuals attempt to disguise any bad, uncontrollable aspects of their natures from the public. Dr. Jeckyll had a predilection for thoughts and acts which he and society frowned upon (although what these acts were is never revealed); as he neared middle age, his life became defined by a continuous inner struggle to keep on the straight and narrow path. He often failed, so he came up with the idea of totally separating his evil nature from his good one. Through the use of chemistry, he developed a solution that, when ingested, transformed him into a different persona in both body and mind, one which had free reign to indulge anonymously in those worldly delights Dr. Jeckyll secretly lusted after. He thought that his original persona would then be freed of the guilt of his desires, while his Mr. Hyde persona could satiate himself in performing guilty actions without any moral restraint. As is only natural, the dark side grew stronger as time passed, and the person of Dr. Jeckyll found himself in more of a quandary than he ever dreamed of before giving birth to Mr. Hyde.Inner conflict between the good and bad in ourselves is something every reader can easily understand, and it is this psychological aspect of Stevenson's famous short novel that accounts for the tale's continuing popularity. It is a quick and absorbing read, but the method of the tale's presentation is a slight weakness in my opinion. We can only watch the human drama from a third person perspective, and I would like to have gotten more deeply inside the mind of Jeckyll and Hyde. Still, this is a classic of literature that will retain its place in popular culture for untold years to come. As for the afterword by Jerome Charyn in the Bantam edition of the book, I must say I could have done without it. It does provide some interesting background on Stevenson, but its psychological assumptions and surmises struck me as overdramatic and groundless. The story of Jeckyll and Hyde stands strongly on its own merits and does not need to be accompanied by psychobabble."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Stevenson created Utterson to narrate the story. But large sections of it are composed of Lanyon's letter to Utterson and Henry Jekyll's diary. The advantage of this is that it allows Stevenson to prolong the readers' suspense. In a way, Utterson, Enfield, and, for a time, Lanyon, are in the same position as the readers: observers trying to understand the mystery surrounding Henry Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.Stevenson allies readers with Utterson and Enfield. Then, after we learn Lanyon knows Jekyll's secret, we, like Utterson, read his letter eagerly. Lanyon's narrative reveals the secret that Jekyll and Hyde are the same person. But, because Lanyon is also an observer, his narrative cannot tell us anything about Jekyll's motive. We need Jekyll's own account for that.Thus, the narrative method Stevenson chooses prolongs our suspense. Gradually revealing information about Jekyll just heightens our desire to know the full story. By the time we get to Jekyll's story, we are at a fever pitch. I doubt Stevenson could have kept the pace of suspense had he used third-person point of view, and he certainly wouldn't have been able to do it using Jekyll as a first-person narrator. The drive of Utterson's limited point of view matches our own.Stevenson's reliance on a limited first-person point of view also contributes to the story's theme. Perhaps Stevenson uses Utterson, Enfield, and our own ignorance of Jekyll's actions as a metaphor for human ignorance generally. In his narrative, Jekyll repeatedly refers to his life as the result of one choice among many choices he could have made. He creates Hyde to experience life and the other aspects of his personality denied by that choice. Jekyll argues that the choice he has made in selecting one life over another is discriminatory and limiting. It excludes other forms of knowledge and experience.Maybe Stevenson hoped to gain reader sympathy for Dr. Jekyll by associating our ignorance and desire to understand the Jekyll/Hyde mystery with Jekyll's desire to know more of the life he sacrificed to play the role of a respected doctor."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Jekyll and Hyde is a chilling psychological thriller by Robert Louis Stevenson that immediatly pulls you in and keeps you intrigued. It's almost like a love story between a man's good side and his evil side. Jekyll is a mild mannered physician with a good heart and good intentions, whereas Hyde is an evil monster with a heart of stone and intentions of committing cruel, savage, animal like murders. Dr. Henry Jekyll first turned into Hyde when he consumed a drink he made himself in his laboratory, and changes back to Jekyll with another. It all seems to be working for him...until one day when he takes an overdose of his Hyde potion and can't change back to his normal form. This book taught me that there is an untamed animal hiding inside each and every one of us just waiting to break out, like when we get angry or just go crazy. This book was terrific, and I'm sure that I will read many other Robert Louis Stevenson books."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Undoubtedly a great story this was. Stevenson couldn't have done a better job in telling the story of these two individuals trapped in the body of one. The concept is of an awesome nature, and so is the story.Now, many people that have never read this think it to be a horror tale. This is indeed true - some of this story is horror. But more than a horror tale, this is a psychological mystery. The way it begins, the way many of the mysteries unfold throughout the story have all the nature, the characteristics, the makings of a mystery. Thus, upon reading this book, you must pay careful attention to all that's going on. If you don't pay attention to a certain detail, you may get very mixed up and lost. It is easy to understand why many different versions have been written for kids.The last part of the book is just wonderful. The book, though it may not be the funnest thing to read, is all worth reading for the ending. The ending is one that will stand high in literature."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Three women discussed how one of their husbands was like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

This is the story of Dr. Jekyll's scientific ability to dabble in the dark side of human nature and his ensuing struggle to return to the man he was.This is not a horror story. This is a moral allegory about what can happen to a man's soul if he engages and indulges the evil that dwells within. First a carefully mixed tincture must be employed to cause the transformation, to release the foul demon hidden well beneath the surface. But as more and more pleasure is derived from time spent as Mr. Hyde, the potion becomes less and less necessary.This is not a horror story. This is a tragic tale of an unfortunate end."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Jekyll and Hyde is commonly evoked to describe someone with a split personality. Stevenson's novel is not really about a split personality, but rather a dual physical and spiritual nature struggling for control of one person. In this struggle, Dr. Jekyll doesn't just assume a different personality, he actually becomes Mr. Hyde.Presbyterian Pastor Tim Keller has a good, brief analysis of parts of the Jekyll and Hyde story in his bookThe Reason for God: Belief in an Age of Skepticism (Hardcover). Keller pinpoints a key point in the story, noting that it's in a moment of vainglory that Dr. Jekyll involuntary transforms into Mr. Hyde. This transformation occurs as Dr. Jekyll sits \\"on a bench in Regents Park, thinking about all the good he has been doing, and how much better man he was, despite Edward Hyde, than the great majority of people.\\"All this to say that Stevenson's novel goes far deeper than a psychoanalytic study of a split personality; it's about a profound spiritual struggle of the evil and good nature within a person."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Most readers may be surprised at just how coy and evasive this short novel is. We get only fleeting images of the villain and his transgressions. For a work that has become so well knit into our cultural standards and mores, it's perhaps remarkable how little actually goes on.You think you know the story. But what most people actually know is the 1936 movie starring Frederic March. Who Hyde is, his relationship to Jekyll, even how one becomes the other: all of these have been changed in every movie, TV, stage, and comic book adaptation ever made.For what's reputedly a horror novel, this book is remarkably unscary. Maybe in 1886, when its ideas were new, it was terrifying. But now, when its core idea has become part of our culture, it's more thought-provoking than frightening. As Stevenson hints at dribs and drabs of Freudian, Darwinian, post-colonial, and other ideas that have become common coin, remember that he wrote before any of these were popular notions.Start right in on the novel. Vladimir Nabokov's introductory essay states a lot that is obvious, and should be read only after the novel itself. On balance, Dan Chaon's afterword, about the novel's cultural impact, is probably more revelatory, and more accessible to general audiences.Remember, this book is probably not what you think you know. It's at once more ambitious, yet far harder to pin down, than the cheapened versions in the mass media. It's smart yet understandable, familiar yet strange. It's the kind of book too few writers create these days."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"This book was fantastic with all of the suspense and all of the love. It was completely fabulous. And to think that all these years after Robert Louis Stevenson died that this book is still popular"},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Robert Louis Stevenson (1850 - 1894) was a remarkable author from the Victorian Era. He has left us at least two masterpieces: \\"The Treasure Island\\" (1883) and \\"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" (1886) and some other good novels such as \\"The Black Arrow\\" (1888).It is amazing how writers and poets are able, thru intuition, to anticipate events or discoveries. When this book as first published, Sigmund Freud was studying with Charcot and not so many years later will produce his theoretic corpus of the human psyche. At some points the present story touches Freud's conceptualizations.Dr. Jekyll suspect evil burdens every human soul, being an obstacle in its way to goodness. So he investigates and produces a drug that \\"liberates\\" the evil spirit and doing so he intend to be relived of it.But Evil starts to grow each time more powerful and emerging Mr. Hyde end cornering Dr. Jekyll into impotence and fear.This story has captivated the public's imagination for more than a hundred years. Movies, comics and theater pieces had evolved from it. His tortured dual character is now a well known icon as Stoker's Dracula or Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.Even if you know more or less the story and its ending, reading this very short book is a powerful adventure.A Classic you shouldn't let passes by unheeded!Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"I found this a fascinating story and appreciated the extra information about C.S.

Fortunately for us, he re-wrote it---in three days.No one today will react to J&H; the way RLS's wife did. We're too desensitized to horror and violence. And consider: whereas many people envision Hyde as some ten-foot brute, he is instead described in the book as a hairy little dwarf who roughs up little girls.But what J&H; did for literature, and the reason why it is still important to read, is that it explored the dichotomy of human nature, which is partly what makes us such flawed beings. It also single-handedly gave birth to a pantheon of 20th century creatures, from the wolfman to the Incredible Hulk.This is a quick read---perhaps too quick. It is written with great economy and the right amount of description of Victorian London's seedy side. The chilling ending asks the reader to sympathize with Dr. Jekyll, whose evil twin is gradually taking more and more control of his faculties."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"It's a classic AND it's actually good.

Really, an hour isn't much reading time to experience one of the great literary classics, so pick up a copy."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"In this story, Mr. Utterson, lawyer and friend of Jekyll is trying through friendly concern to discover the truth about the young and disreputable Mr. Hyde who he believes is coercing the doctor. Jekyll is always one step ahead of him in covering up Hyde's true existence until Jekyll is no longer able to control his transformations and Utterson is called by the frightened servants to intervene. This was an enjoyable story though brief.Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was remarkably subdued story from what I expected. Having seen the movie Mary Reilly previous to reading this book, I expected Mr. Hyde to be more fully developed. What Mr. Hyde does that is so 'evil' is never specified (I mean in terms of general lifestyle - the murder is covered). In fact, the only real reference we get to this life is the character of his dwelling and the presence there of penny novels (cheap, ill respected literature). Except for the murder of an undeveloped character and a general rudeness, we don't really get to know Mr. Hyde as the evil monster I expected. Mr. Hyde is afraid to leave the lab for fear of the gallows but that is as close to a manhunt as we get, unlike in Frankenstein where the chase seems to cover half of the globe or in The Invisible Man were a serious manhunt provides a great deal of action and pace. Mr. Hyde is also a great deal different from how he is represented by Hollywood (for instance, he is shorter than Dr. Jekyll). I guess I was expecting a more likable or romantic villain giving rise to more of a dilemma in trying to destroy him.This story should be read. I am not trying to \\"dis'\\" it. I just expected more out of it because later authors/producers pulled out of it way, way more than was in the original. What this story has is raw potential."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is an easy read. Robert Louis Stevenson has his characters remain flat throughout the story. The events are told at face value and details are limited throughout this book. Stevenson starts the book out as a mystery, leading one to wonder who this hideous and purely evil Hyde truly is and what he wants. Throughout the story it looks like he is holding something over Dr. Jekyll by means of blackmail. The two main characters are introduced through a rather unimportant character, Enfield, telling of his first encounter with Hyde.The story line was phenomenal and unique at the time it was written. Unfortunately, because it is a classic, most people start reading the book already knowing the outcome. The mysterious atmosphere of the story is ruined as the majority of readers have a good idea of who this Hyde character really is.My feelings on this book are neutral. I definitely would not consider it one of the best books I have ever read, but it isn't the worst either. It tells the message for which it was created, but there is not much more than that. It is the classic story of the duality of man, good and evil, which, again, was a unique story line at the time it was written, but too common of a theme today."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"It seems curious that the story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde should still hold such a fascination for modern readers. It cannot work very well as a mystery story, since most of us already know the secret of the book, that one character transforms bodily into the other. (Nor is Mr. Hyde a straightforward horror monster - he is capable of vaguely civil conversation.) This short tale unfolds in a somewhat disjointed series of vignettes, as a certain lawyer grasps various strands of the mystery of Dr. Jekyll through chance encounters and legal documents. For all these possible flaws, the concept of the book goes straight to the reader's imagination and also to the conscience. Hyde is the evil within all people, and who among us cannot identify on some level with him, and fear him all the more? Who among us has not in some fashion struggled for our better natures as Jekyll has? The concept is brilliant, and timeless. For this reason, the book remains as absorbing as ever.

I would love to know precisely how this story appeared to people when the concept was fresh and unknown. The story as it currently exists is hurt by its own success. It remains must reading for anyone concerned about the history of Sci-fi and the quirky edges of Victorian literature. But I wonder if it still has the capacity to entertain like so many other books.

I would love to know precisely how this story appeared to people when the concept was fresh and unknown. The story as it currently exists is hurt by its own success. It remains must reading for anyone concerned about the history of Sci-fi and the quirky edges of Victorian literature. But I wonder if it still has the capacity to entertain like so many other books. I've read Wilkie Collins's THE WOMAN IN WHITE three times and fully expect to read it again at some point. But I wonder if I will be similarly tempted to read Stevenson's famous story again."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde; the words conjure up all sorts of images in my mind, mostly from the theatrical and cinematic depictions I've seen at different times in my life. I thought I knew the story well, and so I didn't expect to find myself surprised by much in the novel. How wrong I was!The novel is interesting, because there are so many aspects of the story that are left to the imagination of the reader. Mr. Hyde's appearance, as well as his misdeeds, are never defined in black and white, but are instead only alluded to in a manner that almost makes them more horrifying. I was also intrigued with the complicated nature of the character of Dr. Jekyll, a man who desires to be seen as an upstanding individual, but is in many ways somewhat fascinated by the evil aspects of his nature.I found this to be a great read, and far more thought provoking than I had anticipated. It is a very short read, around 100 pages, but provides plenty of \\"meat\\" for the reader to chew on. If you haven't taken the opportunity to try this book before, I would recommend it as a very enjoyable read. This has been a great start to my Classics Reading Challenge for 2008, and has left me thirsting for more!"},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"'Jekyll and Hyde' is a commonly used phrase, but the story behind it is quite the chilling work. \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" tells the story of a man who pursues a less agreeable field of science called transcendental science. During his studies, he discovers a way to alter his personality, along with his physical appearance, so that he was purely evil, but wheres a different face than his usual one. The idea of being able to indulge in his lusts with a different face thrilled him and he worked until he perfected the potion that caused the transformation. As time went on though, his evil side grew and began to take over, until not even the potion could turn him back to his normal self. The tragic story ends in suicide.Stevenson's creepy story shows a man who lets his hedonistic and indulgent side get out of check, and he loses control. It is a chilling prospect, even if exaggerated a bit. It is a quick and relatively easy read, and a good horror story about science gone wrong. Beyond this it holds a message that shows that man is evil, and we can't save ourselves from it no matter how hard we try. The story presents an unfortunate truth, despite its contrast with Stevenson's Marxist beliefs, but this truth just makes it all the more chilling and dark."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Great for my daughters advanced English class.

The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll And Mr. Hyde is superb work of sci-fi."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"What an intensely sad moral fable. In some ways I thought it similar to 'The Invisible Man' by HG Wells. Both narratives express a keen interest in science, and warn in their own way of the danger of transgressing the borders or what one may call moral or ethical acceptability and experimentation.The clever Dr Jekyll invents a potion which allows him to temporarily change his appearance, age and nature, in order to live a life of villainy without fear of detection. From that point onwards all goes awry, unitl eventually the hideous transformation (Mr Hyde) begins to take over Dr Jekyll's natural self.Dotted with beautiful use of language, \\"Instantly the spirit of hell awoke in me and raged\\", although at times (after all it's Victorian) somewhat laborious.Interestingly Stevenson's narrative reads unemotionally, even though the content is so highly charged. Different viewpoints are used in the book, allowing Dr Jekyll the final words which explain all. Mr Hyde is never allowed a voice, reinforcing the victory of good over evil, even though the only possible outcome is the death of both Jekyll and Hyde, naturally."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Everyone should read this thought provoking book.

The 1886 work is considered a classic of British literature.Prosecutor Gabriel John Utterson has taken certain interest in Mr. Edward Hyde even since he trampled a little girl. The crowd gathered forced Mr. Hyde to make retribution, however the check he gave the girl was signed by Dr. Henry Jekyll.Mr. Utterson also discovers that Mr. Hyde is the sole beneficiary of all of Dr. Jekyll's wealth. Utterson tries to discuss the matter of Mr. Hyde with the good doctor which, as one might guess, doesn't yield any results.A year later a member of the British Parliament is murdered and the maid identifies Mr. Hyde. Utterson confronts Dr. Jekyll who shows the lawyer a letter in which Mr. Hyde states that he is will disappear forever.Sometime later, suspecting foul play Utterson breaks into Dr. Jekyll's house where they discover Mr. Hyde who has just committed suicide by drinking poison. Through letters Utterson pieces together Dr. Jekyll's double life.The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson is a well known novella which deals with split personality.I found it interesting that the book has only two settings, letters and laboratory. Not the clean, sterile laboratory we imagine, but a disgusting, dirty and bloody one which implores the reader to feel the Gothic horror which the author wishes to convey. In this environment is where Mister Hyde is created, a troubled figure, mean and unabated.Mister Hyde is what Dr. Jekyll wants to be but suppresses within himself. Hyde yearns for violence and sexuality, he is full of strength, uncaring and out of control - or is he actually in full control?Mr. Hyde celebrates the nature of men unhindered by social norms, rules or laws while Dr. Jekyll self censors himself as a proper gentleman should in Victorian England.As time goes on, this novella could be read in several ways. There is the most known one, that of split personality, but also could be a pathological angle of investigating the nature of mental illness. In these days, where science, technology and medicine is much more advanced, the story could also be read as a warning on the extreme use of mind altering chemicals, drugs or alcohol and the self destructive properties of such actions.But Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde could also be read as a philosophy book which deals with the knowledge that we are all on death's door. Death, in this case, is represented as a man of flesh and blood. A psychoanalyst could also, somewhat justifiably, could read the story as the psychotic and narcissist fantasy of Dr. Jekyll.I found the book's subject disturbing, not because of the murder or Goth involved, but more on a psychological level. The possibility of every individual leading a double life is a scary thought, especially when it comes to loved ones. How often, when a grotesque murder occurs, we hear the almost laughable lines \\"he was such a nice guy\\" or \\"she was a wonderful mother\\"?Another side of the story, and I say that as a fan of Mr. Stevenson's work since an early age, I can certainly see a pattern of commentary on Victorian England where, as is today, a person's wealth and social standing relieves them of any moral obligations towards their fellow men or women."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"This book is just like the actual copy.

I didn't. Here's another thing I didn't know: it's really short - almost a novella. One and a half trips to work, and it was over.The book itself was okay, but would have been infinitely better had I read it with the right ambiance. Listening to this book on a car radio, whizzing down the highway at 70 mph in the morning sunlight does not do the book justice. Instead, one should listen to it on a dark night in a log cabin, by gas-lantern light. With such an ambiance, one might put oneself in the time period in which it was written, and loose oneself in the haunting imagery it tries to convey. Otherwise, I'm afraid that in this age of terrorism, school shootings, and lost innocence, Mr. Hyde seems like a pretty mellow guy.'"},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"excellent book. wish stevenson had explored topic more.literature above the common materilistic crap fiction most people read.steveson is for the ages."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde is one of those books that, like many classics, everyone \\"knows\\" but no one's ever read.

If you can put yourself in the place of the characters, the tale is mysterious and the fact that Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde are one and the same is a horrible revelation. The close of the book, in which the reader learns of Jekyll's view of the situation, is still remarkable, and the closing lines are terribly chilling.Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde doesn't match Stevenson's Treasure Island, but is a classic worthy of the title. It's also short and readily available at libraries or online, so you won't be wagering much in reading it for yourself.I listened to the audio version read by Ralph Cosham, a favorite of mine in the audio book field, and can certainly recommend Cosham's reading of the tale."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Stevenson's book is a wonderful adventure into the darker side of our personalities.

I also liked the part when Utterson found the letters that solved the case. But their are also downfalls to the story, first of all the story is to long, you could have wrote this story on 5 pages. This story was really bad at getting down to the point. It seemed like for the first 25 pages the story was really dull and your thinking to yourself when is this story going to get to the point. Another bad thing about this story is that it makes you angry because their are so many bad things happening in this world today where ever you look.

The fact that this story is told the way it is gives it a real life feeling. When I was reading it I felt like it was a real case that happened in the streets of London. The letters that are made make it seem like that the case happened because it gives the tail of many people from the story. Even though the story is well known around Europe and the US the ending is still classic. The fact that the story is ended in a letter is quite original on Stevenson's part.

His intricate plot, themes, and use of symbolism make the novel fascinating to read. The concept is extremely mature and well developed. Also, Stevenson's unique point of view makes the novel even more interesting.The themes of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde are important in the novel. The basic and rather obvious main theme is the duality between good and evil. The duality is manifested in two different ways: the respectable Dr. Jekyll and the evil Mr. Hyde. Dr. Jekyll is a hypocritical doctor who has an evil deep in side of him that he desperately tries to get rid of throughout the novel. He transforms into Mr. Hyde hoping to reduce his aggressions and obsession with his evilness. This, however, proves to be fatal.Stevenson's unique point of view reinforces the mystery of the novel. The main point of view is of Mr.Utterson. He is a quiet, respectable lawyer who is extremely observant to his surroundings. Through his point of view, we see things just as they appear to him, making the novel interesting to read. Towards the end of the novel, we are introduced to two different narrators, Mr. Lanyon and Dr. Jekyll. Mr. Lanyon, the doctor, makes the novel clear and describes, in more detail, the process that transformed Dr. Jekyll into Mr. Hyde. The last chapter, narrated by Dr. Jekyll brings the novel together. Dr. Jekyll plainly describes how the soul is made of two separate distinctions: the good and the evil.

This book is not boring. This book is fun. It doesn't ruin the plot with too much detail like other books. Other fantasy books are usually not even close to realistic. Whereas Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is close to being conceived realistic. This book has a general morbid feeling to it where other fantasies are sometimes cheerful and happy. Robert Louis Stevenson is a realy good writer in my opinion.He uses a very wide range of vocabulary. Stevenson uses many 19th Century terms that seem weird and different to me.One thing bad about his writing is his punctuation. He uses way too many semicolons and comas. He makes one sentence out of six or seven sentences.This book was not the best book I ever read, but was not the worst either. it was mediocre. however It was miles ahead of Dracula.

This piece of fiction, set in a realistic town, contains the story of a respectable Doctor, Henry Jekyll, and a strange other man, Edward Hyde, as seen from the eyes of Gabriel Utterson. You see, the good doctor has been missing lately, and he has been acting rather strangely as well. It appears that whenever Dr. Jekyll is missing, everything should be placed in the hands of Mr. Hyde. This particularly surprises Mr. Utterson, who has been friends with the doctor for years, and is confused as to why Jekyll leaves things in the hands of Mr. Hyde. However, after a maid witnesses Mr. Hyde has _murdered_ someone, the strange man is nowhere to be found! Instead, Dr. Jekyll has returned after a long absence. How very peculiar...Though this book may have seemed simple in the way I spelled it out, it is written in a most confusing manner.

Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde would be a great book for people who enjoy science fiction, confusing books, and like jumping from different character's points of view. I would probably have liked the book more if it didn't jump from the different points of view and different subjects so much.

In this novella, Stevenson explores the existence of both within one body, and the fine line separating one from the other, examining human nature's internal conflicts.Set in 19th century England, this is a story of Dr. Henry Jekyll's struggle to understand the bipolar natures within a person, competing for dominance. Told in both third and first person from his two best friends, Mr. Utterson, his lawyer, and Dr. Lanyon, the tale encompasses his experimentation in isolating these two personalities, finally taking it to the point of performing said isolation on himself, leading to the creation of Mr. Edward Hyde, representative of the doctor's dark side, and his perodic and ever-increasing control of Jekyll. Concurrently, a strange man, mysterious in that he is afflicted with what is called a deformity by all he meets, yet cannot be described, comes to town, bringing with him a suspicious string of murders. As the pieces of this mystery are put together, one can draw from the text that a wise man will leave nature to its own course.Although the book tells a fascinating story, character development leaves a lot to be desired here. The language is somewhat archaic, and Stevensn spends most of the book beating around the bush, making it a fairly dry read. Suspense or science-fiction-lovers, along with anyone of vivid imagination, can appreciate this book, so long as they possess the attention span to get past the first ten pages. On a scale of one to five, despite its promise of psychological adventure, &quot;Jekyll and Hyde&quot; only manages a three. Perhaps Stevenson would have been more captivating, had he only been less long-winded."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"very cool book. was actua;l;ly enjoyable to read and follow along. thank u guys very much 4 the cool book"},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Just imagine having a dream that terrified you so much that you have to write it down to be able to accept it. That alone made it a must read and I can't tell you how many times I've read it since. In many cases this is one story, similar to Frankenstein, where the movies have altered our perception as to what the character was like that the story sometimes pales in comparison.Maybe that's what always drew me to this one. Unlike Frankenstein, I can relate to the character of Jekyll and Hyde in that we all have a dark side we'd love to indulge in without care or worry for the consequences. The fact Hyde is a dwarf and the embodiment of evil compared to the caring and handsome Dr. Jekyll is a perfect illustration to how being one way can alter the perception of those around us.When one was near Hyde, they felt miserable and couldn't wait to be away from him. In time, Jekyll couldn't control the transformation as he'd go to sleep as himself and wake as Mr. Hyde. In the end the only way for him to escape was to take his own life or face the gallows for his crimes.Was the fact he was the less desirable of the two sides of the good Doctor a figment of Stevenson's dream or done on purpose, I have no idea.

It is one of his best stories and the writing is descriptive and will put a chill down your back. It is a look of a man who wanted to separate his good side from his dark and malicious part of his personality. The transformations are a man's method of discovering his true soul and he is torn between two distinct and different ways of life.It is a well written story but a short one. The inner conflict between the two personalities drives Dr. Jekyll to realize the duality of the nature of all men. It is an insight into what a split personality can really mean. Are we all half good and half evil? It is a good story and I recommend it to you."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"This book is a classic.

Anyway, proper paragraphs, em-dashes and all.The story itself was very interesting though most of it was suspense leading up to the last chapter. I won't spoil it for anyone but I found the last chapter to be the most intriguing. Since Stevenson was raised in a Presbyterian home, growing up under a Covenanter nurse and being familiar with Calvinistic theology, this really seemed to me to be an analogy for one's sin nature and the struggle against it. And if you feed the \\"old man\\" then you eventually find it is harder and harder to escape from sin.I know there will be lots of disagreement but it is in perfect accordance with the Christian doctrine of sin nature, especially as expounded by the Puritans. This was very interesting to me and I felt the last chapter especially was well-worth reading in that light.Content: 4Formatting: 4"},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"my mom read this to me when I was young and it was amazing.

The plot and mystery is just outstanding."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"There are many parallels between my life as an addict and the classic story of \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" by Robert Louis Stevenson. I've been familiar with this story my whole life, as most everyone has, but it wasn't until I actually read the book that I realized that Stevenson could actually be talking about drug addiction, especially heroin addiction.Dr. Henry Jekyll was one of the best doctors in London, was kind, and tried to help all. But he believed that each person is not really one, but two, has a \\"good\\" side and a \\"bad\\" side, (Gavin de Becker, in his book, \\"The Gift of Fear\\", makes the same argument) and he created a drug to prove it.Dr. Jekyll's concoction works and transforms him into the ugly Edward Hyde who takes pleasure in evil. The problem arises when he discovers that the potion to transform him back into the mild-mannered Dr. Jekyll starts becoming less effective, requiring stronger and more frequent doses , just as the heroin addict must increase his dose just to feel \\"normal\\" after becoming addicted.Another side effect is that Dr. Jekyll starts turning into Mr. Hyde even without the drug. His \\"good\\" side becomes weaker as his \\"bad\\" side grows stronger. In the end, Mr. Hyde murders a man and can no longer change back to Dr. Jekyll, so he commits suicide.That's exactly how my addiction progressed. I, the \\"good\\" me, was no longer in control. I became someone I never thought I would be and I committed crimes that I'm still paying for twelve years later. I tried to commit suicide too, because I believed I was hopeless, and I could not see this far into the future.Review written by David Allan ReevesAuthor of \\"Running Away From Me\\""},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"We bought this to replace the copy my son bought for school and then misplaced.

The story consists mainly of a few rumors and incidents and annecdotes that are all tied together by the &quot;full statement of the case&quot; at the end, and that's it. For one thing I think this sparseness contributes to the eeriness of the story. The book reads more like a police report that a horror story, leaving Mr. Hyde to lurk almost unseen in the shadows of its pages. For another thing I think that this book has been popular through the years and passed through so many incarnations and popped up in so many different forms precisely because Stevenson did so little with Mr. Hyde. It was like he left a blueprint for other writers to come along and fully explore the ramifications of this book's intriquing premise."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Dr. Jekyll and My.

I would reccomend it to people who enjoy mysteries and a sort of horror."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Robert Louis Stevenson portrays every man's double character and how one chooses who he is in this mysterious and full of suspense story in which we see enfold the urge to know who Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde are. We see the whole mishaps through the mind and point of view of Mr. Utterson, who is a lawyer and respected friend of Jekyll. His curiosity leads into getting himself involved on the strange transformation his good friend is suffering of, and after a murder, the itch to know intensifies as Utterson decides to end all the mystery for once and for all. To do this, he counts with the help of Dr. Lanyon, another of Jekyll's good friends and Mr. Poole, Jekyll's butler.Set in London, England, around the 1870's, Stevenson describes the city, buildings and people as if they were real and the reader becomes Mr. Utterson and can actually see all the things he sees as the reader becomes another character in the story, following the prying of men to know everything.Stevenson writes in a captivating matter and is always up to the idea of describing thoroughly the environment in which the plot unfolds right at the most anticipated moments of the story.The characters were real and credible, some may even be compared to people on our own lives, but I found that the whole plot was a slow going at the beginning and came as an intense rush towards the end.On the other hand, there seemed too much suspense on the story for such a short and simple explanation. Since this story is very old and famous, the book cannot be much appreciated since almost everyone knows what is known to happen to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by either word of mouth, by watching movies or by others that also refer to this book and situation which lowers the reader's itch to know the solution to the plot.A double personality everyone has, in which one should be chosen over the other. This seems as looking everything in black and white, when most of the things and people are grey. There is always the constant struggle of choosing whether the good or bad option which we know clearly, but a bad one amidst a million good does not convert you into your evil self. The book also portrays that once you turn evil; you cannot go back, which in a way I agree on since the guilt of the malicious things done would be a too great burden for an innocent person to live with. Still, being positive minded, I'd like to believe it's never too late to change, and that without the need of potions, only through determination, Jekyll could have found an inner strength to suppress his evil side and transform back into himself, which is what many people have proven to be able to do these days.Jekyll is a wealthy man from a respectable family. He finds the need to divide himself into two sides to be able to do the things he wishes to do without damaging or ruining his reputation. To do this, he uses a potion he created that divides his evil and good side and created Mr. Edwards Hyde, whose name could be a symbol to J's living style in which he feels suppressed and hidden. To do all this he does take precautions such as selecting Hyde as his inheritor, letting his household keepers that Hyde is allowed, writing a letter explaining all, being all secretive... but he did not expect his supplies to run over or his \\"evil side\\" to overrule him, which later results in Hyde killing himself. I believed the story had a greater potential and could have been more developed."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is a book about a doctor who separates his evil self from his good self. He creates a potion that changes him from Dr. Jekyll to Mr. Hyde. Dr. Jekyll is a well respected doctor in London. He is a good hearted man. Mr. Hyde is a cruel and insaine murder. He has a deformity but no one is able to describe it.I belivie that every one has a good and a bad side. One side is shown a lot more than the other side. I do not understand why someone would try to separate their good from their bad. If it were possible, many people would try to separate their to sides, and if they did, then if our bad side is like that of Mr. Hyde, there would be a lot crimes to day."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"The book, The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde has a great plot, but it could be written better. Also, the book is somewhat hard to understand because it is written in an older form of English. The author, Robert Louis Stevenson, does however do a good job of describing the setting. The story takes place in the late 1800's in London, England."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"I thought that Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde was rather a dull book. It didn't have any lowpoints or strainings of any sort but rather, too much a monotonous tone that is just not quite right. I think that maybe I was expecting a little too much, but still I thought it wasn't as good as I was told. It was well written, the style was OK, the problem was the way the story was built. The idea of someone changing his physical appearance is a good one, but I think it should have gone a little deeper in the minds of the person that experiences it. Instead the other chose to show us a friend of that person, and, for me, it lost most of it's interest. I would have liked to be with Dr Jekyll as he drank his potion to &quot;see&quot; how it happened and all.It's not a bad book, it's just not a great book either. A good book that doesn't have everything it takes to become a great book."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book, to me it was confusing at first then it got very interesting near the end. The novel is about a well respected doctor (Mr. Hyde) that invents a posion that can change a person into their alter ego. Dr. Jekyll drinks this posion, and becomes a character we know as (Mr. Hyde.) Mr. Hyde is known as a very disrupeted character that is responsible for the murder of Sir Danvers Carew. Before the Carew murder, Jekyll had become a disrupted person himself. After the Carew murder, Mr. Hyde is not seen nor heard from for a long time. The night of the Carew murder, Hyde leaves a note for Mr. Utterson. Also after Mr. Utterson received Mr. Hyde's letter he had received a dinner invitation from Dr. Jekyll that matched in handwritting to the letter from Mr. Hyde. After this Mr. Utterson investigates and later finds out that Mr. Hyde is only a figure of a posion. My Hyde is Dr. Jekyll's alter ego. At the end of the novel Hyde takes over Dr. Jekyll therefor, he kills himself. This novel was interesting because it makes you wonder whiel reading the novel, how is Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde connected, and who really killed Carew? At first, I thought that Mr. Hyde and Dr. Jekyll were good friends and Dr. Jekyll was lying for Mr. Hyde so that Mr. Utterson wont know his whereabouts. Later I thought that Dr. Jekyll was helping Mr. Hyde get away with the Carew murder, and was plotting to kill Mr. Utterson. It was even more interesting to find out that Mr. Hyde was only Dr. Jekyll's alter ego from a posion that Dr. Jekyll Invented."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"waste of time and energy to order....took way tooooo long to come. i went and bought it at barnes and noble. my child's assignment was due the day it was delivered."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"I have known about the basics of the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde story for as long as I can remember. This book has built an image over the years of being a classic tale of horror and fills the mind with many images. Yet actually, when I made the effort to sit down and read the book, it has a different affect. The writing and sequence of events in the book is pretty fragmented in many places. The book reads much more like a short story than a classic novel. Thus while reading the book, and certainly after completing the book, you can't help but to think of all the things and events that could have been added to the book to make it that classic novel that you originally envisioned. This book is certainly worth reading if anything just for the sake of Stevenson's perspective on the duality of man in the 19th century.

However, since it is not the slang I am used to in speech and in text, the language was difficult for me to comprehend at first. But as the story progressed, I was able to keep up with the extensive vocabulary and sentence structures. The story line captivated me, being mysterious and well put together. Dr. Jekyll is a jolly man who is well liked and well respected, and with good reason. Initially, I was fond of this character as his lawyer, Mr. Utterson, described him throughout the book. Yet, when it is revealed what Dr. Jekyll did, my opinion of him becomes shady and unsure. This character is essential and puzzling in this story, causing one to wonder his credibility. Mr. Hyde, on the other hand, is a man who is easily dislikable. He shows no reason to be admired most notably when he does the unthinkable. Murder, mystery, missing links and possibly psychotic scientists ... and that's just the beginning. This book obviously had no trouble intriguing me."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"This was a great book! It arrived quickly and in perfect condition.

Well it looks like Henry's will will have to be executed as the housekeeper; Mr. Pool thinks Hyde hid Henry's body.Once again, I saw Spencer Tracy before I read the book, so I was anticipating a different type of story. I read \\"Treasure Island\\" so I am familiar with Stevenson's writing style but I did not realize that this story was more of a mystery that draws the conclusion and revelation in the end. The explanation of man and his duel personality is excellent and I suspect he draws on personal experience.I read the kindle version. It was sparse and strait forward; there was not a lot of fluff and speculation from other personalities. I made sure that the text-to speech was activated before purchasing.

The only thing that kept me glued into the story is the characters. Mr. Jekyll had a problem being lonely, while Mr. Hyde was crazy like a young teenager.

The story is about a man name Dr. Jekyll who creats a potion to turn him into another man named Mr. Hyde so he can do his dirty work. The book is suspenseful and is a great mystery. The surprise ending and constant suspense builds this book up to be a pretty good book. This book could have been better if it had more mystery and more action.

I also thought this book was way to long with 54 pages. I think it could have been put into a 20-page book and still have the same content of a 54-page book. I think that this was also very boring. I mean the best part was when Dr. Lanyon wrote that Mr. Hyde came to his house, mixed up a potion, and he turned into Dr. Jekyll. That has very little excitement to it. When I was going to read this book I thought it was going to be very scary and that I would be on the edge of my seat. Well neither of those things happened.

The book will give you a full sense of personality. It not only helps you understand the characters, but it also helps you see which side, your good or your evil, is more developed. The ending will send chills up your spine. Dr. Jekyll is the basic good in the story. He has devoted his life to scientific studies and helping people. The basic villian is Edward Hyde. He is every Evil in existence put into one person. Although Dr. Jekyll is good, his curiousity drove him to unimaginable evil. He decided to explore the evil in himself. He made a potion and drank it. He changed into the horrible Edward Hyde. So you see that what separates this book from the ordinary category, is that the good and the evil exist in one."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"\\"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" has been called a Victorian parable, and it must have been groundbreaking in its time, but Robert Louis Stevenson seems to draw heavily on this passage from the Apostle Paul: \\"I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do...it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me.\\" (Romans 7:15&17) He explores this spiritual struggle with unabashed fervor in a tale still talked about over a hundred years later.The story, no longer than a novella, reads quickly. Told through second-hand accounts and letters (similar to Stoker's \\"Dracula\\"), the tale's violence and mayhem are never directly experienced through the eyes of a victim or the perpetrator, which made it more palatable for its original audience, but makes it somewhat distant for those bred on \\"Silence of the Lambs.\\" We have no clear protagonist, no clear definition of the next victim of Mr. Hyde's brutality; we have only snippets of letters and glimpses of a broken body. Stevenson manages to create a sense of foreboding, and the good doctor's final confessions are chilling, in that they describe the common struggle that all humans encounter within, fighting for the moral and ethical high ground.Sadly, the story doesn't hold up as well as hoped to the test of time. It lacks true suspense, and there's little mystery to be found. In an era of Victorian virtue, though, it was surely shocking to have a writer admit to that struggle within and portray it in vivid terms.I'm glad to have read the book for myself, and I believe it was foundational in the evolution of psychological suspense."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"IF you love action packed eciting books you should read Dr.Jekyll and Mr.Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson.

One of my favourite books, one that combienes science fiction and horror like few have others have done so well.A book of suspense and mystery, it is foremost a book about psychology, exploring the sweet duality of Good and Evil. And though Hyde may be Evil, i have doubts about Jekyill being Good itself. No, the doctor is merely a troubled soul longing for freedom, and that's what Hyde gives. Freedon without consequences, a theme of debate even nowadys.Stevenson's work is simply grounbreaking. It explores so many things: ethics in science; the limits of science and knowledge; how science may affect people. Like The Invisible Man, it talks about the tribulations of scientists and what are their limitations. It's also a dark view of science, for it makes it as something without benefits in the end.But besides this, its still a horror story, a classical one, with all the old ingredients: dark nights; the london fog; a murderer walking about the streets after the next victims. And he does find a couple of them.

I still found it very intriguing (it could be considered the world's first psychological thriller). The manner in which Stevenson writes is very fitting to The Strange Case. It is interesting to mentally piece together all of the parts which Stevenson includes. For anyone who is willing to put themselves in another time period, the book should be great. It's most interesting component is the way the &quot;mystery&quot; is presented, through the eyes of an attorney. Nothing is clear, everything is left to be interpretted by the reader. This clouded view makes the book as mysterious as it is. Throughout most of the story, it is unclear if Dr.Jekyll and Mr. Hyde are one. A disturbing link is always portrayed between the two however."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Dr. jekyll and Mr. Hyde is a story of a struggle of good and evil within ones self.

I don't read a lot of books, but I had to read this for a project. This was an interesting book. The life of Dr. Jekyll shows how everyone has a dark side. Even the nicest people have a dark side. I think he had to express his dark side somehow and used drugs or a \\"posion\\" as an excuse to express himself. I recommend everyone to read this book."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"***This review may contain spoilers***Of course, Stevensons's novella \\"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" (hereafter Jekyll/Hyde) has bestowed upon the world a shorthand phrase acknowledging human psychological duality. However, many of us perfunctorily conclude that the phrase \\"Jekyll and Hyde\\" means we are 50% \\"good\\" and 50% \\"evil\\". Stevenson pessimistically and tragically suggests that it is not so; instead, humans are disproportionately and naturally predisposed towards evil and that \\"goodness\\" ia a superficial barrier, or at best a superhuman assertion of will.At \\"Jekyll/Hyde\\"'s conclusion, where Jekyll's posthumous letter explains not only the mystery of the diabolical Hyde but summarizes Jekyll's life, the doctor admits that his reputation for charity and compassion was indeed hard-won. From the beginning, it was a strenuous effort for Jekyll to be studious, composed, and dignified. He always had a latent urge to be unrestrained, irreverent, and even dissolute, and even secretly indulged these shocking appetites. Jekyll thought his potion could separate this terrible, embarrassing part of him and allow his \\"true\\" good nature to prosper without hindrance. Eventually and horrifically, Jekyll learns that a psychological house divided against itself cannot stand. In other words, \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" are inextricably linked.Furthermore, the linkage is not really a balanced yin and yang. When Hyde is unleashed, he kills without remorse, without his inner Jekyll fighting to control him. Jekyll is nothing more than a superficial \\"refuge\\" from justice. In contrast, Jekyll finds that his inner Hyde IS fighting to control him. Jekyll eventually finds out and admits that is because Jekyll as Jekyll is not purely \\"good\\", but actually a mixture of good and evil. As Hyde, he IS purely evil. Jekyll was overmatched by Hyde from the start.Stevenson sprinkles other clues about our natural evil nature. When Jekyll views himself after the transformation, he is not appalled, at least at first. Instead, he describes himself as freer, younger, lighter. Yes, Hyde is initially dwarfish, but only because of long \\"captivity\\". With each appearance, Hyde becomes more monstrous, but Jekyll does little to check his alter ego other than to register concern and displeasure and even to pretend that he, Jekyll, is not truly responsible. True, after Hyde murders Sir Danvers Carew, Jekyll asserts his will and abstains from being Hyde for a while. But the evil genie cannot be bottled long. Eventually, Hyde takes over, or to be more precise, the true Jekyll emerges, although Jekyll continues the feeble pretense that \\"Hyde is responsible, not me!!!\\"Remember that Dr. Jekyll's skeptical colleague Dr. Lanyon witnessed Hyde's final, fitful transformation back to Jekyll. The shock killed him. The implication is that the realization that all humans contain this evil core was too much to bear. For most of us, this realization is almost too much to bear, but despite the evil odds against us, we struggle to keep our better natures alive."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"This is a classic gothic novel, written in the Victorian era in England. The external story is a tale of the mad scientist Dr Jekyll and his monsterous alter ego Mr Hyde. Which in itself is a great gothic novel to read.For literary content: it's interesting to know that this novel was written shortly after Stevenson's friend, Oscar Wilde was imprisoned in Redding Gaol under the La Bouche Amendment. The La Bouche Amendment was a law passed in England which basically deemed homosexuality to be a crime.There are many instances of homosexual 'code' within the novel and the public reaction to Mr Hyde in the book is symbolic of a Victorian's reactions to a homosexual - they react with anger, not fear.There are also many other literary interpretations of this novel, but the time period it was written in and the historical facts do point towards it being a veiled homosexual novel from the Victorian era.Much as many Gothic novels are instrinsically about sex and sexuality, in a time period where the subject was taboo, this novel is also a treasure trove of secret meanings from another age."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"This is a great book!

This book is so famous and referenced and retold that it was very interesting to read the original 1886 prose! The story is written as an account of events told by Dr. Jekyll's concerned lawyer friend. It's very detailed and by the time you've finished hardly a stone has been unturned! Being so accostomed to the idea that people may have different sides to their personality has somewhat conditioned my response to the story. I do really enjoy thinking about the people who originally read the story when it was first published who must have gotten a thrill from the horror of science gone wrong! The edition I recieved was simply the story with no other added info which was fine with me!"},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"I always thought I knew this story just because the idea of having a dual personality is an idea with which a lot of us can relate. I knew that the story was about a doctor who made some potion of sorts that turned him into an unscrupulous man. But there were several things that I learned from taking the short amount of time to read this story. I did not know that the story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was being told in the aftermath of the confusion of it all. I discovered that there were deep of emotions and grief tied to Dr. Jekyll's decisions and actions. I also learned that Hyde was the complete picture of the devil on our shoulder.

I've seen the movies with the effect of the Hyde potion (the crackling, morphing, turn to a gigantic character). The book was a lot more subtle, and if we didn't all know the story to some extent, would have been a great mystery. It's also seen through the eyes of a friend of Dr. Jekyl's, which makes the story entertaining as he unravels the causes of Jekyl's strange behavior.

I can only imagine reading this book when it was first written, before the idea of a split personality had really been explored in literature. I would have been on the edge of my seat. Even now, though I knew the answer to the riddle as I read, I was close to the edge of my seat.

A necessary addition to every classic literature repertoire."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"I ordered extra copies of this book to give as gifts, but they all arrived with some damage, some with a lot of damage.

I could not get very interested in the book because I am not in to science fiction novels. Another reason I did not enjoy it is because it was kind of scary with all of the killilng and evil. It did have a plot that could keep a readers attention, but it was too evil to keep it very long.

At times it was too pictorial and at others they will change things up and no one will say or revealed a thing to save some rich man's secrete background from coming to the light. The entire plot of the book is revealed in the first twenty pages. Everyone has heard parts of the book. People know Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde are the same man. They know he drinks a potion and changes. They know one is good and the other is evil. Everything is known before you even read the book. I half way expected Hyde to be huge and beast-like similarly to the way he is seen in comic books and even movies. That part was disappointing. The fact that the book jumps from one perspective to the next and the story is simply retold from another point of view. It is simply not a good book. There is a lesson in this.

Maybe the modern day media has dullened my senses, maybe I have become anaesthetized to the twists and turns of this timeless classic. Then again, maybe it is hugely overrated by literature readers who get their cues from the 1940's."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"This book was a MAJOR DISSAPOINTMENT. I would strongly advise AGAINST reading it. I thought it would be suspensful, or at least interesting, but sadly it was just a bad book.The story holds no suspense--the explaination of Dr.Jekyll's antics is handed to you on a silver platter--no mystery, no surprise, just boredom. The author, in the beginning, gets the reader interested, but the ultimate piece in the whole mysterious puzzle is downright stupid.The language was annoying, too. I respect that the book was written many years ago, but the way the characters rambled ON AND ON and never got to the point was downright obnoxious. I only read the book because I needed to for school. It was almost torture to read the constant whining and complaining of Dr. Jekyll, which, by the way, went on for 13 pages straight.I was totally let down by the simplicity and stupidity of the book. A classic shmassic. It was a horrible, badly written book with a flimsy plot line. To any person who wants to read it simply because it's famous, they're in for a real shocker. And if anyone says it's a good book, three words: big fat lie."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"I did not like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde because it took too long to get to the plot. There was a lot of talking, but did not go into full detail of how he became Mr. Hyde. The author would even go back in time to things that had nothing to do with the story line. When I think of Mr. Hyde, I think of more chase scenes and anger. I also think of more scenes of Dr. Jekyll in his laboratory. The ending was also kind of plain and boring; I like endings that give me closure or an ending that hints of a second book.Older people who like old British novels would like this book because older novels were written in the same form. People who have a lot of time on their hands would like this book; it takes a long time to read it. People who read a lot and do not get bored by a slow book and do not fall asleep could read this book. British Literature majors would also like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde because of the style of writing. If you get bored really easily and can fall asleep reading; then you should read this book."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Seems to me that the popular conception of this story misses the point a bit. It's not about good vs. evil -- not really. It's a tale of social repression and liberty.Dr. Jekyll discovers a duality within himself -- he states that he is \\"inclined by nature to industry, fond of the respect of the wise and good among my fellowmen...\\" but also that he has an \\"...impatient gaiety of disposition\\" that runs contrary to his desire to be esteemed and respected amongst his fellowmen.And so in truth it is not a dichotomy of Good and Evil -- not in a universal, philosophical sense of those words. Rather it is a dichotomy of Respect and Passion. The duality Jekyll finds within himself is of this nature: he truly loves the respect of those around him, but that necessarily means sacrificing \\"undignified\\" behavior. On the other hand, he truly loves to be undignified, free and unfettered, but that means sacrificing the respect of those he esteems.Stop right there. And so what leads him to what he later describes as \\"shameful acts\\" is not so much a desire to do evil, or even a love for vices, but a simple passionate nature. This speaks of the Victorian set of virtues -- reserved, under control, calm, wise, respected, anything but passionate and impetuous -- more than a more true virtuous nature -- full of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness. And so Jekyll is condemned by his society to see his more passionate nature as shameful.Jekyll's endeavour is to disconnect these two halves of himself -- this, in itself, could be a worthy experiment, but the danger comes because it is one that his performed upon (and curiously connected to) his own psyche, and there is a grave conflict within his psyche. In endeavoring to disconnect these two personalities, he is recognizing that neither one is morally superior to the other -- one is simply accepted by society while the other is rejected. A passionate and undignified man is not by nature more sinful or wicked than a reserved and dignified man. I would say he believes this on paper, but not in his heart. Deep down, he is a product of his society, and believes, along with those he esteems, and dignity and reservation are virtues, while passion and recklessness are vices.Yet perhaps this book is a tale that conforms to, instead of reacts to, Victorian morality. Edward Hyde turns out to be uncontrollably wicked, murderous, and evil. Perhaps the point is that there is no liberty, lack of dignity, \\"gaiety of disposition\\" without wickedness, and virtue lies in reservation and bridling the beast within. That Jekyll unleashes a monster because he refuses to recognize it as a monster, believing what I wrote above -- that if one could disconnect the two halves, both could live their lives well.If that's the case, then the book is based on a lie, and one of the lies I hate the most -- that passion is ugly and deformed and should be killed before it can kill.I remember another story- one of a man who lived in the desert, dressed in camel's hair and ate locusts. A man who was passionate about doing good -- he was called the best of all men. And of others around him, pious reserved men who kept the law and were respected in everyone's eyes. They were called white-washed tombs.want to discuss? ..."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"The Strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde maintained my interest throughout the whole book.

This is because Mr. Hyde has been seen and suspected in many crimes around the city. Theories develop concerning the whereabouts of Dr. Hekyll when he places himself into seclusion.

Yet Dr. Jerkyll's problems dealing with the evil within turns out LESS than basic. In fact, while Jerkyll fights the evil it seems to grow, becoming stronger. Near the end Mr. Hyde is not only larger than before but seems to be able to appear at will. Yet this is not a DIFFERENT person, both men are the same, sharing the same desires.Within each of us is a Hyde who wants to strike out, to crush those who hurt us or make fun of us. Why else would we love all those action flicks?This is a timeless theme and something everybody has to deal with."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Although sometimes overlooked, Robert Louis Stevenson's novella of dual identity ranks with Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein\\" and Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\" as one of the great horrific works of the 19th century. I first read it as a boy and I recently returned to it for the upteenth time -- and I'm in my early 50s now. This is one of those stories to which an appreciative reader can relish, over and over again.That said, I must warn anyone expecting a really good fright that our modern sensibilities probably prevent this book from having that effect. And in fact, \\"Jekyll and Hyde\\" was never as terrifying as \\"Frankenstein,\\" the story of a man who presumes godly powers but creates a monster, or \\"Dracula,\\" the tale of a creature who seems to have cheated death. Instead, this story of Dr. Henry Jekyll's transformation into a malformed thug is creepy, yes, but also quite sad.But that evocation of pathos may be the book's greatest strength. As a reader, I am repelled by Mr. Hyde but also feel a great pity for him, so twisted he is in body, mind and soul. Stevenson, able to create those conflicting emotions in his audience, stands as one of our great writers.I have read that some people reading this book for the first time have been disappointed by the experience, partly because of their own lofty expectations. If you're coming to the book anew, remember that it was written in a different time, long before we had become jaded by slasher films and pointless exercises in cruelty such as the \\"Saw\\" and \\"Hostel\\" series. This is a marvelous (and short!) tale of a man who lets his humanity slip away into the darkness. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"The story is well-written and would be a pleasure to read on paper, but it is even more of a treat to listen to this audiobook version. Martin Jarvis is a fantastic reader! He uses so many subtle variations of his voice to make each character distinct without caricaturing them. The voice he chose for Mr. Hyde was eerie and thrilling, so that I ended up wishing the character had been given more lines of direct dialogue."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"I bought this same books a while ago. I've always heard about this story in movies, TV and so one. When I came across this book I had to get it. They say never judge a book by its cover, but in this case I did. The look of the book echoes books of the eighteen hundreds. The silver shine on the edges of the pages plus its own bookmark just made me want it more.The classic horror story of Dr. Henry Jekyll and Mr. Edward Hyde gave people around the world nightmares for over one hundred and twenty-five years as well as the writer himself.This is one book like Dracula and Frankenstein you must have for your book collection. No collection is complete without it.Trust me, you'll enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"If you have ever seen a movie version of it or if you think you know the story, you should read the book because I think you will be surprised in how different your perception is. It's not a very long book so its not a huge time commitment, and I think to compare what you think it is about and how it was initially written by Robert Louis Stevenson is worth the short time investment."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"This was another classic book, like the Phantom of the Opera, that I had heard a lot about but never actually sat down and read. It is a pretty quick read, well written, and fairly disturbing...although maybe not by today's standards.Most of the story is told from the viewpoint of Mr. Utterson, a lawyer who is a friend of Dr. Jekyll's and who observes Dr. Jekyll's strangeness from an outside perspective. Mr. Utterson has some experience bumping into Mr. Hyde as well and finds Mr. Hyde a most disturbing character. Most people know the premise behind the story, so the surprise twist at the ending isn't really a surprise. Basically Mr. Utterson tells you about Dr. Jekyll and how Dr. Jekyll's life is intertwined with the disturbing Mr. Hyde. Things culminate when Mr. Utterson receives a journal of Dr. Jekyll's that explains Dr. Jekyll's experiment in full.This is a dark, mysterious read. If would have been full of suspense had I not already known the story. From Mr. Utterson's point of view the things that happen to Dr. Jekyll and involving Mr. Hyde are disturbing and upsetting. It isn't until you read Dr. Jekyll's journal, at the end of the book, detailing his experiments that things get very creepy and a bit spooky.As a chemist I have to say that the chemistry described in the book and it's affect on Dr. Jekyll is ridiculous. I realize this is a work of fiction however and choose to ignore that, although I had to mention it.Stevenson's writing is very readable; and the mystery and gloominess pervading the story is distinct. The story is very engaging and I found myself hard-pressed to put the novel down. At times the language is dated and a bit wordy, but I expected that.Overall I am happy that I read this. It was nice to get the full version of the story and see what all following works were based on. It is a good piece of literature and an enjoyable read. Dr. Jekyll's journal at the end brings up some deeper questions about duplicity of personalities and the good and evil that dwells in all humans; so from that aspect it also gives the reader some food for thought."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"...as the day the words were written. Every human has the capacity for good and evil but it's the choices we make that determine our fate. Recommended for adults or teens, this edition would be a perfect fit for any English/Literature classroom. Relatable characters, digestible content, clean layout, modern face, and budget-friendly. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"What originally drew me to this book was the beautiful intriguing cover, and I soon discovered a very engrossing story within the artistic picture on the front. This book tries to create a link between the good and the evil that is there within all of us and it succeeds in doing so within a few hundred odd pages. It is easily read at leisure with a couple of hours in hand. I would highly recommend picking up and reading this classic!"},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"I had been wanting to read this book for years and finally got to it... I would recommend it to ANYONE looking for a wonderfully written suspenseful read. I loved how short it was - got through it so quickly! It would be a great book to take on a short trip or on the bus as it is easy to stash in your purse."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"I love this story. For a long time it had been one of those that I \\"have always wanted to read.\\" Here, Stevenson has beautifully told a story that, really, even in his day wasn't new. The paradox that good and evil exists in every human being is as classic as the beginning of human history itself; and a phenomenon that has played out throughout history ever since. Far from being unoriginal however, Stevenson has given artful life and breath to this duality through the characters, time, and places in this book. And with this edition, Cricket House has creatively built on the legacy of beauty found in the story."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Jekyll and Hyde is a classic that everyone knows about but few sit down to read. I was surprised at how short it was compared to other books from that genre. I think that if you are just starting out reading Gothic horror, this is a great place to start. At $4.50 the price isn't bad either."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"I had been interested in reading this story for some time. The cover of this particular edition really drew me in. I had known of the story but not the intimate details you can only get from reading it. I picked this story up this summer and was immediately drawn in! The story began with a very ominous scene which set the pace. If you've never read this book, you should pick it up and get acquainted with Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"I have been wanting to read this book for years due to all the movies and shows that make reference to it. It really wasn't what I expected, but I found it surprisingly interesting and psychological. Right away, the cover grabbed my attention. It made me want to turn the page and start reading immediately. The format made it light and easy to stash in my purse and read in my spare time at the airport. It kept my attention and left me pondering the duality of personalities. I thought it was a very thought provoking book, but fun and entertaining."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Many times publishers will publish several short stories in one book, creating a large volume of short stories. I find myself spending a fair amount of my reading time flipping through the cumbersome book trying to find my story. But I love how this publisher is releasing short stories as their own book. The book is beautifully made: The design, layout, and text is very easy to read. And of course, what a great story. Robert Louis Stevenson explores humanity's darker side through the characters of Dr. Jekyll and the infamous Mr. Hyde. The book is feeling like an old friend already."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"I definitely recommend this as a quick, but fascinating read. It's not only thought-provoking, discussion-lending and well-written, but in the case of this copy, aesthetically pleasing and really well designed by Cricket House Books. Stevenson creatively captures the essence of so much human struggle - the capacity for both good and evil within each human being - and the tragic consequences that result when evil is given sway. It would be an appealing choice for teen and adult readers or book clubs."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Why did I give this timeless classic four stars?If you are into intense characters, driving plot, and descriptive narrative... this book is not for you. It lacks all of those things. The main characters of Jekyll and Hyde are scarcely developed, and the supporting characters are not developed at all. We are left with individuals who are little more than names and dialog. The plot is certainly there, and it is interesting, but it is hardly suspenseful. Save for the transformation from Jekyll to Hyde and vice versa, there isn't much description to go on to get a vivid picture of what's really happening.However, one cannot deny the philosophical, ethical, and theological implications of this short book. Perhaps character development and plot were deliberately glossed over so that the reader is forced to consider the duality of human nature. In Stevenson's story, there is no place for relative morality. There is no excuse for Hyde's actions, or Jekyll's for that matter. As Jekyll must come to grips with Hyde's wickedness, so too must we readers come to grips with the Hyde that lives in all of us."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Stevenson draws you deeper and deeper into this chilling tale of a frightening addiction. Dr. Jekyll is a man exploring the soul, who discovers something hidden inside himself. This book weaves artfully around the always horrific subject of the evil within us all. Stevenson's beautiful language and imagery envelopes us in his mind, holding us frozen until the very last page. This story is as magnifcant as it is eerie. I loved this book. READ IT.Afterward, you may not want to look too closely into the mirror..."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"This short novella that has become such a staple of our culture is a quick and easy read, but definitely rewarding. In most formats, the entire story takes up only 50-70 pages, and could be read in a single sitting of a couple of hours. Given this, you may hesitate to fork out your well-earned money for such a small amount of gratification, but if you can find this story as part of a collection or at a good discount (maybe an e-book), definitely go for it.The novel version of Jekyll and Hyde is quite different from the many movie adaptations. For the most part, this version is more simple, with very little filler. Stevenson's original leaves much up to the readers' imagination, making the story even darker and more powerful, in my opinion. Apparently, the idea behind this book came from a very real fear of Stevenson's that he might be living a double life, in which he would unknowingly sneak out at night to commit atrocious misdeeds. Knowing this gives the story even more power, as you can sense the author's seriousness for the topic.If you haven't before, make the effort to find a good copy of this novel. Written in only a couple of days, it is remarkable how integrated these ideas have become in our culture.

However, this is not a simple scientific fiction because it reveals the double characters in human life: a well-respected doctor could have some evil thoughts in his mind and behaved differently.On the other hand, the author did not mention why Dr. Jekyll wanted to do such horrible experiment to ruin himself completely. Perhaps this is the point that needs to explore."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"A lot different from the movie versions, and a lot better.

Well it looks like Henry's will will have to be executed as the housekeeper; Mr. Pool thinks Hyde hid Henry's body.Once again, I saw Spencer Tracy before I read the book, so I was anticipating a different type of story. I read \\"Treasure Island\\" so I am familiar with Stevenson's writing style but I did not realize that this story was more of a mystery that draws the conclusion and revelation in the end. The explanation of man and his duel personality is excellent and I suspect he draws on personal experience.Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde Double Feature (1932/1941)"},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Robert Louis Stevenson is a good storyteller, and this book is probably one of his most well-known. It has been adapted into many different forms including the big screen and television. It has mostly been adapted into movies in the horror genre, and the book is certainly leaning towards this, but it also a wonderful story of the supernatural that still manages to terrify us. It is also a great story because of Stevenson's psychological perceptions, and his strong concern for ethical problems that keeps cropping up throughout the book. The book is still a valuable piece that should be read by anyone interested in great literature."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"This book is defenitly a classic. It probably could have been of longer. If it was at least the length of franenstein I am sure I would have given it 5 stars. The book does a great job of exploring man's dual nature. It is good for a quick read on a rainy day. Anyone who wants to say they've read the classics should read this book. Of course that is just my opnion, I could be wrong."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was a great book. I thought it was strange that the author would kill Hyde/Jekyll off so early in the book, but he pulled it together nicely with the two narratives in the end. I also thought the wording in the book was very easy to understand, and it gave you a defiant sense of suspense throughout the book.I did, however, feel that Hyde could have been more evil. I just always thought of Hyde as a horribly disfigured and large man. Therefore, when you see only two murders and a dwarf as the villain you are somewhat disappointed. Hollywood has played him up as a huge man , and that is one thing I realized by reading this novel. He is a small individual."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"I think the strange case of dr. jekyll and mr hyde is a great read. it is a mixture of a mystery novel with a horror novel. it shows you both sides of every human being, the evil side and the good side. also it being a short novel is a plus.you can read this book in no time. if i had more that two thumbs i would give them all up for this novel. robert louis stevenson did an awesome job with this one . i reccomend this novel strongly."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"This controversial novel, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, shows the battle between the supernatural and rational thought. In this story Dr. Jekyll, a deranged scientist, creates a potion that separates his body into two people, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. This controversial theory of the body being divided into good and evil is clearly depicted in Stevenson's work. Many people would dispute the worth of this novel due to the fact the story is widely read and depicted as clearly as Stevenson has wrote. I truly enjoyed the true story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, showing the true reasons Dr. Jekyll had for his transformation."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was an awesome book. It was so awesome because it was so visual. What I mean by this is that all through the book, even though the characters in the novel were not able to describe him, it was written in a way that I was able to picture Hyde's face. I could just see his ugly face.Also, the idea of someone who is able to change themselves completey by just drinking a potion is an awesome concept(although the change was not what Dr. Jekyll wanted). I also enjoy the fact that the main character kills himself in the end. That doesn't happen in most stoies and it gave this story a great twist.I wouldn't change a thing about this book and would reccommend to any reader Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Dr. Jekell and Mr. Hyde was an okay book. It was just okay because I thought that having most of the novel told through the eyes of a man, Mr. Utterson, who would not have been part of the story except for being Jekyll's lawer, was a little different than the way I'm used to hearing the story told.However, when Mr. Danvers was murdered for no reason, I felt that the story has gotten my attention. The act of senseless violence was definitly a great point in the book.I will tell people who might this book that if they enjoy reading about a scientist who is just on the wrong side of strange, but want a book easily read, to read Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"This was a great book to me. Partly because of the shortness of the novel. The book also was interesting because, if I had never heard the story before, I would not have been able to make the connection between Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde until the end of the book.It was also very easily read because it grabs your attention, and I can't explain how, is able to keep it. With the exception of the huge part of the novel where Utterson speaks of Dr. Jekyll being locked in his laboratory, although an important part of the plot, the book kept my attention.I enjoyed reading this book and would reccommend it to anyone with an interest in science fiction or the abnormal."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was not at all long as I had thougt it would have been. Although it did give a sort of linguring essence. To me it wrapped me into the story by telling of glimpses of Mr. Hyde. How he trampled the girl and killed Sir Danvers Carew. It had me intwined with the profound doctor by day and the evil, luciritive monster by night. Just knowing in the beginning that there was something out there that was cruel enough to kill a poor girl and have no actions toward it but to &quot;pay&quot; the family for what it had done is cazy. And the middle of the story brings you further into it because you don't know what is going on with Dr. Henry Jekyll. All you know is that there is something seriously wrong with him. And the end, well it wasn't the best. It just gave the answer to the &quot;problem&quot; of Jekyll and Hyde by mere letter. I mean it could have been something more.Although I am pretty sure everyone has heard of the story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, how it was the potion that transformed Jekyll into Hyde. I mean who doesn't know the story? But as Stevenson wrote &quot;evil consists not in action but in character&quot; and to me that quote symbolizes the theme of the book. It wasn't entirely Jekylls faught (him making the potion was) but it was his &quot;split personality&quot; Hyde.Robert Louise Stevenson captured the views of his time in this great and very respected book The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"This book had its ups and downs it was also short. The intoduction put everything into sense like when it was said the trues meaning of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde's names. They are both of Scandinavian origin as Hyde comes from the Anglo-Saxon hyd which is Danish hide &quot;a haven&quot;, and Jekyll comes from the Danish name Jokulle, which means &quot;an icicle&quot;, and by not knowing the backround of the names some might think that Hyde means a place for hiding. I liked this book because it was exciting except for the begining of the novel when it was just talking about the characters and what they do. My favorite chapter was Search for Mr. Hyde because thats when we first get to see Mr. Hyde because they would only say little thing that would keep you guessing, and once I found out what he looked like I was excited to read more.I would have to say that the best character was Dr. Henry Jekyll. I liked how he was sneaky and in the end of the book he tryed to be the good guy and stop taking the potion. It was also interesting when it was kind of throught the end of the novel when you find out that Jekyll and Hyde were very close. I would recondmend this book to almost anyone because I'm not much of a reader, but I really enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson may have a long title, but it's a short book to read.The Strange Case is about the duality of man: good versus evil, and how everyone has that inside of them.Mr. Utterson, the lawyer, finds it odd that his good friend Dr. Jekyll has amended his will in order to leave everything to Mr. Hyde. This is strange because Mr. Hyde is an unappealing man, possibly deformed, not to mention evil, having caused major disturbances and a horrific crime.Dr. Jekyll won't get into his relationship with Mr. Hyde, but Mr. Utterson is going to get down to the bottom of the situation eventually!I really enjoyed this book.

The additional material here is the afterword by Jerome Charyn, titled \\"Who is Hyde?\\". Charyn's tone is rather chatty, but nonetheless he raises interesting issues about hidden subtexts related to Stevenson's own life. Likewise, he notes that the story repays close reading to details and even single sentences, as clues to unexplained facets of the narrative, such as what Sir Danvers Carew was talking to Hyde about in the street before Hyde attacks Carew, and simultaneously, what the maid saw (the maid being the only female in the novel). Charyn tries at times almost to titillate readers by raising possible undercurrents of repressed sexuality, or even homosexuality, in the narrative.Overall, a good edition of this classic story, and it is best truly to read the Afterword after the novel, and not before."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"This book is a really good book the plot is good for the time when it was created.

The mystery/thriller aspect was always great, but I am sure it was much more enjoyable in the time period it was published to not know Hyde and Jeckyll were the same person until reading Lanyon's letter to Utterson.A great classic, reads pretty straight forward a with great imagery and suspense."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"this book is not bad but i didn't really like it... the book is pretty confusing it has twists and turns and you don't know what your reading anymore..altogether it wasn't horrible though....if you are older you will probably like the book because you will be able to understand it but its not very interesting."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"found it, purchased it at a good price, delivered timely, works as advertised. couldn't want more.

Even really good people, pushed to an extreme or under the right circumstances, are capable of doing very bad things. That is the moral behind this story of the doctor who concocts and drinks a potion that totally changes his features and unleashes the wicked impulses in him which are otherwise suppressed by his moral conscience.David Rehakauthor of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;"},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Who hasn't heard of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde?

The number of people, who have read the book, is much less however and until recently I wasn't among them.Having read the book, I cannot recommend it strongly enough. Stevenson deals with the dual nature of \`man' and his (or her) battle within himself. The plot is quite simple and it may have been this simplicity that gave the story its popularity. It could also have been Stevenson's skillful usage of the English language, which makes reading this book such a pleasure.The only bad thing about this book is its brevity. Do yourself a favor and read it."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde challenges the strict social classes of the Victorian era and explores the duality of human nature. Reputation is a prevalent theme in this horror story from a different generation.

At times the book because a little boring because of the in depth information and the stiff language.

Which side will win out is one of the major themes of the novel. Another theme of the novel is hypocrisy and double-dealing. As the plot unravels, these two main conflicts resolve after a climactic and very shocking discovery.Because of its uniquely crafted plot, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is a masterful tale of suspense. I thoroughly enjoyed Stevenson's use of imagery, particularly the devil/fiend images, and figurative language throughout the book.

The reader is left to imagine what this &quot;deformity&quot; might be.

At other points, however, the narrator is more specific in describing Hyde. His use of strong diction draws the reader into the novel: &quot;hissing intake of the breath,&quot; &quot;snarled aloud,&quot; &quot;savage laugh,&quot; &quot;something troglodytic,&quot; &quot;Satan's signature on his face.&quot;Since I am a fan of Sherlock Holmes and other classic mysteries, I would definitely recommend Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde to anyone who shares my interests. This mystery is a solid thought-provoking book that includes shady characters, potions, eerie transformations, an oddly worded will, and sudden deaths.

Which side will win out is one of the major themes of the novel. Another theme of the novel is hypocrisy and double-dealing. As the plot unravels, these two main conflicts resolve after a climactic and very shocking discovery.Because of its uniquely crafted plot, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is a masterful tale of suspense.

The story is told mainly from the point of view of Mr. Utterson, the lawyer of Dr. Jekyll, who is trying to find out who Mr. Hyde is.This is a great book, one of those classics that everyone should read at least once. Stevenson gives great descriptions of the battle between Jekyll and Hyde. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Unrestrained evil awaits the reader within this brief novel. \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" is a novel dealing with human duality and theories to that effect. You already know this Victorian-era story: good Dr. Jekyll brews himself some potions in his laboratory, and after drinking them his body deforms and he becomes the evil Mr. Hyde.We see much of the action through the eyes of witnesses to Hyde's corrupt deeds. Hyde is a brutal antagonist; he represents a man at his very worst, from his hideous sneer to his violent gaze. Hyde slinks around the city for some time before finally succumbing to his nature, and committing murder.We meet Jekyll early on, but he remains a cryptic figure until we get a glimpse of his confession, in the form of his journal. Jekyll was experimenting with what some theorists call man's \\"dual nature\\", the idea that each man has a good side and an evil side. Alas, Jekyll's experiments worked a little too well...The enduring strength of this story is a tribute of sorts to the superior storytelling skills of Robert Louis Stevenson, also well known for his \\"Treasure Island\\". This novel is direct and to the point, yet never does Stevenson gloss over the horrors of Dr. Jekyll's fate. The novel contains just as much detail as is needed, and most of the storytelling packs a wallop with very few words. Stevenson's descriptions of the horrors of Hyde are complex and satisfying. The reader can almost feel Hyde staring at them with his hateful, penetrating eyes; they can watch Hyde expressing his contempt for humanity needing only his angered stride as proof of his malice. Jekyll's pain comes through nicely as well; his personal horrors are brought home with climactic flair.Even knowing what was going to happen, I loved reading this story. To me, the story is a warning against both leashing your inner \\"beast\\" and letting him out. While I do not believe in the \\"duality of man\\" theories, I do subscribe to the notion of men needing to vent frustrations rather than tethering them. A person's life is not either / or in the case of emotions; emotions of all sorts are a part of every man's life, and rational people need to know how to constructively provide their emotions with an outlet."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Robert Louis Stevenson's \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" is one of the classics of horror literature because it provides the paradigmatic example of the \\"werewolf,\\" the human being with a monstrous alter ego. However, originally it was much more of a mystery story and that is the best way of describing this adaptation of Stevenson's novella by Michael Lawrence. The book's complex structure is simplified and Lawrence employs a narrator to help retell the tale. The adaptation is certainly competent enough, but the story clearly takes a back seat to the illustrations in this particular volume.This Eyewitness Classics adaptation of \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" is full of the illustrations and details we have come to associate with books put out by DK Publishing. A two-page spread before the first chapter details The Two Face of London, contrasting the rich West End of Victorian London with Soho area where criminals stalked the poor. Background about how Victorian gentlemen dressed for evening and how women were second-class citizens is provided. Once the story commences there are not only illustrations by Ian Andrew depicting events in the novella, but the borders are usually filled with small photographs and detailed text amplifying the action. One such note might explaining the gas lighting system in use at the time while another actually explains the significance of the key Jekyll supposedly gave to Hyde. These pictures and notes are certainly informative, but they are also somewhat intrusive, especially when the reader is trying to decide when they should read each of these additional bits of information.The attempt here is to provide something more than a straightforward presentation of the novella without going so far as to provide an annotated version. The information provided is quite useful for young readers, for the most part, but their intrusiveness may well get in the way of enjoying the story itself. The illustrations by Andrew are stylistically evocative of the shadowy, misty streets of London we associate with tales of violent crimes such as \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.\\" A final spread in the back of the book looks at the Legend of the story, which includes the various dramatic versions on stage and screen. More interesting are the insights into how the story reflected what people were thinking about evolution, psychology, and drugs at the end of the 19th-century. The best solution might be to just try and read the story without always resorting to the additional information and then going back and filling in the details (maybe on a chapter by chapter basis). This approach is used in a pair of other \\"horror\\" classics, \\"Dracula\\" and \\"The Hunchback of Notre Dame,\\" in the DK Classics series."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"It's always interesting to see how a classic like this differs from its many Hollywood adaptations. In this case, the book is very little like the lurid depictions of Mr. Hyde and his doings. In the book, Hyde's depravities are mostly offstage, and the reader learns about them through Jekyll's elegant euphemisms. In fact, the last half of the book is entirely Jekyll's narration of events through the means of a letter he leaves for his friend Utterson. It's a device that probably wouldn't fly today, but was possibly necessary in RLS's day, to avoid detailing just what Hyde had been up to. Some of the language in this book is a bit turgid and I occasionally had to re-read passages to get the gist of them, but I still enjoyed reading it. It's an interesting look at the duality of human nature and what happens to those who give in to the dark side."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Hands down, Stevenson's prose is special, however I would suggest if you are coming to this book in a later stage in life, you may want to bypass it, and study Frankenstein. It is a matter of relationships and character centers and themes too young in the former, which are quite similar really, yet more mature in the latter."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"First published in 1885, Stevenson's novella failed to attract much attention for a month or two, before it suddenly surged to popularity and became a best-seller of its time. Reading it, I was wondering if it really qualified as horror, since it wasn't, well, very horrific. But technically speaking, it is rated as horror, since it has all the necessary literary elements that are the hallmarks of this genre.The story is told from the viewpoint of Mr. Utterson, a lawyer who is a close friend of Dr. Henry Jekyll. The good-hearted Utterson is troubled by Jekyll's association with the unsavory Edward Hyde. He fears that his friend is somehow being compromised by the latter, but how? Is Hyde Jekyll's blackmailer, or his illegitimate son? Actually, Utterson's character doesn't voice these possibilities, but we can hear him thinking them. The lawyer is filled with even more foreboding for Jekyll's safety, when the doctor makes out his will in favor of the much younger Hyde. A murder is committed, and deaths ensue before Utterson's questions are finally resolved.\`The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde' is unlikely to raise even the smallest icy prickle in the spine of a veteran fan of Horror fiction. Poor Stevenson, it's not his fault we need merely turn on the evening news to have our sensibilities inundated with stories that fill us with fear and loathing. Today's horror writers are compelled to elaborate ever further on gore-soaked and flesh-crawling details to elicit anything more than a tepid response from a desensitized reading public.Stevenson, to his credit, is a wonderful story-teller. Though this book was written a couple of years before Jack the Ripper began his spree of terror, Stevenson brings before our mind's eye the fogs roiling around the dimly lit streets of nineteenth century London - a place where menace, in the stunted form of Hyde, lurks around every corner, and the suspense rises to a shrill crescendo. This book predates medical diagnoses of psychopathic personality disorder, and holds a unique place in Literature in its study of human nature torn between good and evil. It was a prototype for the many horror/thriller books that followed in its wake."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"The story is creepy and full of dread.

It did not meet our expectations as the pages are so thin, they could not be highlighted as required by the teacher. The color ran through to the next page making it impossible to read or highlight that page... We were hoping for more substantial paper throughout the book. If you don't care about the thinness of the paper, then this book will easily meet your needs."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"This is a classic tale that I think everyone can take something away from.

But this is the original story and it is an awesome one."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"This is a great classic.

It's always going to be a classic, and the duality of humanity (good and evil) in many ways is explored for the first time, and that is a theme that will live forever and keep this story a classic. But if you could read anything you want, I would look elsewhere, storytelling has evolved thanks to classic authors like Stevenson paving the road for more complex stories and adventures. The good/evil duality, & humans shapeshifting has been redone many times and some of the new stuff out there is just more fun to read than this."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"I never thought I'd say this about a book, but the movie was better - the one starring Spencer Tracey. I appreciate the subdued style of 19th century literature, but this offered little in the way of memorable descriptions of or insights into either Hyde's or Jekyll's mental state. It really seems like Stevenson put little thought or effort into writing this one. I also get irritated when authors ignore such fundamental scientific concepts as the conservation of mass - Jekyll shrinks when he becomes Hyde. Comic-book science fiction does it all the time, but I expect better from a serious author.According to the \\"About the author\\" at the end of the book, Stevenson won international fame from this book. Perhaps for the time, the insight that we have an evil personality within us was so new that this story deserves this fame. Since it is short, it is worth reading.(Peter Payne, author of CAPTAIN CALIFORNIA: A YOUNG MAN'S ENCOUNTER WITH THE EVIL WITHIN HIMSELF)"},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"this book is a good book too read for the young and old. dr. jekyll a man of science and good standing.

It was also extremely short, under a hundred pages. Although it was short, there were a few times I got lost or a little confused. For example, Dr. Lanyon had died, but later in the story there is a letter form him. Also the same situation with Dr. Jekyll. The beginning was a little difficult to get started. It contained too many adjectives and was too wordy.This science fiction would have been more intriguing if I didn't already know the plot of the story. There are many differences between the book and all the other stories I have heard, which I did not like. It also contained good parts. The book eventually starts piecing itself together and gets more enjoyable. This book would be good for a those who like science fiction and seeing all sides of the story"},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"I find classics rather confusing. I believe that is just the language of the time that it was written in. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde does have a rather interesting plot line but, like some of the other reveiw topics, it is a very common Horror plot. But I did enjoy the psycological theme of a persons darker side in Dr. Jekyll's experiment. Yet, this story has become rather cliche and predictable. It just seems as if we already know what is going to happen because this story is so well known. We read and studied this book in British Literature and will be tested on it. It was a rather good book but I still find classics rather confusing."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Robert Louis Stevenson writes a story that continues to disturb people around the world through the power of its narrative and its underlying psychological implications. Robert Louis Stevenson book, Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde, deserves a four-star rating, because it shows Stevenson is repetitive to show the true feelings and emotion of the characters in the story. This story has the split-personality of one man Dr. Jekyl who drinks a mixture of chemicals that turns him into another person, Mr. Hyde, who in the end Mr. Hyde tries to keep drinking this mixture so he can kill off Dr. Jekyl. Reading this book carefully makes this book easier to understand and more exciting to read, but read to fast and miss some details it can be hard to understand. Although this book can be strange at sometimes, Stevenson brings the reader deep into the book by evoking emotion from the characters, a plot filled with mystery, great suspense from a thrilling fiction book, yet sometimes hard to understand and follow.Right from the beginning of the story, Stevenson brings out the emotion from the characters, so the reader can understand and feel what the character is really feeling. When the reader can feel exactly what the characters are feeling it makes the story exciting and fun to read. Stevenson does a superb job of this throughout the entire story, by explaining every detail, so the reader knows what exactly is going on. Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde exchange deep emotion between each other, which also has an affect on the rest of the people in the story. As in real life if something is done to a person it can affect him or her, which can also affect other people, Stevenson makes this book fiction as real as possible.People in the world today get into all kinds of stories, but if some are into mystery book then this one is for them. Stevenson had all kinds of mystery built up into this book, and by having that all built up into the book it is going to be hard for a reader to put it down. Stevenson does a good job by giving little information about something and then adding details to the plot, which gives it great suspense to the story line. This can make it hard to understand sometimes, but if read carefully Stevenson shows the real mystery of this book. The mystery and horror that comes along with this book makes it a weird yet thrilling book to read.Stevenson puts the reader into a stop where sometimes they will not know what is going on. This builds all up to suspense, which brings thrill and emotion to the book. This book is not at all predictable, when the reader thinks something is going to happen Stevenson turns it around the other way and make even more suspense come out of the story. Suspense makes a book thrilling and enjoyable to read, with Stevenson odd way of doing things this book can be a good one to read. The reader never knows what is going to happen next, which leads this story into a great suspenseful plot.There is only one flaw with the story, it can sometimes be hard to understand, that can lead the reader in a confusing direction. It can be so hard at times that the reader will have to go back and reread what they read just to understand and get the full effect of the story. Sometimes the plot can be confusing to understand also, trying to picture the setting and atmosphere can be difficult at times. This can become frustrating at times, but once it is read the right way the story makes good sense. Stevenson makes this story a hard one to read, but one the reader gets past the difficulty, the story can be an awesome one to read.Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde will be a story that will go down in history, because it is such an interesting book to read. The emotion from the story brings the book to real life even though it is a fiction book. Then the mystery come along and grabs a hold of the reader to bring them right into the story. The suspense and thrill from this book is something that the reader will remember for a long time to come. Even though this book can sometimes be hard to understand, it is still one that can go can be said as one of the best books ever wrote. I would recommend this book to anyone that is into mystery and horror; this is a book that no one will ever forget."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"The so-called &quot;thriller&quot; of The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde seemed like more of a sci-fi mystery to me. The narration of killings was not descriptive enough to fit in the category of thrillers such as Stephen King's Desperation. (Great book, by the way) It didn't mention how the blood ran down Sir Danvers Carew's mangled body. It just kind of let the reader's imagination picture that on its own, and this fact may have made the story a little dull for those with not such great imaginations.The story left me thinking about many things. What kind of conflict took place in the novel? Was it man vs. man, himself, or nature? Is an experiment of this type possible? Did Jekyll really have control of his body? Who committed suicide, Hyde, or Jekyll? Did they really commit suicide? These questions are left unanswered in my head, but at least I have something to ponder upon.However, I am not saying that this book was a complete failure. First of all, I am sure that it ran chills up the spines of the people in 19th century England who read this book when it was first published. The ever-so-popular T.V. show, the X-files was not in existence to ready one's mind for the violence that went on in this book. People were not used to hearing about killings in stories; this review would've been different back then. Also, this book contained a wonderful plot. The idea of creating a potion to divide one's evil from their good is very interesting. It is the style that makes you want to stay up all night to finish the novel, when you didn't even need to. This is another problem with this book. It was too short. Brilliant authors such as Robert Louis Stevenson need to make longer novels with more then one problem. This is how Steven King has succeeded thus far in his career. Stevenson could have added some extra conflict to the story and still been able to turn out a masterpiece. In fact, this would've added to its popularity. You don't judge a book by it's cover, so why it's thickness. This is a wonderful example of this statement, and I would recommend it to anyone with a good imagination."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:H},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},D=["disabled"],x={key:0},B={key:1};function E(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",C,[(e(!0),t(y,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",B,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",x,"See more"))],8,D)):p("",!0)])}const J=d(M,[["render",E],["__scopeId","data-v-8d5df726"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/45.md","filePath":"library/45.md"}'),q={name:"library/45.md"},W=Object.assign(q,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(J)]))}});export{P as __pageData,W as default};
