I loved this book, and suggest everyone read it. It is a story of a misaccusted young black youth who by being at the wrong place wrong time, must die in jail. Coming from a very respectable family they wish him to be visited by a teacher...in hope that he can die like a man. They give the unwilling teacher the great responsibility of opening a young man's eyes and heart, and teach him that he (a black boy) is much more than what white society may view him as. In the end the boy is able to possess integrity, strength, faith, and pride although fate has short future for him. Defanantly a beautiful and soul-fufilling book."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"Among the &quot;must read&quot; novels of all times, &quot;A Lesson Before Dying&quot; ranks at the very top of the list in that literary category. It is the type of reading that expands the bounds of the mind, strokes the soul, and tugs at the heart strings. At its conclusion you are left with a plethora of emotions and thoughts that linger for days and remain in your repertory of thought forever. It's one of those novels that you read and say,&quot;Unbelieveable&quot; as you wonder, when will the sequel be published? Ernest Gaines truly solidifies his position as one of the greatest writers ever with this novel.Gains transports you back to a time when the lines between justice and injustice, right and wrong, fair and unfair are obscured and ultimately crossed and broken by race, socio-economic status, prejudice and segregation. The reader is drawn into the lives of the characters on an intimate level through Gaines' masterful dialogue and vivid descriptive details. This is a novel that challenges the idea of &quot;accepting the things you cannot change&quot; and places a very original spin on the concept of &quot;dying with dignity.&quot;&quot;A Lesson before Dying&quot; is a story that unfolds around the main character's final months on death row after being falsely accused of killing a white store owner during a time when the color of one's skin dictated just how &quot;blind&quot; justice will be. The lessons and realizations he, and those persons who hold a significant place in his life, must come to grips with before his death are heart-wrenching and life-altering.From the teacher who, under great duress, is forceably assigned the awesome task of &quot;teaching&quot; the main character the &quot;lesson,&quot; to the reverend who collaborates with the teacher but from a completely different viewpoint on how the &quot;lesson&quot; should be taught, and the various other characters that vicariously impact upon and influenced the way in which the main character internalizes his plight, each of these characters are left with &quot;lessons&quot; that escalate to the riveting conclusion of this story. Ultimately each of these pivotal characters' lives are altered as a direct and proximate result of the main character's death sentence and the manner in which he learns to die with dignity.This is a story about self-respect, self-denial, self-sacrifice, self-esteem and self-defeat. It is a story of family, friends, authorities, and enemies and how they are integrally entwined to shape each other's lives. Written in a time when the constraints of racism and economic status divided and at the same time, drew together a community whose heartbeat came to pulsate in conjunction with the heart beat of the main character. Reading this novel in and of itself will prove to be &quot;A Lesson&quot; of memorable magnitude."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"A Lesson Before Dying, written by Ernest J. Gaines illustrates the struggle of a highly segregated community and the death of an innocent man. The novel is somewhat slow at the start but is appealing to those who enjoy rich character development. The story takes place during the 1940s on a small sugarcane plantation in Louisianna. Jefferson, a young black man, is falsely accused of killing two white men and is sentenced to execution in the electric chair. Miss Emma, Jefferson's aunt, hopes for Jefferson to accept his responsiblitities and not run away from them. Before she dies she wants to see the black man stand for her. She plans to accomplish this by using Grant Wiggins, an educated school teacher, for the job. Throughout the course of the novel, Grant makes many visits to the jailhouse to talk with Jefferson. This point in the novel is where I began to lose interest because the numerous visits are drawn and the same conversation among the characters is repeated in every visit. Miss Emma wants Grant to teach Jefferson how to break the cycle of the community and to rise above, \\"this vicious circle.\\" as Grant Wiggins put it. Grant decribes the cycle of the community by stating that each time a male child is born, the people hope this child will be the one to change the vicious circle. Miss Emma believes that both Grant and Jefferson can break this cycle by encouraging Jefferson to walk up to the chair and stand as the tallest and the bravest man in the room. This novel is not only about Jefferson's development into a man before his death, but also about the development of an entire community including Grant Wiggins. I recommend this book only to those who don't mind a slow novel but enjoy reading the transformation in a deprived community."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"Without a doubt, this is one of the finest pieces of literature I have ever read.

The quotes are based upon what he believes and how he feels.Jefferson was in his twenties when he was sentenced to death by electrocution because of a murder of a store owner and two brothers. Jefferson had no idea of what he had done to put himself in this position. Before his death he was sent to the Bayonne Jail to wait for that one day. The waiting period is known to be the worst part of the sentencing. The reason for that is that the authorities believe that is the time period they have to think about what they have done and how they can get out of the situation or even find a way to be forgiven for the pain it caused the loved ones. In jail Jefferson did not talk to anyone at first. When he did start talking to people, particularly Grant, he would respond in short and non-emotional answers. One of the answers he seemed to give often was. \\"I'm all right.\\" Jefferson stated. (Pg. 169)Religion is important to most people especially the people of Bayonne and at the quarter, where the godmother of Jefferson had lived all of her life and that was where Jefferson was raised. Reverend Ambrose was the person who helped the people if they had trouble believing in what was right and wrong or not knowing who or what is right to do in situations that you feel you need someone there for you. Jefferson knew that there were a God and a heaven, but did not feel there was a reason he believed he would get to heaven. He was not sure when Jesus died and when he rose from the dead, but the fact that he knew he had died and rose is enough to know Jesus did exist and is in the heart and mind of Jefferson. \\"Tomorrow is Good Friday.\\" Grant said, and then Jefferson asked \\"That's when He rose?\\" (Pg. 221)The feeling of death is nothing to the mind of a man that is on death row. Jefferson was sentenced to death by electrocution. Jefferson felt depressed, but did not show any sign of feeling because of the thought of what he could do to make up for what he did. He did not eat or take care of himself either because he had no feeling of remorse, guilt, or even madness. He acted like he did not care anymore and did not want anything to do with his own family or help that his family had gotten for him. The night before the execution he could not sleep and wrote in his notebook that Grant had got him. The thing that Jefferson had done was repressed his feelings of the deaths of the store owner and the two brothers. Then at the last moment of his life he took time to listen to his heart and feel pain because he would not feel anything else after that moment. Jefferson wrote \\"its quite quite an i can yer my teefs hitin an i can yer my hart.\\" (Pg. 233)Gaines, Ernest. A Lesson Before Dying. New York: Alfred A.

In the final words of the trial the lawyer said \\"he's just a hog.\\"When someone looses there faith they tend to say they are lost. Grant said to the priest \\"I am lost and you can't expect me to tell Jefferson to believe when I don't.\\" He also told the priest he needs the radio more than God because he let this happen.The Priest said to Grant, \\"You think your educated because you went to collage, but don't know ant thing about your own people you are not educated when you are in hell your so called education won't mean a thing.\\" it means that even if you know things from books you still have to know god and the people you are around daily to make a difference."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"A lesson before dying is about how the unfair punishment of one man that affects all of those around him. A young black man named Jefferson is sentenced to death by a jury of white men and in the court room is convinced that he is less than human. After his sentencing his god mother encourages the local school teacher, Grant Wiggins, to teach Jefferson how to die like a man. Grant is a skeptic when dealing with people.

Gaines. The story is about a young black boy who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. He was sentenced to death, but innocent of all charges. Should the death sentence still exist today?In my opinion, I think the death penalty should still exist today. It is a lawful way to prosecute someone for killing another person. My saying is \\"A life for a life.\\" It's really the only fair thing to do. But in the story, a young black man named Jefferson is sentenced to death for someone else's doings, and its not right just because he is black. The enforcers didn't care to know the true facts. He is black so he must have done it because he was there. \\"A fool does what others tell him to do.\\" (p.7)Ninety-eight percent of whites are responsible for the death penalty decisions, one percent Hispanic, and one percent black. It's like the white society thinks any other race is too stupid to make a decision as to who should and should not have capital punishment. \\"I was too educated for Henri Pichot.\\" (p.21) This quote is referring to Grant, who was a school teacher. He is another black man in the story, and he is too smart for a white man. Grant knows how to read, write, and do math. Most were lucky if they learned. Grant did and the whites weren't too happy about it.\\"Twelve white men say a black man must die, and another white man sets the date and time without consulting one black person.\\" (p.187) This quote goes with the percentage of whites that make the death penalty decision. That was the way that it was with blacks and whites. Some of the whites or most of them are still like that today.Over all, I thought the book was good. I gave it four out of five stars. I think it will teach young people a good lesson. People of all ages should read this book."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"This story is written by Ernest J. Gaines. It is a story about a young man named Jefferson that is sent to the death penalty because he was at the wrong place at the wrong time. It is just supposed to be an ordinary day of going fishing with Gable, but ended up getting in a middle of a gun fight that he did not cause.In this story, I do not like the way black people are portrayed. Jefferson was innocent of all charges and they gave him death because he ended up at a liquor store where a gun fight broke out and everybody was killed but him. Everybody is calling him a fool for going, but how was Jefferson supposed to know what was going to happen. \\"A fool does what others tell him to do. A fool got into that automobile. A man with modicum of intelligence would have seen that those racketeers meant no good. But not a fool. A fool got into that automobile. A fool rode to the grocery store A fool stood by and watched this happen, not having the sense to run.\\" (p.7) This means that Jefferson was a fool for not getting help, but he was so shocked he didn't know what to do. Since the jury thinks he murdered these people, they call him a \\"hog.\\" \\"He is innocent of all charges brought against him. But let us say he was not. Let us say for a moment he was not. What justice would there be to take this life? Justice gentlemen? Why, I would just as soon put a hog in the electric chair as this.\\" (P.8) They have no right calling Jefferson a hog because everybody should be treated equally! Back then, all black people were treated a lot differently then now. Everything was separated. White people had the good stuff, while blacks had the bad stuff. Separate schools, water fountains, buses, and etc....A lot of people were slaves, and that's how Jefferson is treated. No, they did not have a lot of evidence, but they didn't here the actual side of Jefferson's story. They really did not let Jefferson speak the truth at all. I don't like the fact that an innocent man was sentenced to death without a retrial. They should have gave him another chance. Grant and Miss Emma are trying to do everything to make Jefferson feel better, but he refuses to talk to anybody. At first, he always called himself a hog, but throughout the book, he begins to realize that he is going to die soon, and he wants to live life to the fullest. He begins to talk to people more and he is a lot friendlier to Grant. Also, he now realizes that he is going to die a man. He wants everybody to know that he is a strong man going to the chair. \\"Good by mr wigin tell them im strong tell them im a man.\\" (p.234)Overall, I thought it is a really good book, and I recommend it to readers of all ages.

It shows many good, strong lessons. It's about a young black man, Jefferson, who is accused of murder and is convicted to be put to death by an electric chair.

Also, if the unfair trial isn't enough, the defense attorney calls Jefferson a \\"hog\\", a \\"fool\\", a \\"boy\\", many names that are very disrespectful.

Grant knows he must go on though, for Jefferson, Miss Emma, and also himself. The book has alot of imagery and it feels sometimes like you are in the cell with Jefferson.

The focal point of the story is not to overturn the verdict, but an effort by a family friend to reveal to this man awaiting death the fact of his humanism and inherent worth before he dies. What follows is a touching revelation into the mind of a man who has never been told of his value, who had never been embraced with love, and who didn't know of his own potential to 'stand', and reminds us of the importance of respecting, loving, and encouraging those around us we usually might over look- black, yellow, brown, or white."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"My name is Khristie Dyson and I attend Southern University.

I could not say I enjoyed the book or the writer's style and yet the book does get 3 stars because the plot is compelling and the author is able to convey some of his ideas in an effective manner.Bottom Line-Don't buy it, check it out of the library and read it, buy it afterwards if you liked it."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"As a college freshman reading &quot;A Lesson Before Dying&quot; for the first time, I was at times bored with the story, and at other times excited and wanting to know more. Having grown up in south Louisiana, I felt very familiar with the characters, and know firsthand some of their experiences. (A side note- If you're not from Louisiana, don't attempt to read the story out loud. Chances are, you won't be able to pronounce the words correctly.Louisiana has it's own special language.) The main character Grant Wiggins, not only helps Jefferson, a condemned man on death row, to see himself as a man, but Grant also begins to see what is truly important in his life. The spiteful comment made in the first chapter of &quot; I would rather put a hog in the electric chair as this&quot;- reffering to Jefferson- made by Jefferson's own defence attorney, gives Jefferson the mindset that he is not a man, and will never be one again. It is Grant's task, as set by Miss Emma, Jefferson's godmother and best friend of Grant's own Tante Lou, to teach Jefferson that he is not a hog, but a true man going to his death with honor. This task creates a struggle with in Grant, as he can not see that anything he would do could change the way Jefferson thinks of himself, or the way that anyone thinks of Jefferson. These two characters must challenge one another before either can help the other. Ernest Gaines' book, A Lesson Before Dying, is a testimony of truth and the powerful influence that man holds over each other and themselves."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"I thought the book A Lesson Before Dying was good because it kept me interested and wanting to know what that lesson was going to be.I think girls and boys would equally like this book because it has good emotion.

That said, the book revolves around a black individual, who was convicted under an entirely white jury, the book paints a portrait as if he was innocent. He supposed murdered a white store clerk in a robbery gone bad, however that is up to the reader to decide. As he is waiting on Death Row, the local school teacher, Grant, at the request of his aunt Emma, tries to turn what Jefferson describes as a 'hog' into a man. Thus, Grant, against his own volition agrees and attempts, numerous times in vain, but in the end turns Jefferson into a man who is willing to accept his death with pride and dignity.

I bought it on a whim after reading the back cover copy, but then started thinking I'd made a mistake after reading the first few chapters as it's a little slow at the beginning. However, It picks up significantly after the first 60 pages or so and the subtle messages that Mr. Gaines puts forth in this novel are quite thought-provoking.It's actually the lack of action in this book that strikes a cord with the reader. Despite the fact that their loved one is falsely accused of murder and sentenced to death, the characters in this novel accept the outcome instead of challenging the decision.This story is a message to everyone about how we may choose to act in the worst situations. Do we break down and show our weakness as a result? Or do we hold our heads high and accept our fate with dignity? How we choose to handle the struggles life throws our way becomes more important than whether or not we can avoid the struggles in the first place.\\"A Lesson Before Dying\\" does an excellent job of making that point crystal clear."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"I read this book a number of years ago and still remember the finest of details.

Jefferson's godmother realizes that Jefferson has no way out of his fate and wants him to hold his head high before his death. She enlists the help of Grant, a young local school teacher to mentor Jefferson during the time he has left.

Gaines novel, even having been blessed as an \\"Oprah's Book Club\\" choice in September 1997. Today it is read in many middle and high school English classes for the lessons that it has to teach all of us about human dignity and grace. Not all of Oprah Winfrey's book choices over the years have been the wisest, but she got this one right.The novel is set in a section of 1940s Louisiana that Gaines knows and works so well in his writing. Jefferson, a young black man who by sheer chance found himself at the scene of a store robbery that went terribly wrong is convicted of murder and sullenly awaits his date with the state's electric chair. There is substantial evidence of his guilt since the money from the cash register is found in his pockets and he has helped himself to a bottle of whiskey from behind the counter. And he is the only man still standing since the white storekeeper and the two black men who gave Jefferson a ride to the store have all been shot to death.It is when Jefferson's defense attorney, trying to save him from the death penalty, describes him as something more like a hog than like a man that Grant Wiggins finds himself drawn into the drama surrounding the pending execution. Wiggins is the first black man who has left the plantation for an education and he is unhappy and resentful that the only work for him is teaching the children of those who still work the fields of the cane farm as generations of their families did before them. In a way, he considers himself to be as much a slave of the system as all those who are still tied to the land for their survival. But his aunt, with whom he still lives, and Jefferson's godmother pressure him into becoming involved. They want him to convince the condemned man that he is a man, not a hog, and that he needs to approach his pending execution with all the dignity and courage that only the best of us ever really possess.Wiggens takes on this responsibility simply because he doesn't dare to deny his aunt's request and, when he believes that he is failing them all, he continues the struggle only because he cannot bear to disappoint her. It is only when Jefferson begins to slowly respond to what Wiggins is telling him, and asking of him, that Wiggins realizes that he is being taught a lesson every bit as important as the one that he himself is trying to teach. A Lesson Before Dying is an inspirational book, one that will be used in classrooms for many years to come, and it very much deserves the National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction that it received in 1993."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"The Book A Lesson Before Dying is one of the best books.

His writing was making us feel what people felt on death row.My favorite chapter was 19 the Christmas program because of everything that was going on and Bok pointing at everything and also the kids when they were messing up the line.

Earnest Gains, the author, produces a piece of art, but no masterpiece. The characters are well established, but often times, their foundation leads the reader down paths that they couldn't care less about. The author focuses too much on the main character and his relationship with his aunt, without giving enough information on the main character and his work. These stray and what I see are random paths are boring and do nothing more for the reader than direct the focus away from the book's plot.The book's plot has enormous potential but I feel the author has diffused the story by a predictable ending. From the moment Mr. Gains said go, it was obvious who was going to win. Although the feeling of not knowing what's going to happen next wasn't present, the book still keeps its readers attentive. Although I have made negative opinions on the book, I still feel that the book is well written. The vivid descriptions provide insight into the unlawful ways and everyday life of a racist 60's community. The unjust conviction of a black man by twelve white males is one of the issues that must be acknowledged. Despite being somewhat monotonous, the book has some very entertaining scenes. These include a fight scene, a romantic encounter, and a comical scene involving the school superintendent and a class full of uneducated preteen blacks.In summary, I would say that the book, A Lesson Before Dying, is a well-written book that will keep you in your chair...but not on the edge of your seat."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"A Lesson Before Dying is a must for anyone's home Library.

Mr. Gaines does an excellent job of setting the era and letting us visualize the location that these events take place in.

Grant tells Jefferson that he tries to love and cherish all his relatives and friends, yet when talking with his aunt and Miss Emma, Grant puts them down verbally and never does anything they say.Grant, a school teacher, beats his students mercifully for not spelling a word right or writing on the board slanted; however, teaching like that was customary in those days. No one was forcing Grant to teach as fiercly as he did.Overall, the fact that Grant is portrayed as an angry and bitter sort of man ruined the book.

He caught all of the frustrations of being a second class citizen, the expected subserviant behavior that all people of color were supposed to maintain, even when your learning surpassed those who held onto supremist attitudes. The story was moving, very real. Racism was in the story, but it wasn't racist. I grew up with people like those represented, both black and white.

Gaines. My mother gave this book to me a while ago, but it looked kind of sad from the description, so I put off reading it for a while. She read it because my brother read it for one of his classes in college and he gave it to her to read.The book is about a young black man, Jefferson, who is in the wrong place at the wrong time and gets convicted of murder and sentenced to death. He is not very intelligent and is put down at the trial when his defense lawyer calls him a \\"hog\\", asking the jury if a \\"hog\\" could have committed such a crime. His godmother is so hurt by this that she asks the local teacher, Grant, to start visiting him in prison to \\"make him into a man\\" before he dies.The story line is good, but I didn't think the book was written as well as it could have been. I didn't feel very close to the characters in the story and I thought that they often seemed a little one-dimensional. Also, the story starts off really slow in the beginning. It seemed like I was almost halfway through the book before Grant started visiting Jefferson in prison. Then, the end of the book, the last few months before the execution seemed rushed, like the author had a limit of pages or time and was just trying to finish the book as quickly as he could. It made me wonder if the only reason this book was popular (and my brother read it in class) was because it was part of Oprah's book club."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"Ernest J. Gaine's, A Lesson Before Dying, was the longest 250 page book I ever have read. It's slow pace and predictable events put me right to sleep. The book takes place in the 1940's in a highly racially segregated part of a small Louisiana community. Jefferson, a young black man, is falsely accused of murder and sentenced to the electric chair. The majority of the book is the time between his accusation and his death, in which his old teacher, Grant Wiggins, tries to make a man out of him at the wishes of his godmother (Tante Lou, Jefferson's mom). Grant's goal is to make the hopeless Jefferson into a man, and destroy the white man's myth that the white race is superior. So after frequent visits from the teacher and Jefferson's family, Jefferson decides to stand as a man and die with pride to further the black populations struggle for equality. By sacrificing for this cause, Jefferson defined what it is to be a man by giving his all for others and what he believes in. Everyone in the book is so amazed and enlightened by his actions, and they learn what it means to be a man or even human for that matter (Even Grant Wiggins). It proves we all have something to learn in life, but after twenty pages I guessed the ending because I have encountered a similar theme in multiple other works. I suppose I'm a sucker for happy endings, but I wanted to know where the justice was. Jefferson was a decent human being, and yet he and his family suffered. The question that arises is; \\"Why do bad things happen to good people?\\" Well I don't like that Jefferson seemingly had an unfair turn of events, but being a man of God, I accept the idea the he will be compensated for in Heaven. No one is above death or fate, and for that reason I believe we are all equal. On a side note, the author had some excellent descriptions of the food that Tante Lou made for Jefferson, and I have to say I found myself hungry quite often. Overall I believe that the lesson in the book was a subtle yet valuable one, but it seemed to take the author forever to get there. Other then the fact that there was not much \\"happening\\" in the book, I thought I was a worthy read for someone who has a lot of time on their hands."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"A Lesson Before Dying is a novel about Jefferson, a black man sentensed to death for a crime he did not commit. Jefferson is accused of being at the worng place at the wrong time, yet it is because of his color that he is not given a fair trial. This novel shows the hardships, trials, and crooked morals of a white society on a black man.It is Grant Wiggins, Jefferson's, teacher, who instructs Jefferson to stand up to society and die with dignity. The task undertaken by Grant is not easy because he too being black is treated like a criminal when he visits with Jefferson.

It faces racism in a manner that is true on an everyday level and asks the question, \\"Can a black man receive a fair trial?\\" The story deals with a young uneducated man named Jefferson who had caught a ride home with two friends. After stopping at a liquor store for a minute, his friends begin to get in an argument with the clerk. In a matter of minutes the clerk and Jefferson's friends have all been shot dead. Jefferson then gets convicted even though there was no evidence to convict him. He has to spend his days on Death Row, but his friend Grant is there to support him. Grant learns to become a sympathetic person, and develops a bond with Jefferson. At the end of the story Jefferson is executed and Grant is left crying. The story has a good plot and much insight to the oppression and segregation of the early 20th century south. One of my favorite parts of the story is how it displays the absolute hypocrisy of the \\"Jim Crow's\\" of the south. One good example that I like, is the description given to the school district's superintendent - where Grant teaches. It says while the superintendent preaches cleanliness, good hygiene, and exercise to the black children, he himself doesn't practice what he preaches. In fact, the superintendent is so obese that he struggles just to climb out of his car seat. Gaines' clever usage of the characters and how they themselves are tied into examples of pre-civil rights everyday people is what makes the book good.

Set in segregation-era Louisiana, a young black man called Jefferson is falsely accused and convicted of murder. His godmother, enraged by the fact that he is compared to 'a hog' enlists the help of the local teacher Grant to 'make him a man' before he is put to death. Grant is initiatly reluctant to help Jefferson, as he himself is plauged with doubts about his own racial identity and goals as a teacher. This hence sets into a motion an incredible journey that changes the lives of all concerned forever. What makes this book an incredible read is the fact that it presents its message so effectively. It is a moral lesson without preaching, a cry for justice without propaganda. 'A Lesson Before Dying' compares favourably with other race-relation classics such as 'Cry Freedom' and 'To Kill a Mockingbird'. One must consider what is written in this book before even beginning to concieve what it means to be American, and for that matter human."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"A Lesson Before Dying is a must for anyone's home Library. It is definately what one would call a &quot;modern classic&quot;. I read this book with an online book club whose name is reflected in the title of this review JustBookIt2001. We had a very poignant discussion on this book. So many themes and issues are evident in this novel. You could debate forever on the subject of capital punishment alone. Mr. Gaines does an excellent job of setting the era and letting us visualize the location that these events take place in. This novel takes you back to a time that unfortunately was not that far into our nation's past, where there is racial inquality and judicial injustice.

Reluctantly, Grant and Jefferson work together and develop a strong bond through Jefferson's writings.

More than anything, this novel is a coming of age story. Jefferson, a young, uneducated black man witnesses a robbery, and as the only survivor, he is found guilty and sentenced to the electric chair. At his trial the white defense attorney states that Jefferson doesn't have the intelligence to plan a robbery, saying &quot;What Justice would there be to take this life? Justice, gentlemen? Why, I would just as soon put a hog in the electric chair as this.&quot; This sets the tone for the rest of the story.Grant Wiggins, a school teacher, (one of the only educated black people in the town), is asked by Jefferson's godmother to teach him dignity, and how to be a man before he dies. Reluctantly, Grant agrees to visit Jefferson, urged on by his aunt and girlfriend, Vivian. In the visits to Jefferson's cell, Grant tries to instill in Jefferson some self worth, as he persistantly tries to live out the description of himself as a &quot;hog&quot;. Although Grant wavers in getting through to Jefferson, he eventually does, and begins to break him down. Both men fight eternal demons, however, they later learn the power of frienship and learn to fight those demons together, each holding the others burdon on their shoulders. Through Jefferson, Grant learns to fight the oppression of the white communitty, and Grant helps Jefferson see the meaninf of his life and self-worth, not to himself, but to others who care for him. In the end, they each succesfully conquer their demons, and Jefferson learns to &quot;stand&quot; and to walk to his death as a man. Was a good book with many deep thought provoking themes, and the character interaction between Grant and Jefferson was great, but it's not an action packed book, so don't expect to be sitting on the edge of your seet the entire time."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"I feel that this book has a powerful meaning that touches those who have a sense of heart and pride. It slowly enfolds itself several days after one has finished reading it. It is not a book with action and/or suspense, rather it is a book that causes the reader to think for him/herself. It starts out plainly and ends the way the reader might perceive it to end. It is completely predictible; it is this predictability that directs the mind and spirit toward a deeper meaning of the book.The two main characters, Grant and Jefferson, transform through their hesitant openness to change. Their changing causes them to realize their purpose in life and what it means to have faith. They begin to grasp a sense of pride as they journey through this transformation and as this pride grows stronger, they grow stronger. Finally, I recommend this book to those who enjoy reflecting on and analyzing books, and/or to those who would like to get in touch with their inner-self.

Gaines is a prime example of how a man must face himself and own up to his own burden in life. The story is about two black men who learn about possibly the most important lesson in life, God. Understanding God and death is a lifelong task that is extremely complex. The two main characters attempt to learn not only the tangible, but the intangible too. The tangible is mathematics, english, and ultimately how to become a civilized man. The intangible is something the teacher, Mr. Wiggins, even doubts himself. The intangible is God. Their burden is to learn these things together, and to teach Jefferson how to accept his death and injustices like a man. In the story both characters go through a change.&quot; You shut up, or get up,&quot; I said. &quot;I mean that.&quot;(199) Grant hears two men in a bar talking about Jefferson like a hog, and he finally decides to fight for his race and not be afraid anymore. He learns how to fight for his race out of his care for Jefferson. That is one of the lessons that Jefferson taught Grant. Not to be afraid anymore; however, at this point in time that behavior from a black man is trouble. Jefferson ends up being the brevest man to walk to the chair, and that is told by the courtroom witness Paul. At the end, Grant thinks the change is a miracle from God. Grant finally learns his lesson on a deeper perspective of prejudice; moreover, he learns that you can change things. You can learn about god and about life also.

Characters in the novel, A lesson Before Dying, struggle against the very confines of this question. Their story takes place in a small Cajun community during the 1940's where prejudice is thick, as is pious religion. One young black man named Jefferson is found guilty under the charges of murder. He is falsely accused and sentenced with the death penalty, though he is merely a victim of unfortunate circumstances. Both accuser and defendant believe he is less than a human- only an \\"old hog they fattening up to kill for Christmas.\\" Jefferson's godmother refuses to let these words render truth and believes the one man capable of penetrating these lies is the local school teacher, Grant Wiggins. Though Grand wants nothing to do with the condemned man and feels as uncertain about life as the one sentenced, he agrees to visit the cell. Together, the two men must impact one another to discover the purpose of life.Upon finishing the novel, I truthfully had a mixture of feelings. I felt as though I could not give it immediate praise, nor complete criticism. Its commendable features are displayed in the novel's message about the importance of life, love, and equality. Grant is forced to see life beyond selfish ambition, whereas Jefferson discovers the importance of love in his last days, and both defy prejudice expectations. However, beyond these amiable qualities, I personally do not agree with the novel's open sexual references regarding Grant and a married woman or the novel's blatant profanity. These issues caused my experience with the novel to be negatively affected. If not for these avoidable flaws, I would render A Lesson Before Dying as a masterpiece of painted culture, valuable lessons, and heart wrenching depth. It is one that causes the reader to ponder over the same question concerning our legacy as did the characters. Jefferson has to choose whether to stand as a man or die like an animal, just as we must also do today. I commend the novel for its impressionable look into life's realities and values, but cannot fully recommend it due to my personal stand on its lack of morality. Though my opinion is one of torn feelings and may fail to persuade one in their decision of reading it, I hope to open one's eyes to both the novel's strengths and weaknesses. Therefore, I leave my honest opinion at the door of the next anxious reader to choose for themselves.

To me it's just like the step-by-step, inch-by-inch rhythm one would take to meet an execution. There is an obvious control to this type of writing. It's perfect for the story. The book spares detail. Think of how he describes his lover, Vivian. There's not a lot of sensual language, but we can see how beautiful she is.

A tale of human dignity, and the promise of redemption. Gaines weaves a wonderful tale about a black man condemned to death in a prejudiced manner typical of the south in the 1940's. Names like &quot;Jefferson&quot; and &quot;Grant&quot; become names for heros again despite the story's all-too-real depiction of the mechanistic process of injustice. Grant Wiggins, the unwilling teacher who is given the task of teaching the condemned Jefferson, is the narrator, for he is aware, as an educated man, of the many voices and opinions held by the others, even if he doesn't agree with them. The place of religion is interesting, pitting the beliefs of the classic black preacher, Reverend Ambrose, against the agnostic, academic Wiggins. I, too, would like to have heard more from Vivian Baptiste, Wiggins' girlfriend. The timeline of the story is the timeline of the black children's school year, roughly October to April, a down time on the plantation, when these children can be free to learn their lessons. &quot;A Lesson Before Dying&quot; is a lesson for everyone about freedom, about heroism, about having strength and resolve in a time and place where oppression drained them both.

Gaines is a moving, powerful novel about a black individual put on death row for a crime he did not commit. Overall, I thought the book was very inspiring and well written, but had its drawbacks. The novel is set in the 1940's, where Jefferson and two of his companions, rob a local store. Everybody was killed except Jefferson, the only man who did not fire a single shot. He is subsequently put in jail for no other reason except for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. He is then sentenced to death by the electric chair. His loving aunt, Miss Emma, was humiliated when the juror called Jefferson a hog in public. She hires Grant Wiggins, an educated schoolteacher to help make Jefferson a man, and walk to the chair. Grant and Jefferson work together and following some minor indifferences, Jefferson walked to the chair as a man in the end. The aspect that sets this book apart from others written in a similar manner is that the story did not revolve around Jefferson's trial or his punishment. The author relates the plot in the beginning of the story, which can be a drawback or a bonus, depending on the reader. I liked the way Gaines introduced the entire plot early on, in order to have the reader concentrate on the characters and symbolism immediately rather than later. Also, Gaines brought the characters into the story slowly, unlike most authors. Gaines releases a couple facts about each person when he/she was first introduced. Then, he conveyed more details about them later in the story. In addition to this, Gaines did not reveal any emotional or inner traits about the characters. As an alternative, he let the characters' traits be exposed by their actions. One theme that was predominately heard throughout the novel was \\"Actions speak louder than words\\". An example of this was Jefferson's silence as he walked to the chair. While everybody in the room worried about the execution and showed remorse or pity, he did not speak. Paul, the security guard said, \\"He was the bravest man in the room,\\" and \\"- I could not bare to look\\". The book was top notch for the theme of heroism. The story, in my opinion, displayed two heroes, Jefferson and Grant Wiggins. Grant was hero to Jefferson and Jefferson was a hero towards Grant and the society of Bayonne, Louisiana. Grant did what probably no people in that section of town would have done. He talked and gave Jefferson a chance to reform. That touched Jefferson deeply, knowing that some people cared for him. In one of the last journal entries of Jefferson, he emotionally thanked Grant in the little writing that he knew. Jefferson was the main hero in the novel. He set an example for all people to believe in; he showed them to not be afraid. Jefferson at first was afraid to die, but when Grant came to him, and taught him strength, Jefferson conquered his fears. Jefferson portrayed to the town, that although the white government may seem invincible, some things or choices might have a bad effect on them. The reader could see this throughout the book. From when the execution date was set, the officials began to talk less, and not be as harsh as before. The works of Jefferson and Grant touched Ms. Emma, and Grant was so moved by Jefferson that he could not go to the execution. He was crying for Jefferson and himself when Paul told Grant it was done.The only drawback that I found in the book was it was slow. When one reads the book, a lot of patience is required or they will lose focus. I believe that the story does not have much action or suspense. That is the main focus of most of the stories out in bookstores today, if you are an \\"action and explosions\\" individual the book is not for you. On the contrary, what I loved most about the book were the details in the story and the theme of the plot. In other words symbolism was a chief topic in Gaines' novel.Symbolism is a major part in the understanding of the book. Some of the diminutive details of the story have a lot of importance as the novel progresses. For example, Grant mentions the picture that hangs in the classroom of \\"The Last Supper\\"while in the classroom. This picture compares with Jefferson's last meal before the execution. Another picture in Grant's room portrays Christ knocking on a door; it represents Jefferson knocking on the door of faith and hope. Jefferson cannot be executed on Lent because the town will not allow it. Jefferson is scheduled to die between the hours of noon and three, which was the time of Christ's crucifix. Ernest Gaines writes the novel very realistically. Grant was extremely nervous and angry that he had to go see Jefferson every week. He even said, \\"What's the use, he will die all the same\\". He thought the idea of trying to make Jefferson a man was absurd and a waste of time. Gaines portrayed the attitude of Grant well, because a person would not be exactly pleased if he/she had to carry out the act. Vivian was the only person that kept Grant going; if she had not encouraged him so much, I believe he would have quit. I would recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys powerful novels with a lot of hidden meaning inside the text."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"This novel by Ernest J.

Jefferson, a black teen wrongly accused of murder, and Grant Wiggins, the teacher on the Pichot Plantation, both exemplify the struggle for pride and integrity. The degradation Jefferson faces in the courtroom by his own attorney calling him a \\"hog\\" serves as motivation for his grandmother to change him into a man. Grant is asked to teach Jefferson about pride, however, Grant finds himself the one being taught. As both these young men forge a bond, they defy the expected and prove themselves as men of dignity. The book was thought-provoking with a timeless lesson: every man can be a hero. Ernest Gaines creates a passive protagonist in Grant to portray the importance of small actions. Throughout their bonding, what might seem as an insignificant comment or action is really a major psychological turning point for both Jefferson and Grant. The depth of introspection of both main characters provides the reader with the opportunity to examine his/her own beliefs and self limitations. By discussing controversial subjects such as the death penalty and the existence of heaven, the reader's religious faith is strengthened for his/her own views prevail taking a stand on the issue of death. The details of life during the 1940's in a Cajun community is directly influenced by Gaines who grew up in that environment. Gaines's expertise in these surroundings create the mood of prejudice and condemnation of African-Americans generating the mood in which Jefferson becomes ashamed of himself. With his simple vocabulary, Gaines creates a rather easy reading book. Although the book can be read in a short amount of time, sometimes the realization that something was important causes the reader to review past chapters. A Lesson Before Dying represents the struggle of integrity, pride, and dignity by Jefferson's journey to the electric chair and Grant's path toward the strong principles of his manhood."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"This is a story about a fairly uneducated man who was convicted of murder and sentenced to death.

Grant is asked to teach Jefferson that he is not less than human. The end of the story was very emotional when Jefferson was asked at his final moments if he had any last words.

It's a novel about race relations in America, reminiscent of To Kill a Mockingbird, but it focuses more specifically on the impact that slavery, segregation, and racism has had on black men and how this has affected their communities. A Lesson Before Dying, unlike novels like Mockingbird, is told from the perspective of a black man. The novel also addresses issues of alienation felt by educated black men in their own communities. Grant Wiggins, the novel's protagonist, is the only college educated man in town and the only person who lacks religious conviction. This isolates him a little in a community of uneducated devote Christians.The novel is about the pending execution of a black man who was in the wrong place at the wrong time and finds himself on death row. During the young man's trial, his lawyer in an attempt to avoid a death penalty from the all-white jury suggests that to execute his client would be akin to executing a hog. The comment has a huge emotional impact on the young man, who finds himself on death row anyway and feeling that he is less than human. Grant Wiggins is pressured by his aunt to meet with the young man and convince him to face his death with his head held high and walking tall, like a man.I especially liked that Grant Wiggins is a deeply flawed character - selfish and bitter at times. The novel manages to be powerfully affecting without being overwrought and melodramatic and without being overly sentimental.

The protagonist is a school teacher who agonizes over his vocation to teach (which he refuses to accept as his true vocation), his love for a woman and his yearning to be free.More than one lesson can be learned from this book.

Yes, blacks in the South in the 1940s had it tough ... there is no need to remind us. Gaines did nothing to expand upon our knowledge of this, and if his intention was for greater equality, he failed miserably and only created more hate between the characters and/or the people who read this book. Gaines creates an unlikable, selfish protagonist, Grant, and then drags us through the hardships in his relationships with his aunt, girlfriend (whose relationship with Grant definitely brings out the worst in Gaines' writing abilities), and his death-row inmate charity case Jefferson. Jefferson's diary is perhaps the only effective part of the book in provoking emotion. The only lessen to be learned from this horrible novel is never eeeeeeeever listen to Oprah again!

This is just another book written by an angry African American author, who still feels the &quot;pain&quot; from being persecuted because of his race. In fact the author wrote it because he found that there weren't many books written by African Americans in the public library. The book has a few good points, but it is constructed around the whole racism issue. I know racism is a big issue, but what's done is done. OK we get it, African Americans were treted very badly.

The whole story line is about a teacher named Grant who is assigned to make Jefferson realize he is not a hog. I found the book to be very unentertaining and unexciting; consequently, I felt the book was a waste of time to read. I felt that it was childish for a grown man to think he is a hog because the jury that sentenced him told him this. If he was a man he would know that and he would not need Grant to convince him of this. After killing another man he deserves to be sentenced to life in prison and he also deserves to be killed himself. The book talked about racism to a certain degree. Gaines said that all the events that were going on were occurring because the jury was all white people where Jefferson was a black man. I feel this is false because any human who kills another human does not deserve to live. Also any man who can have his frame of mind changed by one jury telling him something is not a man. This book is stupid and it was a waste of to read it. I would not recommend this book to anyone that I know.At the end of the book Jefferson writes a journal which is one of the last chapters. The journal is written without any form of punctuation and does not have any capitol letters. The chapter is nearly impossible to read and very difficult to understand because nothing is spelled or punctuated correctly. I feel that Gaines probably did this to add the effect of an uneducated man writing the journal; however, it made the book ever harder to read because it needed to be read very slowly to be understood, causing the book to be extremely boring."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"Ugh.

The book is the stoy of how he learns to face that death, and the teacher's accompanying apiritual journey.That said, I hated the book. There is not a good white person or a bad black person in the book. Perhaps that is true of the book's setting, but why are we still playing the victim game 60 years later? Slavery and its aftermath were abominations, but things have changed.

It is about a young uneducated black man, named Jefferson, who has been convicted of robbery and the murder of a white store keeper. He is in turn sentenced to death in the electric chair. Jefferson has a daunting task ahead, to die like a man. Grant Wiggins has been given the seemingly impossible challenge of teaching Jefferson to die with dignity.\\"I was not there, yet I was there. No, I did not go to the trial, I did not hear the verdict, because I knew all the time what it would be...\\" These are the opening lines said by Grant. Although Jefferson is only guilty of being at the wrong place at the wrong time and it is actually his two friends who murder the store keeper, a black man has to be punished for the murder of a white, and Grant knows this.We find out that Grant is a University graduate. He has returned to the community where he grew up to live with his aunt. Grant is the school teacher at the small school for blacks in the church, although he hates teaching. But Miss Emma, Jefferson's godmother, and Tante Lou, Grants aunt ask him of a favor, to teach Jefferson one last lesson before he is executed. \\"Somebody got to do something for me one time \`fore I close my eyes.\\" Miss Emma repeats over and over to Grant and everyone else she needs help from.

I picked up the book because the title grabbed my attention. The actually book is a lot less exciting than the title makes it sound. The first few pages were very interesting but after that it is all down hill.The book begins with a poor black man, Jefferson, being tried for murder. Although he wasn't the one with the gun that killed the poor white store manager, or the one that actually pulled the trigger, he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Jefferson's lawyer knew he was going to be convicted he asked the jury to not give Jefferson the death penalty because he said why would you want to kill a hog? After the lawyer said that comment it upset Jefferson's grandmother so much that she bound and determined to convince Jefferson that he was a man before he died. And who better to do it than, the black school teacher Mr. Grant Wiggins.Although you follow Mr. Wiggins' journey to make Jefferson realize that he is a man, you find yourself reading the same thing over and over. There seems to be no big climax and no surprising ending. Gaines does a good job with description of the town and lets you know how hard it was for a black man in that little southern town. But he doesn't go in-depth with any conflicts or make anything happen that would throw a twist in the story.A Lesson before Dying, was a very disappointing book. I thought that Gaines could have done a better job of making this story interesting but unfortunately he was far from that. I wouldn't recommend this book for a person that enjoys reading a book that has twists and surprises or even a climax."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"&quot;No,I did not go to the trial to hear the verdict,because I knew all the time what it would be...&quot;. The beginning ,yet the end of his trial is veiwed by Grant Wiggins ,the narrator ,as an injustice and unfair judgement. Jefferson, the man accused of commiting the crime, is soon convicted of this crime and is sentenced to death. The last and most meaningful request of Jeffersons family was to ask Grant, who is also a teacher, to teach Jefferson to die like a man. This story has many powerful lessons woven in it. The truth in these lessons can teach a lesson to the reader. Grant &quot;learns&quot; a lesson too which helps him understand that heroism is not always viewed through action.

I think that will always be the phrase that comes to my mind when I think of Gaines's masterpiece, A Lesson before Dying. If you take a close look at it, you will find it is remarkably void of detail and description. Yet it works. It substitutes character and emotion in its place. Don't get me wrong, detail and description play a key role in many, many great novels. However, some of the greatest novels I have ever read (Animal Farm, Of Mice and Men, etc.) do not weigh us down with too many details, but are just simple and wonderful, deep and profound, honest and unflinching. A Lesson before Dying deserves to take its place right next to them. It is one of the greatest reading experiences of my lifetime.The story begins in a courtroom. It is a sad scene. The story takes place, I believe in the early twenties and thirties where racism and segregation were still prevalent. A young black man is on trial for being involved in the murder of a white man at a connivance store. He just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Two of his acquaintances were gunned down and the white man behind the counter also died. He was the only survivor of the incident. Although completely innocent of any wrong doing he must be punished because he was there. He is sentenced to death. Sadly, his own defense attorney calls him a \\"hog\\", an animal that was too stupid to comprehend what he was doing. He uses that defense to try and sway the jury that he is innocent. It doesn't work, and the scar of being labeled a \\"hog\\" will stay with this young black man named Jefferson throughout most of the novel.Next, we are introduced to as educated, prideful, and somewhat mean spirited man named Grant Wiggins. He is a school teacher on a plantation. He hates his job, dislikes his life, and the only joy he has comes from his girlfriend named Vivian. Grant has an aunt, a large and stern woman who is very hard on Grant. I guess you could call it tough love. Grant's aunt is good friends with a woman named Emma. Emma is the caretaker of Jefferson, the black man sentenced to die in the beginning of the novel. Grant's aunt tells him that he must go visit Jefferson in jail and somehow convince him that he is not just some animal. He must convince him to die like a man with dignity.Grant has a negative attitude from the beginning. He doesn't want to go. His aunt has an effect on him, however, and he reluctantly agrees. The first few visits to Jefferson are a disaster. He says nothing. He stares at the ceiling. Emma cries and cries. Grant is just plain pissed off at everything.Grant finds much solitude in drinking and his girlfriend. Through the novel he is always telling her he wants to run away from it all. He just wants to escape with her somewhere. This will serve as a symbol between Grant and Jefferson. Neither one of them has any freedom. Jefferson-physically. Grant---mentally.By and by the visits get a little better, and the relationship between Grant and Jefferson evolves. Grant becomes the teacher, but he learns much about himself through Jefferson. Grant also makes an unlikely friend at the jail. A white guard named Paul. This is important, because I have read by some people that Gaines treats whites unfairly with hostility and bias in his writing. Nothing could be further from the truth. Paul and Grant share the final scene of the book together, and it is one of sublime truth and beauty.There are other characters, such as a Reverend named Ambrose, who has many debates with Grant over religion. Grant has lost his faith long ago. Some of these religious discussions very honest, deep, and thoughtful. There are, of course, other characters and situations that occur. I do not want to take all the joy from experiencing them however. The ending is inevitable, but Gaines shifts writing prose near the end of his novel which makes the messages that shines through even more grand, even more powerful. You'll know what I am talking about when I get there.I can honestly say this book moved me to tears. I know that sounds cheesy but I don't care. Only one other book has ever done that, Uncle Tom's Cabin. This is not a sentimental book by any means. Gaines carefully places his words with wisdom and intelligence. In this book we see real characters and how they evolve. The main character, Grant, is not particularly a likeable man. But he is as real as anyone I have ever read about. His struggles are real, his trials are real. The battle that rages on in Grant is one of the most awesome and realistic depictions of the human soul ever put on paper. The same goes with Jefferson. His journal entries near the end of the novel reach a level that most authors could only dream of attaining. They are some of the most moving passages in all of literature.This is why I love reading, why I love books. It is because there are books out there like this one. It is told with such straightforwardness. It is told with such simplicity. Yet it has such a depth to it that is so hard to find in novels now days. I couldn't believe this was a work of fiction. It seemed too real for that. This will be a book that has a long shelf life ahead of it. There is no way this novel will not become a classic. I used to think that classics weren't written anymore, that they were reserved for another time period long ago. How wrong I was.Grade: A"},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"This book really hit me hard. I grew up in the deep South in the 1960's and witnessed some of the segregation and attitudes that fill this story. But to see only that in this book would be a mistake. There are multiple themes here. Gaines explores the idea that we must sometimes move out of the familiar if we are going to change. The line 'if you stay, you'll become the n***** they believe you to be' is very powerful and applies to all us all at times. As we strive to improve ourselves, to be more than we are, there are forces that strive equally hard to keep us in 'our place'. Often these forces are not as obvious as the bigotry portreyed in this book, but they are as real.There is also a thread of hope sewn into this story. Hope of change, growth and improvement.

Grant, a college graduate, and has returned to be a teacher. Jefferson, locked up and sentenced to die, is a hopeless young man with no future. But society has cast the same burden of racism upon the two young African-American men that makes them equals in the eyes of the White beaurocracy. Grant reluctantly agrees to spend time with Jefferson throughout the trial period at the request of Jefferson's grandmother, who wants only that her grandson die with dignity and pride. She is convinced that Grant, as an educated black man, can teach Jefferson the lessons he needs to be \\"a man\\" before he is executed. Throughout, Grant struggles with his own unwillingness, with racism, and with his own emotions, and in the end finds that he learned the real lessons. Although at its root a tale about racism, the story transcends racism and distills the idea that the best lessons in life are not always the easiest ones to learn.

What happened to Jefferson happens all too often, even after all these years, and that, I find, is truly unfortunate."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"A young man is wrongly accused of multiple murders and sentenced to die in the 1940's. His nannan requests that the teacher of the town, Grant Wiggins, visit him weekly in his cell and &quot;make a man out of him&quot; before he dies. When the defense declares him dumb as a hog in reference to his being unable to plot such a murder, Miss Emma, Jefferson's nannan, is mortified and wants to prove the white man wrong about her boy. Grant is reluctant to get involved in a situation for which he has no patience. Although he teaches his own students well enough, he is harsh and without any patience with them. The last thing he feels he needs is another problem child. His girlfriend and aunt, however, soon have him convinced that this is something he can do for Miss Emma that will mean enough to her that he should be able to overcome his reservations. Although slow in the beginning, it does pick up and become more interesting. It has a lot of themes about prejudice and cruelty, issues that are just as relevant in the year 2001 as they were sixty years ago. It is for this reason that I would recommend it as a good option. Don't expect to waiting on the edge of your seat, though. It's not meant to be suspenseful."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"This compelling novel written by a wonderful author, Ernest Gaines, changed my perspective on the world as I once viewed it. Life was very uneasy for the African Americans back during the time in which this book was to be taken place, and I feel that Gaines emphasizes that point as he displays the story of an innocent black man on death row for a crime that he did not take any part in. Jefferson, the man being charged for the murders of a storekeeper named Mr. Grope and Jefferson's two friends &quot;Bear&quot; and &quot;Brother&quot;, was not only going to be sent to his early death for a crime that he didn't committ, but he was about to walk to the electric chair thinking that he was nothing but a &quot;hog.&quot; Luckily he had a very loving godmother named Miss Emma who convinced an educated black schoolteacher by the name of Grant Wiggins to visit Jefferson until the day of his death and teach him to die like a man, not a hog. Although Grant Wiggins was one of the lucky victims of racism who got a high education, he hated his career, for he felt that his race would not amount to their fullest potential if the world continued to treat people with so much disrespect for living. He formed a close bond with Jefferson, but most importantly, he was able to serve his purpose: He taught Jefferson that a man must walk confidently toward his death knowing that he is a man and nothing less. This novel inspired me to believe that everyone must stive to their fullest potential and hold their head up high despite the riticuole that others might give out to them.

Gaines' novel, A Lesson Before Dying exhibits a young man's transformation from believing he crawls like a hog, to believing he walks like a man. Gaines uses local color and his study of Creoles to bring the novel to life. I absolutely love this book, because it shows representation of honor and heroism in two black men, Grant Wiggins and Jefferson, in their lives in Louisiana. Grant lives metaphorically through Jefferson's imprisonment from a conviction of murder which he did not commit, and the two men struggle together to defy the unexpected and become heroes of the town. Gaines creates a hopeful tone through the novel, and he emphasizes the motif of quiet heroism to prove that faith will keep a man strong so that he may find his dignity. Gaines establishes a hopeful tone through similies, references to southern black Christianity, and motifs. The novel begins comparing his godmother to a &quot;great stone&quot; which represents the stable black women as support for the men. Miss Emma serves the purpose of keeping the hope alive for the young men and trying to instill faith in both of them. As Grant's aunt tries to her religion on him, he only thinks, &quot;I didn't believe anymore and I didn't want her to try forcing it on me.&quot; His aunt never gives up, because the only way Jefferson will learn the faith is through Grant. this task seems impossible to Grant, because he knows that he cannot make a man pray if he does not pray himself. Grant needstrength, and Revernd Ambrose tries to convince him to ask God. He in forms Grant that, &quot;you would have the strength if you had God.&quot; The novel works its way to gaines' motif of inevitable change by Grant's visits and teaching sessions to Jefferson. The change has to face the status quo and thoughts of others, including the sheriff who thinks, &quot;Nobody can make that thing a man. Saying might as well let him go like his is.&quot; Jefferson's change from a hog to a man is compared to a butterfly and its metamorphosis. Grant wonders if there ever was a change in Jefferson, and Paul convinces him by letting him know that, &quot;I saw the transformation. I'm a witness to that.&quot; Everyones hope helps the men in their battle against the status quo. Gaines produces a motif of quiet heroism from symbolism and references to heroes. Jackie Robinson is a hero of the times and Miss Emma presses Jefferson to be like him in that he stands like a man to become a hero. Jefferson's heroism also compares to Crist. Grant's classroom has a picture of The Last Supper which compares to Jefferson's last meal before the execution. Another picture is of Christ knocking on a door, and it represents Jefferson knocking on the door of hope and faith.Jefferson cannot be executed during Lent, because the town will not allow it. Grant remembers, &quot;because of our state's heavily Catholic population, it might not go well to have two executions just before the beginning of Lent.&quot; Jefferson is scheduled to die between the hours of noon and three which is the time of Christ's crucifix. The town knows that a man can be humiliated and still stand from Jefferson's example. The two men learn from each other, and come to possess the quality of quiet heroism. A Lesson Before Dying is a lesson to everyone to follow their heart and always keep hope. Having hope in life and focusing on goal can make anyone a hero. This novel is a reminder that one should never lose hope, because a struggle for one man can be seen as a great victory and savior for many others. I really enjoy this novel, because it teaches valuable life lessons!"},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"I first got to know about this book, when the author was on television in Oprah Winfreys TV-show.

His godmother, Miss Emma, wants Jefferson to die with dignity. She than turns to Grant Wiggins, a black teacher at the local plantation school, and asks him to teach Jefferson to be a man. Grant's pretty much convinced he could do nothing but agrees to visit Jefferson in jail. Grant later on teaches Jefferson to regain dignity and reconnect with their community. Friends, family, and the black community try everything possible to save this innocent man's life and convince this wasn't his doing. As the story goes through a whole time order of events and trial's, the reader is able to tell that Jefferson gets stronger and stronger and is more ready for what has to come. He's ready to experience &quot;the importance of standing&quot; and be a man. This is a very powerful noval. It shows how the African American community had to suffer just to get justice and respect, and still today, have to put up with many of the same things their ancestors had to go through.

This is one of those books which you are continuously on the edge of your seat unable to lay the book down for a moments rest. It demonstrates the racism and segregation that took place in the 1940s, almost 75 years after the end of the Civil War.Gaines writes an emotionally powerful novel about a young, black man whom happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time which cost him his life. In an unfair trial, a jury of all white men convict Jefferson of being guilty for murder and sentence him to the electric chair. However, if that wasn't bad enough he is also called a hog during the trial in front of everyone he knew. In order to help him for the last time Jefferson's godmother and Grant's aunt quickly look to Grant, a local school teacher, to help teach Jefferson how to be a man.After debating and talking to others about the positives and negatives of his decision he choosing to go along with their wishes.

Her god son, Jefferson, is not well mannered and she wants Jefferson to die with a purpose for himself. She wants Grant, a really emotional person, to teach Jefferson how to be dignified. Throughout the novel we are constantly guessing what Grant's actual emotional state is. He is doing fine one minute, then another minute he is thinking about something bad and his worst character traits surface. He has a married girlfriend, he can't leave the neighborhood he so desperately wants to, and he lives in a era where it is bad to be African American.

Gaines is a story about introspection and self awakening with overtones of racism and injustice. Set in a small southern community, a young black man named Jefferson is wrongfully accused of murder and sentenced to death by an all white jury. The local school teacher, Grant Wiggins, is sent to teach Jefferson to die like a man, with honor. While at first reluctant, Grant realizes that he is in some ways similiar to Jefferson. Jefferson is improsoned by four walls and prison guards while Grant is improsoned by his job and the society he lives in. Throughout the process of teaching Jefferson, Grant learns more about himself. The two men teach each other that being heroic does not always involve taking action, sometimes a heroic deed is doing nothing at all in defiance. I liked this book because it taught a good lesson and was emotionally heavy. I did not like the style of this novel because it moved too slowly and became too drawn out.The characters of \\"A Lesson Before Dying\\" are very interesting. The author evolves the characters by showing different sides to each of them, creating complex and intriguing characters. Grant Wiggins is introduced as a calm and gentle school teacher, but he also has thoughts of hate, annoyance, love and compassion making him a multidimensional person and not just a flat character. I liked the idea that heroes can come in many forms. A heroic action can be done by anyone.This novel moved and progressed slowly. It seemed to be building up to a apectacular, climactic finale which never came. In the middle of the story it seemed as if the author lost track of his direction. He seemed to lose all dramatic effect as the reader forgot that Jefferson was sentenced to die.Overall, I liked \\"A Lesson Before Dying\\" but I would have enjoyed it more had it moved faster.

In his description, Gaines drops the ever-present racial \\"titles\\" and instead describes the people...as people. I for one found this message to be quite powerful; due to the cruciality of its being there. By giving the description of an all-black, racially discriminated community gathering and doing the basic joys in life that make us human, Gaines, one of countless times, confronts the negative stereotypes that are still all too present in our current society.The message projected from Gaines, though written as a witness to more ignorant times, can and should be used to help us with the fallacies in thought many of us are still quite capable of having. Though not the only example of the deservance of human equality expressed in the novel, the warm description of the Christmas play (minus the looming fate of Jefferson) and the gathering of what ultimately are just people, spreads quite clearly the message that since no one group of people are able to enjoy life more than another, no one group should have the right to enjoy life more than another. To be put more clearly, no particular type of man is more deserving of happiness than another.I believe this message, though written in the confrontation of racism, far transcends the purpose for which it seems to have been created. By expressing the message so justly, Gaines has seemingly created a personal standard for man kind in its entirety. Its almost as though Gaines is saying, that despite race, wealth, or nationality, no one group is more deserving of happiness than another. This is a powerful message. One could almost call it, \\"universal.\\""},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"I had not been reading like, I use to do in my younger years.

A simple reading on Wikipedia shows the parallels.A mentally challenged boy, Jefferson, is the victim in this novel. Bullied to accompany other hooligans into a store, the endeavor becomes a ruckus and a shooting ensues. The bad boys who requested the innocent's company, and the store owner, die. Because the boy was in the wrong place at the wrong time, and not altogether thinking about what to do when the bodies lay prostrate on the cold floor, a trial before a white judge, before a white jury, led tot he unsurprising result - the death penalty.It is at this point that the boy's grandmother does the great deed - she tells her best friend to tell her nephew to teach the boy. So Grant Wiggins, who owes everything to his aunt, begrudgingly abides by the women's request, and goes to the jail on routine basis to see if he can make the innocent Jefferson become a man.What passes over the pages is great literature. At first, Grant and Jefferson have stilted, if any, conversation. Thereafter, the walls between them subside and each learns from the other. Cleverly, the witnesses from the outside, the readers, grow as well.Although you know that the young man will never receive a pardon, although you know Jefferson will inevitably warm up to Grant, and although the many of the reactions by the whites who witness the relationship between Grant and Jefferson are predictable, this is a great novel. This is writing by someone who knows the art. Do not rely on this objective perspective alone - A Lesson Before Dying won the National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction.Etched in the novel's seemingly simple story are great philosophical proclamations. Sometimes sneaky, often seemingly dicta to the novel's core, they scoot by the skimming reader. But, don't miss these pearls of wisdom. Here is one example.\\"We black men have failed to protect our women since the time of slavery. We stay here in the South and are broken, or we run away and leave them alone to look after the children and themselves. So each time a male child is born, they hope he will be the one to change this vicious circle - which he never does. Because even though he wants to change it, and maybe even tries to change it, it is too heavy a burden because of all the others who have run away and left their burdens behind. So he, too, must run away if he is to hold onto his sanity and have a life of his own.\\"I had never read works by Mr. Gaines before.

Gaines has a powerful ethical and moral palette with which to create great fiction. It seems as though the subject matter of race and injustice was a treasure trove of literary wealth that was Gaines' birthright as a writer. A Lesson Before Dying, like A Gathering of Old Men, the only other novel of his that I have read thus far, has a powder keg premise. An innocent bystander to a liquor store robbery that resulted in the murder of a white man is sentenced to death, even after his defense attorney argued for clemency on the equation of Jefferson, the accused, with a hog. His godmother, a friend of the aunt of the schoolteacher narrator, Grant Wiggins, wants Grant to use his teaching skills to impart one final, important lesson to Jefferson: to convince him that he is a man, not a hog, and that he can walk to his death as a man.Grant has rebelled against his upbringing for many years and yet he has not left the parish, still living with his aunt and still teaching in the parish church's school. After a couple of disastrous visits in which he witnesses Jefferson method acting the part of a hog, Grant is convinced that the task his aunt has assigned him is a useless, foolish and, ultimately futile task. Yet he continues to see the accused. He lacks the will to follow the advice of the bitter mentor of his youth and really leave the parish and this life behind if he really wants his own life to change. He yields to the pressure of his aunt, her friend Miss Emma and the old preacher, Reverend Ambrose. Exerting an even stronger pull is his love for Vivian, his future wife, if she can obtain a divorce from her current husband.For a variety of reasons, Grant continues to see Jefferson. He finally breaks through the barriers and feels he can communicate with Jefferson. He gets permission from the sheriff to give him a radio. He gives him a journal and tells him to write whatever comes to mind. He sees Jefferson begin to become a man who realizes his own self-worth. The power of this dramatic transformation seemed to me to be undercut by the stereotypical characters of the aunt and the reverend. Perhaps my difficulty lay in my lack of understanding of this culture and this world: African Americans in a parish in Louisiana in the late 1940's. These characters resembled dozens of characters that have walked through scenes in films and pages of novels and I felt, like Grant, a desire to break off from their authority. Grant is the first person narrator and, while he is extremely selfish, I felt some of that selfishness to be justified. He is smothering under the weight of the social oppression and the expectations of his elders in how he should behave in this society.When I first began to read the novel, I thought the bulk of it would focus on a tentative friendship that builds into an enduring bond between Grant and Jefferson, following the story arc of many a heartwarming film. Gaines confounds those expectations by staying securely within Grant's mind. The lesson is for Grant as much as it is for Jefferson. As Jefferson learns to die as a man, Grant is given all the lessons from the experience necessary to live as a man. His ambivalence never leaves him, even up to the end of the novel. However, just as Jefferson's shell cracked open and he walked to his execution (a scene wisely left undramatized), Grant's shell begins to crack. As he says after explaining to Jefferson what a hero is, \\"I cry not from reaching any conclusion by reasoning, but because, lowly as I am, I am still part of the whole\\" and he cries again at the end as he returns to his students."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"I was 11 when I read this novel, and even then it completely touched me.

I held off reading it until I saw the movie version on HBO. The characters of Jefferson and Grant were almost mirror images of each other. Where one was ignorant, the other was smart. Where one was brave, the one was weak. They needed each other. The Lesson Before Dying could apply to the 2 of them. Each had a lesson to learn and it had to happen before the execution.

A memorable analogy that Grant describes to Jefferson involves that of an old piece of wood turned into a slingshot by a whittler; Jefferson needs to be that old piece of wood and become something new. Of course, sometimes we are all that piece of wood and in order to become the slingshot, we have to decide on our own to do it."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"A Lesson Before Dying, written by Ernest J. Gaines, is a good book, that is very touching. The character, Grant Wiggins, who is the local schoolteacher, struggles with the concept of helping the man, Jefferson, who is convicted of a murder he did not commit. Jefferson's godmother wants Grant to help Jefferson become a man before he dies, but Jefferson is not very willing to listen to Grant. Grant is also not very eager to help. It is a very emotional story of the end of a life, before it is taken by the electric chair.The beginning chapters were a very good lead into the rest of the book. It was easy to understand the plot. The author easily conveyed the importance of the man, Jefferson, learning a lesson before he dies. Unlike other books, which have a slow pace to them and fail to keep the interest of most, A Lesson Before Dying is very fast paced. It makes the reader want to read it from the beginning to the end without stopping. The chapters are short, so if the reader does needs to put it down here are frequent stopping places. The length of the chapters makes the book more enjoyable. It does not seem like it takes so long to get to the end of the chapter. It also does not keep dragging on about the same thing over and over. It introduces new characters to liven up the story when the old characters seem to be getting boring. The best chapter, and the one that most touches the heart, is the chapter from Jefferson's diary. It really gives insight into how Jefferson is feeling. The diary completes the story line of the book. It was very wise of the author to include this chapter. Without it he would not have evoked the same feelings from the reader at the end.Anyone who enjoys reading sentimental books, but does not enjoy the mushy, romantic kind, would really love this book."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"Point blank, this book is excellent. The story will remain within you long after you finish reading it.In A Lesson Before Dying, a young man named Jefferson is sentenced to death for a crime that he did not committ.

She enlists the services of Grant Wiggins, the local black teacher to try and get Jefferson to learn that he is a man and that he has to set the record straight.The transformation is not an easy one, but in his meetings with Jefferson, Grant teaches himself as well as the reader a remarkable life story. The journey is completed when we read the wonderful summary by Jefferson at the end.All of the characters in the novel are so richly developed, and they intermingle extremely well with each other. Ernest Gaines uses such a wonderfully subtle language that places the reader right into Louisiana as a part of the story, which makes for a very entertaining read.This is such a complete, well-written book with so many positive messages.

It's heros and heroines are real people with real problems. Rarely do we ever get to experience the trials and tribulations of the teacher.

What makes this novel so realistic is Grant's hatred towards the prospect of having to teach Jefferson and Jefferson's cowardice and confusion in the beginning of the novel. Imagry and symbolism in this book are so artisticly that the novel becomes very true to life. I could not put this book down when I read it, and I plan to read more of Gaines' work.

Gaines. I really enjoyed it because it gave me new opinions aboutdiscrimination, injustice, pride, dignity, and the death penalty. I read this book for my eighth grade English class; my class was assigned an independent reading project that relates to our studies of To Kill a Mockingbird, by Harper Lee. A Lesson Before Dying and To Kill a Mockingbird both take place in small segregated towns, in which a young black man is convicted of a crime and sentenced to death. Although the two books have similar plots, the books have different themes and viewpoints. A Lesson Before Dying is narrated by a young, black, educated man named Grant; To Kill a Mockingbird is narrated by a white girl in her youth named Scout. Since the two narrators are of different ages and different races, the viewpoints of each book are dissimilar. Grant is older, more educated, and more experienced than Scout; but moreover, Grant is black and Scout is white. This causes them to have varying thoughts and opinions. Their ideas about how society will attempt to abolish racism differ. In To Kill a Mockingbird, Scout shows that she and her family really want to change the way racism plays a huge role in their town. They want to free Tom Robinson, the black defendant, and allow him to live a fair life; they want to do away with all existence of racism. In A Lesson Before Dying, Grant is sent to Jefferson's jail cell to teach him one lesson: to die simply like a man. \\"I want you-- yes, you-- to call them Liars. I want you to show when that you are as much a man-- more a man then they can ever be. That jury? You call them men? That judge? Is he a man? The governor is no better. They play by the rules their forefathers created hundreds of years ago. Their forefathers said that we're only three-fifths human-- and they believe it to this day.\\" All that Grant asked of Jefferson was that he stand up to their authority, the white people, before sitting in the electric chair. Grant believed that this little act would help change the discrimination that existed. This comparison shows that white people are more optimistic that drastic change could happen; they have the authority and can do something to change, but only if they want to. But black people can only see little, if any, change happen; hampered by hundreds of years of trying for change, they have sort of given up, and hope only for little things. It was very interesting to me to find two different perspectives on how discrimination would change. From both books I gained insight into life in small, southern, and segregated towns during the Great Depression. I highly recommend both books: To Kill a Mockingbird simply because it is an enjoyable well-written classic, and A Lesson Before Dying because it is has a depressing, but truthful plot and a touching end which will not only teach Jefferson a lesson before dying, but the reader as well."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"When I heard my humanities teacher tell the class on the first day we had to read A Lesson Before Dying I panicked. I hate to read. Throughout high school I always bought Spark Notes hoping they would help me pass a test on a book I decided not to read. Now being that I am a responsible college student I opened the book and started reading. After the first couple chapters I contemplated if I should finish reading this book or go back to my old self and get Spark Notes. For some reason I just kept with it and finish the book. Once I got in to it I found myself having trouble putting the book down. This book hooks the reader never letting them put it down until they have finished it. Ernest J. Gaines is a genius. This book gives us as readers a view of how it was to be a black man in the United States during the time of segregation. It's set in the south where segregation seemed a bigger issue than up north. Jefferson a young black male is accused of killing a white male and sentenced to death. Grant Wiggins, a schoolteacher, meets with Jefferson hoping to make him die a man and not a hog as most whites see him. The book journeys through all of Grants encounters with Jefferson.

This book was very intresting. I could not believe that one man could be charged with murder with no proof. Everyone played a good role in the book. I feel that this novel was explaining the ways of the old south. It expressed the racism that went on between black and whites. Racism is still expressed today. If I was Jefferson I would feel intimdated, sad, alone, and very angry.

For a young man to be classified as a hog, and shown no respect is a prime example of the ruthlessness. Jefferson did not have a fair trail. What ever happened to the United States law that states every man is innocent until proven guilty. The outstanding prejudice of the small Cajun town send a man who was not rightfully trailed to death. Who made us God, and how are they to try and do Gods' work. Prejudice is a bad discrimination among people that not only hurt others, but hurt ourselves. Prejudice divides communities, teaches children to hate, and weakens the economy. Ernest Gaines shows us through the townspeople that prejudice just makes things worst. Jefferson was not killed by his actions, but by the prejudice of the people."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"\\"A Lesson before Dying\\" is a powerful novel which confronts racism as well as many other social issues. Although the novel is enjoyable at face value, it also allows for an abundance of individual interpretation of the text. I feel one of the most significant symbols in the novel is the friendship between Grant and Paul. Grant, a pessimistic African American school teacher is the frustrated protagonist. While Paul, a white guard at the local jail, is a young man who comes from \\"good stock\\". Although not a large character in the book, Paul is a key representation of one of the many underlying messages in the text.I personally interpreted the friendship between Grant and Paul as a sign of change. That, in time, everything changes and Grant's pessimistic feelings should change as well. Paul signifies a new generation, one that is far from the previous generations of narrow minded southerners. Grant feels that things will never change, that as long as he is in the south he will be caught in a latent society. Paul is evidence that the age of bigotry is declining. Their friendship foreshadows the progression of relations between the races in the future. Paul is the symbol of hope for the future, and a vision of equality among all men."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"In A Lesson Before Dying, the central theme was racism and its effects on each the characters. Obviously, the character most affected by racism was Jefferson. Grant was also affected even though he considered himself on the same intellectual level as the whites in his community. Despite his education and manners, he is still forced to feel inferior to the white characters in the novel. This causes a great deal of resentment and affects his actions and beliefs. The theme of hypocrisy is present throughout the novel and is caused by racism and its effects.The first example hypocrisy we are introduced to is the \\"fair\\" justice system of the 1940's. How can it be fair if there is a black man on trail for murder against twelve white jury members? His judge, the jury, his lawyer, and even the man who set his date for execution were white. His lawyer was perhaps the most hypocritical of them all. While he should've been saving Jefferson, he incidentally sealed his fate by saying that he was not \\"capable of planning a robbery or murder.\\" He then reduced him to the level of a hog, insinuating that he has no brain or soul. Because of white man's firm belief in superiority, there was no way Jefferson could come out of the trial innocent. The fair justice system was by no means fair, controlled only by the white man and neglecting other races.However, the white men weren't the only hypocrites. The mulattos were also racist and hypocritical. Grant encountered this many times throughout the novel. His former teacher, Matthew Antoine, was mulatto and showed hypocrisy by saying that he was \\"superior to any man blacker\\" than he was. Yet he was complaining about how whites were so racist towards everyone else. How could he expect better behavior from others when he himself was the same? There were many other examples of how the mulattos thought they were superior to blacks. Not only were the mulattos hypocritical, there are examples of black hypocrites also.The narrator, Grant Wiggins, showed hypocrisy also by wanting to leave Bayonne and everyone in it. He was an educated man and wanted to be respected by everyone. He felt he was as smart as the white man and definitely smarter than the blacks that worked in the fields. He saw himself on another level as them and wanted to be treated that way. In turn, he ends up looking down upon his own race and thinks that he is superior to them. He also says over and over that he wants to leave Bayonne and see what the rest of the world has to offer. He left once but then returned, and never left again. He is torn between what he is and what he thinks he should become. He continues to maintain his arrogant nature in order to feel superior, because he knows that he will never get the respect that he thinks he deserves.Hypocrisy rooted in racism was present throughout the novel. Those behaviors were not exclusive to one race of people; the whites, mulattos, and blacks all experienced it. This just shows how alike humans are and that racism is an empty belief. They were all fighting the same battles and were too blinded by their beliefs to see it. Everyone in the novel had insecurities and used racism as a way to shield it."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"A Lesson Before Dying was more like a given chance to see how court cases were handled back in the freedom world. I think that this book clearly gives an overview of how difficult it was to prove an innoncent person guilty. Jefferson was wrongly accused of killing someone that he didn't even know of. Because of Jefferson's skin color, he could have been charged with all the charges that man could think of. This part in the book shows the reader how racism was implemented back in the days. Gaines really made the reader have sympatation for Jefferson because he was about to be put to death for something that he didn't even do. Even though Jefferson was given all the help from man, I think that he wasn't helped fairly enough, but you can't implement today's society to the past. The book might have had some parts that i found very disliking but overall it I think that A Lesson Before Dying Should be read by all individuals because it is an impressing novel.

At first Jefferson just stared at his plate and would not eat, because he was depressed. This made his nannan very sad.

He has his work cut out for him in trying to transform this simple young man, who is understandably upset at his defense attorney's choice of words during closing arguments (he describes him as being less than human, going so far as to compare him to a hog) and holds on to that feeling in disregarding the efforts of the visitors to his jail cell. Jefferson is guilty of little more than being a black man in the wrong place at the wrong time in the wrong era in American history, and, in the confusion of criminal circumstances, making a foolish, and ultimately fatal, decision.Over a period of about six months, Wiggins helps change Jefferson, local persons both black and white, and, unintentionally, himself for the better due to his efforts on behalf of the condemned man. A Lesson Before Dying, a book about capital punishment and the ruinousness of racial injustice, is a better book than Helen Prejean's Dead Man Walking (which I read just prior to this one). Also good: To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee and Tobacco Road by Erskine Caldwell."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"This book is often compared with To Kill A Mockingbird. They both deliver lessons of the inherent injustice of racially defined societal hierarchies. The insecure obtuse nature of whites makes life a discouraging grind for blacks. This book delivers that message well. It also makes another point clear. Young black men with potential face a choice of staying local in a certain futility of trying to make a positive change or they escape and abandon their friends and family to another generation of discouragement. The point of the book is clear but that clarity is so direct that the book is rendered somewhat dull. Harper Lee delivers similar messages with the type of irony and lovable characters that are the artistic means of great story telling. Ernest J. Gaines delivers this story with a blunt hammer, hence my assessment of 'Important but dull'."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"The older and, one hopes, wiser I grow, the more I admire and respect simplicity. Simplicity is not simple. Simplicity means clean lines, all that is unnecessary pared away. Simplicity means choosing that one golden word where ten would only confuse the issue. And, that one word can be clear and true.Ernest J. Gaines is a master of simplicity. A Lesson Before Dying is clean and clear writing, descriptions that say just enough to evoke an entire scene with all senses engaged, all heart and mind present. His dialogue is bare bone, sparse as the dialogue I so admired as a young writer-in-training, enthralled with that other Ernest--Papa Hemingway, and his unique way of capturing the way that people actually speak rather than the stilted narrative voice of the author him or herself.\\"It don't matter,\\" I heard him say. He was looking up at the ceiling.\\"What don't matter?\\"He didn't answer.\\"What don't matter, Jefferson?\\"\\"Nothing don't matter,\\" he said, looking up at the ceiling but not seeing the ceiling.\\"It matter to me, Jefferson,\\" she said. \\"You matter to me.\\"He looked up at the ceiling, not seeing it.\\"Jefferson?\\"\\"Chicken, dirt, it don't matter,\\" he said.\\"Yeah, it do, Jefferson. Yeah, it do. Dirt?\\"\\"All the same,\\" he said. \\"It don't matter.\\" (Page 73)Ah yes, there is that mastery, like a reincarnation of Hemingway, with an artist's understanding of the way that life moves--not in straight lines, but in circles, ever circling on the same spot, trying out its parameters until it is known, only then shifting to the next circle, a slight distance this way, or that, or even back again. I admire this accuracy portrayed in the written word. The novel becomes life.The life portrayed in this novel is based on two main characters, set in 1940s Louisiana, the deep south, when racism and segregation ran deep, and a black man was imprisoned just for being in the wrong place at the wrong time, innocent that he might be. Jefferson is a simple-minded man who inadvertently ends up in the middle of an armed robbery, and although he has done nothing wrong, is sentenced to die by a legal system that has nothing to do with justice but everything to do with enforcing the status quo. Grant Wiggins seems, at first, Jefferson's opposite--a black man who is educated and intelligent, a teacher at a church school. Both men, however, live in a prison, even as only one of those has tangible bars.When Jefferson is called \\"same as a hog\\" by his own defense attorney, likening him to a dumb animal in the hopes that the jury will deem him innocent out of sheer lack of enough intelligence to commit a crime, his aunt, Grant's grandmother, can accept the final verdict of death, but not the image of her nephew dying like an animal. She calls in a favor from Grant, who reluctantly agrees to visit Jefferson in prison and teach him to die like a man.If this injustice, the death sentence of an innocent man, cannot be changed in a deeply racist society, then one's attitude about it can be. Jefferson bitterly accepts being called a hog--\\"it don't matter\\"--but the story unfolds in those gorgeously clean lines with the meetings between the two men, some of which are nothing more than sitting together in a prison cell for an hour and staring at the ceiling. There are no lectures, no fist-pounding diatribes, no soapbox rantings to vaguely disguise the views of the author in need of getting something off his chest. There is just this fly-on-the-wall observation of two men sharing space, different yet same, both locked into place, both suppressed by their life sentences to a destiny neither deserves but inflicted upon them because of their race.So how does a man become a man? What differentiates a man from a dumb animal? Our teachers are not always those with the highest intelligence quotient. Our leaders are sometimes those who are silent, but walk to their destiny, however unfair, with clean conscience and straight spine. Whatever is done to a man matters little. What a man does to himself, and how he handles the circumstances of his life, is all that matters. Live or die, a man does so with honor. Just or unjust, a man answers to himself if he has lived with integrity. If he has, he can walk through any trial, toward any fate, with his head held high.Edward J. Gaines was born on a plantation in Louisiana, where he is now writer-in-residence at the University of Southwestern Louisiana. Previous books include The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman, A Gathering of Old Men, and several others.~Zinta Aistars for The Smoking Poet"},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"\\"A Lesson before Dying,\\" by Ernest J. Gaines, paints the picture of a young African-American man in the late 1940's in the racially segregated Cajun community of Louisiana, who is wrongly convicted of killing three men. When Jefferson is convicted, his lawyer, in an attempt to salvage him from a awful fate, compares him to a dumb hog, an animal that does not make any real decisions or plans, and says he is simply a \\"fool\\" (Gaines 7). Sadly all this insult is to no avail and Jefferson is sentenced to death by electrocution, with just a few months to contemplate his life as a dirty \\"hog\\" (Gaines 8) in his hollow cell. The book is a narrative of this time.After his conviction, Jefferson's godmother Miss Emma becomes determined to help him leave life as a man, and head straight to heaven. She arranges Grant Wiggins, a local university graduate and current teacher, to teach him, unwilling as he is, how to be a man and end up heaven. Their story, of teacher and student, leads through Grant's teachings of being rational and believing in oneself. They both end up learning about life, death and the meaning of being a good person.Although there is defiance on Grant's part and fright on Jefferson's, they both come to their senses by emotionally feeding each other. Grant, although well educated, is lost despite his word of the contrary. He is against the snooty people of the upper white class, yet shows to the people around him that he is well educated and not to be forgotten about. He is immovably in love with Vivienne, a mother and in the process-divorcee, and stuck in the job he dislikes, but never moves across to the other side of greener grass. He only grudgingly consents to help Jefferson and all visits are tainted with silent resentment. After helping with this sad case of death on the horizon Grant is brought down to eye level and made to think about his flaws, and to break out of the sad rut he is stuck in. Jefferson on the other hand is blatantly lost, he's young, broke, and foolish. His musings are those of a \\"hog\\" (Gaines 1) who can't think for itself, but it doesn't matter he'd die soon enough. Broken down by the critical opinions of those who shut him in a cell and left to reflect the last months of life as a hog he gains courage from Grant's outward certainty.I am against the death penalty, thus this story resonates with me. I think the death penalty is a conflicting idea of ensuring justice, yet Gaines attacks the challenging task of displaying the grief sufficiently. The way Ernest J. Gaines poetically infuses the story with Grant's and Jefferson's internalized hate is invigorating. He stealthily hides simple phrases that make the reader feel as though you sit watching this tale unfold. Quick snip-its of the feeling and meaning of a split second are caught on paper. Gaines tells the experience of the trial from Grant's point of view, \\"I was not there, yet I was there. No, I did not go to the trial, I did not hear the verdict, because I knew all the time what it would be\\" (Gaines 1).Although there is the common theme of overbearing cliches: the African-American man suffering for the crimes he hasn't committed, finding yourself from the lessons of others, and the inevitable fate nonchalantly ignored by the apathetic characters, Gaines pulls them off with a unique twist. The dialogue at the beginning of the book is a bit vapid with nothing crunchy to snack on, yet only towards the end, the story entails a juicy sauntering of pain and emotion. The way Gaines describes the moment when Grant is sitting, staring at a hill of bull grass when he knows that Jefferson has past, is luminous, \\"I probably would not have noticed it all had a butterfly, a yellow butterfly with dark specks...not lit there. There was no odor that I could detect to have attracted it...I watched it closely, the way it opened its wings and closed them...then flew away. I watched it fly down the ditch and over the quarter, I watched it until I could not see it anymore. Yes, I told myself. It is finally over\\" (Gaines 251, 252). From this he evokes a strong willed unconscionable grief within this simple and delicate imagery. Although the beginning is a bit dull, the ending is strong and poetic with the message of appreciating life and grasping tight to the will and courage we attain, that makes this book a strong message to the lost at heart."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"It's suprising the things that humans can do. In Ernest Haine's novel \\"A Lesson Before Dying\\", told beautifully with the lyricism and poetry of a true artist, we are haunted by reality, death, racism, and the never-ending struggle between finding God and finding ourselves in the process. Mr. Wiggins, the teacher of reading, writing and arithmetic, helps Jefferson find the strength within himself to face the electric chair and in the process learns a little more about the world then he expected. Discover, in these pages, the lessons people can learn before dying."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"Having read this very moving book, my immediate reaction was that I simply wanted to discuss the book with other readers. As a number of the other reviewers have given good synopses, I'll just comment on a few aspects. Gaines often notes whether people are looking at each other face-to-face or whether they are looking away (at the floor, at the ceiling, etc.). Looking someone in the eye --especially with such painful experiences being very front-of-mind-- is not so easy. Later, Jefferson is able to look people in the face as is the narrator, Wiggins. The exchanges between Paul, a jail deputy, and Jefferson & with Wiggins are both very touching. They're all human, or \\"youman\\" as Jefferson would say, & in the end they all share a love for one another. Another great section of narrative occurs all over town on the day of Jefferson's execution. Citizens, white & black, are all upset and very ill at ease concerning the matter. There doesn't seem to be any sentiment that a cold-blooded murderer is finally being put away, but rather that a great, senseless tragedy is underway and no one is willing or able to stop it.From the description of the crime, it seems clear that Jefferson was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. It seems implausible that Jefferson could be guilty of murdering Mr. Grop&eacute;. Yet, Jefferson never proclaims his innocence either in his discussions with Wiggins & other visitors or in his own diary notes. No one raises the issue -- perhaps because it wouldn't matter anyway. Another thing is that Jefferson was charged only with murdering Mr. Grop&eacute;. Brother & Bear, the two black liquor store robbers who died in the shoot-out, well, I guess no one cared who might have killed them.Probably the main reason I haven't given the book five stars is that I found the final statement by Jefferson's defense attorney to be very weak and not believable. His idea seems to have been that Jefferson was no brighter than a hog, & the state of Louisiana does not execute animals. Of course, farmers butcher hogs routinely, & if anything, I thought it almost made it easier for the jury to return or recommend a death sentence. Still a great read!"},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"&quot;A Lesson Before Dying&quot; is a well written novel that shows the Black American struggle for social justice and recognition. The novel portrays how African Americans have managed to overcome nagative stereotypes they have been subject of through out the history of this nation. At the same time, the novel shows how by overcoming those negative stereotypes African Americans allows the rest of the society to see that they are no better than the rest of them but at the same time they are no less. A lesson of self respect and a positive attitude toward the essence of life is hidden within the work of Gaines. Such a valuable lesson should be read by any one searching for their hidden identity as well as any one oppressed by any established stereotype and looking for spiritual freedom. With no doubt, &quot;A Lesson Before Dying&quot; embroils a lesson that overcomes any racial or ethnic barrier and should become part of the literature curriculum in high schools across ! the nation so that our youth can relate to this experience."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"Although the novel never bored me, it didn't move me with great force either.

We have analyzed it in every way imaginable via class discussion, lesson plans, reflections, and a class listserv but the thing that stands out the most is the sincerity and humble beauty the author captures in high character Jefferson. Grant was living a dry and unmotivated life. It took the freedom of literacy from a man with shackles on his hands and feet to give Grant a lesson worth dying for. Grant tried to live a life that was structured and confined by his &quot;Westcott ruler&quot; but Jefferson taught him the power and beauty of freedom. The Jefferson Journals were the most magnificant words I've ever read in a book. No other chapter in the book shaped my view of Jefferson more than the journal entries.

His account of a man sentenced to death for a crime he did not commit is a testimony to the lack of value placed on a black man's life. Mr. Gaines points out that all citizens have a right to trial by a jury of his peers, but only if you are white.

I started out thinking the book was a bit of a soap opera, overly simplistic and pat in structure and tone. But it's designed to move quickly so the reader can reach the bigger truth without a lot of obstacles along the way.

Although I had never read any of the writer's previous works, his name is familiar and so, naturally, I assumed I would be in for a dramatic and stunning emotional rollercoaster. I wasn't.This book is so poorly written I really hope that my suspicions are true and that all the pages of the original text were replaced by a 15 year old promising prankster. While the main premise of the book has the potential to be a real winner, Gaines fails to give it the depth it really needs. Instead, he treads above the surface throughout the entire book, using superficial emotions with superficial, and stereotypical, vocabulary. At the end, we get what everyone expects, the standard tearjerker in a Lifetime movie. The book was a chore to read, with Gaines' digressions making it nearly unbearable (must we know about every single person that attended the school play, and must we go through the play in its entirety?).Nevertheless, Gaines does have an incredible way of making the story seem realistic. The main character, Grant Wiggins, is clearly not a writer yet when he telling the story it is as if he were simply talking to an old friend. Still, while Wiggins is not a writer, Ernest J. Gaines is, and an established one too. One would've hoped that a man with his clout would give us the mature literary quality one expects.

Oppression. These are some of the most commonly heard of subjects, not only in history, but even to this very day. However, A Lesson Before Dying refers to these subjects these subjects during the Nineteen Forties. These subjects of prejudice, racism, and oppression are the subjects of this review.\\"He looked at me as if to remind me that I was supposed to say Mister before a white man's name,\\" from page 188 is an excellent example of the racism that African-Americans faced then. Obviously, many white people, at the time, expected African-Americans to show respect for them no matter what the situation was. This show how white people thought that others are inferior to them.\\"I followed them into the inner yard, up the stairs to the back door,\\" from page 18 symbolizes how white people thought it beneath themselves to allow blacks and others to enter through a visible entrance. A great example of the prejudice and oppression that white people showed and sometimes still show others is what this is. Once again, white people see other races as their inferiors.\\"I was too educated for Henri Pichot,\\" from page 21 is somewhat of the reverse of the themes of A Lesson Before Dying. This is a good quote because, even though white people saw themselves as the higher race, black people thought of them as just stuck up people who weren't as superior to everyone else as they had thought that they were. Basically, what this quote implies is that people who see themselves as superior to everyone else normally aren't as superior as they think.In conclusion, I chose to tell of how this book does a fantastic job of describing the subjects of prejudice, racism, and oppression that African-Americans faced at the time this novel is based. It just goes to show that people can show prejudice against others of different races; however, no one race is better that any other in the end. Finally, I have decided to rate this novel at three out of five stars. I do this because, even though it is a great novel about the prejudice people faced, I found it somewhat boring as it tended to drag on at some parts."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"This book was a book that seemed to have lots of changes in the emotional state of the characters because of the fact the someone was going to die.

It was a three-star book, and here's why.Grant Wiggins is a schoolteacher who left his home town to go to college, then came back to that same small, racist Louisiana town to teach at the local school for black children. He didn't have to come back, and once he does, he complains often and continually talks about running away and leaving. But when Jefferson, a young man Grant is connected to through a family friend, gets wrongly convicted of a crime and sentenced to death, Grant must stay to help him \\"become a man\\" before going to his death.Religion seems to be a primary focus of the narrator, and many of the secondary characters get into it with him about how he's godless and he is steering Jefferson wrong by not putting more emphasis on praying and repenting. His method of quiet self-reflection gets through to Jefferson more than any of the religious attitudes, yet our narrator is basically still condemned and he also beats himself up over not being a believer. It seemed strange and slightly unreal to me.The notion that ultimately we control how we live our lives and our attitudes toward ourselves and others, even on death row, is an interesting one. However, for whatever reason, Gaines could not get me to care much about any of these characters. Certainly, I felt bad for Jefferson for being sent to death by a white racist jury, and I had sympathy for his godmother who wanted only to see him walk upright with dignity to his own death before she passed. But I had a difficult time relating to the characters' struggles.Truth be told, if being \\"straight and true\\" really is what makes a book great, then this one is not. Still, it read quickly and it still has me pondering its meaning, so in that sense, it is a good, three-star book."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It did not make my 5-star plateau, but it did create a character that I related to fairly well. The parts of the book that I liked best had very little to do with the main plot.Grant is a college educated man who has returned to his prejudiced, hopeless town that he grew up in. He constantly battles the feeling that he is wasting his time by coming back to his previous community. He is a teacher at the same school that he was educated at, and he continuously sees that everything is coming full circle. No matter how hard he teaches or puts forth effort, he sees his efforts as fruitless: the white society dictates what you can or cannot do; many of his students, like his previous colleagues when he was younger, just end up working in the fields or moving; others end up dead.Grant uses his experience with Jefferson, the man who is in a more hopeless situation than he is but somehow still rises above it all, to obtain stronger faith and prepare him to be the \\"hero\\" he talks about in the book.The undertones of the books are also appealing with religious and the string of anti-intellectualism interacting with each other.Just a well-written, thought-provoking read."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"A Lesson Before Dying is a book about a mentally retarded man, Jefferson.

Two other black men and the white shop owner end up in a gun fight, and the three men end up dead. Jefferson is scared and confused as to what to do next. He grabs a bottle of liquor off the shelf, gulps down some whiskey, grabs some money out of the open register and runs. He was on his way out of the store with the bottle of whiskey and a pocket full of cash, when two white men catch him.At the trial, the prosecutor stated that Jefferson along with the other two black men had intentionally gone to that store together and had planned the robbery together. The defense stated that Jefferson had simply been at the wrong place at the wrong time. There was absolutely no proof that there was any pre-planning with the other two black men. After all the shop owner only shot the other two men. He said that Jefferson, took the booze to calm his nerves and he took the money out of need and stupidity. That didn't make him a murderer. The defense attorney also asked the jury to look at Jefferson, and see that he was not really a man (yes he was 21) but not really a man. He asked them to look at the shape of his skull, his flat face, his empty eyes; he asked them if he looked like he had enough intelligence to plan anything, let alone a burglary. His argument was that this black man who knew of nothing more than plowing a field was not capable of such a crime, therefore to find him guilty and sentence him to death, would be like putting a hog in the electric chair.The twelve white men that sat on the jury found Jefferson guilty of robbery and murder in the first degree. Jefferson was sentenced to death by electrocution.Jefferson's godmother, Miss Emma asks Grant Wiggins, the young twenty-something college educated black teacher to help Jefferson die with dignity, like a man; not like a hog.This was a great novel. It is books like this one, that are full of ideas, themes, and symbols, that leave me wishing I was a member of a book club, because after you are done, you just want to talk about it with somebody else that recently read it.If you are thinking about reading this book, think no more...just read it!"},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"Gaines proves to all just how good he is in this novel. Facing a dense landscape of thrillers and action adventures, he dares to write what seems to me like one of the better literary novels around right now. One feels as if he is being given a rare look deep into the minds and hearts of the main characters of the story. The book has no fluff, it is pared down to the necessary words and what craftsmanship there is in the words. Gaines is not a churner-out-of-books, it's obvious he has labored over every word and every sentence."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"I recently read A LESSON BEFORE DYING as part of the National Endowment of the Arts \\"Big Read\\" program, which is designed to revitalize the role of literature in the United States. This short novel, which was published in 1993, is a really great book at a lot of different levels.A LESSON BEFORE DYING is a book about race relationships in America, much in the tradition of books like TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. It essentially deals with an execution of a black man in a deeply prejudiced Louisana community after World War II. Unlike most novels of this nature, this books is told entirely from the perspective of the African-American community. It bears mentioning that the author himself is African-American, and grew up in the segregated South in the 1940s and 1950s. So this novel has a compelling ring of authenticity, since it is largely based on his own personal experiences.Gaines writes A LESSON BEFORE DYING in a very stark style, but he gets his point across very clearly. All the scenes that deal with everyday racism, and the humiliating psychological consequences of such racism, are very powerfully executed. But Gaines is a sophisticated enough author to deal with other psychological issues as well. The main character of Grant Wiggins is the only college-educated black in his hometown, and the novel does a fine job of revealing his sense of alienation. For example, Wiggins is not particuarly religious, which makes it difficult for him to relate to his own family, all of whom are strong Christian believers. The resulting conflicts are quite fascinating to read about, as Gaines explores territory that I have never before seen in a work of literature.While this novel probably isn't in the same class as TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, its a powerfully written work that deals with some important themes and ideas. I felt like I learned quite a bit from it on both a historical and emotional level. As a result, A LESSON BEFORE DYING is very much worth your time."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"One of the reasons I love using this book in the classroom is because so many have been affected by relatives in prison. Our society does not talk enough about or examine the after effects of prison. Why aren't there support groups like ALANON, but for family members of prisoners? Before reading the book, I ask my students (anonymously) to write down every family member they know of who has been in prison or jail (not write the names, but the relationship -- for example: grandfather, aunt, brother etc.). It was eye-opening the first time I looked at the results. The vast majority of students in my urban high school had several relatives with prison records. Tapping into this prior experience, or background, helps them connect more with this book than anything else that I teach."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"This book was a great read and is just simply a good book. Even though they were certain Jefferson didn't kill Mr. Grope he was still convicted. I loved how even thought he was convicted Aunt Emma never gave up on him.I personally thought Aunt Emma was wasting her time. The only thing Jefferson believed was that he was a pig. He wasn't worth being talked to by humans. I slowly started liking him more once he started to abandon that thought.He was going through a tough time because he was sentenced to death for something that they didn't have proof that he did. At the beginning of the book I resented Grant and I thought all he did was think about himself and was very selfish.He ended up helping Jefferson in so many ways and he actually got him talking and writing before his death. It was a sad day when Jefferson was killed because everyone became very fond of him. I had also liked him a lot. I know if I was him I would've just given up when they sentenced me to death but he didn't.Towards the end of the book is where it got really good. Grant and Jefferson were becoming friends and Jefferson was talking to Aunt Emma and she was happy. He even talked to Vivian, Grants white girlfriend.Overall this book was a page turner. I couldn't put it down and I want to read it again. It will be a classic soon, and should be taught in schools because the morals of the book are amazing. I hope that everyone who reads this book will like it as much as I did because I enjoyed it very much.

Gaines until last year. This book is quite a surprisingly effective book about Grant Wiggins, a teacher, in a Louisiana Plantation who is asked to help Jefferson, a death row inmate, be a man before he is executed for a crime that he didn't commit. Gaines writes with great ease to the audience. It is one of those books that has come along in the classrooms. The book itself is a morality lesson about two very different African American men, Jefferson and Grant, who learn to bond despite Jefferson's resistance and reluctance. He keeps hearing him being described as a hog by the judge and those white men who sentenced him to death. The book is a tear-jerker when Jefferson acts like a hog because that is how he is described and his beloved Aunt Emma who would do anything to make him a man. She is dying and expects to be reunited with him after he is executed. There is no last minute appeals or years of waiting.

A Lesson Before Dying by Ernest J. Gaines is a heartwarming novel of how man can overcome enormous obstacles which are set against him. The story is set in the late 1940's in the small Cajun community of Bayonne, Louisiana. Racism continues to haunt this small town and all of its members.This story is told through the eyes of a young teacher named Grant who finds himself struggling to find happiness in the small community he lives in. Early in the novel you learn that the story is going to surround a young black man named Jefferson who is caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. When two men attempt to rob a local liquor store, the owner of the store and the robbers begin shooting. Jefferson is an innocent bystander to the crime, and when the smoke clears Jefferson is the only one left standing. Even though Grant was unable to go to the trial he already knew the outcome. He states, \\"I was not there, yet I was there. No, I did not go to the trial, I did not hear the verdict, because I knew all the time what it would be.\\" Jefferson was unable to prove his innocence, mostly due to the community's racist feelings, and is sentenced to execution.Jefferson's godmother soon realizes that there is no escape for Jefferson from this terrible fate, and that Jefferson must find a way to walk to his unfair death with his head held high. So his godmother asks Grant, the local school teacher, the favor of helping her turn her godson into a mature adult. At first Grant is doubtful of being able to help in this situation, but eventually he takes on the role of Jefferson's mentor. Grant tries to persuade Jefferson to do the unthinkable: \\"I want you to show them the difference between what they think you are and what you can be.\\" With all odds against them, the two are able to perform a miracle which everyone else feels is impossible.Gaines creates a world in which you become lost and find yourself cheering and crying with the characters as they face and triumph over the obstacles set against them. He creates characters that are realistic and act like you and I would. They aren't perfect and they make mistakes, but that's what makes them so loveable. You are able to connect with them and feel as if they are family or close friends.This novel is high-quality from the beginning to end, but the ending is amazing. The ending is one where after you have finished you want to read it again and again. You want there to be a sequel so you can once again revisit the characters you know and love.A Lesson Before Dying is well written and holds many life lessons from which we can all learn. I recommend that all high school students and adults read this book. I think that anyone who is looking for a novel with valuable principles and a good plot would definitely enjoy this book. This novel scores an A+ with me and I think that anyone would appreciate it. Whether it's a summer reading choice or not, you'll love this novel."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"I have several opinions about this book, and the first is that it should be placed on the mandatory reading list of every high school student in the USA; it is destined to become a literary classic in the same vein as Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird. The themes introduced throughout this book are designed to elicit discussion and shatter stereotypes. The transformation of the book's main character, Jefferson- a poor, uneducated, young, black man who has been convicted of a murder he didn't commit and whose life is compared to that of a hog by his own defense attorney in the worst closing argument to a jury ever atempted, is remarkable to watch unfold. Jefferson is reborn on death row with the help of his teacher, Grant Wiggins, the university educated, local black school teacher who reluctantly agrees to visit Jefferson in his cell at the request of Jefferson's aunt, Miss Emma, who wants Wiggins to make Jefferson know he &quot;ain't no hog.&quot; This book will evoke emotions in most of us; you will feel yourself react as you read. It is so very well written. Of course, the question remains is whether the book's themes will make a difference to its readers. Ernest J. Gaines, the author, must think that they will; I think that the book could have been titled, a lesson for us all."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"I'm probably in the minority here, but I did not enjoy reading this book. I expected this book to be a profound study of a relationship between a mentor and a young man ready to die. I was disappointed to find that the relationship took up relatively few pages in the novel. The first meeting between the two in which progress is shown doesn't occur until page 169, which doesn't allow for much time to fully develop the transformation. Instead of fresh insight, illuminating dialogue, and a complex relationship, Gaines tends to lean toward a simpler profoundness, but doesn't really succeed. A perfect example of this is found in the last line of the book. It doesn't end in philosophy or poetry, but only with a simple statement: \\"I was crying.\\" It's simple statements like this that never satisfy, and are barely adequate.Much of the novel is wasted focusing on the narrators mundane life, and not on the relationship. Unnecessary conflicts abound between the narrator and his aunt and his girlfriend--conflicts that almost trivialize the death of young Jefferson.The premise is very promising, though ambitious, and it is sad to see the author spend more time creating background noise than developing what could have been a profound and beautiful relationship and transition.My bottom line is don't waste your time. There is nothing profound or fresh to be found here."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"I'm glad to hear many of the students who reviewed this book say that they found it more piercing than some of the &quot;older&quot; novels they read in class. Although as a teacher I wouldn't throw aside Hawthorne for Gaines, I think this book is a terrific addition to the American classics read in middle and high school. It makes a good pairing with To Kill a Mockingbird. Harper Lee's classic (and still as moving as ever) focuses on the trial of a black man, unfairly convicted, whereas Lesson accepts the inevitable death sentence and explores the journey towards salvation. Our narrator is the only &quot;educated&quot; person in the novel, but for all his education, he has no soul and no religious faith. After being asked to meet with Jefferson, the condemned man, to convince him that he is in fact a man, not a hog, the narrator discovers as much about himself as the prisoner. The minor cast of characters are well drawn -- the pain evident in their lives is present on ever page. We witness the indignities they suffer in the hands of the white justice system, including being forced to wait hours just to speak to the sheriff. I'm glad Gaines includes one &quot;good&quot; white man (Paul) as a gesture of good will that there are always smaller heroes among villains. The friendship between the narrator and Paul makes for an inspiring finale.This book is very moving and well-written. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"Capital punishment, segregation, and acceptance have been a part of past and present times. Those issues along with tragedy, injustice, and accomplishment are part of the fascinating story, A Lesson Before Dying, by Ernest Gaines. The setting for this novel is a small town in the south during the 1940s where the two main characters are Jeferson and Grant. Jefferson is condemned to death by electrocution for a crime he did not commit. When his godmother realizes that nothing can be done for his freedom, she asks Grant to help him die like a man. After being called a hog by his defense attorney, Jefferson looses the little dignity he had and it's up to Grant to restore it. Grant doesn't like the idea, but he's forced to comply to it by his aunt. In return, Grant learns about the soul and spirit. Gaines writes this tragic story and reveals his feelings of capital punishment, segregation, and the difficulty of acceptance in a unique way, which thus makes this novel a 1993 winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction. Ernest J. Gaines was born into the world he describes in A Lesson Before Dying. &quot;Though the places in my stories and novels are imaginary ones, they are based pretty much on the place where I grew up and the surrounding areas where I worked, went to school, and traveled as a child...&quot;(Vintage Books) depicts Gaines. Although what he says, Gaines has a special way of letting the reader know what his opinion is on capital punishment. He describes his feelings about this form of punishment through Grant. When the date for Jefferson's death is set, Grant thinks about the way someone can plan a man's death. &quot;How do people come up with a date and time to take a life from another man? Who made them God?&quot; Those were the thoughts going through Grant's mind, and they showed the billiance of an author who expresses his feelings in a unique manner. Grant and Jefferson convey to the reader the true meaning of soul and spirit by teaching each other those values. Grant shows Jefferson to die with dignity. Then, conversely, he is learns a few things about the soul. The way they respond to each other is described so clearly, it's as if the reader is in that lonely and desolate cell. Gaines also wrote about the mulattos to tell the reader about the struggle with acceptance. He teaches the reader about segregation and acceptance through his other characters. Bars in the back of town for &quot;blacks only&quot;, &quot;blacks only&quot; restrooms, and the school where Grant teaches for &quot;blacks only&quot; are only some of the examples of segregation Gaines so explicitly places in the novel. A Lesson Before Dying is a touching and powerful novel that reaches out to the reader and portrays a time of injustice, inequality, and struggle. Gaines does an exquisite job of describing thoroughly the pain of enduring those issues. That description makes the story powerful enough to change some readers' thoughts. By comprehending the struggle these main characters go through, the reader gets a broader view of society which makes him/her a better person."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"A Lesson Before Dying is one of the best books that I have ever read. This book focuses on the racial differences in the 1940s and how blacks were treated unfairly. Jefferson, a young black man,accused for murder is sentenced to the death chair. Without proper evidence, the all white jury assumes that he killed a white man. However, Jefferson is actually a good boy who was raised by his Aunt Nannan. After realizing that her nephew will die soon, she wants him to die a man and a believer in God. Unfortunately, Jefferson endures name calling and racial abuse, thus he feels that he is only a worthless hog. It will take the help of his former teacher, Grant Wiggins, to make his Aunt's dream come true. The road to making Jefferson a man and a believer is not an easy one. Even Mr. Wiggins must learn a lesson and become a believer. I recommend reading this book because it seems as if the reader \\" learns a lesson before dying\\" with Jefferson and Grant. It is also significant because many black men and women in our past died as Jefferson- innocent.

The back of town is where blacks live, and bars for &quot;blacks only&quot;, &quot;blacks only&quot; restrooms, and the school where Grant teaches for &quot;blacks only&quot; are only some of the examples of segregation Gaines so explicitly places in the novel. Lee describes Maycomb County, where To Kill a Mockingbird takes place, as a segregated town, much the same as in Gaines' novel. The south side of town is for the blacks, and there is a church that is for \\"blacks only.\\" Both A Lesson Before Dying and To Kill a Mockingbird are touching and powerful novels that reach out to the reader and portray a time of injustice, inequality, and struggle. By experiencing the struggle that the main characters in both novels go through fighting for their lives against unfair accusations just because they are black, the reader experiences the horror and injustice of racism on an extremely emotional level, and cannot help but be changed by the reading of these books."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"Overall I feel that this book is extremely well written.

Gaines from a list of books by black authors. After reading a summary of the book, I chose to read it because I felt it would make a big impact on me and leave me thinking. While I was reading the book, I was also reading To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee for English class. To Kill a Mockingbird and A Lesson Before Dying are similar in that they are both about a black man accused of a crime on a white person. However, I liked A Lesson Before Dying because it wasn't about a black boy trying to prove his innocence to escape the death penalty. It was about a boy who had accepted his fate as a Black and the main character who tried to teach him to be a man before he died, for the defense attorney said to the jury, &quot;What justice would there be to take this life? Justice, gentlemen? Why, I would just as soon put a hog in the electric chair as this.&quot; A Lesson Before Dying seemed to be more true to the way it really was for blacks accused of a crime. They had almost no chance of being declared not guilty. This book really made an impact on me. I learned to appreciate my life more, and I know that what happened to Jefferson could happen to anyone. Just being at the wrong place at the wrong time could lead to consequences as extreme as being convicted of a murder and receiving the death penalty. It taught me about the struggles that Blacks had to go through in the thirties. One reason why Gaines might have written the book was to express the fact that Blacks who have been accused of a crime with a white person as the victim have no chance of being free. When Grant and Jefferson's Aunt Emma went to visit Jefferson, Jefferson had lost all hope of being set free and said, \\"...it don't matter.\\" But, Grant wanted to teach Jefferson to stand proud when he died, as it would give more Blacks the strength to stand proud in society."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"I'm an 8th grader and I read A Lesson Before Dying. I read the book while reading Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird. A Lesson Before Dying is set in the South following World War II. In the novel the author, Ernest J. Gaines, deeply explores the relationship between an innocent black man on death row, Jefferson, and Grant, a black man who was sent to teach Jefferson \\"how to be a man\\" and \\"how to die.\\" Gaines writes from Grant's point of view which allows him to show the fluctuation of Grant's sentiment toward Jefferson and how his experience with Jefferson had changed the kind of person he is. I enjoyed the book, and especially how Gaines' style of writing allows the reader to think about the book, the concepts it presents and the racism in post-World War II South and draw conclusions by himself. Despite this, I appreciated how Gaines made his opinion about how strong the racism was very clear. He wrote that Jefferson's court appointed attorney's sole argument was, \\"I would just as soon put a hog in the electric chair as this.\\" His statement was making the point that it was not justice to kill a black man, fore it was like killing nothing. I found many similarities between this book and To Kill a Mockingbird, including the racist setting and a black community's fight against blatant injustice. The one thing both books made evident was how significant a blemish racism has been on our country's history."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"In A LESSON BEFORE DYING by Ernest J. Gaines the reader is taken back to a small, Louisiana town in the 1940's. The opening scene of a courtroom quickly draws your attention to the conflict of the novel - a black man, Jefferson, wrongly accused of murdering a store owner during an attempted robbery. Jefferson was merely in the wrong place at the wrong time, and given the death penalty because of it. Just before sentencing, Jefferson is referred to as a &quot;hog&quot;, which becomes a centralized idea throughout the story. The characters in the novel strive to turn Jefferson's opinion of himself being a &quot;hog&quot; into seeing himself as a man before the day of his execution comes. Miss Emma who raised Jefferson suggests that Grant, a teacher, visits Jefferson in jail in hopes of changing Jefferson's outlook. It is apparent that Grant is not too motivated to help Jefferson at first, but he grows to truly care about him. Throughout the story, the reader sees Grant and the other characters deal with many different kinds of conflicts - conflicts of love, religion, happiness, life and death. The ending of the book is somewhat predictable, but still has a great impact on the reader. The issues in the novel are disturbing, but true."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"This book wasn't written by Oprah, but it looks like it could have been--a sappy melodrama that attempts to pull the reader to judge through emotion--much like Oprah's talk show. The idea I do like: a black man is wrongfully convicted of a crime and controversy is to follow. The first and last chapters of the book I liked the most--they were more focused on Jefferson himself and how others felt--had the book been focused on that the entire time, I probably would have enjoyed the book. Instead, Gaines turns it into a psychological tug-of-war with Grant, having his mind switch back and forth about whether to help out Jefferson or not, barely focusing on the conflict itself. The paragraphs including Grant's aunt and girlfriend were what I think Gaines intended to be the emotional pull of the story, but that just kept pushing away the focus on Jefferson, sidetracking the storyline (this is what I think Oprah liked in the book). So, once again, I felt the story could have been SO much more, just that Gaines went for the wrong effect (whatever it may have been). I apologize if you think my review was boring--it reflects the book."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"This book is lucidly (if simply)written, and is often moving, particularly towards the end. Better than passable writing, however, is far from sufficient to compensate for the fact that the topic of racial and legal injustice in the segregationist south is strictly old hat. Having had his thunder stolen by To Kill A Mockingbird, Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry and other works of a similar caliber, Gaines is preaching to an audience of the converted, with no new wrinkle to convey to them. While most of the novel is dedicated to the admirable but obvious propostion that racism is bad, Gaines' one ambitious move is the unsubtle implication (lamentable and probably fatuous) that a meaningful sense of identity can be built from a recognition of shared persecution.The novel only becomes poignant when Gaines takes the step of briefly putting us inside Jefferson's head. Instead of an exploration of issues like why Jefferson's community failed to give him a sense of identity to begi! n with, we can expect Gaines in future novels, while maintainig a competent level of writing, to advance such daring theses as &quot;The Irish troubles are bad.&quot;"},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"Story set in 1940's in a small town in Louisiana. Young black man (Jefferson) happens to be an innocent bystander at a liquor store when two men attempt a robbery and gun shots break out. Jefferson is charged with the crime - he is unable to prove his innocence in a town where a black man is guilty before proven innocent - and he is sentenced to death. Jefferson's godmother realizes that Jefferson has no way out of his fate and wants him to hold his head high before his death. She enlists the help of Grant, a young local school teacher to mentor Jefferson during the time he has left. At different times in this book, you are nauseous over the racism - you feel the pain and suffocation of the main characters - you are inspired at their determination despite the hopelessness. The author places you right at the scene and you live this story. This was one of the most moving books that I have ever read."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"This book takes me back to my college days (which weren't that long ago!). I took a course in Comparative Ethnic Literature that, quite possibly, changed my life. Among the books that we were required to read was A LESSON BEFORE DYING, beautifully written by Ernest Gaines. Jefferson, a slow-witted young man, is wrongfully accused of murder, at the scene of a stick up. This conviction is race-based. [Jefferson is a young African-American man in the South.] The young man is treated more lowly than a pig in the trough. Without an education or a prayer, Jefferson needs to be brought some dignity during the final days before his inevitable execution. Grant Wiggins, a very successful product of their small Southern town, has returned, and is the pride and joy of their community. Wiggins possesses an education and is also a schoolteacher. He is approached to bring the young man a connection to something other than his doomed fate. Their connection actually transforms Grant, in the process, and their exchange is anything but one-ended.This book is written in such a way that you really feel as though this is a skillfully orchestrated play. I could see the imagery he described and I could also hear the Southern drawls and feel the scorching Southern heat burn my skin. It isn't often that a book transfixes me four years later as though I had just read it yesterday. That is what A LESSON BEFORE DYING succeeds in doing and I really reccomend that you read it--not because Oprah picked it, but, because it truly is a great example of terrific modern day fiction."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"I very much enjoyed &quot;A Lesson Before Dying&quot; for several reasons. First of all, as an opponent of the death penalty, I think this novel describes perfectly the horrors of being forced to face death, as well as the tragedy of an innocent being put to death. It also beautifully illustrates the hardships and prejudices that many people, especially African Americans, endured in the past, not only with the law, but with acceptance in society as well. I hoped throughout the entire novel that Jefferson's fate would change, yet knew it never would, due to the ignorance present in the white community by which he was judged. The whole novel was written from the heart and was very inspiring, in spite of the sadness involved."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"A PC novel.

This is one of the latter sort. While written with a strong hand, the book fails to make any of the characters real and reads like a lengthy journalistic account of a few weeks in the life of a young black man in a racist town. One could not sensibly say this is really historical since there is little to contextualize the story. Nor could it be said that we feel for the poor guy who may have been falsely accused and is going to die. Hard to tell that there is really a lesson before dying except the usual stand up and be a man my son type of banalities. What one could say is that the author plays with a lot of touchy feely words to reach his readers and I can see from reviews here that it worked for a lot of them. One star for good English, but not for the chapter written in gibberish that I had to skip. Also note that the author cannot write a sentence longer than two lines, and that gets tiring in the end. One star for a story that was promising from the start. All in all not worth the time and I regret picking up this book."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"I've always been a fan of all of Ernest Gaines' writing. And I am no particular fan of Oprah. But like all his books, I enjoyed this one. I only gave it four stars because somethings I found uncomfortable from my own experiences (as a white woman living in 1940). Not untrue, just from a highly different perspective. And one of the things that I found \\"worrisome\\" was the use of Claude Festus McKay's poem \\"If We Must Die\\" as theme, with the strong \\"hog\\" imagery of the poem and the book: \\"IF we must die, let it not be like hogsHunted and penned in an inglorious spot...\\"Having said that, I don't for a minute think that Ernie was using it literally in the sense that Claude McKay did--as an avowed Communist, preaching revolution in the 1920s. I prefer to believe that the Hog in 'A Lesson Before Dying\\" related to the idea of a \\"revolution\\" of the main characters' thinking.One reason for posting this review is that although I didn't by any means read all 500+ reviews, I think the \\"hog\\" was grossly misunderstood; and even in one review the idea that \\"Bayonne\\" wasn't a Cajun town was way off because in 1940 except in St. Martin and maybe Lafourche Parishes, there were no Cajun towns. Cajuns were looked down on as much as the Blacks--and some would say even more since they're Caucasians!It's really sad that many younger readers aren't given more genuine background when they read historical fiction stories--especially of Louisiana. Not only do they miss a lot, they are open to formng warped judgments. That was then; this is now. I mean, Oprah and Ernest Gaines being lionized in 1940 in Louisiana? No way.[...]"},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read. It unfolds slowly, just like life does.

It is written without punctuation and with no grammatic consideration. This is where Gaines' ability to write shines through. This chapter is a much needed rest from the previous mundane chapters.I did not find the novel appealing in anyway. The protagonist is weak and annoying. The story drags on and on as Grant tries to help Jefferson mature out of his mental childhood. Metaphors and other literary techniques are present, but the novel is so boring that it's not even worth noticing them.

Have you ever thought about being executed for something you didn't do? Have you ever learned one of life's little lessons without even knowing it? This is what A Lesson Before Dying is all about.Jefferson, a young black man, is an innocent by stander to a liquor store shootout in which two black men and a white man are shot. Jefferson is then sentenced to death. Grant Wiggins, a school teacher from the plantation, is pressured into going to visit Jefferson by his aunt and Jefferson's god mother. Later in the story Grant and Jefferson become good friends. Once Grant and Jefferson become friends, Grants life is never the same.Jefferson's attorney said, \\"I would just as soon put a hog in the electric chair as this.\\" This book shows how black men were treated. Not the same as today and not the way they should have ever been treated. This book also shows that blacks were characterized as not smart. Grant says, \\"I was supposed to have said don't. I was being to smart.\\" This book also show s that not all white men disrespected blacks. For example at the end of the book Paul, a jail deputy, stuck out his hand and said, \\"allow me to be your friend Grant Wiggins.In conclusion I think this book teaches a lot of life's little lesson's.

I don't read very much but I enjoyed this book for the most part. I didn't like writing the quotes for school... that kind of ruined what I liked about the book. I had to rush through reading so I could finish the quotes and get a good grade.What I remember from this book is that Jefferson, a poor black slave, was in the wrong place at the wrong time. He was at the scene of a murder and convicted of it because his nationality. So Jefferson went to death row to wait for a seat on the electric chair. His white lawyer called him, \\"Incapable of planning a murder because he was a stupid hog.\\" So his aunt sent Jefferson's cousin Grant (a black teacher) to educate him and make him believe that he wasn't a hog. She wanted him to die with the pride of knowing that he's a man and that all the white people were wrong about him.Grant disliked making these trips at first because Jefferson didn't cooperate at all and it seemed pointless. But when the two connected finally, Grant went to see him and got him gifts as often as possible. Jefferson wasn't the only character who learned a lesson or two in this story.

Gaine's A Lesson Before Dieing is a story about two black men who battle racism through the simple act of resisting. The year is 1948 and racial segregation is still very strong in America, especially in the southern town of Bayonne, Louisiana where the novel takes place. Jefferson, a young African-American, is the only survivor of a local store shoot out involing him, two other young black men, and the white store owner. With all the evidence the jury needed found in Jefferson's skin color, he is convicted and sentenced to death, but not before his own attorney claims that Jefferson is no more capable of this crime than a &quot;hog&quot; is. Hearing those words, Jefferson's godmother vows to watch a &quot;man&quot; walk to the electric chair, not a hog. By the request of Jefferson's godmother Grant Wiggins, a local black school teacher, helps Jefferson to become that man. Together they learn that true heroes never give in.On a count of the main conflicts being internal conflicts, I found this novel slow and at times boring. Despite certain interesting details, such as the contrast of the two &quot;heroes&quot; of the novel (ones a well educated man who carries the hopes and dreams of his people, the other an uneducated man whom little if anything is expected from), this novel let me down. The themes of the novel- faith and perseverance- are very strong and powerful but are at times overshadowed by other conflicts and events in the novel. Too much detail is being payed to Grant and the rest of the town and not enough to Jefferson and his struggles. Despite the Jefferson's triumph in the end, I felt a little let down. We see him win, but the variety of conflicts in the novel didn't allow us to see the whole battle, just bits and pieces."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"I thought ths book was one of the best ever writen about an execution.

Gaines's, A Lesson Before Dying, was a great book. The characters in the book were very well developed. The main theme in the story was; heroism is not discrimination, racism, and the death penalty. The setting of the book was during the time when racism was the biggest thing around. During the time period, there were strict rules of blacks using water fountains for blacks, sitting in the back of the bus, eating in a black only cafe, etc. This book was very strong and contained many different views of racism.Harper Lee's, To Kill A Mockingbird, was similar to this book because they both contained signs of racism and discrimination. Both stories had a character(s) who defended blacks, trying to show that they weren't bad or to be discriminated against.From reading this book, I found that Blacks or any other kind of race different from whites, should be respected and not treated with cruelty. I recommend this book to everyone because this book can really tell you lots of things. This book teaches you lessons about how to judge people and that violence is not the way to solve things.

I chose A Lesson Before Dying, byErnest J. Gaines. I read this book while reading To Kill a Mockingbird, by Harper lee. There are many similar points that the authors make about racial issues and baout living in the South during the 1940's. A Lesson Before Dying is set in Louisiana just after World War II. Jefferson, a black man, was at the scene of a shoot out. The three other men were killed which left Jefferson as the only survivor. He is convicted of a murder and sentenced to death. Jefferson's defense defends him by saying, &quot;Gentlemen of the jury, be merciful. For God's sake, be merciful. He is innocent of all charges brought against him. But let us say he was not. Let us for a moment say hge was not. What justice would there be to take this life? Justice, gentlemen? Why, I would just as soon put a hog in the electreic chair as this.&quot; Jefferson's godmother wanted Jefferson to know that he was a man and not a hog before he dies. She asks Grand Wiggins, a local school teacher, to teach him that he is a man. Grant unwillingly accepts but later learns a valuable lesson. In To Kill a Mockingbird ther is also a trial to prove the innocence of a black man. In each story the man loses hope of becoming free. Both writers had a clear understanding about how race had affected the blacks and both writers didn't try tohide how strong the racism was. It was understood how racist the South was during the 1940's. Througout the whole book Ernest J. Gaines expresses his opinion about racism and segrigation. He tries to tell the reader a story about how improbable it was for a black man to get taken off death row. He also shows how the black people related to the white people and how the Whites related to the blacks. it showed the differences between their two lifestles and how they were seen by each other. Gaines expresses his feeling about racism and segregation in the south through som of the characters in the book such as Jefferson and Grant. This book made me think about how some people treated others like animals, without any respect or worth.

The subject matter is compelling, as are the opening scenes and the descriptions of interactions between blacks and whites during the late 1940s. But once the situation is set up (I won't give it away), things become awfully repetitive and predictable, like a bad TV movie. The supposed romantic interplay between the main character and his girlfriend seems out of left field, and their dialogue jaw-droppingly dumb. I'd compare Gaines' attempts at romantic dialogue to Steven King's attempts at writing non-gory scenes. Just plain bad. I wish this book were an &quot;instant classic,&quot; because some of its messages -- including one to white folks like me that the sullen anger and suspicion that some blacks feel toward whites is well founded in history -- deserve to be read by a wide audience. Many whites in those days saw any sign of black intelligence and desire for equality as a terrible threat that had to be quashed. Also, for such an honored book, the writing should be at a higher level, and this is ninth grade writing. I wish this book was better.

The membership thoroughly enjoyed the book. The title captured the story like no other book I have read. The book would have been more appropriately entitled Lessons Before Dying because, unlike what I anticipated, Jefferson was not the only character who had to learn a lesson. Grant was at a critical crossroad and on the verge of becoming like his former teacher cold, indifferent and hostile, i.e., spiritually and emotionally dead. Although he did not realize it, his aunt and Vivian fully understood the importance of Grant becoming involved in this crisis. Grant needed a drastic wakeup call. Jefferson was both Grant's and the community's savior. He gave them hope. He was the sacrificial lamb. He became the reader's hero. We were captivated by his courage, a courage which none of us could fathom. It was difficult to grasp the source of such strength. However, it was sad that Jefferson had to die in order to be loved and respected by both the black community, even his beloved godmother Emma. There are many Jeffersons in our society today who get lost in the community who feel unworthy, unwanted and unloved. After reading his diary and seeing that he was smart and had excellent perceptions of people, I was ambivalent as to whether it would have been better not to gain knowledge of the eve of the execution. Yet, I understood the situation was bigger than Jefferson. Ms. Emma was probably the most loved and respected character. She was absolutely brilliant and could have been psychologist. She was a master of the human psychic. She was able to manipulate everyone to get what she wanted.

The entire first half of the book is painfully slow and darn near pointless. Sure, Gaines establishes some characters here and there, but all in vain since none of them have any depth at all. The only thing going for this book is the author's hope that if he makes the \`victim' black and the jury completely white, then the whole book is about racism and prejudice. Truth is folks, no matter how much the book made you cry, the plot has nothing to do with racial injustice.This is all not to mention how poorly written it was. Gaines' interpretation of slang was distracting in that he would omit slurred words completely making you feel like you misread the sentence. He lacks any of the perks of the first-person narrative and dumps dialogue on us in long strings. Perhaps more importantly, I personally felt no sympathy for any character. I don't understand how an entire story can warp a lawyer's mere mentioning of an animal for perspective to be the complete basis of Jefferson's character and the plot itself. I mean, the lawyer only said \\"hog\\" once, not even in direct reference, and suddenly it made Jefferson into a bumbling idiot? No, I'm pretty sure he was a bumbling idiot before the trial. If he had the sense to call for help or at least walk away from the crime scene, then he wouldn't where he is. He might as well be a murderer. He might as well be a hog. It doesn't even matter what race he is.With the flaw of the plot being the entire plot itself aside, we're left with false morals. If race was completely taken out of the story and you still felt like crying at the end - so be it. I'm not here to impose my own personal taste upon you. You'll like what you you'll like, but try not to make this story to be some epic racial drama. It's really just about a guy trying to teach a fool how to deal with his consequences, and it was done rather poorly, might I add.

Gaines. Our eighth grade English class in San Francisco wasstudying racism as shown in twentieth century literature. I chose this book to compare to the classic, To Kill a Mockingbird, which we were studying as a class project. A Lesson Before Dying and To Kill a Mockingbird are about similar subjects in that two wrongly convicted black men must be sent to death because of racism. However, this is where the comparisons end. The points of view of the main characters are radically different. In To Kill a Mockingbird, the main characters are portrayed as optimistic and hopeful for the prisoner's future. However, in A Lesson Before Dying, the main character is extremely pessimistic about his goal of making the prisoner realize he is a man and not a hog. It is interesting to note that the optimistic characters are white, while the pessimistic one is black. Because whites generally had an easier life during the time the stories were based, they were bound to have a more positive outlook on life. This is unlike the cynical point of view of the black character in A Lesson Before Dying. He, like most blacks during that time, was treated badly by racist whites. A Lesson Before Dying is about two black men's struggles in a Southern racist town. The tone makes it clear that each man is imprisoned in his own way. The story is narrated by Grant, an opinionated school teacher who is frustrated with small-town life, but is too reluctant to leave. The other character, Jefferson, is wrongfully convicted of murder and living in jail, waiting to die. The tone of the book is set by Grant, whose interpretations of his surroundings and relationships with others make the story so moving. When Grant is told to make Jefferson feel like a man before he is executed, all of the emotions of his own life pour into his thoughts for the poor prisoner. This is portrayed through the simple-minded, almost childlike voice of Grant. The reader is taken to the essence of his personal pain and his understanding of Jefferson's fate. To Kill a Mockingbird is considered a classic because it shows that whites can be moved to rebel in times of injustice towards blacks. A Lesson Before Dying is a fascinating comparison because it shows that one's viewpoint is really shaped by experience. I wonder what would have happened if an optimistic white person like Scout was sent in to talk to Jefferson. Would Jefferson have been convinced? Probably not, and the book would not be a believable statement on racism. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in understanding how human experience effects racism."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"It was my first book about a young black crimer in 1940's.

Also he cought what could he do for Jefferson and his community even he was mad at living Cajun Community. And I was so sad because Jefferson died although he didn't do anything wrong; he just didn't know what he should to do then.

Ernest J. Gaines, himself growing up in a similar setting, makes his novel very realistic. He bases most of his novels on real life experiences from his youth. This book takes place in the late 1930's in Louisiana. A black man named Jefferson was said to be guilty for killing a white man- a crime he did not commit. Mr. Wiggins, the teacher at the colored church elementary, is asked by Jefferson's godmother to go visit him in jail. In court, Jefferson was called a &quot;hog&quot;, and not a man. Jefferson's godmother, Miss Emma, wanted Mr. Wiggins to teach Jefferson ,before he is executed, that he is a man. The two men grow a relationship, and Jefferson is eventually able to express his feelings by writing to Mr. Wiggins in a journal. Jefferson is a very honest person, and you really feel like you know him at the end. That is the thing I liked most about the book, it is very realistic. I feel that this is one of the best books I have ever read, and reccomend it to anyone who does not mind a little sadness."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"I approached this book with the idea that I would not like it and was only reading it because my book club had chosen to read it. There are so many stories written about the human condition, but I have to admit I had read few others that had the effect that this one had on me. The author presented the story by simply giving the facts of what life was like for that group of individuals and the few choices that were presented to them as a race. I felt genuine sorrow for all those who suffered the same type of hopelessness and despair. This book truly gave me an insight that I had never experienced before."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"Lesson Before Dying is a story that tells about many prejudices about blacks in 1940s. The author uses Jefferson as a black character who is low life, not educated, and stupid. So that when Grant wants to help Jefferson to know he is a man not a hog, people around him ( white people ) are careless about the imporants to Jefferson and to his family. In fact, the only reason that is it a powerful story is that thinking self as a color person actually can take you insidethe story. So you can feel very touching and warming in the heart of yours."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"I haven't finished the book at this point, but so far I have thoroughly enjoyed it and can't wait to finish it.

As I lay the book back on my shelf for one last time, I realized the morale of the story. This book was not a comprehension book where you had to read between the lines to understand it. That 14 yr old and the 15 yr old that made the reviews on this book as being boring and not liking it was just utterly stupid. Sure, maybe the book is for older people, but only mature people could really appreciate it. I think these KIDS just wanted to see their name and comments on the internet. This is all coming form a 19 yr old in college, and is mature enough to write a review. my favorite part of the book is where the Jefferson walks to the electric chair a MAN not a HOG. In other words, make the best of a bad situation."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"A Lesson Before Dying by Earnest Gaines is an excelent book! It takes place in the 1940s in a small town in Louisiana. A young black boy is convicted of shooting a killing a white store owner. He in fact did not do this; he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. His lawyer tried to get Jefferson off by telling the all white jurors that Jefferson could not think to do anything like that because he was not a man, he was a hog. Once the jurors convicted Jefferon and senteced him to die by exuction, Jefferson's nanna asked Grant for help. Grant was the plantation teacher for all the children living on the plantation. Grant was from the plantatation and moved back with his aunt when he graduated from college. Ms. Emma (Jefferson's nanna) asked Grant to teach Jefferson to be a man. She did not want a hog walking to the death chair; she wanted a man to walk there. Grant goes to Jefferson out of respect to his aunt and Ms. Emma; he really does not want to go there at first. During Grant's visits the relaionship between Grant and Jefferson grows. Everyone wants Grant to visit Jefferson for differnt reasons. The reverand, Ms. Emma, his aunt, and even his girlfrind Vivan all have their own reasons. This book brings forth many social issues we still deal with today."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"Grant Wiggins feels pulled between his roots in Southern Louisiana and the life he could have if he left. He's an educated black man who finds himself helping a young black boy walk to the electric chair like a man. At first he feels like he's been forced into helping Jefferson, the accused, but finds he learns more about life than he counted on. Life shouldn't be as cold and calculating as Grant believes and watching Jefferson face death shows him the other side. This book is emotionally riveted, but worth the read. It teaches one that human life is worth something no matter their race, religion, or culture. It is amazing how the times have changed in the world, yet in some places it still remains the same. This book will be a classic."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"This was a pretty powerfull book that seemed to take a new approach at some pretty old, yet still controversial sublect matter. Its not a book filled with explosive action (besides the first two pages), and its not fast moving. Yet the pages still move smoothly and hold the attention. The book takes a realistic approach at what its like to be on death row, and what its like to be wrongfully accused. How do you change a person who thinks they are nothing but a pig, fattening up for the slaughterhouse, into a man, and a representative of a race. This is the main problem discussed in the book. But the book has more to it than that. It shows the struggle that blacks had to go through not much more than fiftey years ago. It shows how they began to break free of the mold that they had been stuck in prviously, emerging as the great individuals that they always had been."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"A Lesson Before Dying is a heart felt drama about the unfair lives that the black culture lead during the 40's. Capital punishment was also a leading issue throughout the story. The combination of racism and capital punishment created a complicated situation that was very moving. The issue of capital punishment that was portrayed in this story was unfair because of the racial situation that was factored in. THIS STORY WAS AN EXCELLANT WAY TO EXPLAIN HOW THIS CULTURE DEALT with cruel and unfair punishment.

This is opposed to the last 10 chapters or so when I could barely stand to put the book down. I love how the book explored the essence of being a man. I found it interesting how the book convinced me that both Jefferson and Grant made the magical transition from,in Jefferson's case, hog to man, or in Grant's case, grown child to man.

For the first 150 pages Gaines beat around the bush and filled the pages with useless trip after trip to the jail, where, surprise, once again Jefferson says or does nothing.

Chapter 29, Jefferson's Diary, was heart-wrenching. I cannot fathom what it would be like to be in Jefferson's shoes. My emotions changed throughout the book, but I was able to relate to many of the characters. The only side of the story that could receive my criticism is Grant's life. Many detials were included, but the strings were never tied at the end of the book. It seemed to stop abruptly. I would have liked to know more, or I would liked to not have known as much about him.

Copying with topics such as racism, death penalty and injustice boosted by prejudices lodged in a little Cajun community in the 1950's, &quot;A lesson before dying&quot; shows how all classics should be. The reluctance, the bewilderment and finally the urge of a teacher for making of an innocent victim a real man before dying. I have never seen anyone dealing with such profound feelings the way Ernest Gaines does in this novel. Outrageous injustices committed by some against others due to issues so shallow like those of someone's color.

It is a fiction story that takes place in a small town of Lousiana all the way back in 1940's. It was so obvious for such incidents to happen back then that it seems to be a true story. Black Women wants their men to make them proud. Black men afraid of lifting the burdone left behind by other ranaway black men. Very touchy, infect, a close view of life of an Afro-American person back in the days of segregation. Eventhough, I liked this novel very much, but I gave it only four stars, because I think that Mr. Gaines should have discussed Grant's relationship with Vivian a little more after Jefferson's death; It was not talked about after discussing the problems they might face after Vivian's husbnd learned about their relationship.

They were black and grew up in the black society, separated from white people. Although Grant graduated University, he was still segregated by the white men.

Gaines's, &quot;A Lesson Before Dying&quot;, was a great book. The characters in the book were very well developed. The main theme in the story was; heroism is not always expressed through action. This book talks about many different things, discrimination, racism, and the death penalty. The setting of the book was during the time when Racism was the biggest thing around. During this time period, there were strict rules of blacks using water fountains for blacks, sitting in the back of the bus, eating at a black only cafe, etc. This book contained many different views of racism.This relates to the book of To Kill A Mockingbird, since they both took place when people were discriminating blacks. Both these stories had characters who helped the blacks and tried to help them, while other people were racist and tried to kill them.From this book, I think that racism is bad, and that people should respect peoples' differences. I think that people who are racist should just leave the &quot;colored&quot; people alone.&quot;A Lesson Before Dying&quot; was a great book and can teach many readers a lesson, and how to treat others that are different."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"It was my first book about a young black crimer in 1940's.

Also he cought what could he do for Jefferson and his community even he was mad at living Cajun Community. And I was so sad because Jefferson died although he didn't do anything wrong; he just didn't know what he should to do then. Finally this story let you know how important the people who are surrounding you. Jefferson just felt he's a hog. But his people didn't allow it, and they tried to change his mind; he's a man.

Grant not only transforms Jefferson but is transformed himself as he visits Jefferson in prison. This emotional narrative is not a literary masterpiece but is well written, well structured and to the point. Well worth reading at only 250 pages. I love fiction like this.

This is an emotional and touching book that makes readers realize that any form of racism is unecessary under any circumstances. It shows that sometimes people must go through hell in order to achieve something that seems unachievable. A Lesson Before Dying also sympathizes with people who are unhappy with their surroundings due to chaos and want to just run away from it all. At the very end of the book, Grant and Paul, ( deputy at the Bayonne prison), are walking down a road talking about how Jeffersons execution went and Paul tells Grant that he is one of the best teachers he's ever seen. They end up shaking hands, and to me, this indicates that somewhere down the line, blacks and whites will bond one day and all of this ridiculous racial tension will end. This is the kind of book that seems like time flies when you're reading it because you get caught up in it and it is so interesting and easy to understand. Earnest J.

Jefferson learns that his education and his possessions do not define a man, but rather the respect he has for himself and others. Grant, while teaching Jefferson something to do something Grant could not do himself, learns an important lesson about the value of sacrifice and family.The lessons learned in this novel can be applied not only to the characters themselves, but also to today's society, where dignity and pride are often secondary to material possessions.

The main character is a black man named Jefferson who is being put to death for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. As the story goes Jefferson had been picked up by two other black guys who were on there way to a liquor store. The intentions of the men who picked Jefferson up were to ask the owner to give them free liquor. When the men ask the owner for the free liquor he turns them down. This upsets them and cause them to rob the owner. In the battle everyone is shot and killed except for Jefferson. Jefferson notices that everyone is dead and that he had nothing to do with it so to calm his nerves he drinks some whiskey. As he drinks the whiskey he notices that the cash register is open and takes the money. As he is about to leave he runs into some white men who catch him. At the trial he is sentenced to death.While in jail a man named Grant goes to visit Jefferson and during his visits becomes really close to him. Everytime Grant goes to see Jefferson he tried to explain to him dignity but Jefferson isn't willing to listen but Grant keeps trying. On Grants last visit he gives Jefferson a journal and asks him to write about his thoughts. Jefferson fills the journal with ideas between men and hogs.I liked the book it made me think about how unjustly blacks were treated.

First he learns to care for Jefferson and that he can&#65533;t escape from his commitments making him as well a man.

The trial in which Jefferson was found guilty was over with before then end of the first chapter. Having been finished nine pages into a book of over 250, the most exciting part of the book quickly digresses into many chapters of very little action. The lack of action will make the casual reader lose interest. Although the plot slows down, there is still action going on. The action shifts from what happens to the characters physically to what happens to the characters emotionally. For this reason, someone looking for an exciting story about a man on death row should not read this book. A Lesson Before Dying is the perfect book for someone interested in reading a beautiful crafted story about the relationship of two men who are perfect complements to each other. Throughout the book, when Jefferson feels hopeless, Grant -whose job is it to educate Jefferson- gives him hope. When Grant is weak Jefferson had strength. This award-winning book is required reading for many schools. Many students, not wanting to read this book, will find it boring. Someone who is genuinely interested in this subject matter will find this book an amazing piece of literature."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"You must read this book twice. Read it once for general comprehension and then again for true understanding. A Lesson Before Dying is not a book, but rather an updated Bible of the 90's. It teaches the lesson of an ordinary man, more specifically a black man of the South, becoming a legacy, simply because he endured. I embody the character Jefferson. Jefferson has been accused of a crime he did not commit, murdering a store clerk and then taking money from the register. Yet, he did not know that he would be tried for a crime less apparent, the crime of being black. I understand as an African-American I will never be treated or looked at the same as a Caucasian or any other race for that matter. I can't say that at times I haven't questioned why I would be born into such hatred. But, now I have come to a universal truth and it is as follows, the color line is a line dependent on a bias mentality, the finish line is a line dependent on impartial faith. I draw this conclusion solely based on the race for equality, a race not yet won. Although I think the strongest line of all comes in Chapter 31, when the last words of Jefferson are,\\" Tell Nannan I walked.&quot; Jefferson took steps not only towards death, but also towards freedom. He freed himself from the chains, of which we are all connected, the chain of ignorance. Jefferson endured degrading circumstances. He was confined into a tiny jail cell for months. He was isolated from friends and family. His only link to the world was his ability to write. The words he placed inside the notebook, which Grant, the schoolteacher bought him, streamed across the page like an ever-flowing river. Jefferson, a common, everyday black man took a stand not for his own personal benefit, but for the hope of equality. He refused to be another statistic in the books; he refused to be the &quot;hog&quot; the white man treated him as. Faith made Jefferson not only a man, but also a hero. Ernest Gaines is a heroic writer. He wrote about a time when the limits were tested and about a struggle that continues through today. The lesson I learned at sixteen years of age was a lesson for life. The lesson I learned was that faith is worth dying for."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"i had a difficult time getting through this book. i often questioned why it had made the Oprah book club list. alas, i moved forward and as a result was hardly prepared for the emotions that sprung forth from me as i read the last chapter...can someone say TISSUES! amazing! i recommend this book whole heartedly and hope others are as moved as i was."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"This book takes place in the American South in the 1940's.

Grant, a black teacher, has been asked to help the doomed man know that he is a man, despite the fact that the white men called him a hog.This is a moving story of honor, racism, and what it means to be a hero. Overall, I enjoyed this book. I gave it only 3 1/2 stars (rounded up to four), however, because I found parts of it drawn out and painful to read. The convicted black man, Jefferson, is extremely cruel to his loving godmother. I don't feel it was necessary to draw this detail out quite as much. Also, Grant sees racism in every aspect of his life. After a while, the reader begins to say, &quot;Yes I can see you feel this system is unfair, but do you really need to make it as blatantly obvious?&quot; Still, one can only wonder what it was like to be the victem of this racism, and perhaps it is an honest depiction."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"It's 1948 and Grant Wiggins, an intelligent young black man in the deep South, is frustrated at every turn. He hates his job. He's forced to live with his aunt. The woman he loves is still married to a man who won't divorce her. And he's teaching in a poor church school even though he doesn't believe in Heaven. To top it all off, his aunt's good friend, Miss Emma, has just seen her God-son Jefferson convicted of murder and sentenced to death....and she wants Grant to teach the hulking illiterate something before he dies.This is the conflict in Ernest J. Gaines' fine novel, A LESSON BEFORE DYING (Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., 1993; 256 pages). And what a conflict it is. In Gaines' capable hands, what could have been a standard potboiler with preachy overtones (something along the lines of Grisham's A TIME TO KILL) becomes instead an almost profound examination of what it means to be human, and to live (or die?) with dignity.This is in no small way achieved by Gaines' inherent restraint. In telling the story, the elements of anger and violence are there, but not exploited. This is no easy task; among the themes are prejudice and oppression. Yet Gaines makes the reader feel their presence without acting as a literary hammer.It's this approach which makes the quiet desperation of his protagonist seem so realistic. Wiggins always seems about ready to crack at the seams in his frustration, and his &quot;tutoring&quot; of Jefferson is for him, at first, just another unwanted burden. But as he faces the oppression in his own life, he begins to see how important his mission actually is, both to Jefferson and to himself. &quot;I want you to show them the difference between what they think you are and what you can be,&quot; Grant says, trying to reach the doomed teen. &quot;To them, you're nothing but another nigger--no dignity, no heart, no love for your people. You can prove them wrong. You can do more than I can ever do. I have always done what they wanted me to do....But you can be better. Because we need you to be and want you to be.&quot; It's a naked moment for Grant, and one that explains the inner hatred he has for his job, his family, and himself.A LESSON BEFORE DYING has recently received a boost from Oprah Winfrey (she has recommended it on her show as part of her Book Club), and in this she has served the reading public well. It's rare these days to read a novel with a somewhat legalistic theme and come away with a better understanding of humanity. It is also a fine way to be introduced to Gaines, a consistently good writer whose work deserves an even wider audience."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"Though the Oprah Book Club seal on the cover, originally held me quite suspicious of this book's credibility, I actually found it a meaningful read. This story of a young man about to be killed for a crime he did not commit is one that surely leaves many people touched. I did not feel a strong emotional connection to the characters and found the plot a bit too predictable, but although it was hard to connect with the characters, they were (for the most part) very real and complex. I believe this novel is still too new to really find out whether it has lasting power and/or any great literary impact, but if you are looking for a fast-paced, meaningful (yet hard to connect with) read, I would reccomend this book."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"Convicted of a crime he didn't commit, Jeferson is sentenced to death in the electric chair.

Grant Wiggins, born and raised on a sugar cane plantation, on which he is now the schoolteacher, is faced with the challenge of shaping a young innocent man named Jefferson, unjustly convicted for murder, into a man before his execution. \\"Now his godmother wants me to visit him and make him know-prove to these white men-that he's not a hog, that he's a man. I'm supposed to make him a man. Who am I? God?\\" Grant struggles with himself and the others around him in search of his own identity. The faith of the community lies upon Grant as a hero, and forces him to realize his importance to his people. As a result of his revelation Grant comes to understand his role amongst his peers and accepts the challenge presented to him by the matriarchs in the story, Miss Emma, and Grant's Aunt, Tante Lou. A Lesson Before Dying, although slow at times, was rich in character development, and is worthy of much praise due to its wonderful account of the struggle of a people. A classic story of faith, love, struggle, and heroism, A Lesson Before Dying promises to enhance the perspective on which one views life, basically a wonderfully told tragedy."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"Its the summer of 1940. In a courtroom of a small Cajun community, a trial is taking place for the robbery and murder of a white shopkeeper. In this courtroom a young black man, Jefferson, is about to be sentenced to death by electrocution. His only crime--being at the wrong place at the wrong time. This scene establishes the narration of Ernest Gaines' compelling novel, A Lesson Before Dying. Gaines delivers a novel that captures the interests and touches the hearts of its readers. Grant Wiggins, the narrator, begins the story, &quot;I was not there, yet I was there. No I did not go to the trial, I did not hear the verdict, because I knew all the time what it would be.&quot; Even in the antebellum emancipated south, serious issues regarding race, segregation, and prejudice prevail. Grant, a university-educated black male, has returned from the city to the plantation community where he teaches in a small plantation church. Disturbed with his station in life and angered by the injustice he sees around him, Grant struggles as a prisoner of social convention--always wanting to pack up his things and runaway. But Grant is asked by Jefferson's Godmother, Miss Emma, to stay and teach Jefferson to die like a man. After being called &quot;a thing that acts on command&quot;--a hog--by his own defense attorney, Jefferson looses the dignity he has. It is now up to Grant to restore it. Jefferson believes the words of his attorney as he sees himself only as &quot;a old hog--Just a old hog they fattening up to kill for Christmas.&quot; He sees himself as subhuman and worthless. But as the story progresses the two men forge a bond showing that being a man is truly a great thing to have. Both learn many valuable lessons as they teach each other. Grant, who lost his religious faith when he went of school in the city, learns about the soul and the spirit. In the beginning, Grant found Sunday, the Lord's Day, &quot;the saddest day of the week.&quot; After being around Jefferson in the small isolated prison cell, though, Grant's character encounters a spiritual rebirth. Jefferson learns about becoming a man. Constantly feeling he is already dead, Jefferson struggles with accepting that he is a human like the rest. Grant tries to tell him, &quot;We're all going to die, Jefferson,&quot; but Jefferson, knowing his fate, replies, &quot;Tommorow, Mr. Teacher, that's when you go'n die? Next week?&quot; Nevertheless, in the end, Jefferson eventually overcomes this and approaches his life's end like a man--&quot;Tell Nannan I walked,&quot; he said. As the narration continues in the novel, Gaines depicts issues of injustice in the south as a result of Jefferson's trial. He says, &quot;Twelve white men say a black man must die and another white man sets the date and the time without consulting one black man. Justice?&quot; In the racist society of the south, the African-American does not have the luxury of a fair trial and equality. There are bars in the back of the town for &quot;blacks only,&quot; there are schools for &quot;blacks only,&quot; and there are jail cells strictly for &quot;blacks only.&quot; A society that is supposedly over the racial conflicts, strongly conveys a prejudice attitude. The novel forces the reader to take at African-American's fight for freedom that followed their so-called emancipation. Gaines also furthers the story as he comments on capital punishment. He delineates its unethical side when Grant remarks in the text, &quot;I could not get that date and time out of my mind. How do people come up with a date and a time to take life from another man? Who made them God?&quot; Gaines incorporates segregation, tragedy, and injustice into this emotional story. By comprehending the struggle these characters go through, the reader gets a broader view of society and the lessons it teaches its individuals. A Lesson Before Dying is a dynamic story that suits readers of all types. Ernest Gaines truly reaches out and the makes the readers apart of the novel itself--whether they're ready for it or not."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"&quot;I was not there, yet I was there.

In a small Cajun community, in the1940s, a young black man is about to go to the electric chair for murder. The story is set in racist Louisiana and tells of the redemption of a death row prisoner and the teacher sent to help him die with dignity.Symbolism is a major part in the understanding of the book. The book was top notch for the theme of heroism. One theme that is predominately heard throughout the novel is &quot;actions speak louder than words&quot;.

I, an eighth grade student at San Francisco Day School, read this book alongside To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee. I found that the ideas explored in A Lesson Before Dying, such as discrimination, prejudice, pride and death, were very similar to those introduced through To Kill a Mockingbird. Although the ideas explored were the same, the point of view taken by the narrators in the books differ greatly, as one author is white (Harper Lee), and the other is black (Ernest J. Gaines). These contrasting views are shown best through the narrators expectations for the outcomes of the two trials, which take place in each book. To Kill a mockingbird is about the trial of a black man, Tom Robinson, after he has been accused of raping a white woman. Although it is quite obvious that Tom did not commit the crime, the jury reaches a guilty verdict, as could be expected in the racist time and society in which the book took place. Atticus, (Tom Robinson's lawyer and the father of the narrator, Scout) however, has a very optimistic view in both the start and finish of the case, and believes that as time progresses racism will be diminished through the progressive generations. His views, and the views of Harper Lee, are expressed through his closing argument, which makes it apparent he believes change will come. In the beginning of his closing argument Atticus states that the courtroom is the one place that all men are created equal, \\"...a pauper the equal of a Rockefeller, the stupid man the equal of Einstein, and the ignorant man the equal of any college president.\\" He finishes his closing argument with: \\"I am confident that you gentlemen will review without passion the evidence you have heard, come to a decision, and restore this defendant to his family. In the name of God, do your duty.\\" The events which take place in A Lesson Before Dying, are very similar to those occurring in To Kill A Mocking bird: a young black man (Jefferson) is put on trial for a crime he didn't commit, and although it is apparent he is innocent, the white jury returns with a guilty verdict. The view of the narrators Grant Wiggins, an educated black school teacher, is much more pessimistic than that of Harper Lee/Scout. Grant believes that society will never change and he has no hope that blacks will he treated as equal as time progresses. This is shown through the opening lines of the book, \\"I was not there, yet I was there. No, I did not go to the trial, I did not hear the verdict, because I knew all the time what it would be.\\" Grant thinks, that even though Jefferson did not commit the crime, the white jury will find him guilty. He has no hope that this racism will change, not with this case, and not ever. Reading A Lesson Before Dying taught me not only about the ideas of racism and justice, but also made me realize how strongly an authors background and personal feelings reflect upon their writing. It was very clear how differently the two authors felt about racism and the future of blacks in this country. Ernest J. Gaines felt less hopeful because he himself had experienced racism, and he understood how hard it would be to break out of this mold which people followed. Harper Lee, on the other hand, being white, was more hopeful that this mold would be broken, not realizing how severe discrimination really was. Had A Lesson Before Dying been written by an author of a different race, particularly a white person, it would have turned out to be a very different book, and I therefore realize how deeply an authors personality and beliefs impact their writing. A Lesson Before Dying was a very well written and realistic book which helped to broaden my view on the issues of discrimination, the death penalty, and many others."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"For readers looking for That Death Row Experience, check out &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot; instead. &quot;A Lesson Before Dying&quot; is a tedious exercise in racial pandering, repetitive not only in themes (Grant Wiggins, a black man who has escaped Massah and gotten a teaching certificate, encounters racism from Massah &amp; co. at every turn while wondering ceaselessly whether to blow town and if so, whether to take his married girlfriend with him) but also in language (if I had a nickel for every time Grant called his girlfriend &quot;Honey&quot; in one memorable passage, I would be the new owner of the Redskins). The story plods along blindly until Jefferson, a mentally-challenged inmate who is supposed to learn said lesson, shows us his journal. From that point on, it's compelling and touching. Too bad that's not until the last chapter or so."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"I can see why English teachers love this book, and why generations of students will be doomed to hate it.

He's pressured by his family into tutoring Jefferson, an innocent black man found at the scene of a bar robbery turned homicide. Jefferson has been sentenced to death and his \\"nannan\\" - godmother, wants to prove that he is more than a \\"hog\\" as his defense attorney had claimed.How to make this book more relatable for teens? Hmm... you could draw parallels to the Troy Davis case, although it seems that the fervor surrounding that case has already died down. NPR did a piece on Willie McGee and the Traveling Electric Chair.What's really striking is that for all the visits, and food that's brought for Jefferson - they really don't speak much at all, and Jefferson never does get the equivalent of a high school education. Everything that Wiggins encourages Jefferson to do is much more for the comfort of the people who will survive him. The story is rather slow paced and full of atmospheric details of racist Louisiana in the 40's.

This is why he is chosen to help Jefferson. Jefferson is in jail for participating in a robbery and murder which he did not commit. He was in the wrong place at the wrong time. At the end of the trial, the prosecutor calls Jefferson a hog. Now Grant's aunt and Miss Emma want Grant to convince Jefferson that he is not a hog, that he is a man.\\"I'm sorry, Mr. Grant, I'm helping them white people to humiliate you. I'm so sorry. And I wished they had somebody else we could turn to.

Eventually, however, Jefferson starts talking. By the time of his execution, Grant has convinced him that he is a man. He is not only a man, but a hero. He is a man/hero because not everybody will give up there life and take the chair as Grant knew Jefferson would.\\"Do you know what a hero is, Jefferson? A hero is someone who does something for other people. He does something that other men don't and can't do.\\" (p. 191)Grant changes throughout this book. He goes from being sad and sorry for himself, to realizing that life isn't so bad.\\"I wanted to scream at my aunt; I was screaming inside. I had told her many, many times how much I hated this place and all I wanted to do was get away. I had told her I was no teacher, I hated teaching, and I was just running in place here.

He realizes that he is lucky to have what he does have, and to be grateful for it.Overall, I think this was an excellent book that helps teach you that you should be grateful for what you have, and not be mad or upset about what you don't. It takes a while to learn, but all you have is time. For those people who do not have time to learn should think about their lives as they are now.

Grant criticizes society and dreads being treated like an inferior thus giving the novel a theme. The issue of injustice and facing responsibility is a great subject matter to base a book upon, until an adolescent must read it, which is then that the book falls out of play.

I read the autobiography of Miss Jane Pitman about four years ago, and that novel really struck me. After reading this book by Gaines I feel the same emotions I felt at the beginning of the book. I know about the conflicts between the two races during the pre-civil rights era in the south, and this book seemed to follow a history textbook. I feel as though Gaines skimmed over the characters and the story. For example, the story should start point &quot;A&quot; which is the setting up of the characters and the history of the characters, then move onto &quot;B&quot; which is everything that leads up to the climax, then head over to the climax and the lesson learned in point &quot;C&quot;. Well i feel like Gaines went from A to C.The story is about Jefferson, a black male living in LA. He is wrongfully accused of murder. When two people he was at a convience store shot the store clerk; and him, but not before the clerk killed the two boys jefferson was with. Jefferson is put on trial, and is sentenced to death by the electric chair. His lawyer argues to the jury that he is unintelligent, and a hog and therefore can not be sent to jail. How could he have planned such a crime, when he can't even count. Jefferson's godmother does not want to see him die thinking he is a hog, and makes a plead to Grant (an educated school teacher) to teach Jefferson that he is a man.Throughout this novel we have the common racial tensions, and injustices black america faced before the civil rights period in this novel, but it seemed boring and did not move me in the least. It seems as though a novel with a plot as strong as this should be able to move me out of my seat and make me feel the injustices that black america faced, but this was not the case. I was left with no lesson out of this book. The one point that I did feel from this novel is simply this: The mere fact that an individual has a college education does not make them smart. It is not a ticket for them to think they know everything about life, family or any circumstance. I think Gaines could have done more with this novel then he did. I think Grant and his girlfriend Vivian's relationship could have been written more into the book, as well as Jefferson's thoughts about people trying to help him.Overall: I would skip this one and look to Gaines' other novels.

Gaines is based on the story of a young man who is sentenced to death for a crime he did not commit. He was convicted by the color of his skin, and for being at the scene of the crime. While reading this capturing book I thought about the book \\"True North\\" by: Kathryn Lasky. \\"True North\\" is based on the Underground Railroad, which follows a white woman's friendship with a black woman who is an escaped slave making her way to the Canada border. Both authors show the reader how strong the characters are through thick and thin. The character in \\"A Lesson Before Dying\\"; Jefferson undergoes change through trust of another black man by the name of Grant Wiggens, and understands the real meaning of life. Jefferson's nanna persuades a young schoolteacher Grant Wiggens to visit Jefferson in his cell and help him learn his pride of being a man before his death. Grant Wiggens is quoted in the novel \\"do you know what his nanna wants me to do before they kill him? The public defender called him a hog and she wants me to make him a man. Within the next few weeks, maybe a month, whatever the law allows- make him a man\\" Before the story is over the two men forge a bond showing being a man not a hog is truly a great thing to have. The teacher lets a confused teenager understand that he is not the victim, but is for the color of his skin. The characters in \\"True North\\" undergo the change of life, understanding of two different races coming together and understand the real meaning of life.

Crying softly, Lucy traced the terrible embroidery of scars with her finger. It was then that the unimaginable became imaginable. That night, the two girls fell asleep in each other's arms.\\" The author gives vivid detail and the characters perspectives on life. Both of these books go through change through each character, while they both find the real meaning to life. Gains and Lasky paint a picture for the reader about each of the characters who undergo change. Let's the readers escape and imagine what it is like for Jefferson, Wiggens, Afrika's, or even Lucy's way of life, through friendship and understanding."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"This book will really pull at your heartstrings but be prepared to do a little translating.

That said, once you understand what is being conveyed, you can almost hear the words being spoken."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"In the novel A Lesson Before Dying, There is a very good lesson to be learned. The lesson I learned is that if you have faith you have everything you need. In the story, a black man named Jefferson was convicted and found guilty of a murder he did not commit. He was simply present at the time of a shooting in which everyone around him was killed and he was blamed for it because of his skin color. If he had been white there would have been a more extensive investigation. Jefferson was sent to prison for a month or so until his execution. In that time period, Jeffersons' aunt asked professor Wiggins to visit Jefferson in Jail and try to \\"teach him to be a man\\" before he dies. Professor Wiggins agreed to help. The first few trips were practically a waste because Jefferson would not say a word out of his depression. But after a while Jefferson opened up to Wiggins and they talked about anything that came to mind. Wiggins could not think about anything to teach him besides having faith and trusting in God. Jefferson learned this and developed his own faith. When the execution day came around everyone was sad and crying except Jefferson because he had faith. It was said that Jefferson was the strongest man in the town that day.This story was made up but the concept is real about prejudice and the unjust treatment that black people recieved. I liked this book for many reasons but the main reason was the way the author, Earnest Gaines, described everything in such great detail.

The movie I saw about two years ago and cannot really remember it too well, but after reading the book I am going to rent it this weekend. The way Jefferson was potrayed as a hog instead of a human being and a man made it easier for the jury to find him guilty and sentence him to die. The rationale being is that it is okay to slaughter a hog, but to kill a man well that's another subject so instead of addressing Jefferson as a man lets make him into a hog. There were parts of this book that made me feel anger and other parts that gave me hope and promise. However, at the end Jefferson showed even though he was innocent of killing Grope he would take being at the wrong place at the wrong time as a man."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"-----------------------------------------------------------------A Lesson Before DyingA Lesson Before Dying is about a black man who is present during a robbery and a murder in a bar. Confused by all the action and the death of three men, he goes over the counter to see if he can help the store owner only to find him dying and gasping for air. He looks to the cash register and sees money under the thin money holsters. Never had having more than a dime in his pocket, Jefferson takes all of the money figuring that no one will expect he took it. He sits down behind the counter and thinks to himself \\"Boy, I really need a drink!\\" So he picks up a bottle of liquor and drinks it straight out of the bottle. After sitting down for quite a spell, he walks out of the door only to be confronted by police who arrest him.Jefferson is tried before a \\"fair\\" judge and jury. For stealing the money and the liquor he is sentenced to death because they believe that it is a premeditated crime. During his trial, his own lawyer uses calling Jefferson a hog and a idiot, therefore trying to show the judge and jury that this man doesn't contain the mental intelligence to carry out a master plan. Grant, a kindergarten through high school teacher, is made, by his aunt, to go and see Jefferson and try to make him a man before his execution.Though the course of this book, Grant visits Jefferson many times. At the early visits, it seems all help for Jefferson is futile, but then towards the end of the book , Jefferson starts to understand his ignorance , and starts to believe in God and humanity again.Chapter 29 is Jefferson diary. It shows Jefferson's thoughts, and the author is aiming at making the audience feel bad for Jefferson since he was not a likeable character from the beginning.At the end of the book, his death, Jefferson is proclaimed to have been the bravest man in the execution room.-----------------------------------------------------------------"},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"A Lesson Before Dying, written be Ernest J. Gaines, is a captivating story of how a stubborn and selfish teacher named Grant Wiggins and a diminished death row inmate, Jefferson, overcome adversity to form an everlasting friendship and prove to the world how African American men can stand tall in a world where they are oppressed and belittled. When Jefferson is called a &quot;hog&quot; during his murder trial, it starts a chain reaction which ends up the making and death of a friend. Grant must overcome his own personal roadblocks in order for him to reach and connect with Jefferson. The lack of action in the book is easily made up with the amount deep heartfelt emotions that the characters express. A wonderful book that everyone should read."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"A Lesson Before Dying is a story of many themes and values; all of which are positive and insightful. Although it may be slow moving and undeveloped in some aspects, the book teaches important lessons that everybody could benefit from. I would recommend purchasing this book.Taking place in the 1940's, the lesson begins with a young, black, male who happens to be at the wrong place at the wrong time, and as a result is falsely accused of two murders. This illustrates one of the featured themes of the story: racism. I think racism is very easily detected as a theme to the story. With a weak story line though, the reader maybe distracted and lose focus of the reoccurring theme of racism.There are many characters in this story including the Death Row Inmate, and Grant Wiggin, who is a teacher that is sent by Jefferson's mother to convene with Jefferson. Also there is the white Sheriff of the small southern town and the mothers of Grant and Jefferson, never in the story do you get the feeling that you know and understand any of these characters. With poor character development, never do you completely feel as emotional about the character's different problems.The storyline of A Lesson Before Dying completely evolves around the theme of redemption. The white folks of his town label Jefferson as a \\"HOG\\". The object of Grant visiting Jefferson at the county jail is to convince him that he is not a HOG and to walk to the electric chair with dignity and pride. I like the theme of redemption and it is interesting the way Grant gets the theme across to Jefferson.Even though this story has its flaws, i.e. its very slow reading, has a boring storyline, and the lack of character development, I think the lessons and values taught should not be passed up."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"A Lesson Before Dying is a fervently emotional story. The book begins with a boy, named Jefferson, being accused of a murder in which three people died. Jefferson did nothing wrong except that he was there and witnessed the crime. Most people would not think much of a person witnessing a crime and being put on trial, but Jefferson was African American and the time period was 75 years after the Civil War. The state was Louisiana, a state that fought for slavery, so that indicates why he is sentenced to die. Jefferson's defense attorney should have been penalized for mow practice, but that wasn't around back then. Jefferson's attorney said that sentencing Jefferson to the chair would be like killing a hog.That statement put Jefferson's mother into distress. She then asked Grant Wiggins, an old teacher of Jefferson's, to turn Jefferson into a man. Grant did not want to attempt this difficult task but his Aunt, whom he was staying with, forced him to do it. Grant teaches to elementary kids at the church. Grant no longer goes to church and because of this he fails to see inside himself.After visiting Jefferson for some period of time, Grant begins to see where his life is going and in which way he would really want it to go. At the same time, Jefferson becomes more of a man. A Lesson Before Dying can be slow at times, but it is an appealing book that is worth the time reading."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"I feel that this book is one of the best books on race relations in the South.

I have to remind myself to concentrate on the substance of what's said and not to allow these pronunciation oddities to color my impression of the character. Why does he have to over-emphasize every consonant? Every &quot;t&quot; in the words &quot;often,&quot; &quot;sweater,&quot; or &quot;water,&quot; for example. I know the teacher is a pedantic boor (at least so far), but this narrator makes him seem even worse than intended."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"This book contains some imaginery we've all seen elsewhere, some characters that are too stereotyped to be real and a style that is somewhat like a chant with endless repeption as the ultimate poetic resource. But two things stand out inmediately, the message and the voice of the jailed man, Jefferson. The things that Jefferson says are the real engine of the book, they are poignant and they are raw. Even someone as illiterate and brutalized as Jefferson, is capable of taking command of his life and turning it around against all odds. Through the help of one of his peers : the professor. Also the professor, by undertaking a task that he doesn't want at the beginning, comes to the realization of how to really make a life happen instead of repeating the errors of the past, the irresponsibilities of humanity (any humanity, not just black) against itself. I say any humanity because the book also shows the weak foundation, or &quot;myth&quot; upon which the whites in the book also survive. The scribblings of Jefferson in jail are the core of the book and I recommend it if only for that."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"A &quot; Lesson Before Dying&quot; by Ernest J. Gaines is a powerful and moving book. It's realistic insight on black suffrage,in Louisiana in the 1940's, keep a readers full attention. I thought that the religious symbolism that Gaines uses was innovating. His comparison of Jefferson's character to that of Jesus Christ was very insightful. Gaines also uses descriptive writing to explain different situations and express various characters throughout the book. This use of descriptive writing makes the novel interesting and easy to read. The only aspect that prevents this novel from achieving five stars is Gaines' tendency to not flow from chapter to chapter. It seems that every chapter begins to present a new idea instead of continuing with where the previous chapter left off. One example of this is in chapter 19 throughout the chapter he writes of this &quot;lone gift against the tub of dirt&quot;(p.151) but yet throughout the rest of this story nothing is ever mentioned again about this gift. Although this book does have this one flaw, it is definitely worth reading. One of the best books I've ever read."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"Ernest Gaines writes with such believably real characters that the reader barely wants to put the book down before finishing.

I felt Grant's frustration. I wanted to reach out and talk to Jefferson myself. I, too, realized a lesson: that straddling the fence on feelings is a dangerous position. This story could have happened in real life, not just in Gaines book; he grips your attention from beginning to end."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"A Lesson Before Dying is a touching classic novel that keeps the reader actively interested.

Enjoyable reading but for my point of view I am ready to read a story about a white man, committing the same crime, in the 1940's or today, with an all white jury and the same outcome.

Gaines is a solid writer and he gives everything to the story. Gaines reigns in his writing so it never lets out the anger, frustration and disillusionment that the characters carry. I wanted so much for Grant to explode, do something brass and big and even after the fight scene, I was still waiting for release. And that's when I realized how well crafted and artful an author Gaines is. Gaines made me FEEL what Grant felt his whole life, what Grant's people and community felt; a hungry anger that can never be sated. I felt this anger so clearly that when I closed the book I felt as though I had in some way fulfilled Grant's desire of getting out of that town and going somewhere better."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"A Lesson Before Dying is one of those rare books that stays with you months after you've read it; the kind that teaches you things about yourself.

It uncovers deep wounds, and although it offers no quick cure, the kindness, strength, and goodness of the characters signals hope for them as well as for us."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"Ernest Gaines has written a book that encourages the reader to look deep within ourselves to see a different storyline. The book takes place in a time where racial segregation is still in place and there are many barriers that stand between the black and white communities. The characters each impart a piece of the hidden storyline, which is, what makes a hero ? Each does something to better another life, be it a simple task or an intense situation at a small cost to themselves. The characters themselves, do not take credit for the things they do. They don't see their efforts as a showcase, but rather rejoice in reaching a goal. Grant Wiggins talks to Jefferson on being a &quot;hero&quot;. That scene is where I realized that all the characters were heroes, they each had a different goal and different reasons. I felt Gaines had given us the opportunity to see true heroes at work. I felt this book gives a reader a better insight, in which small tasks done to better another life, make heroes of more people than we realize. The self-sacrifice a hero endures, may be as small as a task done in a grudging manner to enduring an unhappy situation. This book was rich in characters and deep in meaning.

The main character, Grant, is not particularly likable. He's bitter, unmotivated, and at times, just plain mean. In fact, most of the characters in the book are not particularly likable. Most of them appear to be downright miserable. A sign of the times? I don't know, but you'd think *someone* in the novel would be a joyful person. Jefferson, the imprisoned man, is an interesting character, but even his turn-around is a little anti-climatic. With the build-up of the novel and the title and the praise and all, I expected much more of an epiphany at the end. For me, the pay-off just wasn't there.

Jefferson, who just so happens to be at the wrong place at the wrong time, witnesses a shootout between a white store owner and two black men. It also just so happens that Jefferson is the only survivor and witness. He is put on trial and because of his race, convicted of murder, sentenced to death by electrocution. But before his execution, Jefferson&#65533;s sickly Godmother&#65533;s only wish is for him to believe he is a man and not a hog, as the defense had cruelly stated him as. His Godmother believes this can only be done by persuading Grant Wiggins, the school teacher, to gain access to visit Jefferson in prison and help him face his death with dignity.Grant, the educated school teacher, who has returned from the University back to his hometown, is living a life full of problems. Grant struggles with his decision to run away with the woman he loves, although deep inside he knows he cannot leave his aunt. He is also involved in many arguments with his aunt over him not believing in God and also him dating Vivian, his girlfriend. Now Grant must fulfil a wish of a dying old woman, and help Jefferson to die like a man. Eventually through the story the two men acquire a relationship that changes them both.The beginning of the story was a little boring, but with an urge to finish the book, I kept reading, and it kept getting better the further I read even through the end of the novel. The chapters contained events from one day to the next so it was very easy to understand and pick up where I left off. The only confusing chapter was reading Jefferson&#65533;s diary. Although I believe it was essential to the novel to include this chapter, it was difficult to read. This chapter lets you understand and realize what exactly Jefferson was thinking and going through right up until his execution. The words written, in this part, would have been exactly like the poor grammar Jefferson would have used because he was almost illiterate. The words written were parts of words with misspellings and no punctuation making me have to slow down the reading and at times think of what words he was actually referring to.This story, I think, dealt with heroism that does not always have to be shown through a persons actions. It also dealt with major issues of race and identity. For example, Grant struggled with being the well educated man he thought he was or being the ... they (meaning the white people) knew he was. This story made me also think how unjustly blacks were treated.I definitely recommend this book to anyone who is looking for an emotional story that has a meaning to it that can be different to each person depending on how they look at it. Just remember that when you read it do not stop reading it just because you know what the ending will be because each chapter brings more and more meaning to the story."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"A Lesson Before Dying is well-written and thoughtful. With that said I must interject and say it doesn't quite live up to expectations. Gaines seems almost fearful of tackeling serious issues. When Grant does reach Jefferson, the novel abruptly ends with his death, no great depth. Wiggins doesn't truly try at any one point to assist his imprisioned student so it was rather surprising to find he had reached him. How? By being cynical and cruel? If you want to read a thoughtful drama of African American life in the past, read the brilliant The Color Purple or if you want a compelling case of the unfair way blacks were persecuted in the South, read the compelling and worthwhile To Kill a Mockingbird. This is not near the poweress of Walker or Lee. Sorry Gaines, close but no cigar"},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"This book has so many good aspects to it. It deals with so much including racism, society, family, respect. It brings a lite these ideologies in a orginal and new fashion. You can't not see this book for what it is and must look beyond the words written. It is a definite think book. It is wonderful and a good, solid read. The basic plot deals with Grant, a black teacher, living in a small racial segregated town in the late 1940s. Jefferson, is a black man condemned to die for a crime that he says he didn't commit. It is a struggle between right and wrong and between responsibilty and free will. It will open your eyes."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"A beautiful, painful and powerful novel, 'A Lesson' is set in Louisiana in the 1940s, a time well before &quot;desegregation&quot;. A poor black man, Jefferson, is sent to jail for the death of a store owner he did not kill. The governor will decide when he will be executed (electric chair). Another young black man in town, Grant Wiggins, the local schoolteacher, is pressed by his grandmother and the condemned man's godmother (who raised him) to visit the man in jail and &quot;make him a man&quot; before he dies. The condemned man has been called a simple animal by his lawyers, a 'hog' specifically, and his godmother refuses to let her son be executed buying into the white man's label. The local school teacher would rather have no part in any of it. This is an excellent book. The last section as Jefferson and Wiggins being to communicate is extremely powerful and well done. Every high school should make this required reading(particularly in white upper middle class school districts). Although it is fiction, it is historically and sociologically relevant, and so thought-provoking and heart-wrenching all in one."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"During my 8th grade English class, I read A Lesson Before Dying by Ernest J. Gaines. I read it while studying To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee. A Lesson Before Dying is about a black teacher in the South who is forced to visit a man condemned to death. The man being visited was wrongfully accused of murder. To Kill a Mockingbird and A Lesson Before Dying have one large concept in common, they are both based around a black man being wronfully accused of a capitol crime. To Kill a Mockingbird was written by a white woman, Harper Lee, and A Lesson Before Dying was written by Ernest J. Gaines, a white man. This leads to very different points of view. In To Kill a Mockingbird, Tom Robinson, the wrongfully accused man, is said to have a good chance of appealing to higher courts. In A Lesson Before Dying, they don't even consider appealing, they just try and make death better for the man. The white point of view is much more positive, and optimistic for a black person in a white judicial system. The black point of view is more pessimistic, yet probably more realistic. This is what makes the books very different. In A Lesson Before Dying, the story is told from the point of view of a teacher who is very bitter, and has a large grudge against white people. In To Kill a Mockingbird, the story is told by a young, white, upbeat southern girl who always seems to be happy. The point of view of the author changes the points of view of the characters in the book. I think that a person being the subject of persecution would be more likely to understand the reality of the situation (in the books) than someone who has probably not experienced persecution at all. That is why a black author could better understand the hopelessness for a black man condemned to death during a time of such strong racism. I think that this book was well written, but it was hard to like some of the characters, especially the main character. For me, that makes it hard to keep reading from the point of view of a jerk. The book is also very slow-paced, and hard for someone of my age, 14, to stay interested in for long periods of time."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"This was my first time reading any of Mr. Gaines' works, but I am now anxious to read more. My emotions ran the gamut while reading this book - to shame because I am white; to anger at the prejudiced sheriff and his cohorts; to despair over Jefferson's fate; to compassion over Grant's fate; to pride in the respect the people of the quarter showed to Miss Emma and Jefferson.This book is powerful and heart-wrenching. I couldn't put it down, and you won't be able to, either!"},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"This is one of the top five books I have ever read. The story, set in 1940's racist Louisiana, tells of the redemption of a death row prisoner and the teacher sent to help him die with dignity. The teacher, Grant Wiggins, a college educated man who has returned to his hometown to teach, reluctantly agrees to his aunt's request that he visit Jefferson, a young man who has been wrongly convicted of murder. Jefferson's lawyer's sole defense was that Jefferson was a &quot;hog&quot;, dumb, without plans, and unable to plan and execute a robbery. Through Grant's visits and his reading of Jefferson's diary, the reader is drawn into the pain and injustice of Jefferson's situation. Top notch writing and character development."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"A Lesson Before Dying by Ernest J. Gaines is an excellent, touching book. The story is set in the late 1940's in a Cajun neighborhood in the South with racism still very much present. The main character, Grant Higgins, faces what seems to be an insurmountable task in teaching Jefferson, a wrongfully accused black man on death row, that he is a man and not a 'hog.' Although Grant is a teacher, he must go beyond letters and arithmetic to help Jefferson gain self-worth and pride before he is put to death.Gaines takes this background and adds struggles and roadblocks that make the story enthralling. The elements of anger and frustration help the reader relate to what Grant is dealing with.The message of opression for blacks and supremacy for whites is what leads Grant to realize how important Jefferson is, to not only Jefferson's ill godmother, but as a symbol of the whole African American race. Grant says, \\" To them, you're nothing but another nigger--no dignity, no heart, no love for your people. You can prove them wrong...Because we need you to be and want you to be.\\" This line, one of many emotional and heartfelt speeches by Grant, really exposes his anger and disgust with the way things are and how his future is dependent on Jefferson believing in himself or not.Other reviews commented on the fact that A Lesson Before Dying is long and drawn out. Although there is a lack of action in the middle, these pages are used for developing the plot and adding more tension to the characters and their relationships. Overall, the book is an incredible emotional ride that will elicit feelings out of anyone. This story is an excellent \\"pick up\\" and read book recommended for anyone."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"In a Cajun Community in Louisiana, a young man is about to go to jail for a crime that he did not commit. A white man had died and the blame was all on him. He now was going to go to the Electric Chair and there wasn't anything that he could do. He had lost all respect from everyone, this was Grant Wiggin's job to show all the white people that he was really a great person and was raised the right way. Grant Wiggins, the university educated, was forced to visit Jefferson by his aunt who made him go and teach him some things about life. The only problem about this was that Grant didn't even no how to handle life. Grant always grew hearing other people say that he wouldn't be anything than a black man. Grant was always encouraged by this and because of this he left the town for a few years and then came back to be a school teacher. Throughout the entire book Grant is wishing and dreaming about taking Vivian and leaving the town forever. The main point that I got out of this Book was no matter what happens, you have to stand up for you did or may not have done. I feel that A Lesson Before Dying is a great book that gives a life meaning message."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"I read the cover of this book and decided to read it based on the fact that it is regarded as a classic and seemed interesting. Since this book is fairly well known and the editorial review gives a good synopsis of it, I won't get too much into the details of the story. Instead I'll just focus on what I got out of this powerful novel.It has been said many times that living as a black man even in a highly racist society is easy. If one wishes to fight the white supremist establishment however, it will be hard. Sometimes the hard way is the best way though. In the time period depicted in this book, if a black man stepped out of his place and wanted to be something other than subhuman, then he found much opposition.Grant Wiggins, a school teacher was one of a few blacks from a small cajun community in the late 1940s who found empowerment through resisting the white power establishment. Grant Wiggins grew up around mostly uneducated people none of whom encouraged him to go the college and become a teacher. He did however have people discourage him and tell him that he will always be nothing more than what the white man wants him to be. Wiggins aunt (Jefferson's godmother) encourages him to visit Jefferson in prison and make him a man. After a certain point in the story, the best that Jefferson could do was to become something that none of the whites thought he was or could ever become.The main message I got out of the book is the importance of standing up and being who you really are regardless of the situation. Applying this in our everyday lives sends a very powerful message others who wish to break our spirit."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"A book dealing with the problems of African-Americans in the 1950's, this book mainly concentrates on the life of a black man, Jefferson, sentenced to die and a friend, Grant, trying to make him realize his humanity. Though dealing with the problems of a specific minority, the book can easily be extended for all people in all minority groups. Though not all would have to deal with aspects like racism, they would have also have problems with oppression. Heroism and heroes or lack of them might be one of those problems. The life of the characters is awful and explicitly described by the author. Gaines's mostly simple and concise sentences show everything he wants to show and the rest is left up to the reader. This book is a book that traverses cultural boundaries, and can be applied to anyone and everyone. Overall however, though it tells of other things, the book tells about its own title: A lesson before dying."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"all of us on this earth, a piece of drinting wood, until we-each one of us, individually - decide to be something better.&quot;So Grant Higgins, school teacher in an African-American bayou community, tells Jefferson, a young black man sentenced to death for a murder he did not commit. While defending Jefferson, his public defender told the jury he was no better or worse than a hog, but his godmother was determined to allow him some dignity at his death. So, she pleaded with Grant to visit him at the jail, to teach him how to be a man. Through their relationship, both Grant and Jefferson learned about dignity, compassion, and how to live both in a world that was unkind and unfair to those of their race.This book is amazing, and should be read by everyone. The ending isn't a surprise - you don't need to speed through the book to see where it is going. But, the writing of the book, and what it reveals about the human condition, are astonishing and should be savored."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"A Lesson Before Dying, written by Ernest J. Gaines, is a good book, that is very touching. The character, Grant Wiggins, who is the local schoolteacher, struggles with the concept of helping the man, Jefferson, who is convicted of a murder he did not commit. Jefferson's godmother wants Grant to help Jefferson become a man before he dies, but Jefferson is not very willing to listen to Grant. Grant is also not very eager to help. It is a very emotional story of the end of a life, before it is taken by the electric chair.The beginning chapters were a very good lead into the rest of the book. It was easy to understand the plot. The author easily conveyed the importance of the man, Jefferson, learning a lesson before he dies. Unlike other books, which have a slow pace to them and fail to keep the interest of most, A Lesson Before Dying is very fast paced. It makes the reader want to read it from the beginning to the end without stopping. The chapters are short, so if the reader does needs to put it down here are frequent stopping places. The length of the chapters makes the book more enjoyable. It does not seem like it takes so long to get to the end of the chapter. It also does not keep dragging on about the same thing over and over. It introduces new characters to liven up the story when the old characters seem to be getting boring. The best chapter, and the one that most touches the heart, is the chapter from Jefferson's diary. It really gives insight into how Jefferson is feeling. The diary completes the story line of the book. It was very wise of the author to include this chapter. Without it he would not have evoked the same feelings from the reader at the end.Anyone who enjoys reading sentimental books, but does not enjoy the mushy, romantic kind, would really love this book."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"Ernest J. Gaines' novel, A Lesson Before Dying exhibits a young man's transformation from believing he crawls like a hog, to believing he walks like a man. Gaines uses local color and his study of Creoles to bring the novel to life. I absolutely love this book, because it shows representation of honor and heroism in two black men, Grant Wiggins and Jefferson, in their lives in Louisiana. Grant lives metaphorically through Jefferson's imprisonment from a conviction of murder which he did not commit, and the two men struggle together to defy the unexpected and become heroes of the town. Gaines creates a hopeful tone through the novel, and he emphasizes the motif of quiet heroism to prove that faith will keep a man strong so that he may find his dignity. Gaines establishes a hopeful tone through similies, references to southern black Christianity, and motifs. The novel begins comparing his godmother to a &quot;great stone&quot; which represents the stable black women as support for the men. Miss Emma serves the purpose of keeping the hope alive for the young men and trying to instill faith in both of them. As Grant's aunt tries to her religion on him, he only thinks, &quot;I didn't believe anymore and I didn't want her to try forcing it on me.&quot; His aunt never gives up, because the only way Jefferson will learn the faith is through Grant. this task seems impossible to Grant, because he knows that he cannot make a man pray if he does not pray himself. Grant needstrength, and Revernd Ambrose tries to convince him to ask God. He in forms Grant that, &quot;you would have the strength if you had God.&quot; The novel works its way to gaines' motif of inevitable change by Grant's visits and teaching sessions to Jefferson. The change has to face the status quo and thoughts of others, including the sheriff who thinks, &quot;Nobody can make that thing a man. Saying might as well let him go like his is.&quot; Jefferson's change from a hog to a man is compared to a butterfly and its metamorphosis. Grant wonders if there ever was a change in Jefferson, and Paul convinces him by letting him know that, &quot;I saw the transformation. I'm a witness to that.&quot; Everyones hope helps the men in their battle against the status quo. Gaines produces a motif of quiet heroism from symbolism and references to heroes. Jackie Robinson is a hero of the times and Miss Emma presses Jefferson to be like him in that he stands like a man to become a hero. Jefferson's heroism also compares to Crist. Grant's classroom has a picture of The Last Supper which compares to Jefferson's last meal before the execution. Another picture is of Christ knocking on a door, and it represents Jefferson knocking on the door of hope and faith.Jefferson cannot be executed during Lent, because the town will not allow it. Grant remembers, &quot;because of our state's heavily Catholic population, it might not go well to have two executions just before the beginning of Lent.&quot; Jefferson is scheduled to die between the hours of noon and three which is the time of Christ's crucifix. The town knows that a man can be humiliated and still stand from Jefferson's example. The two men learn from each other, and come to possess the quality of quiet heroism. A Lesson Before Dying is a lesson to everyone to follow their heart and always keep hope. Having hope in life and focusing on goal can make anyone a hero. This novel is a reminder that one should never lose hope, because a struggle for one man can be seen as a great victory and savior for many others. I really enjoy this novel, because it teaches valuable life lessons!"},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"Book review: A lesson before dyingA Lesson Before Dying, by Ernest J.

Gaines writes a poignant story about an African American youth in the 40's who is in the wrong place at the wrong time. He is accused of a murder, that took place in his presence and is sentenced to die by electric chair. Jefferson was raised by his Aunt Emma, who had done everything for him since he was abandoned by his own parents, at an early age. There is only one thing that she is asking for, before she passes on, and there is only one man in the town who can do it, and that is the teacher, the nephew of her best friend Tante Lou. Aunt Emma gave up on saving Jefferson's life, when the court found him guilty and asks the parish teacher to make him 'youman' so that he can die as a man. All his life all that Jefferson ever did was work like a dog on a plantation, and though there was a school, for the blacks in the town, it was, at least in Jefferson's school days, grossly inadequate. But, Aunt Emma was asking the wrong guy, because Grant Wiggins just wanted to get away, run away from the forlorn Louisiana town where he had grown up, before it was too late.The characterizations are well rounded and the settings are vivid, you will feel like you know the people and have been to Louisiana, in all of it's picturesque and tragic beauty.

Don't miss this powerful book!"},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"For all who haven't read this book, I would definitely suggest reading it in the near future. It isn't the most exciting and exhilarating book ever written, but over all there is a good message that comes out of reading it.The story is about a black man named Jefferson who is accused of robbing and murdering a white liquor store owner. Hoping for Jefferson's innocence the jury finds Jefferson guilty and puts him in jail until the date is set for his execution. Jefferson takes the snide comment from the defense attorney about him being a \\"dumb hog\\" to heart and no longer thinks of himself as human. After finding out that her godson was sent to jail and sentenced to electrocution, Miss Emma, Jefferson's godmother, is determined to make Jefferson think he is human again and for him to regain his self respect.In order to do this she asks a local school teacher, Grant Wiggins, to visit Jefferson in jail until he comes around again. After several visits, Jefferson, as well as Grant who has also been having some struggles in his life, finally begins to regain his self respect and knowledge of the importance of life. Grant realizes that his life might not be as bad off as he thought since he isn't the one stuck in jail about to die. This recollection builds up Grant's hope and faith that he is able to make a difference in Jefferson's life. The big question is whether or not Jefferson realizes the importance of life and if he will walk with his head held high on the day of his execution.Overall, the book was very inspirational and made you value the importance of life. Some people in the world have a lot more trials and struggles in their life than others. We need to all realize that even if there is a time when we are struggling, we probably aren't as bad off as a lot of people. The book was very well written and made you reflect on how you are living your life. The only weakness that I saw personally in the book was that it was a little slow. It was easy reading, but many of the same things kept happening over and over. The whole book was based in the same location which made me loose a little interest. These weaknesses however are small and shouldn't stop you from reading this inspirational novel."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"We were very frustrated by the Audible version of this work.

I must say, this was one of the best school reads that I've had the pleasure to read.Gaines has a wonderful way of not only setting the scene but also drawing you into it. It doesn't matter what your background is or how likely you are to relate to the characters or atmosphere. You'll get hooked into the story and find yourself actually caring what happens in the book as well as what the characters will do. This book really does deserve its status as a favored school read as far as general scholastic reads go since it does a great job of showing us what life was like for so many African-Americans during the 1940s. It was a little startling to me to read some of the things since while I'd read about them in class, Gaines made it feel like I was reading and hearing about these things for the first time.The only bit of criticism I'd give is that there are large stretches where not much really happens and I can't help but feel that it could have been condensed a little bit more than it was. Some of the elements of the book didn't need quite as much page time to get to where it was going, which sort of disconnected me from the story now and then. It didn't overly dilute the bigger story here, but it was enough to where I know it'll bore some readers.Even so, this is definitely a story that you should read or watch (the film, that is) at some point in time."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"Gaines made you feel as if you were right there with the characters the whole time.

Sad, straightforward plot.Because I don't like to know too much about a story before I read it for myself, I didn't know that the setting was 1940s Louisiana, so was appalled in the first few pages that Jefferson had such an unfair trial where even his defending counsel was racist. But...1940s Louisiana...no, this is not an unrealistic situation, it was all too common.Grant Wiggins, the local teacher who is telling the story, is not very likeable, mostly because he doesn't like himself. He is educated, he is sometimes brutal to his students, and he has let life be sucked out of him, he is trapped. And he is a most unlikely person to be given the task of helping Jefferson learn to be a man before he is executed.Some of the dialogue is written in huge paragraphs, the speakers bouncing back and forth multiple times in the same paragraph, and it was hard to understand. I don't know why it was written that way when most of the dialogue is written traditionally. There were several pages written as a minimally educated person would write, and those took some time to understand, enough interpretation that it took away from what the person was truly saying.I wanted to know more about Jefferson earlier in the book, but he was revealed slowly, as Grant learned more about him, and more about himself. For the most part, I liked the characterization but a couple of people felt too much like stereotypes to me. The story was touching and sad and, as fiction, all too real."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"In the segregated South, a man named Jefferson has been roped into a robbery that turns into a murder. A white shopkeeper is dead, and so are the two black men who held the guns. Jefferson, who was just there at the last minute and wasn't planning on causing trouble, is the only man left to stand trial, so naturally he is conviced and sentenced to death.In his closing argument, however, Jefferson's attorney argues that Jefferson can't be sentenced to death, because he doesn't have the mental capacity to plan and execute such a murder. He isn't a man; he is no better than a hog and nothing can be gained from killing him.Jefferson's godmother is just as distressed by this argument as she is by the death sentence. She turns to her best friend's nephew, Grant, the local black schoolteacher, to change everyone's opinion of her godson. She knows he is going to die, but it is important to her that he die with dignity, as a man and not an animal. She wants Grant to visit Jefferson in jail and somehow make a man out of him, something he can't figure out how to do.Grant is unhappy. He doesn't think he can do anything for Jefferson. He feels like a fraud. He hates teaching but feels like it is his only option as a college-educated black man in this time and place. He regrets not running away, but makes no plans to get away now, either. The local reverend is holding a grudge against him because Grant doesn't attend church and the reverend is worried that he will turn Jefferson's soul away from religion.The basic idea of this story is an interesting one, and it is frustrating to read about the myriad small ways that blacks were made to feel inferior to whites in this time. It is hard to read about Grant's visit from the superintendant who ignores his request for better supplies, or to read about Grant being made to wait for over two hours to speak with the sheriff about visiting Jefferson. It is maddening to read about a country in which such things were considered normal and acceptable.However, I felt that this book fell short of its potential. Grant was a thoroughly unlikable character, who made a poor narrator. He didn't like his life, yet refused to leave the town he felt was so stifling. He was unkind to his students and unkind to his aunt and to Jefferson's godmother. I ended up not caring much if he was able to carry out his mission to make Jefferson a man by the time he was executed."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"I have to admit, this isn't the worst in-class reading assignment I've ever had to sit through.

Gaines is a very descriptive author, with amazing character development. You really gain a wonderful understanding of the characters and their relationship with each other. It is also a great depiction of the time period it is based in, and has a perfect point of view from the african community during that time.However, the book often seems hard to follow. It's drawn out, and you may very well be half way through the book before you actually find the main point of the story. As such, I would most likely never have been able to finish it on my own.

Gaines is a prime example of how a man must face himself and own up to his own burden in life. The story is about two black men who learn about possibly the most important lesson in life, God. Understanding God and death is a lifelong task that is extremely complex. The two main characters attempt to learn not only the tangible, but the intangible too. The tangible is mathematics, english, and ultimately how to become a civilized man. The intangible is something the teacher, Mr. Wiggins, even doubts himself. The intangible is God. Their burden is to learn these things together, and to teach Jefferson how to accept his death and injustices like a man. In the story both characters go through a change.&quot; You shut up, or get up,&quot; I said. &quot;I mean that.&quot;(199) Grant hears two men in a bar talking about Jefferson like a hog, and he finally decides to fight for his race and not be afraid anymore. He learns how to fight for his race out of his care for Jefferson. That is one of the lessons that Jefferson taught Grant. Not to be afraid anymore; however, at this point in time that behavior from a black man is trouble. Jefferson ends up being the brevest man to walk to the chair, and that is told by the courtroom witness Paul. At the end, Grant thinks the change is a miracle from God. Grant finally learns his lesson on a deeper perspective of prejudice; moreover, he learns that you can change things. You can learn about god and about life also. That may be the lesson that occurs before we all die."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"\\"A Lesson Before Dying\\"Ernest GainesWhen reading the suspenseful book, \\"A Lesson before Dying\\" by Ernest Gaines, we felt sorrow not only because Jefferson, the main character was black and uneducated., He was treated unfairly by society because of the color of his skin and for a crime he did not commit.

The main character, Grant, feels trapped in a society that still judges people by how dark their skin is.

The public defender basically strips him of his humanity in court by referring to him as a &quot;hog&quot;. A schoolteacher (the narrator, Grant Wiggins) is coerced by his aunt and the prisoner's godmother to visit the young man and impart to him a sense of dignity, enabling him to die like a man and not a beast. Of course, there is always more to a book like this than the simple story. It brings alive a time and place that is in the past, although not far enough. The unspoken protocol between blacks and whites of that time illustrates the ever-present racism of that period. No wonder Wiggins wants to escape, to leave that world in which he is indeed as much a prisoner as the condemned young man Jefferson. The learning that takes place is mutual, and the learning is there for each reader that will open his or her heart and let this powerful book speak to the soul."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"A Lesson Before Dying is set in a small town during the 1940s.

The book begins with a boy, named Jefferson, being accused of a murder in which three people died. Jefferson did nothing wrong except that he was there and witnessed the crime. Most people would not think much of a person witnessing a crime and being put on trial, but Jefferson was African American and the time period was 75 years after the Civil War. The state was Louisiana, a state that fought for slavery, so that indicates why he is sentenced to die. Jefferson's defense attorney should have been penalized for mow practice, but that wasn't around back then. Jefferson's attorney said that sentencing Jefferson to the chair would be like killing a hog.That statement put Jefferson's mother into distress. She then asked Grant Wiggins, an old teacher of Jefferson's, to turn Jefferson into a man. Grant did not want to attempt this difficult task but his Aunt, whom he was staying with, forced him to do it. Grant teaches to elementary kids at the church. Grant no longer goes to church and because of this he fails to see inside himself.After visiting Jefferson for some period of time, Grant begins to see where his life is going and in which way he would really want it to go.

The setting is a small town in the 1940's. Jefferson is on trial for robbery and murder. This is the time of segregation. Although there was evidence of him not committing murder, he was still sentence to death row because the juries were all white. During this time there was a lot of discrimination against black. So Jefferson was not given a fair trial. To the white Juries he was a black man. To them he was already guilty. Also during the trial his own lawyer called Jefferson a hog.Although the book is about Jefferson, the main character is Grant Wiggins. He is a school's teacher in the town where Jefferson is. Grant promised Jefferson's godmother to make Jefferson into a man but Grant himself doesn't know the meaning to be a man. As Jefferson is waiting for the day of his execution, Grant tries to talk to Jefferson as much as possible. As the execution day draws nearer, Grant and Jefferson will form a bond of friendship.Although this book was a very good, I didn't like it because I like to read mystery books.

About how they are treat more like a \\"hog\\" than human. Although this book was very good, there was a lot of part where it was very boring and confusing.Critical ReactionThe themes of the story for A Lesson Before Dying are based on Gaines ideology. &quot;We all know--at least intellectually--that we're going [to die]. The difference is being told, 'Okay, it's tomorrow at 10 a.m.' How do you react to that? How do you face it? That, it seems to me, is the ultimate test of life. Quote by Ernest J Gaines, by Vintage Books. That quote tells of how Jefferson feels. Knowing that the exact date and time of his death. The author is trying to tells the reader what it would be like to be on death row for something of which you have not done and discrimination of which the people during that time had to endure.The author writing style is a bit unusual. Although the story is about Jefferson, throughout the entire story I mainly focus on Grant. Throughout the story it mostly focus on Grant and his life. It wasn't until the end that the author let the readers read about Jefferson perspective. It wasn't until the very end that the readers will know about what Jefferson was thinking.Throughout the story there was too much unnecessary information that the author put in. So that made the reading boring for me. It talks too much about Grant's life instead of more about Jefferson.

Gaines not only adresses the prejudices the blacks face from outside their race but also the inter-racial troubles that they face. It talks of how the educated colored men of the south no longer will associate with the lower classes and how this is stripping down the cultures pride.

The author included many faces of the issue: the blacks, the educated and the uneducated; mulattos; attitudes among blacks toward light skinned and dark skinned; the arrogant whites of that era and their wives (who played significant behind the scene roles); black family culture. It is all there and well written. I wish the author had written more about the friendship that developed between Grant and Jefferson.

Characters could have been defined more. On Oprah's show, she asked audience members if they &quot;got the lesson&quot;. Well I know the prisoner became a man before he died, but I can't quite grasp the lesson. Is it because of Grant's injustice that he experienced.

I appreciated the authors insights and development of intra-racial issues between Grant, Jefferson, Vivian and the other inhabitants of the plantation. Jefferson's diary and Paul's visit to the school house are powerful images that are well told by the author. Overall, however, &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; far out shines this book's handling of the subject matter -- and it was told from a white perspective.

I found myself fascinated by the main characters. I always wanted to know what was going to happen and that kept me turning the pages. However, I was never convinced that the characters Jefferson and Grant were really connecting as much as Grant believed they were. Grant's romantic interest with Vivian gave an interesting human dimension to the story but never seemed an integral part of the main story. In short, I enjoyed the book while I was reading it, but always wanted more information than was forthcoming. Perhaps that's realism."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"Ernest Gaines did a terrific job with bringing the reader to the scene and feeling the plantation life.

Over all a good book, but not a masterpiece."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"This novel gives a good depiction of what life must have been like for a black community in southern Louisiana before civil rights. The writing is restrained and unsentimental, almost to the point of bleakness. I wish Gaines would not be so clipped and obviously self-edited in his style.

Ernest J. Gaines does an excellent job of setting the mood of 1940's southern life of black America. This book shows beautifully the relationship of Grant Wiggins and the many people that surround his life, the school children, his girlfriend Vivian, and of course Jefferson, the wrongly condemned man about to be executed. A Lesson Before Dying illustrates that the people we percieve as needy (Jefferson) actually are the ones that give the most. He really changed the life of Wiggins while going through his own transformation before death. The pages from his notebook were difficult to decifer but so compelling and the story is really revealed within those few pages. A Lesson Before Dying, read it. -Angela Bernardoni-"},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"It is late 1940s' Louisiana. A simple-minded black man is wrongly accused and convicted of murdering a white owner of a liquor store. He is condemned to death in the electric chair. The setting is familiar to readers of American literature, but the lesson to follow is not. Gaines has brilliantly woven a tale of bravery vs. cowardice; strong vs. weak by creating a hero of the humble prisoner and giving meaning and direction to the life of a reluctant, mediocre teacher. The teacher, the malcontent Grant Wiggins, has been bullied by his aunt and her grieving friend, the aunt of the jailed boy, into making a man of him before he dies. This project is launched when, during the trial, the white defense lawyer referred to the captive, as nothing more than a farm animal. A &quot;hog&quot; to be precise. At the aunts' relentless urging, Wiggins drags himself to the jailhouse weekly with no idea how to begin this lesson, when he hasn't learned it for himself. How can a man can die like a man if he has never lived like a man? The text to follow, particularly the prisoner's diary, is an amazing, inspiring piece of work. A winner of the 1994 National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction, A LESSON BEFORE DYING is certainly worth reading."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"A Lesson Before Dying is about relationships. Relationships between a man and a woman, a man and his family, and a man and society. All incorporated in a wonderful and powerful story. It takes place in the 1940's where a young black man will be executed for the murder of a white store owner. During the trial, his lawyer tells the jury of white men that executing the young man would be like strapping a hog to the electric chair. His godmother doesn't want the world to see a hog executed, but a man. So the local black schoolteacher's services are offered up to make sure that no &quot;hog&quot; is to be executed. It is a wonderful book. It is the perfect example of &quot;walk softly and carry a big stick&quot;. Gaines does this literally. The language is elegant which makes the emotions all the more powerful. I was moved. Read this book, not because it is Oprah's pick, read it if you are a fan of a good story. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"Was I ever pleasantly surprised at what a fast read with such deep implicaitons was contained between the covers of this book! It is set in the lives of a condemed man and his loved ones in Louisiana in the early 1950's. The book begins with Jefferson rail-roaded for a murder due to the color of his skin, rather then the evidence. Even his own defense attorney refers to him as a 'hog' in his closing argument. This affront to Jefferson's humanity sets both the community and him on a quest for respect and resolution before his impending execution. The social injustice is haunting and the resolutions are memorable."},{"Title":"The Private Eye","review":"If you like your romance steamy, your men hot and your women feisty then these two stories are a must-have for your collection. Jayne Ann Krentz gives us a vintage tale of love, lust and confusion between detective Josh January and innkeeper Maggie Gladstone. This is wonderful Krentz stuff, the affair is believable, the characters charming and the story holds us to the last kiss! Lori Foster gives us a harder-edged tale of brotherly love taken to a new dimension when Dane Carter replaces identical (and dead) twin Derek at the helm of their company and in the bed of former girlfriend Angel Morris. A tale that could have become sloppy and unpleasant remains taut and enthralling, the steamy sensuality will melt your heart and leave you cheering for the eventually triumphant couple. Cetainly the plots are predictable, and there is little mystery in whodunnit, but do we buy romances for mystery? You'll find plenty of what we do buy romances for between the covers of this book!!!"},{"Title":"The Private Eye","review":"Jayne Anne Krentz has written a wonderful romance between a streetwise, cynical detective and an innocent, small-town girl. The mystery is light, the romance is crackling. Best of all is the spunky trio of elderly tenants. These three leap off the pages, giving the hero and heroine's romance a push, a nudge, and a downright shove. PRIVATE EYE is a classic romance that will have you flipping the pages to get to the fantastic ending.

He thinks he's got a hot lead when Angel Morris walks into his--Derek's--office. The more he learns of her relationship with his brother--that Derek had betrayed her trust, had her fired from her job, fathered her child, then left her--the more it looks like Angel could be Derek's killer. Yet, the more he learns of Angel, the more he knows it isn't her. When it turns out someone is trying to kill Angel, Dane is left with finding the real killer and protecting the woman he loves.Lori Foster's ability to pull readers into the story and not let go until the very last page is what makes her such an enduring favorite!"},{"Title":"The Private Eye","review":"I always enjoy Jayne Ann Krentz's books, and this one was no different.

It's wonderful to finally get a chance to read this book. I was not disappointed by the trademark sizzling romance and good-natured humor.The Lori Foster novel was an enjoyable read as well, although I did have some complaints about the wimpiness and naivete of the heroine. I probably would not have tried this author had she not been paired with Ms. Krentz, but I will keep an eye out for her books in the future."},{"Title":"The Private Eye","review":"BEGUILED is a masterful mystery full of snap and sizzle. Not only will you be left guessing until the end, but you'll be fanning yourself too. As always, Foster manages to make the air positively electric between her well-written hero and heroine. Look for WANTON, a spin off from BEGUILED, to hit store shelves in October. It's sure to be as sinful as its name."},{"Title":"The Private Eye","review":"First, let me say this was a good book. I love a hero who is burned out and a heroine who looks for the good in people. But...I found myself constantly looking at the author's name to verify that it said Jayne Ann Krentz on the cover. There was none of her signature humor or crackling sexual tension. As it has a 1999 copyright date, I would expect her usual style. Could this be a much older book that wasn't published until 1999? If you're a JAK fan, you might be disappointed. If you like sweet romance with a little sex and interesting minor characters, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Private Eye","review":"This book was okay but it didn't sizzle by any stretch of the imagination.

I loved every minute of it. After reading it I went out and bought four other Lori Foster books. I like authors who don't portray the hero as a wimpy romantic. Her male characters are more masculine, while still being romantic. I happen to have three older brothers, me being the only girl in the family, so I can also say I like her female characters better, because they are not all wishy washy.

It has instantly moved into position as one of my favorite Winterreise. Rowe's voice is strong, lilting and unpretentious. Always on pitch, with blessedly no portentous \\"lieder-grumble\\" and not a trace of affectation, but with plenty of musical drama. The pianist Fischer is quite forceful but paradoxically a little genteel in spots. But the approach slyly works somehow in a way that fits an updated Biedermeier masterpiece, with the edges smoothed elegantly, but not too much. It is all really beautiful, simply put. And the recorded sound is outstanding! The voice comes through with no echo, glare or boominess and piano sounds really gorgeous, never rumbly even in very loud passages. What a treat this is. I will be interested to check out the accompanying book some day if I see it. This is why I keep buying Cds."},{"Title":"Schubert's Winterreise: A Winter Journey in Poetry, Image, and Song","review":"The book arrived on time and was in good condition but the back cover was soiled.

I had read a Gardner novel many years ago, and was impressed by the superlative writing style he employs. The work almost reads as easily as a good novel, and doesn't wholeheartedly fall into the category of literary criticism. Chaucer is portrayed sympathetically, as a civil servant you would like to know. Excerpts from his poems are presented in the original middle English, with a pronunciation guide in the back of the book. It is a challenge to read the original texts, but well worth it.If you are interested in Chaucer's life, his work, or 14th Century England written in a vibrantly readable style, you will enjoy this book. The knowledge imparted resembles a textbook, but the writing style resembles a well written novel."},{"Title":"The Life and Times of Chaucer","review":"In this bio, the times are far more interesting than the life. TO make his living as a poet, Chaucer was courtier and upper-level functionary. Much of his life he kept accounts of customs houses, oversaw building projects, and acted as a lawyer and judge, all the while ingratiating himself to aristocratic patrons and the kings. He gave readings of his poems, which were bawdy and splendid with ironies and piquant observations, establishing himself as the greatest poet in Europe of his age and creating a great legacy. However, not only is very very little known of his intimate life, but the details that have been unearthed by scholars in obscure archives are simply banal.The times are very interesting. First, his life covered the close of the 100 years war, a time of military necessity that anticipated the rise of the absolutist state, with its creation of an administrative apparatus the likes of which the world had never seen. Chaucer was a cog in this evolving machine, which accepted administrators of talent from bourgeois households while subordinating aristocrats to the crown. Second, there were a series of interesting kings, from the legacy of the eccentrically incompetent Edward II to his beloved son (Ed III) until the megalomaniacal Richard II. These developments are covered with beautiful, succinct descriptions that are a pleasure to read. Chaucer knew most of the famous and infamous, including the black prince, John of Gaunt, the notorious courtesan Alice Perrers, and many others. He was also a diplomat, negotiating marriage and trade agreements as well as a representative of the crown that required travel all over England. Nonetheless, there were many functionaries like Chaucer and nothing that he did contributed anything original to this incredible political period, however much he was at the scene and hence a good vehicle to evoke it all.Unfortunately, the book also attempts to address the innumerable scholarly questions about when and where Chaucer wrote various works. These long stretches are so dull to the lay reader that they can be skipped easily, to find the nuggets of The Times that are far more fun. Gardner also speculates way too much on the unknowable details of Chaucer's intimate life, such as whether he loved his wife, whether he married her at the behest of his patron to conceal the fact that an aristocrat had impregnated her. Some of this is common sense, but much of it is interpreted in light of his poetry. This fills more than half of the book and was a complete bore to me. Only a specialized academic would find it of interest or even relevant to the narrative.The book is not easy to read. There are many sections with long quotes, sometimes a page or more, of the archaic English of the time. This adds to the tedium, unless the reader is fluent in middle english. However, Gardner is a wonderful stylist: his prose is uniquely original and elegant.REcommended for scholars, Gardner fans, and determined lay readers. It is not for the general reader."},{"Title":"The Life and Times of Chaucer","review":"John Gardner in his The Life and Times of Chaucer starts by modestly offering what he hopes to achieve. This person found it fascinating. John Gardner makes many logical cases to fill in the blanks and why he sometimes differs from other opinions. The book could have been slightly longer but not still be a quick read, What it did for this person is to gain greater understanding and obtain additional books on prior and later centuries. The amount of subjects and considerations is vast and may have been further addressed in his other books."},{"Title":"The Life and Times of Chaucer","review":"While Gardner clearly has the command of the facts regarding Chaucer's life, I found this biography for some reason tough to get into. Then on page 37 I ran into a 177 word sentence/paragraph. While it was possible to follow Gardner' thought through this maze, this pointed to the reason why I was having to work so hard. As far as I can tell, nobody representing the reader touched this lumpened mass. Far from being an exception, my guess is the average sentence in this book is well north of 50-60 words. In addition to massive run-on sentences, Gardner repeatedly uses the first person, which I found most distracting. Normal biography protocol is for the biographer to not make themselves an obvious participant in the presentation (even if they are). For some reason Gardner wants us readers to think about _him, the writer. Well, as has been said, you don't need to eat the whole egg to know it is rotten. Page 37 was as far as I was willing to go. Gardner's book may have lots of interesting information but the presentation makes the reading too much of a slog to be worth it. There are too many books and not enough time ... at least not enough for The Life and Times of Chaucer by Gardner."},{"Title":"The Guns of Valverde","review":"As an avid student of the U. S. Civil War in the Southwest, and a frequent visitor to the battlefields and other skirmish sites in the &quot;Territory of New Mexico,&quot; I found P G Nagle's work on Guns of Valverde just as riveting as her previous work entitled Glorieta Pass. Ms. Nagle has carefully researched her subject matter as shown by her attention to historical facts and then masterfully woven them into a story bringing this period of time to life. The fact that I'm so familiar with the factual information helped me enjoy both this latest of her works and the previous one tremendously. I was able to absorb more of the fictional account without having to stop to confirm or contest the factual elements. But whether or not the average reader is knowledgeable about the Civil War in New Mexico is unimportant since Ms. Nagle continues to impress me as a superb storyteller.Ever since The Killer Angels by Shaara and Ulysses by Skimmin were written I have attempted to read more of these historical novels, finding the majority of them to be extremely well written, factual to my satisfaction, and entertaining. Guns of Valverde, like Glorieta Pass, definitely fit into this category. I look forward to Ms. Nagle's sequel entitled Galveston which, I understand, is a work in progress."},{"Title":"Political Economics: Explaining Economic Policy (Zeuthen Lectures)","review":"The authors understand that the study of political institutions drives political science and apply economic principles to do this methodologically. This book evaluates various political institutions in their barest forms and derives intuitive results for their expected performance using elementary economic modelling techniques.

The authors are pioneers in what they do, but, unfortunately, are not likely to be accepted as mainstream political scientists."},{"Title":"Swingin' on the Grapevine","review":"The book is a compilation of articles written by Marilois Bach for the Weekly Vista Newpaper in Bella Vista, Arkansas."},{"Title":"The Jewel Ornament Of Liberation: The Wish-Fulfilling Gem Of The Noble Teachings","review":"From the back cover: \\"This is a masterwork of Tibetan Buddhism.

But my greatest compliment for this text is the simple acknowledgement that my personal spiritual practice took shape and deepened considerably as a result of reading and re-reading and referring to this text.I highly recommend it for any serious-minded spiritual student, not just those interested in Tibetan Buddhism.--Robert McDowell, author of the forthcoming Poetry In Spiritual Practice"},{"Title":"The Jewel Ornament Of Liberation: The Wish-Fulfilling Gem Of The Noble Teachings","review":"An overview of the Buddhist path.In Jewel Ornament, it says that reading teachings from Gampopa is the same as receiving teachings from him, and truly I think that is the case- this book not only gives you words, but also a strong blessing to develop towards enlightenment. It has been said that anyone who fully understands Jewel Ornament fully understands Mahayana Buddhism.After reading this book, my Buddhist view is much more complete, and feels as though it will not let me down, as it's based on understanding rather than just words."},{"Title":"The Jewel Ornament Of Liberation: The Wish-Fulfilling Gem Of The Noble Teachings","review":"This book is suitable only for practicing Buddhists as it lists a lot of what constitutes good karma and what constitutes bad karma and the consequences of each. Many of the consequences are repetitive, thus making this book resemble a law book. In addition, the author extracts the same point from many other texts, thus making it once more very repetitive. The list is not elaborated further, thus raising a lot of questions. This book surely must be read with a guidance from a teacher."},{"Title":"The Jewel Ornament Of Liberation: The Wish-Fulfilling Gem Of The Noble Teachings","review":"Most people I know are using to say \\"that's a hard time to live in\\".

I've found it very useful as a source of supplemental information and alternative perspectives on various topics that have arisen in my studies. For example, a common Buddhist teaching that people are instructed by their Lama to start with is the teaching on \\"The four thoughts that turn the mind toward the dharma.\\" I think Kalu Rinpoche's book \\"Foundations of Tibetan Buddhism\\" is a much better book to learn about the four thoughts, but Gampopa's text is very useful to expand and elaborate on that knowledge."},{"Title":"The Jewel Ornament Of Liberation: The Wish-Fulfilling Gem Of The Noble Teachings","review":"This is a very valuable reference text for any student of buddhism. It is as someone else has stated, great for use in a study group."},{"Title":"The Jewel Ornament Of Liberation: The Wish-Fulfilling Gem Of The Noble Teachings","review":"S. Gampopa was the primary disciple of Milarepa (famed for his songs & many legends of accomplishments--e.g. reaching enlightenment after having murdered people via black magic). But, this isn't primarily a Mahamudra (MM) book. It's more basic. It's valuable having \\"classics\\" translated, but it's oriented towards Vajrayana (Tibetan Buddhism) mythology, ritual practices, etc. IMHO it could have a more balanced approach--though of course it is a Medieval text. I prefer more practice-oriented works--especially the \\"evanescent\\" (per Namgyal)=\\"skipping the grades\\" (per Rangdrol) type. This book is more gradual e.g. Lam Rim teachings. Tsele Natsok Randr&ouml;l in his \\"Empowerment & the Path of Liberation\\" says: p. 67: \\"'The Wish Fulfilling Jewel Ornament of Liberation' establishes an understanding which unifies the 2 streams of Kadampa & MM...it emphasizes the Sutra system, & was written to show the stages of the Mahayana path. The explanation of emptiness...adheres mainly to the Middle Way view...This book does conform with the general vehicles. The actual view of MM, however, is clarified in Lord Gampopa's \`Revealing the Hidden Points of Oral Instruction,' and other of his works.\\" So this book doesn't provide a sufficient explanation of MM but does contain a few good quotes: page 144: \\"A Bodhisattva must always think: Today I will accumulate Merits and spiritual awareness and bring merits to all beings.\\" p. 231, note #40: \\"Reality has nothing to do with the concepts we create about it and then believe to encompass it.\\" p. 273: \\"Mind works for the benefit of others without premeditation.\\""},{"Title":"Flocabulary: The Hip-Hop Approach to SAT-Level Vocabulary Building (Flocabulary Study Guides)","review":"I'm a student that has always had trouble memorizing vocabulary words... I got the equivalent of a 710 Critical Reading on the PSAT, and one of my weaknesses is vocabulary, which makes me lose around 20-40 points. It's just ridiculously boring and I forget the words a week later anyways, but I was introduced to new methods of memorization with Rock the SAT, the first book I bought. But Rock the SAT presented 2 problems: the vocabulary was fairly basic, and the singer's voice was extremely annoying.Having memorized all the words in Rock the SAT, I went to my local store to find Vocab Rock, the only other book like Rock the SAT that I knew about. But when I flipped through it, I saw that the vocabulary was extremely easy and few in number. Fortunately, I noticed Flocabulary and looked through it. There was an incredible amount of vocabulary crammed into each song, and the lyrics looked provocative and interesting, and most importantly, i didn't know about 1/2 of the words. Amazed, I purchased it.When I put the CD into the CD player in my car on the way home, I thought the radio was accidentally on, since the music was so well-produced, the lyrics were intelligent, and the rappers actually had an extremely well developed sense of musicality. I could barely believe my ears when the song began to recite vocabulary flawlessly.If you are looking for a music vocabulary CD, this one definitely is the best, unless you hate rap with a passion. The only problem I found with rap was that as a rock listener, it was more difficult to memorize the lyrics, because there was so much packed in. I wouldn't have it any other way though, it's better than feeling like you are wasting your time while a song rambled on about the definitions of \\"parallel\\" and \\"mosaic\\" for 3 minutes. And with all music vocabulary CD's, it is important to look at the book's lyrics while listening, since the mind tends to gloss over words it doesn't understand/hasn't heard before as random syllables."},{"Title":"Flocabulary: The Hip-Hop Approach to SAT-Level Vocabulary Building (Flocabulary Study Guides)","review":"Flocabulary is the real stuff.

It took a few times listening to it to start picking up all the vocabulary words they use. Don't be put off by this if you have trouble understanding the singers the first time you listen to them.

The words are complex and will expand the normal speakers use of language. Initially I thought this was going to be some corny gimmick, but I was very impressed. The rhymes they use to explain the words are actually pretty nice and will indeed help you understand what each vocabulary word means.Also, I am a huge \\"true hip-hop head\\" and reading through this book was very much needed for me. As they state in the introduction, hip-hop/rap today is seen as being almost completely as depicting negative images of violence, disrespect of women, and utter ignorance. The truth is there is a plethora of intelligent hip-hop music available that can teach, evoke emotion, paint vivid pictures, etc. I feel this book brings that fact to life beautifully, and shows how hip-hop, like many other forms of music & art can expand the mind & ultimately be instrumental in a person's growth.Pick this one up if you're a teacher of young students, if you're a \\"real hip-hop\\" junkie, or appreciate the music & also interested in possibly expanding your vocabulary."},{"Title":"Flocabulary: The Hip-Hop Approach to SAT-Level Vocabulary Building (Flocabulary Study Guides)","review":"it help me study for the gre. not really a fan of hip hop but this is very effective way of learning"},{"Title":"Flocabulary: The Hip-Hop Approach to SAT-Level Vocabulary Building (Flocabulary Study Guides)","review":"Great SAT prep!!

In reality, it doesn't work and this product underscores the reasons why hip-hop typically uses grade-school level vocabulary. In an attempt to imitate popular hip-hop guidelines - fun rhymes, a flowing song, good beats - this product throws words out at a million miles per hour. However, these aren't common words, they are SAT vocab words. After listening to a song you realize that lots of words were presented to you, but that you didn't actually learn the definitions. At that point, you realize that you actually have to pay attention to the song. It can't just play passively in the background like when you are listening to the radio in the car. When you try to listen in an active way, you realize that the product moves too fast and doesn't give you enough time to absorb each vocab word. You will find yourself stopping, starting, and rewinding the song many times. At that point, the whole purpose of just listening to the song is defeated.Good concept - bad in practice."},{"Title":"Hunting the Hard Way","review":"Great read!

He also went hunting with his bow and arrow."},{"Title":"Hunting the Hard Way","review":"The first 2 chapters of this book locked this reader to the pages like an arrow nocked to the string. The thoughts and feelings expressed by Howard Hill as he came to full draw on each of his adventures put me in the saddle or atop the mountain looking through his eyes. Any archer's heart will race at the reaccounting of each hunt, but only archers of traditional caliber will be able to appreciate the flight of the arrow as it's loosed and hits its intended mark. The bond between fellow hunters is well expressed and gives proper account to the knowledge and wisdom passed down at the campfire by older more experienced hunters. But for the fact that Howard Hill has accomplished things with his bow that I wouldn't begin to consider, I found it difficult to associate with some of his underwater adventures."},{"Title":"Hunting the Hard Way","review":"If you are involved with archery, this book belongs in your library. Howard Hill posessed skills that are nothing short of incredible when it came to hunting and target archery. This book will inspire you to pick up your bow and go out and shoot.

This book is a compilation of accounts from Howards career that would be written off as fantasy if so many people hadn't witnessed what Howard was able to accomplish with a longbow.

A SCARLET CORD, the author's latest novel, asks, \\"Is it ever right to hide the truth? Can deception be redeemed?\\" When Melanie LaSalle meets Joel Ellington, she finds a man she begins to care about ~ a man who awakens feelings in her she thought she'd buried with her husband four years before. But as the relationship deepens, so do the mounting suspicions and accusations against him. Has she believed a lie? Is Joel the man she thinks he is? You'll have to read to book to find out ~ and the ending may surprise you. Like her previous books, BENEATH A SOUTHERN SKY and AFTER THE RAINS, this latest work ~ A SCARLET CORD ~ will keep you turning pages, and give you a heart-warming read."},{"Title":"A Scarlet Cord","review":"The Scarlet Cord by Deborah Raney is a stand out Christian novel. Melanie is recovering from the death of her husband Richard slowly by caring for her daughter Jerica when a new man shows up at her church. Joel seems to be everything she's looking for in a husband and father for her child, but as they grow closer, secrets about his past threaten to pull them apart. At first I was disappointed that Raney disclosed Joel's secret so early in the book, but as I continued to read, I could see that the disclosure was about Joel's character. He was such an open, honest person that keeping the secret was tearing him apart. Raney does a good job at pacing the story, and the story moves in unexpected ways. What a reader would normally expect to happen in this type of story (specifically one plot element) never happens, and it's a blessing, because it keeps you reading, wondering when and if it will. I cried through the last twenty-five pages of the book at the depth of Jerica's love for Joel, and when I closed the book, I had a smile on my face and realized there was hope in my heart. In all Christian fiction there is a pivotal point within the story when the main character feels the peace of God descend upon them. The whole story turns on that point: if it's not believable to the reader, the story and the message won't carry any weight. In The Scarlet Cord, that point is not only believable, but it passes on to the reader as well. Amazing book."},{"Title":"A Scarlet Cord","review":"I haven't read a suspenseful romance this emotionally charged in a long time.

After I had read the preface, I couldn't put it down. For three days I read and reread this book. Not only is it intellectually stimulating, it is also spiritually challenging. It makes one wonder, &quot;Would this happen today?&quot;"},{"Title":"The Righteous Gentiles of the Holocaust: A Christian Interpretation","review":"Out of the numerous holocaust studies, there have been relatively few about the &quot;righteous gentiles,&quot; that small number (far less than 1%) of non-Jewish Europeans who risked themselves and often their families to save Jews from the Nazis. Of that small number of studies, none had analyzed the phenomenon from a specifically Christian perspective, despite the fact that many of the rescuers were professing Christians. David Gushee's remarkable study fills this gap. Gushee admits that most Christians stood by and did nothing while the Nazis took their Jewish neighbors to the death camps. Some even cooperated or were themselves perpetrators of the atrocities--often having learned to hate Jews in church. So, Gushee investigates to find out why these Christians were different. What made them rescue Jews when so few others had such moral heroism? Gushee seeks to answer this question so that today's chueches can work to produce that type of Christian and not the bystanders or perpetrators. He also concludes that political protections for the basic human rights of all must be firmly in place--by the time one needs heroic morality, it is too late to stop genocidal horrors.

One can only pray that it finds a wide audience which heeds its author's lessons well."},{"Title":"HELEN'S BABIES","review":"I have read this book several times, starting in junior high and ending in college.

At the same time he is also trying to romance a lovely young lady, and of course he wants her to think he is great father material, even though in private he thinks the boys are little monsters.You've probably seen this plot in movies and sitcoms, perhaps this book was the original which inspired them."},{"Title":"HELEN'S BABIES","review":"I could not stop laughing while I read this book.

The characters are unforgettable and will remind you of people you know in real life. What's even more unforgettable is the elaborate and highly original mayhem that the kids cause, which they always manage to do at the worst possible time.What I loved the most about this book was its comedic brilliance. The author could have written a book about a couple of mischievous kids, and it would have been funny. Adding a hapless bachelor as their babysitter is even funnier. But having a hapless bachelor as the babysitter of mischievous kids he cannot control, and adding a love interest whom the bachelor is trying to convince that he is great father material, and having her keep showing up when he's in trouble way over his head with the kids, is comedic genius.I highly recommend this book.

A CLASSIC."},{"Title":"HELEN'S BABIES","review":"This book is a riot. It's one of the funniest books I've ever read. Harry, a childless man, agrees to take care of his two nephews, Toddie and Budge, only to find himself in way over his head. At the same time he's trying to convince a lady he's romancing that he would be a great father, but every time she sees him with the kids they're causing him more trouble than he can handle.This book became an instant sensation when it was published. Originally aimed at adult readers, it became a major juvenile literature success overnight, and it's still very popular with kids today. That's no surprise with it being so hilarious and with the kids always being the ones who come out on top.As for adult readers, I think we can all relate to Harry's predicament. There's been some time or another in our lives when a rambunctious child has gotten the best of us, though in Harry's case, it's happening non-stop and at the most inopportune times.I loved this book. The predicaments that poor Harry finds himself in are unbelievably funny, and Habberton paints such a vivid picture that you can easily envision the zaniness. Every time I pictured each particular mess that the kids had gotten Harry into in my mind, I could not keep from bursting out laughing."},{"Title":"HELEN'S BABIES","review":"Worth a look for an insider's view to the state of bachelor/nephew relations amongst the New York society set.

It has prompted me to want to read her dissertation; it's on order. I expect that I will find it necessary to cut her some slack there as I do in reading her witch's rage in Outercourse.That her painful personal struggle finds her, at this stage, singing in blossoming poetic inventions fulfills Emerson's goal of the teacher \\"to raise and cheer.\\" Daly's unhesitating acceptance of witchery will put many off. But singing is always better than shouting. I found this long text a pleasure to read, with lucidity and appeal on every page.It bears the mark of the artistic originality that creates the new world we now live in. The story of Daly's voyage to that new world harmonizes such variegated experiences that I am left profoundly changed. Enough to share her new world? Only if I can make a similar voyage for myself. If there's a message to Daly's method, it's \\"Do your own work.\\" Go, go, go for it!"},{"Title":"Outercourse: The be-dazzling voyage : containing recollections from my Logbook of a radical feminist philosopher (be-ing an account of my time/space travels and ideas--then, again, now, and how)","review":"Mary Daly (1928-2010) was a radical feminist philosopher and theologian who taught at Jesuit-run Boston College for 33 years; she retired in 1999, after a discrimination claim was filed against the college by two male students who claimed to want to be admitted to her advanced Womens Studies courses. She also wrote the booksThe Church and the Second Sex,Beyond God the Father: Toward a Philosophy of Women's Liberation,Gyn/Ecology: The Metaethics of Radical Feminism,Pure Lust: Elemental Feminist Philosophy,Websters' First New Intergalactic Wickedary of the English Language,QUINTESSENCE: Realizing the Archaic Future A Radical Elemental Feminist Manifesto, andAmazon Grace: Re-Calling the Courage to Sin Big.She wrote in the Introduction to this 1992 book, \\"As I Re-member my own intellectual voyage as a Radical Feminist Philosopher, I am intensely aware of the struggle to stay on my True Course, despite undermining by demons of distraction that have seemed always to be attempting to pull me off course. These I eventually Dis-covered and Named as agents and institutions of patriarchy, whose intent was to keep me... within the stranglehold of the foreground, that is, fatherland. My True Course was and is the Outercourse---moving beyong the imprisoning mental, physical, emotional, spiritual walls of patriarchy, the State of Possession.\\"Here are some additional quotations from the book:\\"I did not yet understand that for a woman to strive to become a philosopher was to break a Terrible Taboo.\\" (Pg. 22)\\"Another---and more important---advantage was that I was now basically equipped to see through all the myths of male intellectual superiority---forever.

It isn't just the story of her life, but of her thinking as well. She was the only child of solid working-class Catholics in Schenectady, N.Y., who sensed at an early age that she wanted to be a philosopher, not realizing that to become one, she would break a Terrible Taboo. (She intentionally uses upper case as a mode of giving importance where she feels it is due and vice versa.) Her graduate study took her to Switzerland. (Women couldn't get a degree in philosophy in the Catholic education system.) Boston College hired her and fired her and, after student demonstrations (at that time all male students), rehired and promoted her and gave her tenure. This was not the end of problems for her at Boston College, but when asked why she stayed there, she noted it \\"is where I choose to Stand my Ground.\\" In her early 40s she was the first woman to preach at Harvard Memorial Church and \\"turned the occasion into a Call for an Historic Exodus from patriarchal religion.\\" Hundreds walked out. Daly never went back, deciding that \\"oppressive tendencies are not aberrations but the very stuff of christianity\\" (lower case intentional). Her vocation then became Radical Feminism, seeing the women's revolution about participation in Be-ing, an ontological movement. As outsiders, \\"women are especially equipped to confront the structured evil of patriarchy . . . are in a unique sense called to be the bearers of existential courage in society.\\" She uses Paul Tillich as a springboard here. She talks of how she wanted to keep the word \\"God\\" but finally found it \\"hopelessly, irremediably inadequate.\\" Daly most often contemplated the divine essence as a verb, Be-ing itself, so that worship is \\"not kneeling in front of a so-and-so but swirling in energy.\\"She talks of feeling a lot in common with the cow who jumped over the moon in the nursery rhyme. The cow didn't know exactly where she was going, but she knew she had to do it. No matter if all the dogs in the world are laughing at her. The cow was probably fed up with domestication. If she had jumped the fence, she would have been caught and dragged back. That rumination of Daly's so inspired me that I had a dream that night of flying. I was carrying my cat, and when we came to a steep cliff we took off, using the cat's wings (!?) and flew. Here is part of a poem I wrote about the dream:On cat wings -Too far, too steep to walkThis journey calls for flight.Flying high to see through the unrealities of nowAnd to see the Ancient EssencesThen to sound the courageous clarion callAwakening Laughter, Joy, and BE-INGThroughout the cosmos.Daly says that 1975 was the year the backlash began and that the Montreal massacre in a university classroom in 1989 ushered in an age of escalating gynocide. I'm not going to list the statistics of rape, battering and murder of women here, but most shocking is how \\"business-as-usual\\" such things continue to be. Mary's life was a call to wake up."},{"Title":"Best of Creepy","review":"A collection of 8 black-and white cartoons from the 1964 magazine Creepy.

That is until my local library got a copy. I can tell you that the moment I got hold of this book, it was a complete magical treasure. Every single page is a wonder of glorious illustrations with unique detail of expressions and geographical locations. The story-line is realistic and does not sweet-coat anything in regards to child-abuse, showing the emotional journey of the young girl (and her pet rat).Reading this book, I found myself continually reflecting and looking back at the previous pages as they are of such detail and portray the story with emotion.You will not regret getting this book.

Originally I bought the four comic-book format issues one by one as they arrived. I purchased the first issue initially because of the amazing colored pen and ink illustrations (I do pen and ink drawing myself), and once I had read the first issue of the story, I eagerly awaited the other three issues. I'm sorry to say the four issues got lost during a move, so when I saw The Tale of One Bad Rat in book form, I snapped it up.Helen Potter wanders into the school laboratory and saves the rat's life (and also turns all the other lab rats loose after seeing what happens to them). In turn, the rat saves Helen's life several times; she doesn't follow through with the several imagined suicides she visualizes in her mind was because she has \\"...responsibilities.\\" She had \\"a rat to support.\\" I have to admit that when Helen returned at one point and found that her pet rat had been killed by a housemate's cat, it brought me to tears (and I'm a cat lover!).The illustrations are consistently wonderfully done, and the intercutting of her negative memories of abuse and her positive admiration of the example of Beatrix Potter's stories and artwork into the story is masterful. Her declaration that she will not be a victim any more and her confrontation of her weak, manipulative father are heroic. And the illustrations of her life in the British countryside following that confrontation are all joy.Another reviewer thought \\"the abuse wasn't brought in subtly enough.\\" Respectfully I respond that while abuse may be insidious, nothing about abuse is subtle, not in the acts themselves, not in the lasting damage on many levels which abuse causes, and not in the confusion and powerlessness and self-loathing suffered for years after the fact(s) by the victim."},{"Title":"The Tale of One Bad Rat","review":"I love this book.

The protagonist is obsessed with Beatrix Potter, and Talbot brilliantly channels both Potter's literary and artistic style in this story. My one possible condemnation of the book is that it made me tear up whilst reading it in the cafe immediately after purchasing it, which is, frankly, a little awkward.Talbot uses the medium of the graphic novel to sensitively and evocatively address incredibly tough issues - runaway children and sexual violence amongst them. Those that mistrust or belittle the ability of comic books to tell the real, hard stories should be ashamed of themselves - The Tale of One Bad Rat definitely proves them wrong."},{"Title":"The Tale of One Bad Rat","review":"I bought this book to write a research paper for my PhD course.

And though it would seem a classic Beatrix Potter beginning, this tale is not hers, but is actually a graphic novel written and illustrated by British artist Bryan Talbot. For those unfamiliar with the term, graphic novels are essentially thick comic books, often collected from a series of individual comics. It's a format not entirely dissimilar to Beatrix Potter's own, and the similarities with her work do not end there.As in many of Potter's tales, Bad Rat's main character is one of unfortunate circumstance who has to see her way past the wicked foxes and ill-tempered farmers of her life to find her happily ever after. Instead of using an actual rat, though, Talbot introduces us to Helen Potter, a wildly imaginative, homeless teenager, whose only possessions are the Beatrix Potter books she took when she ran away from home and whose only friend is her small nameless pet rat.Helen's world on the streets of 1990s London is not an easy one. She gets by panhandling and through the kindness of her fellow street kids, but is plagued by occasional bursts of her own imagination. Among other things, she sees visions of possible ways to end her life, can see historic versions of her surroundings, can envision people as their animal counterparts and even imagine a giant version of her own pet rat. She views herself as a bad person-a bad rat. This psychologists tell us, is often the case among those who, like Helen, have been damaged by the all too common nightmare of parental abuse. It is the exploration of this important problem that forms the foundation for this story.Like her namesake, Helen's finds pleasure in drawing-whether doodling on her pants or copying Beatrix's illustrations from her books. Helen finds hope in the parallels she sees between her life and Beatrix's. She wishes more than anything else to leave London for the Lake District village of Sawrey, where Beatrix herself lived much of her life. After some unfortunate incidents involving the police, this is exactly what Helen does. Escaping London for the peaceful Sawrey brings her some happiness, but it does not allow her to escape her past. Finally facing that past and her abuser becomes Helen's ultimate quest toward her happy ending.In The Tale of One Bad Rat, Bryan Talbot has created a modern version of a Beatrix Potter story, filled with colorful true to life characters and villains every bit in Mr. McGregor's league. The story also serves as a love letter to the English Lake District and its various villages-a land of lush green mountains that were a passion of Beatrix Potter's for much of her life and served as the setting for many of her tales. He has also created a work about the terribly important issue of sexual abuse-especially considering that government studies estimate that one in three girls will be molested before they're eighteen, and that statistic is based only on the few cases that are reported. And while Bad Rat is ultimately an uplifting tale of survival, it reminds us that not everyone lives happily ever after."},{"Title":"The Tale of One Bad Rat","review":"First off, let's get the bad bits out of the way - The cover of Bryan Talbot's, 'The Tale of One Bad Rat,' has got to be the worst looking/designed cover of any graphic novel or book that i've ever seen.Now for the good - once you get past the hideous cover all is quickly forgiven both with Talbot's great artwork and excellent writing with story, theme and character. Most people will have heard of this book for its unique attempt (at the time) to address serious social issue (sexual abuse) which it does a fantastic job of in terms of taste and message. But while the abuse theme hovers constantly throughout the book, Talbot opens the world of his characters up and vividly recreates the mean streets of London and the scenic splendour of the English countryside that gives this book a grand feel to it without being bogged down by the heavier theme at hand. Also of interest is the way the books of Beatrix Potter is weaved into the storyline not to mention some intriguing bits involving rats."},{"Title":"The Tale of One Bad Rat","review":"Like Spiegelman's Maus and Satrapi's Persepolis books, this graphic novel shows how powerful this genre can be in dealing with brutality, in this case with childhood sexual abuse as well as with animal experimentation, social isolation, homelessness, and a horrifying family life. As society and family prey on Helen, the protagonist, she thinks, she reads, she develops her own thoughts and insists on going her own way--and on getting others, including readers, to think differently about their own preconceptions and assumptions as she sheds her abusers.Take the example of rats--far from being reviled at best and something to be experimented on at worst, Helen shows other characters and us, the readers, that they're intelligent, amazing creatures that should be respected and even worshipped, as in Hindu religion. What's especially great about this novel is the way that it mixes an unflinching look at horror and brutality (Helen being abused by her father and rejected by her mother; fantasies of suicide; scenes of sexual predation as she hitchhikes; and much more) with a clear appreciation for the power of art and thinking (as well as the positive example of another assertive individual, Beatrix Potter) to help someone come into her own and leave her abusers behind."},{"Title":"The Tale of One Bad Rat","review":"I've seen several people criticizing the cover art of this book, and I think this needs clarifiction.If you read Beatrix Potter books as a child, as I did, you would have recognized immediately that the cover is a direct homage to the classic white covers of the little books. The plain white background, centered watercolor illustration, and even the title font is a faithful echo of every tale she ever published. Go check out one and see if you don't revise your opinion. I was, in fact, drawn to the book immediately BECAUSE I recognized it as a Beatrix Potter concept.Oh, and the story is a very good one, and timely. :)"},{"Title":"The Tale of One Bad Rat","review":"This is one graphic novel you'd never encounter too frequently in a long time! It is a very illustrative and eye-opening tale about an unhappy English teenager who took her beloved rat and fled the chambers of horror which she would've called &quot;home&quot;, which was haunted by her sexually abusive father and her haughty, unloving mother. After a whole series of very scary misadventures with sexual predators and pursuing policemen as well as begging for food and sharing a run-down room with a cocky young boy who leads a helping hand, Helen finally decides to turn around and face her worst enemy - who happens to be her own loving daddy. And, Helen also finds a very powerful inspiration in her most favorite author, Beatrix Potter - who probably had gone through the very same situation in her youth. Very clever storytelling and such beautiful, realistic artwork that truly glitters with a subtle element of fantasy and action adventure, though I found Helen's encounter with her perverted dad a bit too melodramatic and some of the characters depicted in the story are a bit ugly to look at, like the girl's mother, who is wearing too much make-up on her aging face. However, this is the very kind of creation I wish I can find on more and more of the graphic novels and comic books being produced today instead of just superheroes and oversexed young bimbos."},{"Title":"The Tale of One Bad Rat","review":"Many people shy away from grahic novels, thinking they are &quot;just comics&quot; or &quot;full of violence and sex&quot; (after all, we also use the word &quot;graphic&quot; in front of the words &quot;violence&quot; and &quot;sex&quot; all the time in movies and television). However, this book is not &quot;just a comic&quot;.This graphic novel tells the story of Helen Potter, sexually abused by her father for years, who runs away from home, heading for the home of her favourite childhood author, Beatrix Potter. The book starts with Helen begging on the streets of London, before she heads north to find Hill Top Farm, Beatrix's home.The story of Helen's abuse at the hands of her father, and of the complete lack of feeling and neglect from her mother, is told through flashbacks, and as Helen talks to her pet rat. This is interspersed with Helen's journey north towards the Lake District, which mirrors her journey towards the eventual confrontation with her parents and with her own self.This book is a touching story of hope told in a graphic format that will reach an audience that a more traditonal text-based novel of this ilk might not reach. The illustrations are vivid, yet the characters are also realistically portrayed (none of the gravity-defying female body parts that show up in some graphic novels!). According to the author, this book is also being used in outreach and therapy programs for abused children and teens.This is a valuable book for any library to have."},{"Title":"The Tale of One Bad Rat","review":"A 16 year old girl called Helen Potter leaves home, running from an abusive father and a mother who doesn't care. She finds herself begging on the streets of London and, along with her pet rat and a bag full of Beatrix Potter books, she begins a journey similar to Potter's out of her horrible situation into a place where she is safe and happy both in mind and body.Bryan Talbot does a fantastic job depicting the horrors of street life in London. The sprawl, the crazies who are out there preying on the young and vulnerable, and those who would help them, namely those in similar circumstances albeit somewhat older. Talbot also deals with the issue of abuse delicately and yet brutally as well. We see the circumstances in which it happened and how it affected Helen. The psychological damage it does to a young mind is written clearly and honestly so those who haven't been abused (eg. me) could follow and begin to understand the victim's feelings.Talbot also throws out facts about rats and their history, as well as the life story of Beatrix Potter. Helen's journey takes her to the Lake District which was Potter's home for many years and he draws absolutely stunning landscapes of the area. He also puts together a Beatrix Potter-esque story at the end of the book \\"written\\" by Helen. The artwork throughout is brilliant with Talbot opting for the first time to use human models to draw from to add an extra dimension of reality to the story.Why this is labelled \\"Young Adult\\" is insulting as anyone should be able to read this without being put off that it might be \\"childish\\". It's a searingly honest look at a taboo issue in our society and deserves a wider audience than simply \\"young adults\\".A brilliant and moving comic book from one of the masters of the medium, Bryan Talbot's \\"The Tale of One Bad Rat\\" is an utterly engrossing and wonderful read. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Tale of One Bad Rat","review":"The graphic novel \\"The Tale Of One Bad Rat\\" by Bryan Talbot is an Eisner Award winning story about Helen Potter, a woman who was sexually abused by her father for 8 years while she was a child and teenager.The current second edition has excellent hardcover design, paper quality, and illustration color reproduction. The graphic novel, a story in 3 parts, was originally published in four individual comic books. I enjoyed having the whole story in one professionally crafted volume.I'm not a person who writes many reviews. I don't enjoy writing reviews for the sake of writing reviews. I tend to only take the time to write reviews when I estimate I've found a great artwork that may be underrecognized or underappreciated in some way. I'm not alone in admiring this graphic novel. I was initially introduced to this book because it was recommended by both Neil Gaiman and Alan Moore.This is an exquisitely well-thought out story. And Bryan Talbot is a master storyteller, writer, imagist, and draftsperson. His linework, line weight, and drawing abilities leave me with firm rememberances. His ability to paint and color is comparable to Milo Manara - and I mean that as a high compliment. His colors support a concert of details used to set compelling and accurate emotional atmospheres. Talbot doesn't just lay down flat colors. In studying his illustrations, you can see the care of every color weight, stroke direction, and visual texture.The story begins with Helen living on the streets after running away from home. The story arcs through her beginning processes of recognizing she was sexually abused and trying to understand the harm the abuse did to her. The story is about trying to recover from incest by taking dramatic and active steps to repair what can be rebuilt. Helen reads many self-help books about child abuse and incest, she separates from her abuser, and she eventually confronts him.Many of Helen's dialogues and thoughts are taken from research Talbot did after reading many books about sexual abuse of children and interviews of sexually abused women from many different countries. The story intimates the famous author (Helen) Beatrix Potter may have suffered from similar abuses as a young woman. And the story parallels similar steps and locations both Ms. Potter's took to separate from their fathers to become self-defining and self-reliant individuals.This book was created to bring more attention to addressing the serious and common problems of sexual abuse: \\"It's been estimated that one in three girls will be molested before they're eighteen. Approximately 90 percent of that abuse is committed, not by the stereotypical stranger in the raincoat, haunter of the schoolgates, but by a close, male relative.\\"The story appears to have been written to emphasize that sexual abuse victims commonly take on the self-perception they are bad - even when bad things have primarly been done to them. Some children who experience incest may believe their parents must be good, and they make an incorrect reasoning progression and assume they must be a cause of their parent's bad behavior. Also, sexually abusive parents often verbally and emotionally abuse their child, communicating they are ugly, unpopular, or unlikable. This can lead a child to self-loathing, a misperception they are a bad rat - when they are not.The story champions the concept of judging individuals by their individual actions and not by their stereotype. Helen literally has a pet rat she rescued from being dissected at her high school. And later in the story, she has an imaginary friend who is a rat, with whom she discusses, vents, and works out her problems. She researches and discovers for herself many good qualities about vilified rats. The \\"rat\\" exploration and theme is a fascinating juxtaposition in a story that also focuses on the misbehaviors of men - who would ironically often be referred to as \\"rats\\" for their incestuous behavior. Talbot appears to be emphasizing the distinction between reality and appearances, emphasizing compassion for literal rats who are well-behaved social creatures and disdain for figurative \\"rats\\" who are ill-behaved social creatures. The book's title can be easily interpreted to infer not all rats are bad.Helen used art, creativity, and storytelling, like Beatrix Potter likely did, to address the difficult problems she was facing but did not feel able to discuss or face directly or publicly. Our art is often our heart on our sleeves, and sometimes artists use allegory and metaphor to address serious problems, problems they don't feel safe or proper discussing openly or directly. Sometimes they draw what they cannot say or communicate through words.Talbot does a masterful job of drawing, painting, and writing many things that need to be communicated openly, directly, and often."},{"Title":"The Tale of One Bad Rat","review":"This fine graphic novel is a stellar example of what comics can do better than any other artform. Prose by itself wouldn't convey the combined power of text & illustration Talbot uses to such stunning effect. Beginning with the Beatrix Potter-style cover art, he offers layers of emotional & artistic meaning, utilizing flashbacks, fantasy, and harsh realism to tell the story of a damaged but ultimately victorious young woman -- and he's able to tell it from both the inside & from a more omniscient viewpoint. His detailed & expressive faces provide nuances that would do many accomplished actors proud.What makes this work is that it's not just A Very Special Episode sort of story. Helen is an individual, not a case study, for all the extensive background material. Her story is not simply about healing & recovery, but about the importance of art, as well as the struggle towards wholeness that every human being must undergo.

Shepherd, Jr. is a beloved man who wrote a number of books and taught many seminary students at the Graduate Theological Seminary in Berkeley, California. I know this as I know some bare bone facts of this man of faith, this Reverend who was influential and I understand a contributor to the modern \\"Book of Common Prayer\\" which Episcopalians use in worship on Sundays and daily life. But I don't have to write an advertisement for the compiler of \\"An Anthology of Christian Devotion: Holy Communion,\\" a book I bought used since it is out of print.My copy was owned by R.J. Brown, a name on the inside front page of the book, published by The Seabury Press, Greenwich, Connecticut, 1959. I feel like I have a special book, and for my library a collector's item that I read numerous times in the week. Usually I do so in the evening. I share R.J. Brown's interest in the book, so I imagine, for one reason I bought the book was to get a look at the writings that interested the compiler so as to gain insight into \\"The Book of Common Prayer.\\" Does this book do this for me? Perhaps. But more so, the book is a friend and opens my eyes to poetry and short readings from people who had a deep love of the Lord, devotion in their religious life, and a commitment to Christianity.Quote from the book:\\"It must be His voice thou hearest when He says, \`Come hither, all ye that labour and are heavy laden,' hence His voice that invites thee: and it must be His voice thou hearest when He says, \\"This is my Body,'...\\" Soren KierkegardAnother reason I chose this book, and a serious one, was to enter into and gain in a kind of dialogue about Eucharist. That is the subject about which the title says these devotions attend. It isn't so frequent a thing that I talk with people about Communion, and what it means to us. Today I did so with a woman who is 97, and it was a conversation that came from the Holy Spirit since we had our conversation right after taking Communion Under Special Circumstances together. With this book, one can have that introduction and conversation about Eucharist with this writer, who has passed away and ,as I know and enjoy, left these writings for the edification of readers. It is a joy.Quote from the book:\\"For a bond of love,/a sufficient account of our offering,/the armour of patience,/a stirring up of thanksgiving/confidence in prayer,/mutual indwelling,/a pledge of resurrection,/an acceptable defense at the judgment,/a covenant of our inheritance,/a figure of perfection...\\" \\"Before Receiving\\" by Lancelot Andrews.The fullness of such a quote from a lovely statement made in poetry is itself a meal. Of course, it tells us about Holy Communion. The poem itself is longer, but not too long for my taste so that like the other readings, they do not tire the reader. They refresh one.If you as a reader of this review wonder what my friend and I said about Eucharist, this quotation above titled \\"Before Receiving\\" sums it up---but oh, so eloquently. The book is an eloquent one, and certainly a source of taste--as in taste what we bring to you and have learned for devotion and understanding of our God. There you have my statement about the readings, so there you have also high praise for this compilation of readings about Holy Communion. Certainly one will find it worthwhile to read prior to Sunday Communion, for you will be pleased to share in its depth and sometimes apparent truths known. Here one may also gain insight into what was on the mind of Massey H. Shepherd, Jr.Quote from the book:\\"Holy and righteous Father, in commemorating here the one perfect sacrifice offered once for all on the cross by our Lord Jesus Christ, in joyful expectation of his coming, we offer ourselves to thee as a living and holy sacrifice....\\" \\"Liturgy of the Reformed Church of France, 1946.--Peter Menkin, Easter 2007"},{"Title":"Godzilla Returns","review":"This book adheres to the spirit of the Godzilla series. The monster is symbolic of the threat of nuclear war, as in the original film. The appearance of a great many other Toho Productions monsters brings back many green memories of my childhood; Saturday night horror movies and the giant rubber monsters that dominated them.

Marc wrote about too many monsters to make them all interesting enough. Godzilla only fights one monster in the book and that fight is only three chapters long.

Dylan, 10 years old"},{"Title":"Godzilla Returns","review":"This book is an okay book, but definitely not one of Marc Cerasini's best. His other Godzilla books have been much better, such as Godzilla Returns and Godzilla at World's End. In this book, I thought that the main character, Kip Daniels, was not a good character to play the part of the person who is going to save the world from everyone's favorite monster. The plot was kind of thin for my liking, and seeing how good Cerasini's other Godzilla books have been, I don't think it can really compare.However, I did like the big action sequence at the end of the book involving the other monsters from previous Godzilla books. I also liked how Godzilla was plagued with the question of whether he was a friend or a foe. And though I thought the book was alright, the whole \\"The world must end because it's the beginning of the new millenium\\" thing was a bit overdone and not too believable. Now, not to take away from those other books concerning that subject matter, but this one doesn't compare to other Y2K books such as Y2K by R.J. Pinero.Overall, I thought this book was good, but not one of Marc Cerasini's best. I would recomend this book to hardcore Godzilla fans, but not to someone just looking for a good read. A good boook, but not a classic, that's for sure."},{"Title":"Godzilla Returns","review":"In 1999 the Californian Kip Daniels, a fifteen year old, is selected to the G-Force team.

I loved the parts were the military are fighting the monsters and when the monsters are destroying a city.

The action scene were good and intense, as they were in his other book's. Overall this was a good, thrilling book with a smooth running plot.

Godzilla 2000 is a great read for Godzilla Fans everywhere."},{"Title":"Godzilla Returns","review":"Marc Cerasini has fashioned a magnificently entertaining novel that is a must for all Godzilla fans! The novel effectively evokes the awesome power and majesty of the Monster King without a trace of condescension or camp. The characters are well drawn and more than just potential monster bait. The scenes where the military engage Godzilla are exciting, and very realistic. Many of them linger in the memory long after the novel has been read; the scene where Godzilla is doused with napalm being a particularly vivid example. Cerasini allows the reader to get down into the thick of things along with the characters. We feel the growing fear of the soldiers as they face a seemingly indestructable monster and understand the pain felt by those whose lives are forever altered by the beast's rampage. All-in-all a fantastic read!!"},{"Title":"Godzilla Returns","review":"This is a good book because Mark Cerasini's got the guts to make a whole series of Godzilla! The story is good, too. I give it two thumbs up. They should turn this one into a movie!"},{"Title":"Godzilla Returns","review":"This book is a great book if you are a Godzilla fan. Cerasini is a great Godzilla storyteller."},{"Title":"Godzilla Returns","review":"As good as Godzilla Returns--Cerasini's first book in this series--was, Godzilla 2000 blows it away! He creates a globe-trotting adventure featuring many of Toho's best-known monsters, but never loses sight of the human element. The reader gets a genuine feel for what it must be like to live (and die) in a world being torn apart by giant monsters. The members of G-Force are colorful and distinct from one another, and we develop a real affection for them and the other characters in the book. We also develop a certain amount of sympathy for Godzilla and the other monsters, seeing them not as evil, but as forces of nature. It's also fun seeing characters from the last book show up as minor characters in this one. Godzilla 2000 can be read on its own, but reading the books in sequence makes for a richer, more rewarding experience in terms of characters."},{"Title":"Godzilla Returns","review":"This book is in a word:SUPERB!!!! Godzilla 2000 really shows what these beasts are. Forces of nature and embodiments of human nature. Godzilla's battle with King Ghidora was the highlight of the book. The fact that the novel was based on a &quot;kiddie&quot; book makes no difference. It is still a great book. I can't wait for Godzilla at World's End to come out."},{"Title":"Godzilla Returns","review":"Both new and old Godzilla fans will enjoy this exciting, fast paced novel detailing the monster's return to Tokyo, forty years after his last appearance. By creating an original sequel to the 1954 film, Cerasini is able to introduce Godzilla to new readers who might only know Godzilla by reputation, without having to recap the entire movie series. Hard-core fans who might be upset that this book and its sequels ignore the events on the big screen will be pleased at how thoroughly Cerasini has captured the spirit at the heart of the Godzilla stories. While this novel and the ones that follow are written for a teen audience -- and feature young adult protagonists as a result -- adults will find them just as entertaining. If Tom Clancy featured giant monsters in his books, they still wouldn't be this good! Check it out!"},{"Title":"Godzilla Returns","review":"This book was surprisingly good, though I was a bit dissapointed that the book's main villian, King Ghidorah, was only in the last fifty or sixty pages of the novel. Also, I was dissapointed with the Varan monster, I would rather have seen it replaced with either Mechagodzilla or Gigan, or maybe even King Ghidorah...imagine an ending where Godzilla, Rodan, Ghidorah, and the ship Raptor One fight in NYC!!! But overall, a great book. I especially loved how the sub-plot with Rodan was done, and the ending to Rodan's story was surprisingly moving"},{"Title":"Godzilla Returns","review":"One of the best godzilla books around"},{"Title":"Godzilla Returns","review":"Ok, I have to make a declaration here; I love Godzilla. But Godzilla has to be done right; in the seventies the movies lost their way, turning the Big G into a cartoon superguy for the kiddies. In recent years, starting in 1985, Toho Studios began a new series of movies featuring the King of the Monsters. With adult plots, stunning special effects and a much darker tone than before, these new movies revitalised the legend of Godzilla. And now, Marc Cerasini has perfectly captured the movies and nailed them to the printed page. Godzilla 2000 starts with the threatened end of the world, and builds from there. Cerasini seems to have a gift for portraying the cataclysmic clashes of the monsters and the military, without forgetting the real human dramas occuring around these battles. His characters are believable, and you find yourself rooting for their survival against all the odds stacked against them. In the shadow of the monsters, the real gems of this book are the little tales of human courage and ingenuity in the face of the ultimate threat. The pace of the action never slows from beginning to end, and at the end of the book, you're left exhausted, but thrilled. I have one or two criticisms. As the book is aimed at the &quot;young adults&quot; market, Mr Cerasini feels compelled to make the lead characters teenagers, which at some points in the book threatens its believability. Also, it is obvious that the author views Godzilla as a tragic beast, the victim of humanity rather than its enemy (a view espoused by many of his characters). While nicely put, this view is expressed often to the exclusion of all others, which is a little jarring when the said behemoth has caused the death of thousands and has destroyed a number of major cities. Those aside, this book is a treat for anyone who loves Godzilla, and wants to see him treated with the respect he deserves. Buy it."},{"Title":"Godzilla Returns","review":"This book is slow until the battles start, even in between them it was slow. And the final battle was probably the slowest part of all. But still a great book!"},{"Title":"Godzilla Returns","review":"I rate this book a 2 beacause the monsters were boring and less detailed then Mark Cerasini's third book, Godzilla at World's End. Also, this Kip Daniels goes to G-Force just because he beat a video-game?"},{"Title":"Godzilla Returns","review":"I loved godzilla returns and was hopeing to see some good fighting scenes in this one, nick gordon and brian shumara (from the first book) only go cameo apperences and that was the first(of many) problems with this book. nick and brian sould have been the stars in this book, but they got the un-likeible, g-force now, and this tradision of kicking out stars continued with &quot;godzilla at worlds end&quot; . and the part where the girl can &quot;mentaly&quot; hear mothra, that stinks! so if you like GOOD books, then DONT get this one."},{"Title":"Godzilla Returns","review":"Once again, Marc Creasini has written an entertaining Godzilla novel. Though not as good as the &quot;Godzilla Returns&quot;(mainly because the author tries to put too many plot strands into a relatively small space), this book is still a Godzilla fan's dream come true. The monsters, Rodan, Varan, Mothra, Kamacuras, King Ghidorah, and Godzilla, are all treated with respect and are rendered quite realistically. The writing is of the highest quality. We can really relate to and root for the various characters. The battles with the monsters are positively exhilirating and, once again, lodge themselves into the reader's memory. Best scenes: the discovery of Varan's victims, the initial assault of the Kamacuras, and King Ghidorah's arrival on the planet Earth. This novel will hold you in its spell until the very end!!"},{"Title":"Godzilla Returns","review":"Marc Cerasini has written GODZILLA 2000, a story of the millennium, apocalypse and giant monsters. But this is not just a giant monster book. As Robert Price of Crypt of Cthulhu notes, Cerasini has taken these monsters and rid them of their taint of cartoonism.This book continues the story of Godzilla who has appeared twice before (as seen in the movies Godzilla, King of the Monsters and Godzilla 1985). Some asteroids that pass through our system every 65 million years are coming around again. This time it looks like they will strike the Earth. But the asteroids are not the only threat. A Japanese research team has located Godzilla and he is awakening. Resources are now split between dealing with the asteroids and speeding up production of defenses against Godzilla.Soon the first of the asteroids arrive and new monsters are seen to walk the Earth. A giant reptile crawls out of the Gulf of Mexico and terrorizes the Yucatan. An asteroid fragment causes insects in Kansas to mutate horribly. A researcher among the Alaskan Natives learns of a prophecy involving the Firebird. The Earth Spirit tries to contact various humans to warn that Godzilla is an ally and the Destroyer of Life is coming.This almost reads like an DC Comics' Otherworlds tale. Imagine Rodan as the legendary Firebird or Mothra as the embodiment of the Earth Spirit. While old monsters are seen in a new light, Cerasini delivers a fast-paced tale full of action. If you enjoyed the old Japanese monster films you just might want to pick up this book and see the old monsters fresh as the day they were created."},{"Title":"Godzilla Returns","review":"Long after I've forgotten Devlin and Emmerich's effects laden lizard-fest, I'll still be thinking fondly of Marc Cerasini and his Godzilla novels. Reading these books is like taking a peek into a better world, where Godzilla movies are unencumbered by budget, unfettered by cautious studio executives, and where they can finally tell the stories we've been waiting to see.There's a scene in this book, where a plan to contain Godzilla goes badly wrong, and a helicopter literally bounces down the creatures back. It's so vividly written and paced that I found myself forgetting to breath as the images came alive in my mind. Cerasini's love of the subject matter is obvious, and his skill in telling a tight and exciting tale is just as hard to deny. What's more, he manages to avoid some of the absurdities present in even the most recent Godzilla movies from Toho. The world in Cerasini's novels is one that will forever be marked by the emergence of the monsters, and the effects are progressive and remain evident from book to book.Though the book is listed as being for &quot;young adults&quot;, it has plenty to recommend it to &quot;slightly older adults&quot;. Pick it up while you still can - then hassle Random House to bring out &quot;Godzilla and the Lost Continent&quot;."},{"Title":"Godzilla Returns","review":"This is a great book with action and suspense! The only problem was that they kept switching to a different story every few minutes. But still a great book!"},{"Title":"Godzilla Returns","review":"This book is this movie all the G-fans really wanted the team of Emmerich and Devlin to deliver. Chock full of monsters and mayhem, a properly somber tone (the monsters actually kill and eat people) and, most importantly, a serious repect and deep love for the subject matter, Godzilla 2000 is the perfect read for any Godzilla fan of any age. An essential G-book."},{"Title":"Godzilla Returns","review":"Godzilla Returns is about a gigantic atomic monter that destroys Tokyo. In 1956,an atomic monster rises out of Tokyo Bay.

Originally published in 1955, it was updated for the last time in 1960. There are two volumes, but they are often available in a single book, which makes it easier for the reader to handle. Graves does a wonderful job of making the myths easy to read and understand, and discusses the variations which often occurred in the myths. His interpretation of the myths is a bit subjective, so the reader needs to treat that aspect as such.The volumes can be used in different ways. One of the more useful ways is as a reference for learning about references to Greek Mythology. The table of contents provides 171 different myth titles to choose from, but if that doesn't help you find a particular reference, the index at the end of the second volume will help you locate the relevant myths that touch upon a particular name or subject.A second way to use the book is to simply browse until you find a myth that interests you and spend some time reading about it and its variations. Each myth is explained in clear English and divided into paragraphs relating to each of the ancient Greek works which mention the myths. These ancient references are then listed which easily provides the reader the information they need to do further investigation. Lastly, additional notes are included which help to better understand the myths and put them into an historical perspective, though again this is not necessarily factual as much as it is supposition on the part of Graves.Another way to use this book is to simply read it to gain an overall understanding of Greek myths. I would say this book doesn't work as well in this way as it does in the prior ways. The myths are intentionally split apart to better focus on the individual parts and so it doesn't flow. In addition, many of the myths have multiple versions and Graves discusses many of these variations which also interfere with treating this book like a story book. In addition the links to references and the material added to better understand the myths which are so useful for treating this as a reference, definitely get in the way of telling the story. All that being said, you can still use the book in this way, it is just not the optimum format and there may be better books out there for this purpose.I have found this book to be very useful over the years. It is very helpful when doing research, but also good for a diversion when one wants to look at one particular myth. Some may not care for Graves personal input on the myths, but I think it is a useful perspective even if one doesn't agree with his conclusions. Though not perfect, this book still rates five stars in my opinion."},{"Title":"Packet Alley,: A magic story of now and long ago","review":"Packet Alley by Elizabeth Meg was a great book to read to 4th graders during our study of Delaware state history.

Each and every story he writes has something very unique to the voice and to the plot. This holds true for this novel as well, but, I fear I have been spoiled by Terry's excellent short story collections. From any other author this novel would probably constitute a great accomplishment in style, tone, character development, and plot, but as a Terry Bisson novel, I was left wanting more.The premise is, as always, unique and promising, but I can't help but feel it would have worked better as a short story rather than a novel."},{"Title":"THE PICKUP ARTIST.","review":"Terry Bisson has come up with some unique sci-fi ideas and biting humor in his time, but this underachieving novel doesn't stack up with his best work. This one is inspired by Bradbury's \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" and Bisson adds satire with a near-future of culture overload and corporatized bureaucracy, embodied in a bizarre social movement to eliminate old art to make room for the new. This premise, surrounding the pickup artist who hunts down now-illegal artistic works but comes to doubt his mission, has potential, and Bisson keeps things fun with a sardonic sense of humor and an eye for the absurd. Unfortunately, after setting up the useful satirical theme, the novel turns into a tired road trip saga that rapidly runs out of steam, and wacky absurdity has to stand in for the lack of plot movement, with Bisson piling on unexplained gimmicks like a talking dog, a miniature man, and time dilation. This is an example of a book that has a great premise but doesn't live up to its satirical potential. Fortunately, Bisson's talents are on display in plenty of other books.

At the opening it seems almost a straightforward commentary by SFnal means on a theme reminiscent of _Fahrenheit 451_ (though at core very different), but by the end it has become a road novel through a very strange next century America.The title character is Hank Shapiro, who works for the government confiscating works of art which have been &quot;deleted&quot;. It has been determined that contemporary artists are unfairly at a disadvantage in &quot;competition&quot; with the weight of all the works of literature, painting, acting, etc. from the past, and each month, a randomly selected set of authors, musicians, movies, painters and so on is &quot;deleted&quot;, and all their works are supposed to be destroyed. Shapiro and his fellow &quot;pickup artists&quot; travel to people's homes who are reported to own copies of deleted videos, records, and books, and confiscated the works (while compensating the owners).Hank's dog is dying, and his mother is dead, and his father, who named him for the legendary country singer Hank Williams, left long ago. The combined effects of all these lead him to a criminal act -- when he confiscates a Hank Williams record he decides to try to find a record player on which to listen to it -- just once -- before turning it in. Before long he's involved with a long-pregnant librarian named Henry, and with a series of identical Indians named Bob, and he's breaking into a veterinary hospital to rescue his dog from euthanasia, and his Hank Williams record has been stolen, possibly by one of the Alexandrians (Library version) who apparently try to rescue deleted artwork. So Hank and Henry and the corpse of Indian Bob and the dying dog start to chase the record across the country, through flee markets and abandoned casinos and abandoned highways to the independent city state of Vegas.Alternating short chapters tell the history of the move for &quot;deletion&quot;, which began with terrorist destruction of paintings at museums, and continued with the support of a mysterious software billionaire and an aging actress and a trial of the accidental killers of a number of people at a museum.The telling of this story is continually interesting, and the characters are quirky and involving if not quite ever real. The plot is discursive and really doesn't go much of anywhere, and the social background is interesting but not coherent. Much gives off the sense of being made of as it goes along. What seems to be the central argument, concerning the morality of this &quot;deletion&quot; and perhaps the &quot;anxiety of influence&quot; or something, is never really engaged, but the book is still about something -- about death, I think, and perhaps about art as a release from a dead life. I don't get the sense of a completed argument, or even, really, a completed book -- but an interesting effort in both areas."},{"Title":"THE PICKUP ARTIST.","review":"Wow...this book is TERRIBLE. I know that doesn't help potential readers as much of an insighful review, but this book is truly bad. When the most interesting part of the book is the prologue, you've got serious problems. The characters are completely undeveloped and uninteresting, and every plot device is poorly utilized. For example, he tries and fails miserably to convey emotion in the female lead by alluding to the changing colors of birds on her sweater (something akin to a &quot;mood ring,&quot; but allows him to talk about breasts I guess). An actual author would have just found the right words to convey her emotional state. And I couldn't help thinking of the drug HalfLife (which allows one to communicate with the dead because of air &quot;trapped in their lungs&quot;) as a dumb rip off of Miracle Max and his bellows in The Princess Bride...he's only MOSTLY dead. At least that was funny. This was just stupid. If the author had bothered to explain anything about what is going on about his world instead of boring us with snippets of history, it might have made a book with a very interesting premise bearable. Instead, this seems like a rush job built on a neat idea and lazily written to capitalize on previous success. Blech."},{"Title":"THE PICKUP ARTIST.","review":"Admittedly this is not one of the great works of contemporary science fiction, but I couldn't help but smile reading page after page of this witty, slender novel. Bisson is one of science fiction's funniest satirists since Kurt Vonnegut announced that he isn't a science fiction writer (My humble apologies to Vonnegut - you were and still are - a science fiction writer.). He paints a satirical look at the future that is as riveting as any I've read in an early William Gibson novel or any of Jack Womack's. Bisson's main protagonist Hank Shapiro comes across as a befuddled, amusing Ulysses searching for the Holy Grail (a Hank Williams LP!) in a dystopic American future. I eagerly await Bisson's subsequent efforts in humorous science fiction."},{"Title":"THE PICKUP ARTIST.","review":"I stopped reading it after the first hundred pages. After that I just jumped to the last 2 chapters to see what happened, but I really didnt care anymore.I read Bradbury's &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; years ago and loved it. When this book was touted to be similiar to 'Fahrenheit', I expected another interesting romp. Boy, was I wrong.The only saving grace was its alternate chapters where we can read of the early days of the anti-old art movement (which is why I give this book 2 stars instead of 1). But even that didnt hold my attention long.If I can only use one word to describe the book, it would be:- BORING."},{"Title":"THE PICKUP ARTIST.","review":"Sure to be compared to the Ray Bradbury classic, Fahrenheit 451, Bisson's satirical romp posits a future in which 20th century works of art (books, films, records, paintings, etc.) are being systematically deleted to make room for new artists. Hank Shapiro works for the Federal Bureau of Arts and Information as a &quot;pick up artist,&quot; (kind of a repo man/IRS auditor) employed to make house calls to confiscate items that have been &quot;deleted.&quot; The story follows what happens when he confiscates a Hank Williams record and has the urge to play it before destroying it (strictly against the rules). It seems his father, who abandoned him, named him after the singer, and Hank hopes to catch a glimpse of his father through the music, which he has never heard. This leads him to an illegal underground &quot;Misdemeanor Cafe&quot; where he tries to buy a record-player but ends up losing the record, and eventually on a surreal cross-country quest with a long-pregnant woman, his ailing dog, an amazingly resilient homing bug, and a dead clone Indian as companions.Oddly enough, once the road trip starts, the book starts to rapidly loose steam. Bisson has a knack for great little details like various futuristic drugs, including Half-Life&#65533;, which allows the dead to speak (Hilariously, they tend to say things like, &quot;Oh no! I'm dead aren't I? Tell me I'm not dead!&quot;). Or the giant landfill being burrowed through by miners on a drug called &quot;Dig&quot; who retrieve old ephemera that gets sold in &quot;flee&quot; markets that straddle state borders. Vehicles generally run on a massive electrical grid, and Indian casino chips function as a currency franca. But even with these nifty details, the trip&#65533;in which Hank is trying to recover the album, and the woman is trying to reunite with an old love&#65533;never really goes anywhere interesting.Fortunately, every other chapter is a history of how the deletion system came into being, starting with terrorist acts against art and museums, and continuing with the support of the shadowy software giant &quot;Mr. Bill&quot; (Bill Gates, duh), and a celebrity trial. This history shows how the production of art has outpaced the world's ability to absorb it, placing new artists at a stifling competitive disadvantage. It's a kind of interesting satirical concept that Bisson riffs on rather well, but it can't completely conceal the tepidness of the road trip chapters."},{"Title":"THE PICKUP ARTIST.","review":"Hank Shapiro is a pick up artist. He spends his days confiscating literature, music, art, and movies that have been scheduled to be deleted. Some clients are surly, others just want the money they get for turning items in, but Shaprio is always professional. Its a people job and he's a people person.The trouble starts one day when he picks for destruction up a Hank Williams record. He remembers that his father gave him the name Hank as he was a fan of this musician. He becomes obssessed with hearing the albumn and even goes as far as to visit a &quot;Misdeamenor Cafe&quot; where someone can hook him up with a black market record player.Shapiro finds himself on the run with a pregnant librarian called Henry, a dead clone named Indian Bob, and his dog Homer who is female. They travel ever west in search of Hank's stolen record.Full of interesting characters and also the history of this future world, the pick up artist is both entertaining and thought provoking. Its hard not to compare it to the classic &quot;Fahrenheit 451,&quot; but the reasons for deletion are more complex. I highly reccomend this title."},{"Title":"THE PICKUP ARTIST.","review":"The Federal Bureau of Arts and Information provides a critical service for the people. They pick up, pay\`and destroy art that has had its &quot;place in the sun.&quot; The importance is to make room for new art because space is at a premium. Salinger and Miller are ancient history, and Shakespeare must have been off planet as the Alexandrians proud of that ancient fire rule the arts.BAI PICKUP ARTIST Hank Shapiro thinks nothing of seizing a Sinatra or a Monet for ultimate destruction. Hank is polite and professional as he goes about his job as the repo collector. However, Hank makes a colossal error when he collects a recording by his namesake, Hank Williams and cannot resist listening. When he loses the record, Hank is obsessed to regain it. He begins an odd odyssey across the country accompanied by his often-dead dog. They continually run into the Bob clones that seem everywhere and other assortment of weirdoes.THE PICKUP ARTIST is weird, amusing, and entertaining as if Fahrenheit 451 occurred in Eerie, Indiana. The story line is cleverly written engaging the audience with Hank's story and the history of the fire movement. Anyone who relishes a wonderful satirical science fiction at its most humorous yet quite insightful best will want to pick up award winning artist Terry Bisson's ironic look into the future.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"THE PICKUP ARTIST.","review":"I haven't read science fiction for a long time because science fiction had stopped being what it used to be. Science fiction used to be fun, challenging, stimulating, and critical. This novel brought all of those things back to me and I recommend it unreservedly. It starts with a neatly drawn, nicely consistent future society richly described with gritty detail. The characters are few but interesting and believable. The plot commenses with a nod towards Fahrenheit 451, but travels in unexpected directions. The author's style is reminiscent of Ray Bradbury, Alfred Bester, and Cordwainer Smith. Fine company for a contemporary author."},{"Title":"THE PICKUP ARTIST.","review":"I had to laugh at the number of &quot;stiff&quot; reviews of the Pickup Artist, here. A fun imagination is definitely required for reading, otherwise the tongue-in-cheek absurdity appears to get lost on some hapless folks.&quot;The Pickup Artist&quot; is most definitely absurd, but also very inventive, and surprisingly, even thought provoking. &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; it is not, nor does it try to be. Bisson is very successful in creating a world unto his own; crazy, yet consistent. The book's ending is solid, satisfying and even poignant.I would love to read more."},{"Title":"THE PICKUP ARTIST.","review":"Certainly, there are elements of Tom Robbins and Douglas Adams and Terry Gilliam in this book, but this is less like a story and more like a collection of interesting elements. The plot gets more and more nonchalantly weirder to the point of absurdity, so I was able to skim the last 50 pages without any worry that I'd miss anything important. I believe that the book could be improved by moving the interspersed &quot;history lesson&quot; to an appendix rather than forcing the reader to wade through it on the chance there's something interesting within."},{"Title":"THE PICKUP ARTIST.","review":"The other reviews have described this book in detail. I'd say Bisson pulled me along, sometimes kicking and screaming, only to land me with the line from a Hank William's record that the protagonist,Hank Shapiro, has been seeking throughout. I won't reveal the line, but whether imagined or real, these are his father's last words to Shapiro before the father leaves forever--words that Shapiro comes to realize he has fulfilled. It's this simple message from father to son that made this book worth reading."},{"Title":"THE PICKUP ARTIST.","review":"In a world where there's just too much music to hear, more art than one could possibly ever see, and (God knows) too many damn books to read, there's need for a pickup artist--someone to trash the old stuff in order to make way for the new. In Bisson's imaginary future, material by the Immortals (those artists born before 1900) is exempt; deletion from the canon is determined not by quality but by the randomness of age. So Hemingway survives and Steinbeck is destroyed. James Baldwin, Mark Rothko, Steve & Eydie--they will all be equally consigned to the trashbin of culture.It's hardly an unexpected plot twist that pickup artist Hank Shapiro is going to get curious about all that stuff he is sent out to hunt down and destroy. The surprise is that the artist who finally gets his attention is his namesake, Hank Williams, the crooner and composer of such memorable hits as \\"Diddy Wa Diddy\\" and \\"Honky Tonkin.\\" (True: a photograph of the singer on the album reminds Hank of his father--but still.) On the sly, he asks a Brooklyn librarian Henry (Henrietta) where he might get his hands on a forbidden turntable; the next thing you know, the LP, which he's supposed to turn into the bureau by day's end, goes missing.What starts out as a dystopian urban purgatory soon leads to a shootout in Brooklyn, which in turn forces Henry to embark on an impromptu road trip to Las Vegas with said librarian and her (sort of) dead lover, Indian Bob, to find the Hank Williams album and the meaning of life or, at least, of country music. On top of everything, Hank--the living one--has to rescue his dying dog, which he left at a clinic built (naturally) on top of a mountainous landfill on Staten Island. The book gets increasingly absurd as our merry band of adventurers travel west. There's an indestructible homing device that pursues the fugitives across the country. There are various pharmaceuticals with varying side effects. There are more than sixty Indian Bobs scattered about, some living, some not. (\\"All the Bobs are buried in one cemetery. It's part of the deal. We don't get an education, or a girl, or a decent job, but we get a burial plot.\\") Finally, there's a cataclysmic ending appropriate to the motto: What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.There's just enough to hold the reader's interest to the end, including some funny bits and a few good lines. But, too often, Bisson bets that his readers will find absurdity inherently funny, or that cloning a gag repeatedly will elicit additional laughs. Every time the travelers get on their way, the homing bug shows up. Every time Bob's corpse wakes up from a dose of HalfLife, he exclaims, \\"Oh, no! Am I dead?\\" Every time the dog talks (yes, the dog talks), his comment begins \\"Something smells funny/burned/wonderful/etc.\\" The goofier jokes don't get any better with repetition. Rather unnecessarily, Bisson includes alternating chapters that offer a \\"history\\" of the rise of the terrorist movement that brought about the future state of affairs; these sections, with their faux academic gravitas, add little in the way of hilarity, cleverness, or enlightenment.The nods to Bradbury, Vonnegut, Douglas Adams, Stanislaw Lem, Philip K. Dick (see: Ubik), and others are so unsubtle that the book feels less derivative than imitative, and readers might be forgiven if they feel that they've read this book before--many times. Not quite scornful enough to be satire, not witty enough to be parody, not absurd enough to be profound, and not elegant enough to be homage, it's a rather weak echo of its many predecessors, a slim effort that seems a lot longer than it is. But the true irony here is that, only a decade later, Bisson's book is already out of print--making way for far better fare."},{"Title":"THE PICKUP ARTIST.","review":"This is my third favourite book in all the world.

Echoes ofFahrenheit 451combined with dry wit in the first few pages made this seem like a natural fit for me. Unfortunately, the promise of the premise was never exactly realized. The story fell vaguely flat somehow - I am still not sure exactly where it went south, but just know that somewhere in the middle I realized I no longer cared what happened. Occasional witty bursts of prose combined with the premise kept me reading through to the end, but the story never quite seemed to live up to its potential - and more's the pity, because I really did love the concept."},{"Title":"History of Witchcraft","review":"This is a lengthy and exhaustive history of witchcraft and the occult written by the eccentric occult historian Montague Summers in 1927. Summers was well known for his many books on witchcraft, vampires, werewolves, and the history of the occult in general. He was generally considered The Expert on the history of witchcraft in the early 20th century and was filled with little-known anecdotal tales of witches, warlocks and dark devilish conspiracies as is evidenced by the many long dry examples in this book. This work is, however, a thorough reference on a arcane subject and is valuable for its many historical accounts of witch trials and other tales of witches, devils, and their arts. Summers is often criticized for his lack of skepticism, as noted below, as well as the heaps of praise he showers on the works of the Inquisition and its supposed war on witchcraft during the height of witch hysteria. His translations of notorious books like the Malleus Maleficarum and the Compendium Maleficarum, both witch hunting manuals used for centuries to detect, judge, and execute suspected witches, are his best-knwn works. Summers appears to revel in the age-old war against witches and often seemed a man born into the wrong time. He seems to wax nostalgic on the &quot;Burning Times&quot; and its blatant mysoginistic undertones, and this was in our &quot;modern&quot; age. In fact, he seems almost like a magistrate plucked from a 17th century witch burning and transplanted into the 20th century to write about his esteemed accomplishments! Yet, all this comes from a man who went to great lengths to transcribe and republish Reginald Scots' &quot;Discoverie of Witchcraft&quot;, a 16th century treatise DISCOUNTING the existence of witches and demons and which was banned by the Holy Office and ordered burned by King James I of England! Very interesting stuff indeed."},{"Title":"History of Witchcraft","review":"One of the first, and still the best, scholarly studies of witchcraft, which deals in general terms with its history and practices (the companion volume The Geography of Witchcraft describes specific cases of witchcraft from around the world). Summers's baroque language is ideally suited to his subject, which is treated seriously, but with considerable wit. His inclination to believe too much rather than too little has not always found favour, but he wrote from the viewpoint of a Catholic priest who, though he relished describing the ways of the witch, also roundly condemned them."},{"Title":"History of Witchcraft","review":"_The History of Witchcraft and Demonology_ by Roman Catholic priest Montague Summers provides a fascinating account of the influence of Satan on the development of witchcraft and heresy. Montague Summers, a convert to Catholicism, was an eccentric character - a priest who operated independently in England and wrote much on the occult and folklore from the perspective of a medieval traditionalist Roman Catholic. Summers argues against the so-called rationalists and skeptics who refuse to recognize the existence of the supernatural or the role of evil and of Satan in the world. Against these and other modernists, Summers provides the traditional Roman Catholic view regarding the demonic nature of heresy and the role of Satan in its proliferation.According to Summers, the witch is at once \\"heretic and anarchist\\". He seeks to show how all heresy, beginning with the dualistic Gnostic heresy including Manicheeism, is rooted in satanism and attempts to supplant the godly order of society and makes war against Christ and his Catholic Church. Among other heresies mentioned by Summers are those of the Waldensians, the Adamites, and the Cainites - Gnostics who spurned Christ and opted instead for the worship of Satan making an effort to identify with the sources of evil in Holy Scripture such as Cain and Judas Iscariot. Summers also mentions the Templars who became corrupted and engaged in vile acts including the worship of a human head known as the Baphomet. The witch, a devotee of Satan, may be understood as a revival of these most ancient and heinous heresies. Summers argues for the reality of witchcraft, claiming that there really existed a conspiracy against medieval society represented in witchcraft and that that conspiracy involved the worship of Satan, against the rationalists who attempt to explain it away through other means. Summers also argues against the theories of Margaret Murray, an anthropologist and Egyptologist who in her (in)famous book _The Witch-Cult in Western Europe_ argued that witchcraft represented a surviving pre-Christian pagan religion of Dianic worship which underlay medieval Christian society. Summers attempts to outline various features of the witch including the role of various demons and familiars, the witch's mark (believed to be an imprint left from the claw of Satan, and explaining the role of the \\"witch pricker\\"), the presence of a tiny nipple on the witch's body through which the familiar often in the form of a cat was nourished, and the role of the witch's sabbat. Summers also shows how the witch as Satanist sought to ape the Church of Christ, desecrate the host and religious objects, and engage in the black mass. Among others, Summers makes reference to such notorious criminals as Gilles de Rais (who engaged in the murder of children - another frequent accusation made against the witch) and the author J. K. Huysmans (whose novels feature Satanism and the black mass). Summers also turns his attention to the witch in Holy Writ. Here, he mentions the witch of Endor as well as bringing up such infamous injunctions against witchcraft as that in the Old Testament Exodus 22:18 \\"Wizards thou shalt not suffer to live.\\" In addition, Summers attempts to fully explain the phenomenon of diabolical possession. First, he notes the reality of diabolical possession and then he presents a discussion of the exorcism. Throughout he makes reference to Scripture, noting the exorcisms done by Christ himself and the apostles as well as from the history of the church and the lives of the saints. While the reality of the diabolical possession among those exorcised by Christ is de fide, some have argued that other exorcisms are more suspect (and others outside of the Catholic faith including Anglicans and other Protestants have rejected the practice entirely). Summers shows the errors in these rationalist and modernist explanations, and although it is possible that many were not in fact possessed, it is certainly the case that a great many were. In addition, Summers presents the entire Roman Ritual for exorcism. Summers also shows the use of exorcism among the Puritans, who often amateurishly attempted to copy the attempts of various Jesuits. Summers also explains spiritism (or spiritualism) in which a medium attempts to make contact with the dead or other discarnate spirits through various means. Summers shows the dangers of this and other occult beliefs presenting official documents from various church councils and popes. The church (and Summers) believe that much in spiritism can be explained as simply fraudulent practice; however, the fact remains that there is something diabolical at root behind spiritism and that often the spirits encountered in fact represent demons. Finally, Summers ends with a discussion of the witch in dramatic literature. Here, he presents details from various plays involving witchcraft including such famous examples as that of the Faust legend (presented in Goethe's _Faust_ and Marlowe's _Dr. Faustus_, for example) and in Shakespeare (especially the witches in _Macbeth_), etc.This book represents one of the best available on the history of witchcraft. Summers is obviously very learned and presents many obscure references, often in their original form (archaic English, French, Latin, or Greek), as well as stories from the lives of the saints, the history of the church, and Holy Scripture. Summers is unequivocally unapologetic for his rejection of modernism and thoroughly embraces the medieval viewpoint. He remains a fascinating and eccentric character whose books provide details on the occult of an encyclopedic scope."},{"Title":"History of Witchcraft","review":"This is a textbook of witchcraft and demonology written by the Catholic priest that found the need to translate the \\"Malleus Maleficarum\\" (the professional manual for witch hunters for nearly three centuries) into modern English. This was written prior to the modern Wiccan movement and discusses the horrors of sorcery and pacts with the devil. If you are looking for the definitive non-fiction work on the evils of witchcraft and demonology then, you have found it.

However, I didn't agree with his rather intense view (compared to the rest of the book) on spirtism. Also, the chapters' &quot;The witch in holy writ&quot; and &quot;The witch in dramatic literature&quot; were not chapters I found of great interest. This book is best for being a collection of examples of accounts with devils and demons."},{"Title":"History of Witchcraft","review":"I stumbled over this book purely by accident. I had no idea that Summers is still in print. It is like finding a long-lost childhood friend!Back in the 1950s I used to hang with ceremonial sorcerers and the occasional black magician in my old home town of San Francisco. I was an avid collector of old coinage, you see, and my main source for Indian head pennies and Liberty dimes was a strange little shop in the Mission District run by an old geezer who was also a taxidermist. He claimed to be over 200 years old, his life preserved and extended by ingesting certain Lovecraftian \\"essences\\" from his stock in trade. Frankly, I didn't believe him; I'm sure he wasn't a day over 150.Anyway, the shop was the local gathering place for the questing brotherhood. After all, if you lived in San Francisco and your grimoire called for, say, a tablespoon of bat's blood, where on earth were you going to get it but from your friendly and slightly weird local taxidermist? Let me make it clear that I never met a sorcerer who was anything but respectable. The black magicians in particular were the most law-abiding of people. One would-be necromancer spent his days visiting and cheering up elderly residents in hospitals. The story that he was sizing up future clients was a vile canard. These were not the social misfits who took up Satanism as peddled by Anton LaVey and all his charlatan successors; they came much later. Really, the only questionable thing about the sorcerers I knew was a deplorable tendency of some to walk about the streets in cloaks.From time to time, one sorcerer or another would take the plunge and attempt to conjure up a demon. (The more namby-pamby among them would say \\"daimon,\\" but it was a distinction without a difference.) Real ceremonial magic is not for the unindustrious or slothful. There are robes to be embroidered, wands to be cut, blades to be forged, sigils to be drawn, flames to be lit, smokes to be inhaled and, believe it or not, prayers to be uttered. It is a long, intense, fatiguing process and, what the heck, it sometimes worked. It worked, that is, to the extent that an exhausted and half wigged-out sorcerer would convince himself that he had indeed called up a spirit from the vasty deep. And it would scare him silly. (In one of his books, Aleister Crowley gives a lengthy description of his shot at demon-raising and the absolutely predictable result.)After a bout of demonism, sorcerers would check in for short stays at convenient psychiatric facilities or, perhaps more likely, go on long benders. Then it was back to the taxidermy shop for sorcerous bull sessions about the esoteric literature then in print. (Grimoires, of course, were only valid in manuscript form and copies were held secret and unique to each individual sorcerer.) Eliphas Levi, the consensus held, was instructive but unsound in detail. Aleister Crowley was suggestive but ultimately incomprehensible--a delusion and a snare. Montague Summers was regarded as sound as to historical facts and crazy as a bedbug with regard to conclusions. The sorcerers of San Francisco, by and large, subscribed to the often quoted opinion that Summers' learning was as vast as his stupidity."},{"Title":"History of Witchcraft","review":"Although Summers was a very educated man, he appeared to hold little skepticism for the alleged crimes of accused witches.

The meaning of passages is sometimes quite elusive."},{"Title":"History of Witchcraft","review":"This work about witchcraft, sorcery, black magic, neuromancy, damnation, Satanism and every kind of magic and occult is written by the undisputed scholar in the field and is a work of unprecedented authority, of interest to all who are connected with the subject."},{"Title":"History of Witchcraft","review":"I am a historian who a focuses on Reformation issues, and I wrote many papers over the last three years on the history of witchcraft from an anthropological point of view. There are several wonderful studies of witches and witchcraft, mainly by Protestants during the time of the religious upheavals and the witch hunts (Cotton Mather has some interesting ideas). Montague Summers' writings were trying to revive a dying belief, and he was a complete crackpot (no, not a professional term, of course). He believed in witches entirely, though felt that there were very few true witches left. The only value that this book or any other that Summers wrote has is to show how people once believed."},{"Title":"History of Witchcraft","review":"5 stars if you're planning to make a hollywood horror movie; you'll be swarming in dubious info, perfect for any imaginary work. -1 star for taking every thrown-at anecdote as proof enough, as if the phobia of all (so-called) secular beliefs after the beginning of the world's christianising would not result in as many fictional beliefs and false histories as that which secular cultures heathenishly accept. -1 more stars because 4 points is too high a grade.However, there may be some truth to what he says. How widespread these practices were, and whether they were at all related to a diabolic entity from Christiandom is another matter.It must also be noted that present-day Witchcraft (Wicca) and Satanism (Church of Satan) are mostly harmless institutions: they do not eat pies made from human babies and exhumed corpses. There are practically no police records of any virgins being napped off for sacrifice at some altar or other. None to worry there. Nor prejudice."},{"Title":"History of Witchcraft","review":"In the introduction Mr Summers tells the reader that there has never been an unbiased and factual account of witchcraft. He tries to pass his book off as being unbiased, when in fact he is using the exact same bias found in the 17th and 18th centuries. He likens witchcraft to devil worship, likens to the pagan celebrations to sexual orgies and debauchery. Like the rest of the fools of his day, he got it wrong. Was there devil worship going on in his day? Most certainly there was. Fertility rituals for crops, healing the sick from natural medicines, and folk practices are not devil worship. The bible describes Lucifer (i.e the devil, satan) as a beautiful angel. The church, made by and run by man, created a foul image of the devil being half man and half beast, like many of the old pagan gods. The accounts of witchcraft found in this book are twisted and perverted to fit into the scope of devil worship. He makes hurdles of judgement, leaps to conclusions, and formulates opinions based on fiction. He seems to be determined to make witchcraft out to be evil, in fact seems determined to make anything other than catholicism out to be evil.Summers is a fool, just like his peers, and produced a \\"history\\" of witchcraft and demonology based on superstition and fear. Why a man of god uses the tools of the devil is beyond my realm of understanding.Don't waste your time reading this heap if you are interested in pre-christian religions. Don't read this heap if you are interested in demons. The only reason I would recommend reading this book is to see how christians view pagans and their religion. This is as bad as it gets.The sad thing is, some of Summers' other books are really quite good. I read his books about vampires and werewolves about ten years ago, and rather enjoyed them. It would be more accurate to call this book a \\"history of devil worship and demonology.\\""},{"Title":"History of Witchcraft","review":"I read a review of someone talking about how this author doesn't understand Wicca...

While there are many excellent books on traditional tapas by Spanish food experts such as Penelope Casas, this book gives us a whole new look at this genre of cooking.The first thing that appeals to me about the book is the organization of the chapters by principle ingredient. The highlighted ingredients are:Olives and olive oilTomatoesPotatoesMushroomsLegumesPeppersVegetables and MoreCitrusGarlic and onionsRiceCheese and eggsFishShellfishChickenPorkOther MeatsThe first entry is obvious as there is no cuisine on earth, even the Italian cucina that is more infused with olive oil, as Spain is the producer of the largest share of the world's olive oil by a significant margin. Things the French may do with pork fat, such as confits, the Spanish do with olive oil.Of course, I could not resist jumping to the chapter on potatoes to see Andres' take on the Spanish tortilla or, as Andres puts it, \`Tortilla de patatas' which is actually much less confusing than its more familiar name. Virtually every treatment I have seen of \`Tortilla do patatas' uses the same basic four ingredients, potatoes, eggs, onions, and olive oil, plus salt, and Andres' recipe is no exception. The procedure is just a bit more fussy than traditional recipes, with the quartered and thinly sliced Idaho potatoes being fried to almost the consistency of a chip before combining with the other ingredients. The saut&eacute;ed onions are also given a special treatment in that they are strained to remove excess oil after cooking.Otherwise, the recipe is pure tradition. That cannot be said of the next recipe, where the raw potatoes are replaced with commercially available potato chips. Instead of sauteeing the potatoes, the chips are \`marinated' in the raw egg. The tortilla is then cooked de rigeur, but without onions.There are a lot of little things about this book that endear it to me. In addition to the organization, I like the table of contents at the beginning of each chapter which gives the Spanish and English names of each dish plus the wine tip for the dish. This small consideration means, for example, that you can look down the list of mushroom dishes to find one which best matches a wine you may wish to serve.Be clear that chef Andres goes far beyond the original meaning of tapas from Andalusia where it meant something to cover your glass of wine, generally sherry. This means that not all the dishes herein are \`finger food' AND many, such as the lobster paella and the roasted beef tenderloin will serve well as a full course of a sit-down meal. On the other hand, almost all recipes are imbued with the tapas spirit in that they are relatively easy to prepare, although some, such as the \`slow-roasted' beef tenderloin may take a fair amount of hands off cooking time. On the other hand, I did find some instructions that begged more details. One dish instructs us to add vinegar to an olive oil confit, with no instructions on how we are to get the oil and vinegar to work together. So, the price for the simple instructions is that you will do much better with these recipes if you already know your way around the kitchen.In addition to the \`Tortilla do patatas', I found several other takes on very familiar recipes such as the apple, cheese, and walnut salad which is customized by the use of Murcia al vino goat cheese instead of a blue cheese and the absence of a green such as Belgian endive.Overall, we get about 120 relatively simple recipes at the standard price on a popular theme but all with enough of a twist to raise the eyebrows of the culinary cognizanti."},{"Title":"Tapas: A Taste of Spain in America","review":"\\"A Taste of Spain in America\\" makes the perfect holiday gift for anyone who enjoys cooking, glorious photos of food, or Spanish culinary delights. The book is gorgeous and easy to use. Designed for the home cook, the recipes are inventive and interesting, but not intimidating. Directions are clear and concise, and ensure that the novice chef -- or an experienced cook just learning about tapas -- can create attractive and tasty dishes. Chapters are designed around ingredients, so if you don't like olives, or fish, or mushrooms, you can just skip those sections. At the same time, this arrangement allows you to fully explore the possibilities of an ingredient through multiple, varied recipes. A sure winner!"},{"Title":"Tapas: A Taste of Spain in America","review":"I bought this book because a friend of mine took me to Andres' restaurant in DC while on vacation. I loved the food and wanted to recreate it when I got home.The main thing I like about the book is that it has the recipes for the items offered in the restaurant. I know what they are supposed to taste like because I've tasted them at the restaurant. Many times you buy the cookbook for a TV chef or restaurant chef and it doesn't have the recipes from the show or the restaurant which is annoying to me. The directions and ingredients are very easy to follow and I love the pictures showing me what the end product is supposed to look like and with plating suggestions.The reason I gave it four stars instead of five wasn't necessarily because of the book itself. Many of the recipes have complicated components that must be made ahead of time. There are many ingredients that aren't commonly found in grocery stores requiring a trip to a specialty market. In most cases, substitutions are suggested. Many of these recipes aren't last minute \\"I have guests coming over and need something to serve them recipes\\". This is more of a planned evening, probably with everyone in the kitchen drinking wine as the tapas are prepared and placed out for everyone to enjoy."},{"Title":"Tapas: A Taste of Spain in America","review":"I just recently purchased the book, Love it! The recipes are very well written, very easy to follow, not too many ingredients. I have tried quite a few of the recipes and have received very pleasing comments! The book is well worth the purchase price, great holiday gift for the cook at heart.Darlene"},{"Title":"Tapas: A Taste of Spain in America","review":"We found this book in the local public library and tried three or four things from it. They were wonderful. We bought the book and have loved almost everything we've tried. In fact, our New Year's dinner and our Valentine's dinner were both home-cooked tapas meals, with almost everything prepared from this book. It's wonderful."},{"Title":"Tapas: A Taste of Spain in America","review":"Despite being a long-time self-professed foodie, gourmand, and accomplished cook, I'm not usually a fan of cookbooks, finding most shallow in technique and ideas, with big names or glossy photos trying to cover for a lack of substance.Jose Andres' cookbook, by comparison has a big name -- the man responsible for some of the best dining in the Washington DC area, and lots of glossy photos. But it breaks the stereotype I expected by tying in culture, techniques, and excellent combinations of ingredients.The book is broken into chapters by its inspiring ingredient (eg, \\"potatoes\\" or \\"olive oil\\"). Each chapter has an introduction on the subject food, and each recipe in each chapter has both background on what makes the recipe special in Spain (or what inspired his creation of the recipe), and a tip on making the dish, as well as a suggested Spanish wine pairing. And of course the recipe itself, and the requisite gloriously glossy photo.All of that works and works really well. The book is a joy to flip through, the recipes seem attainable, and the writing is inspired. Highly recommended whether you're new to the world of small plates or already an experienced fan of tapas."},{"Title":"Tapas: A Taste of Spain in America","review":"I gave a Tapas Party for 11 last night. The guests, who ranged in age from 19 to 60, helped prepare dishes from this cookbook. The recipes are well-written and pretty easy to follow. We all had a blast, loved the food, and learned a lot. Our favorite recipes were Traditional Astrian Bean Stew; Rack of Lamb with Honey Allioli; Tortilla de Patatas; Artichokes Sauteed with Ham; and Rustic Bread with Dark Chocolate, Olive Oil, and Salt (Really! You've got to try it!). For a special occasion, it is worth taking the trouble to gather the authentic Spanish ingredients, because they make all the difference. Our local stores stock many of the ingredients and can order others. I ordered chorizo, Serrano ham, and Spanish beans from La Tienda (latienda.com). I am going to buy this book for passionate cooks."},{"Title":"Tapas: A Taste of Spain in America","review":"I've always liked tapas, but I never knew much about their history and preparation until I came across this book. I have to admit that I've never read a book about food cover-to-cover, but this one was written so beautifully that I was just captivated."},{"Title":"Tapas: A Taste of Spain in America","review":"UPDATE 2012I have now cooked several dishes from this book. I have change my rating from four to one star. This is because the recipes are very inaccurate. They are written in a very sloppy manner, sometimes salt is totally forgotten. One recipe calls for 1 lb of mushroom and 2 cups of olive oil, which is supposed to result in 1.5 cups of finished product. How is this possible? The same recipe is full of other inconsistencies. In another recipe one is supposed to stuff cherry tomatoes with crab. Has the author really seen a cherry tomato? In another recipe we are supposed to heat the oil to medium-high heat or around 160F. How can that me medium high. Sure, if you know your Spanish food you can always modify the recipes. But if you know Spanish food I don't think you would by a beginner's book anyway. Really sloppy work. Sad because the DVDs are useful.ORIGINAL REVIEWThe author's selection of tapas; some fairly traditional and some with novel twists. Each tapas gets a spread of two pages (picture + text). Many recipes contain genuine Spanish meat and cheese products that are now available in the US. The selection is geared towards an American audience (eg several lobsters because they are cheap in the US), but that shouldn't stop people based in other parts of the world from enjoying the book. Recommended."},{"Title":"Tapas: A Taste of Spain in America","review":"This is a great cookbook for people who want to dine sensibly but to dine \\"fine.\\" My wife and I have been enjoying its recipes about once a week. For us the small portions inherent in the \\"tapas\\" idea and their healthy Mediterranean ingredients have opened up a new way to cook and to eat. Recipes typically defy characterization by course since many of the dishes presented include not only(smaller) amounts of meats, poultry or seafood but also vegetables, fruits or legumes, nuts and so on. That quality of combining wide-ranging sources of nutrition makes each dish suitable to become the center of a sensible meal. In fact, we recently returned to Barcelona and found that Spaniards are increasingly doing just that in their tapas restaurants, combining different tapas into a \\"tasting menu\\" approach to dining.The recipes in this book have winning features: ingredients are simple and are increasingly available in mainstream markets as well as in Latino food stores, dishes are quick to prepare and to cook, little or no special equipment is needed and the results are as tasty as you make them by purchasing quality fresh or processed ingredients. Online sources are given for those persons wishing to do \\"authentic\\" versions of each recipe or people who don't have hispanic sections in their food markets. After all, Jose Andres does most of his cooking in his three Washington, D.C. restaurants with ingredients he can find in America.I can not recommend this cookbook highly enough. Spanish food is neither greasy nor spicy and has little in common with the folkloric foods of Texas, Mexico or the Caribbean cultures. Jose Andres is a pied piper when it comes to leading an American audience to appreciate the culture and the foods of his Spanish homeland."},{"Title":"Tapas: A Taste of Spain in America","review":"When we traveled in Spain we discovered many different Tappas that everyone liked!

A few points may help you use this book to the full. Often, in Spain, a dish is available as a tapa, a half order, or a full order. This is because a restaurant really wants you to stay and eat there and not leave to try somewhere else. So, if it seems like the portion is large, it is. You should either share it, or plan on making it a main course, not a tapa. Second, to get the true feeling of what tapas are, try doing a tapear yourself. Get a group of friends together and pick an area with a number of restaurants. Then, start at one, have a drink and a something to eat, either an appetizer or an entree shared among the group. Talk and enjoy then, move on to the next place an repeat. This is a great way to spend an evening, and you don't even have to go to Spain. Then try at home with several of the recipes from this book. You will have a much better idea of what tapas are all about."},{"Title":"Tapas: A Taste of Spain in America","review":"I love this book! An entire chapter just for mushrooms, fabulous!!

I bought this book some years ago, and tried a few of the recipes with limited success. Now that we've moved away, we're jonesing for some yummy tapas. Also, we both did the Master Cleanse, which made us both more conscious of our food intake.Using fresh/local/organic vegetables, these recipes really pop. The cooking is actually quite simple for most of the veggie dishes, and it's easy to eat entire vegetarian meals without realizing there isn't a meat centerpiece. It is very important that the main ingredients are fresh and yummy, though - get a good olive oil (Spanish, of course, as is everything in the book). I actually have carried the book with me while shopping so that once I found fresh meat or veggies I could look up a recipe and be sure to get the rest of the ingredients.My wife has handled the cooking for several years, but upon picking up this book again I have cooked probably 10-12 dishes without a miss. It is definitely an accessible book, especially the soups and vegetable dishes. A couple beef and chorizo recipes are easy, too. Tapas-style eating (multiple small dishes) is very enjoyable and helps bring the restaurant experience into our home.When your spouse stops dinner to take photos of the plates you know you're doing something right.

I'm not living in the complete middle of nowhere, but a town of 100,000 is not large enough to stock things like monkfish or spanish chorizo or any of the other dozen essential ingredients Andres uses. He doesn't acknowledge that any of his essentials might be rare, and so never indicates alternative ingredients.The book itself, of course, is great.

I don't really mind that though, I was getting sick of hearing about the wanawut and the full titles of the first three books anyway.This is the ending book, we are moving on without our familar friends and the one people have now two bands because of a dispute that our hero Torka is too old to reslove. It is sad to see them go, and watching Torka breaking the symbol of the people, but we must follow the herds to the summer breeding grounds."},{"Title":"Walkers of the Wind","review":"While well-written enough in a technical sense, the story was very disappointing. The story lurches from disaster to disaster and from sexual interlude to sexual interlude. These were apparently intended to be titillating (but failed) and included animal sex, rape (forced bestiality and child-rape) and incest. While some of the characters (such as an old hunter) were well-realized, most of the main characters were little more than cardboard stereotypes pushed into predictable conflicts, such as the Girl on Drugs and then the Sassy Woman Who Wants To Be A Hunter. Characters were alternately primitive and disconcertingly sophisticated. There was very little detail in how day to day life was carried out; not that I would want the story to have bogged down, but more detail would have conveyed the sense that the author actually had done more than the most cursory research on what people had to do to survive.In short, the story was little more than an angsty caveman-style &quot;bodice ripper&quot;. Ho-hum."},{"Title":"Walkers of the Wind","review":"Okay, I liked this book, but not as much as the first three in the &quot;The First American&quot; series. I'll start with the bad first.What I didn't like was the seeming inability of Manaravak (one of Torka's sons) to come to grips with who and what he actually is. Because of this, he made mistakes that cost his people dearly. I also didn't like the actions of one of the young women in the tribe, and the fact that she was able to get away with things for so long. And while her actions did add to the tension in the story, I had hoped for a different resolution.Also, a couple of scenes require a stretch of your imagination to believe that such a thing could happen. That I didn't like because it almost transformed the book from an historical adventure to something bordering on fantasy. But since it was a small part, it didn't do much damage.Now on to what I did like. For one thing, the pace was good. Events moved along at a pretty fast clip that left little room for boredom. And the setting and action was described with sufficient detail to give you a clear picture of what's going on.The book read like a true adventure story -- there was always something happening that usually involved danger and required a struggle and courage. The plot was also pretty good.I would recommend this book to all readers, and especially to those who've started on the series. It is a good book and it's still interesting to see how these characters lives are still being shaped."},{"Title":"Walkers of the Wind","review":"This book depicts people at their worst. While it could have been an interesting read about early American hunters and gatherers, the horrific details of rape, incest, pedophilia, and murder just got worse and worse.

It seemed as though the book was just a venue for writing about pedophelia, which he discusses in great and endless detail."},{"Title":"Walkers of the Wind","review":"Great books, never a dull moment, and the books come in great condition, i would recommend all the books in the series of this wonderful author, thanks, Catherine"},{"Title":"Walkers of the Wind","review":"Another excellent book.

This book describes it from genesis to today, covering every significant development and deployment. The book is remarkable not only because of the authoritative detail but because Gillcrist is so candid. He's sometimes biased and doesn't mind admitting it--but he always back up a controversial opinion with facts. This book is highly recommended for anyone interested in air warfare and naval aviation. The pictures are terrific, though only 'blanket' credited when unofficial. But you'll see the great work of 'Heater' Heatley--nuff said!"},{"Title":"Tomcat!: The Grumman F-14 Story","review":"The book is a magnificent celebration of the birth, life and early demise of the F-14. Well written and filled with outstanding photographs this is the definitive F-14 book. The only problem is that the supply appears to be limited.Forty years ago I sat in class reading the case study on General Dynamics and the TFX, McNamara's one plane fits all solution to military procurement. Fortunately for our country seval Navy admirals sacrificed their careers to prevent that disaster from being imposed on the nation. Grumman stepped into the breach and delivered the F-14 which evolved to become one of the premier fighters and ground attack aircraft.My personal belief is that when the history of the 2000-2015 period is written, perhaps 30 or 40 years into the future, military historians will look back on the forced retirement of the F-14d's and follow on models as one of the tragic mistakes that cost the nation dearly. The premature retirement of the F-14d and the failure to follow on with a next generation fighter to carry the improved Phoenix missile increases the risk that the history of the next two decades night be written by the others, as is the privledge of the victor."},{"Title":"Tomcat!: The Grumman F-14 Story","review":"...written histories of the F-14 Tomcat. You can tell from the narration that the author was intimately familiar with the aircraft and knew the aircraft well, rather than coming across as some book-learned egghead that still refers to the Tomcat's mission as 'Fleet Air Defense'.

Written by a retired admiral who was involved with the F-14 program from the beginning, the book walks you through the development, deployment and the improvement programs and the various politics of the program up to 1994 (the publishing date). The second half of the book is mostly about saving the F-14 program and it is therefore mostly hoopla on the author's particular position on the matter. Personally I did bot agree with the author's position and for the matter neither did the US Navy. To the author's credit he acknowledges that his position was different than the powers that be, however his particular bias does taint the book somewhat. Personally as much as I like the F-14 it is tremendously overrated aircraft and I feel that the Navy's retirement of it in favour of the Super Hornet was a good move. The problem wjth the author's bias is that you do not get an effective evaluation of the aircraft i feel. The book doesn't spend much time placing the F-14 in comparison to it's rivals or even gives much technical information but rather draws an overall narrative of the F-14s life so bear that in mind when purchasing. Also if you are buying this for the purpose of making models (as I am) then there the photography in this book is of limited benefit, and the information is not detailed enough to warrant a purchase. Nevertheless an interesting read."},{"Title":"Tomcat!: The Grumman F-14 Story","review":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0887406645/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleEqually interesting and fascinating photographs; well written, definitely not lame...

And to be honest it starts out good but when it gets to \\"Mama stoops to kiss my hand.

I'm not a Christian but I think it's a little weird to be comparing our families move to Jesus's death."},{"Title":"Boxes, Boxes Everywhere","review":"My son, daughter-in-law, and their 18-month old daughter were moving from a small apartment into their first house. I wanted to help my grand-daughter cope with the move so bought this book and a few others about families moving for her.

My grand-daughter still asks for the \\"box book\\" to be read to her."},{"Title":"Boxes, Boxes Everywhere","review":"My children and I loved this book and read it when we went through our move. It is not comparing moving to Jesus' death, but to the fact that He left Heaven to come to a new home. It helps a child understand that he is not alone and that even Jesus had been through this tough change. That was actually my very favorite part of the book and brings tears to my eyes when I get to that part. I am buying this book for a friend that is moving - her children are having a tough time with it and I thought they would find it comforting, as my children did."},{"Title":"Boxes, Boxes Everywhere","review":"I started reading this to my son about 2 months before we moved.

For older children it could be a great way to get them talking about an upcoming move."},{"Title":"Boxes, Boxes Everywhere","review":"I love this book. We are a military family and move quite often. I first purchased the book about four years ago. The perspective it takes to moving is a far different approachh than any other book I've encountered. It deals with the emotions and perceptions of a toddler who is moving but then brings those feelings around to Jesus. The book was developed by the MOPS (Mothers of Preschoolers) program and it subtly gets your child to understand he/she can rely on Jesus during the move. He will understand.

The focus is on the famous: Great big photos of silver screen idols from the silent days through the studio era and beyond. There's a bit of history (mostly tangential to the people making the movies), a little scandal, good &quot;behind the scenes&quot; images and facts, and some attention to non-American film, but this is mostly the public face of Hollywood. &quot;Life Goes to the Movies&quot; features an outstanding collection of large format photos, many of them familiar (although many of them will be new to readers). The overriding spirit is a celebration, not of &quot;film,&quot; but of what fans know and love as the &quot;movies.&quot;"},{"Title":"Life Goes to the Movies","review":"This book may be difficult to find since it's out of print. And it's definitely one that's entertaining and interesting enough to warrant re-publication.It's about a rare and distant world -- a world where movie stars were glamorous and remote, held high on pedestals and expected to be more beautiful, more exciting and much, much more exotic that everyday folks. They were seen as always perfectly coiffed and smiling, loved and treasured, surrounded by adoring sycophants.Back then movies were larger-than-life stories that had little to do with actual living and a lot to do with romantic (even sentimental) entertainment. Movie makers seemed to be having as good a time making movies as audiences had watching them. And according to this book, they were! It was a win/win world.The volume is divided into three chapters: \\"The Stars,\\" \\"The Buildup,\\" \\"The Movies,\\" \\"The Studio\\" and \\"Behind the Scenes'\\" reprinting highlights of magazine coverage of the movie industry from 1935 to 1972 (when sex and violence took over and people who loved movies for entertainment quite going to theaters).It's fair to say the book is a mirror of the successes and failure of both Life magazine and movies. It's a fabulous collection of romance and romantics. If you remember the Old Hollywood, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Deracination","review":"H.B. Huisinga's debut novel is a tightly-woven, fast paced mystery thriller that showcases her natural talent as an author. In Deracination she has created characters you'll love, and some you'll love to hate. Fans of forensic science, computer hacking and Egyptian mythology will all find something to sink their teeth into in this page-turner.Five years after meeting--and marrying--under extraordinary circumstances, Horus and Monet Quinn are jarred out of their routine by a violent attack. Monet has never explained her past to her husband, and he hasn't asked her to. Now, their lives are on the line--and hundreds more may depend on their trust for one another.An important theme of the novel involves the main character Monet's journey of self-realization and recovery from sexual abuse. The reader will find Huisinga's approach to the subject challenging and thought-provoking; those with an interest in survivor issues will find themselves alternately crying with Monet--and cheering for her successes--as the plot unfolds.Can't wait for the sequel!"},{"Title":"Deracination","review":"This novel draws the reader into the novel with well developed characters and a quickly moving plot line that surprises and entices.

Ropes has written a classic history of the Union Army of under the brief leadership of John Pope which ended with Pope's defeat at the hands of Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson at Second Manassas in August 1862. This slim book was part of a &quot;Campaigns of the Civil War&quot; series originally published in the 1880s, and the current edition is a verbatim of the original.While much has been said about Pope's bombastic &quot;Headquarters in the Saddle&quot; speech that offended many of the rank and file, and of his &quot;scorched earth&quot; policies that prompted Robert E. Lee to label Pope a &quot;miscreant&quot;, recent histories suggest that it was the selfishness of George McClellan and the uncooperative attitudes of McClellan's lieutenants who served under Pope, specifically Fitz-John Porter, that were primarily to blame for Pope's resounding defeat.This contemporary account of the actions of Pope's army pretty much affirms the recent accounts, commenting on how Pope was able to consolidate the scattered and badly beaten (by Jackson) elements of the Union forces in the Shenandoah into one cohesive force. Pope also established a pretty credible Union cavalry force that unfortunately was not supported by the Union infantry. This actually led to Pope's undoing when John Buford and a small cavalry force found itself alone up against Longstreet's entire corps in the Thoroughfare Gap. Forced to concede the Gap, the Union cavalry alerted Pope to the fact that Longstreet was coming in to relieve Jackson, who was pretty badly battered. Pope refused to heed this warning until it was too late, and was soundly thrashed.The reluctance of Fitz-John Porter to commit his corps to the fray, and of his mentor McClellan refusal to send troops already promised to Pope only contributed to an inevitable, though not necessary defeat.If only Ropes' book, with its small print wasn't so difficult to read!Even the wonderfully graphic maps are barely legible. I would recommend &quot;Second Manassas&quot; from the Time-Life Voices of the Civil War series, and &quot;Return to Bull Run&quot; by John Hennessey for further exploration of the Pope period in the Union Army."},{"Title":"The army under Pope (Campaigns of the Civil War)","review":"This books is a compantion volume to Francis Palfrey's \\"The Peninsula\\". McClellen moved the Army of the Potomaic by sea to drive up the Yorktown peninsula on Richmond. Pope remained behind with what was renamed the \\"Army of Virginia\\" to defend Washington (The only instance of a Union army being named after a state instead of a river.) It was hoped that he could keep Washington covered while advancing on Richmond, and link up there with McClellen. But Stonewall Jackson was loose in the Shenandoah, which posed the threat of an end run attack on Washington. Lincoln feared for Washington's safty and kept Pope's force pinned at Fredericksburg, while Jackson slipped from the valley to join Lee in the defeat of McClellen. Once McClellen was beaten and withdrawing by sea, Lee and Jackson turned against Pope. Pope was defeated at the battle of Manassas (2nd Bull Run) and retreated into the city of Washington.This excellent study of small unit actions shows exactly what the opposing commanders were thinking and worrying about. The appendix contains actual exchanges of battlefield communications.Readers should know this 1885 classic is public domain and available in many editions which vary wildly in quality and type size.This book is part of a 12 volume set.(1) The Outbreak of Rebellion - John G.

Lee then attempts to cross the Potomac and invade the north.(5) The Antietam & Fredericksburg; McClellen having returned from the peninsula stops Lee's invasion at Antietam but fails to destroy his army. Burnside takes over and pursues Lee to Fredericksburg, where the Union army self-destructs in an assault on its fortified heights.(6) Chancellorsville & Gettysburg - Hooker replaces Burnside and tries to take the Union army around Fredericksburg, but is bluffed from the dense forests around Chancellorsville. Lee again breaks free and this time invades Pennsylvania but is stopped at Gettysburg.(11) The Shenandoah Valley in 1864; this valley is a thorn in the Union's flank, and is ultimately razed so Union forces can operate more freely in the east.(12) Virginia Campaign of '64 & '65; Lincoln is desperate to end the war.

It will be bloody, but he wants all losses immediately replaced to his army remains at full strength during the long bloody grind to Richmond.IIB- Western Theatre(2) From Fort Henry to Corinth; The Confederacy hoped to fortify the upper Mississippi in Missouri and Kentucky as a jumping off point to invade the north.

Many publishers offer cheap digital scans with illegible maps and text that is difficult to read -- apparently this reviews stepped on one such land mine.The best editions by far are those from DSI digital scans, with flawless text and clear maps. Most of the have the \\"Look Inside\\" feature so you can see for yourself. Here is the DSI edition:[...]For some unfortunate reason, DSI's editions usually don't appear when you search these titles. Try searching a title with DSI after the name, but even that doesn't always work.The Da Capo edition is also good. It's editions are a little smaller in size but of high quality and with excellent contemporary introductions.Final comment - I'm no expert or professional Civil War buff, so don't treat anything I've written as such.

Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Widow's War: A Novel","review":"Although not generally a fan of historical fiction, I enjoyed this story, which is set in Santucket Village, Massachusetts in 1761, about a fisherman's widow trying to come to terms with her change in station during her first year of widowhood. Within the book's first few pages, Lydia \\"Lyddie\\" Berry, a 39-year-old woman, learns of her husband-of-twenty-years' death. Because of her status as a widow, her husband's will, as is common at the time, allows her only one-third rights to the property and home she shared with him. Almost immediately, she's forced to move in with her daughter and son-in-law, who must take on financial responsibility for her but gains two-thirds rights to the property and house. The couple resent her presence and the burden of her care, so, trying to avoid (p 283) \\"What might she become if she stayed...A thing that sat in the corner knitting unwanted stockings, trying to contain her tongue against her son-in-law, and even her own daughter?\\" she chooses to defy convention and demand her \\"one-thirds\\" rights to her former home. Complicating things further, she decides to befriend a neighboring Indian family. Additionally, the townsfolk shun her as she appears to be heading down a heathenistic path. Although I'm all about facilitating the empowerment of women, what I liked even more was the fact that Lyddie's actions throughout seemed consistent with her character. The ending was a little vague (and I prefer to know what happens, even if I don't like it), but overall, The Widow's War was an entertaining, easy-to-read story about empowerment. Also good: The Egg and I by Betty MacDonald, The Perfect Storm by Sebastian Junger, and The Weight of Water by Anita Shreve."},{"Title":"The Widow's War: A Novel","review":"If you approach this story as a light, short read with some interesting parts you will enjoy it. I was looking for some more emotion, a tighter and more realistic story line so I was a little disappointed.The story begins as Lyddie Berry finds herself widowed. Her husband, Edward, a whaler, has drowned while at sea. To complicate her sorrow, she discovers that she is only entitled to 1/3 of the home she had shared with him for twenty years. Her ruthless son in law (this character was overwritten, in my opinion) wants her to sell the home and live with he and her daughter. She also befriends an indian couple that live on part of the property and, as the story unfolds, play a role in the narrative.I enjoyed reading about life in colonial Cape Cod, I enjoyed some of the colorful characters, I really enjoyed the part of the story that dealt with Lyddie's daughter (her only surviving child) and her torn allegiance between the husband and the mother, but I found the total story a bit too modern for it to be realistic. There is no way that a woman in that time could turn her back on family, community, church and carry on an affair (with an indian no less) and come out on top. I liked the fact that she did, but the whole thing was just too modern to be true. I did not appreciate, also, that until about 2/3 into the book all the men in the story are either evil, drunk or both. Surely we could not have gotten this far as a nation if that were true.Overall the book is harmless enough, as I said it is short, and if you are interested in the time period it will sufficiently keep your attention."},{"Title":"The Widow's War: A Novel","review":"\\"A Widow's War\\", more than anything, gave me a glimpse of the life of a woman in the 1700s in New England. The laws were such that a woman had little autonomy. The story was interesting, but it was the circumstances of the times that made Lyddie's actions the ones she had to make - - or, rather - - the ones she chose to make. They were very difficult choices and, given the harshness of life at that time, it made me wonder how many modern women would have made those same choices."},{"Title":"The Widow's War: A Novel","review":"I just could not put this book down. From the very first page, I became so immersed in the world of Lyddie Walker, I almost felt as if I became her. But she was so much more clever than I could ever be, and braver, and tougher.

The book was a depiction of the legal system, religion and prejudice (in this case Native American Indians) and how those systems and laws affected women in times past, some with good intentions in mind but, because it put all the trust and power in the men folk, also allowed abuse toward women in general but especially widowed woman. When her husband dies at sea, the main character proclaims war on the conventional rules and laws of the time.This was another's book club choice which is why I enjoy the book club so much, reading wonderful books that I might never have know about or picked up myself.

I know my close friends might be tired of hearing me refer to it, except they enjoyed it, too.It's so nice to be swept into a book from the beginning page. WIDOW'S WAR certainly does that to me. Ms. Gunning has the ability to craft her research and develop the characters in such a way as to bring them to life and make them matter to the reader from the outset.Another good aspect about the author's writing is learning details about our past that I had heard about or not known about before. Being a pre and post-Revolutionary War buff, I had some acquaintance with the \\"Widows' and Orphans' Laws\\", but now know more, thanks to Ms. Gunning. Women were better provided for under Spanish law than English. Woe betide the unfortunate woman who would be widowed and too cowed or afraid to think for herself in those times. Marriage was a form of serfdom, and perhaps to some, still is."},{"Title":"The Widow's War: A Novel","review":"I really enjoyed this novel by Sally Gunning. I particularly enjoyed the main character Lydia Berry and her struggle to find her place in the world after her husband passes away.Edward Berry is a whaler, married twenty years to Lyddie, when an unfortunate turn of events leads to his death. It is what Lyddie has feared her entire married life. Grieving for her loss she moves into her daughter and son-in-law's home and finds that she is unable to do what is expected of her. Instead she breaks with custom and eventually challenges the law that forces her from her home of twenty years.Gunning paints and interesting portrait of colonial life before the revolutionary war and sheds light on a little known custom where widows inherit only one third use of their husband's house while all property was passed to another male in the family.I really liked the characters Gunning created particularly Lyddie Berry, Ebenezer Freeman the lawyer and Sam Cowett the American Indian who is the Berry's nearest neighbor. The relationships between them are realistic and complex. But Lyddie Berry is the character I most identified with. She is strong and determined and risks the life she knows in order to find a life she can live.In the Historical Note at the end of the book the author includes a list of facts on the laws, customs and way of life in Massachusetts and Cape Cod in 1761, which I found very interesting. It made me realize how bold and brave the character Lyddie Berry really was given the context of her existence.Sally Gunning has written a trilogy of books around this period and location. 'The Widow's War' is the first, 'Bound' is the second and 'The Rebellion of Jane Clarke' is the third. I have just started reading 'Bound' and was happy to discover Lyddie Berry and Eben Freeman between the covers.I recommend this to those of you who enjoy historical fiction especially if you enjoy the setting of colonial America."},{"Title":"The Widow's War: A Novel","review":"Oh how I loved this book! It could also be a really good movie if someone did a good job on a screen play.The beginning was a little too slow for me, so much so that I nearly gave up on it but I persevered and I'm so glad I did. I fell in love with Lyddie and really didn't want the book to end. Sally's writing was magical and I found the story, characters and plot interesting, engaging and fun. If I had one complaint it would be that the beginning was like watching a kettle boil. You just wanted it to get going! Lyddie also wasn't as open or thoughtful until the middle of the book.

I can't wait for her next book which I have pre-ordered.... Can't wait !!!!"},{"Title":"The Widow's War: A Novel","review":"Great read - compelling, page-turning historical fiction with a romantic triangle twist, yet so very LITerary too.I found this book because the jacket copy in another more recent book, John Smolens' THE SCHOOLMASTER'S DAUGHTER, compared that book to Gunning's. I'm so glad I followed through on that comparison. I tore through this story, although I wanted to savor it. It was that good, so good you hate to put it down because you can't wait to see what happens next. It's a 1760s tale from colonial Massachusetts, set in a tiny fishing village on Cape Cod. Lydia Berry is widowed by a fishing accident in which her husband of 20 years is drowned. Only then does she begin to realize her vassal-like state, as attempts are made to have her sign away all rights to the home her husband had built and where she had given birth to her daughter and her stillborn and short-lived sons. Henceforth she is to be called Widow Berry and is expected to live in a spare room of her daughter's house under the sufferance of her onerous son-in-law, who naturally expects to take over everything that once belonged to Lyddie. She rebels, and refuses to sign the necessary papers that would leave her homeless and beggarly. A local lawyer takes an interest in Lyddie, and in more than a legal manner. So too does her nearest neighbor, known mostly as \\"the Indian,\\". He gives her employment, first nursing his sick wife, then (after the wife dies) as a domestic, but this begins to develop into something deeper, although a lifetime of racial predjudice against blacks and \\"Indians\\" doesn't just melt away for Lydia. Eyebrows are raised and tongues wag in the community at this reversal of roles and the delicious possiblity of miscegenation.Lyddie Berry brought to mind another fictional Lydia, the heroine of Molly Gloss's fine novel, THE JUMP-OFF CREEK, set in frontier Oregon in the 1800s. Both are extremely strong and independent characters, despite the separation of an entire continent and more than a hundred years. All of the principals of THE WIDOW'S WAR are many-dimensional and intriguingly human, but Sally Gunning's heroine Lyddie Berry is a character you won't soon forget. If you want a good read that will immediately catch you up, I can't recommend this book highly enough. Go for it!- Tim Bazzett, author of the memoir, BOOKLOVER"},{"Title":"The Widow's War: A Novel","review":"Set in Pre-Revolutionary War New England, this book tells the story of Lydia Barry, whose husband is a whaler and meets his end at sea. At the time, the law gives all of her property to her Son-in-Law, who she must live with. Of course, he is a huge jerk, but being married to her only living daughter, she has little choice but to live with them. What follows is her journey to find herself, I suppose. She bucks the legal system, moves back into her old house, is disowned by her daughter and son-in-law, and has a few other adventures I won't spoil by mentioning.I gave this book three stars for the research that obviously went into writing this novel. You get a real sense of the way people lived in Massachusetts Bay Colony and my hat is off to Sally Gunning for her work. However, the story was all over the place. She couldn't decide what she wanted Lydia to do, and the random sex scenes (not too detailed) seemed really out of place. The book had good ideas and really good research, but it left me feeling a little confused because the story never really came together for me. If you like historical detail, this is the book for you. I wonder if Ms. Gunning's next effort should perhaps be non-fiction since she obviously has a great interest in the time period and the New England area."},{"Title":"The Widow's War: A Novel","review":"Gripping and convincing, with living, breathing characters and some of the best dialogue I have ever read. A wonderful book group choice because there is so much to discuss."},{"Title":"The Widow's War: A Novel","review":"This book was recommended to me by another Amazon customer who had been reading my reviews. She was right to think I would enjoy it, and I owe her my thanks for introducing me to Sally Gunning and her historical fiction.The book is beautifully written, and brings the reader onto Cape Cod and into the year 1761 with a clarity indicative of an author who is intimately familiar with the time and place. The widow, Lyddie, lived in a time in America when women had no significant legal rights. They couldn't own property, couldn't vote and lived their lives at the complete discretion of their husbands or nearest male relative. When Lyddie loses her beloved husband at the beginning the book, her fate lies entirely in the hands of her odious son-in-law. With no finesse, he bullies and carps at her to be obedient and do as he says regarding her home and possessions. Lyddie, only thirty-nine, does not wish to spend the rest of her days kowtowing to him and living, uncomfortable and unwelcome, under his roof. She refuses his demands to sign the legal papers allowing him to sell her home. Although now owned by him, she, by law, is entitled to occupy one third of it. She moves back to her cottage as he cuts off all support, removes her furniture, tries to starve her out, moves his drunken brother into the other two thirds of the house and undermines her capacity to sustain and support herself in every way possible. Just wanting to be left alone, rumors fly as she befriends a neighbor, tries to find work, avoids her unsympathetic church and raises their wrath by working on the Sabbath. Being an independent woman puts her at odds with everyone, and she is even unable to sell her wonderful cheeses because merchants fear retaliation from her wealthy son-in-law and other important citizens who have made her an outcast of sorts.The details in the book are wonderful pictures into life on the Cape in the eighteenth century. Lyddie's story is a page-turner, captivating and mesmerizing from start to finish. I can't wait to read, Bound, my next Sally Gunning purchase."},{"Title":"The Widow's War: A Novel","review":"In \\"The Widow's War,\\" Lyddie Berry finds herself a widow when her husband of twenty years drowns while whaling. The story takes place in the early eighteenth century in a small village in Massachusetts on Cape Cod. Laws at that time gave a widow one-third use of her late husband's real property, or proceeds from the sale thereof; the title of the property is transferred to the male heir: in this case, her overbearing son-in-law, Nathan.When Lyddie refuses to sign over her house, she is banished from her daughter and son-in-law's home. With few resources at her disposal, she's forced to seek housekeeping work for her neighbor, an American Indian and his deathly ill wife. One thing leads to another; before long the gossip mill has poisoned her reputation: she's banished from her church, merchants won't buy her cheese, and no one will hire her.Lyddie's journey is a complicated one, and Sally Gunning tells Lyddie's story with emotional and nuanced clarity. A great read!Constance Richardson, Author, \\"Swimming Upstream: A Memoir.\\""},{"Title":"The Widow's War: A Novel","review":"Lyddie Berry is a 39-year-old woman living in Satucket (now Brewster) on Cape Cod in 1761. When her husband dies in an accident, she's expected to hand over control of her life to her recently-acquired son-in-law, as her closest male relative.... but when she realizes she's not ready to sign over her right to her house, conflict ensues. Lyddie finds that nonconformity suits her, but without family support, suddenly has to make her own way in a difficult world.The best thing about this book is that it deals with the oppression of women head-on. So many historical novels dealing with gender inequality feature a protagonist who's mistreated by some of the men in her life, only to \\"solve\\" the problem with a man who loves her and chooses to treat her as an equal. I sympathize with those authors' desire to produce a happy ending, but such a solution obscures the problem, which wasn't caused just by individual sexist men but by a system that denied women fundamental rights. Lyddie sums it up nicely as she wonders whether a potential husband would use her property against her: she finally comes to \\"the heart of the trouble: whether he would or no, he could. He could, by law, do whatever he chose with the house once she signed the paper, as he could do with her the minute he married her.\\"From that quote, it's clear that this isn't a conventional book; rather than marrying Lyddie off and sweeping the systemic problems under the rug of her husband's egalitarian beliefs, Gunning gives us an honest depiction of a woman's struggle to make her own way within the limitations of the time period. Now that's something I can respect.But one need not be an ardent feminist to enjoy this book: the plot is engaging on its own merits, and Lyddie's determination makes her an easy character to root for. The writing style, while unadorned, is quite competent, and the dialogue manages to move quickly without feeling too modern. The historical detail is evidently well-researched (although if you really want a strong sense of place and immersive detail, Caleb's Crossing by Brooks is a better choice). The descriptions of all the work that went into sustaining pre-modern life are appropriately exhausting. And one thing Gunning does especially well is avoiding black-and-white characterizations: the sexist son-in-law, while infuriating, is not without good qualities, while Lyddie's past and present love interests--and Lyddie herself--all have their flaws.My main beef with this book is that we learn remarkably little about Lyddie beyond her actions and thoughts in the immediate storyline. What was her childhood like? How did it happen that her only blood relative is her daughter? What ever happened to that brother who's mentioned in passing? She's lived in Satucket all her life, so why doesn't she have any friends there? Why isn't she friendly with any of her neighbors? Lyddie is an extraordinarily solitary person, almost misanthropic, whose only real relationship at the beginning of the book seems to be with her husband: has she been this way all her life, or was it caused, as her estrangement from her daughter was apparently caused, by her losing four young children? None of these questions are answered, which is frustrating.Ultimately, The Widow's War is a good book, standing out primarily due to its uncompromising look at gender issues in colonial America. It's worth a few hours of your time, and if you like it, the sequels are decent as well (Lyddie comes back as a secondary character, so if you don't like the ending here, there is more! The themes are less overt in the sequels though). I recommend it."},{"Title":"The Widow's War: A Novel","review":"Okay, I'll try not to gush, because this is not a gushy kind of book.

Very visual, simple, and eloquent.I couldn't help identifying with the widow since I once lived alone, and even fought the \\"system\\" a time or two myself.

As is typical in this time period, when her husband drowns in a boating accident, Lyddie is entitled to use of one third of her husband's estate, with the remaining going to the nearest male heir, which for Lyddie is her less than stellar son-in-law. Gunning creates a strong believable character in Lyddie and one I found myself rooting for. I think what I found so appealing about this woman and what made her so human, was that she tried to do what society expected of her, but in the end followed her heart, challenging the strict code of mores and fundamental views of the time. I truly appreciate the contribution that women like Lyddie have made to the freedoms today's women enjoy and never tire of reading of their personal journeys.

The ideas that helped to shape the historical Otis and his enlightenment-inspired followers, are seemingly far from the reality that fictional Lyddie Berry faces in Sally Gunning's novel \\"Widow's War\\". Lyddie in the opening pages of the book goes from the wife of Edward Berry to his widow her care and custody given over to her son-in-law. Lyddie chafes at these constraints and soon determines to make her own way in the world. The book recounts a revolution of her own that presages the one to come all of America in a few years.\\"Widow's War\\" is a solid piece of historical fiction that can be enjoyed by a diverse audience. It is written in an accessible style and seamlessly works in enough historical fact and period explanation to allow users to not feel out of place in 1761. The book's context, set in the last years of America's colonial period as pressures to expand the rights of colonists begin develop is perfect for its plot of a woman placing herself outside of the traditional family structure she has always known.I never felt like I was being lectured to while reading this nor did I feel it was an adult version of a teen age \\"problem\\" novel designed to teach me about history while making it fun.

Women were, of course, second class citizens, and one can't help but cheer for the one in a thousand who had courage to be something beyond some man's foil. I think all of us appreciate the fact that literature is finally giving us more strong women. Sadly, the times - if history is correct - were too full of those women who humbly accepted their status and those who actually believed in the system. Lyddie is a lady and a good citizen who did her best to adhere to society's demands, but broke out when those chains were too crippling.

I usually end up with loose plots, annoying formatting issues, horrific grammar, characters more one-dimensional than a sheet of paper, and a sense that an alarming number of people lack basic reading and comprehension skills. But this book was a pearl in the oyster. The plot is already adequately described in previous reviews. So I'll just say that the author's skill at bringing alive the tedious daily lives of this era, and her ability to weave an imaginative story in vivid detail, kept me up way past bedtime two nights in a row. My only complaint is that some of her characters may have been too exaggerated - Scheming cheapskate, Nathan, for example, puts Snidely Whiplash to shame.

It was easy to step into her and go through each emotion and hardship, along with the bits of happiness. This story also allows one to catch a glimpse of life in the mid-1700's - especially from a woman's perspective. How thankful it made me to be a woman of today's society, rather than one from that time period, where a woman was more or less viewed as a possession, of sorts, who lived through and for a man, rather than for herself.The Widow's War - so appropriately titled - is a delectable piece of literary dessert, meant to be savored and cherished from page to page.

When Lyddie's whaling husband is lost at sea, she faces total loss of power. With the male heirs, (even through marriage, not necessarily through blood) to be the controllers of the estate, times were not good for women. Faced with her loss of husband, as well as status, and economic freedom, she refuses to live within the constraints of her village. She becomes a nurse and an entrepeneur, making cheeses, selling eggs, and starting the second chapter of her life. She becomes estranged from her only child, who has married the keeper of the family home. Liddie refuses to sign over her third share, and dislikes moving into the dower room of her daughter's home. When she returns to her home, and forges a relationship with her neighbors who happento be Indians, the plot develops. The Indian, Mr. Cowett, who failed to pull her husband from the sea,has a crucial role in her life. The role of the Puritanical church is also integral to the story.I hated to have the book end, and as I read out here on the foggy days and nights of the Cape, I MADE myself only read a few chapters at one sitting.

The law at the time gives her a life interest in the widow's 1/3 dower rights, and leaves her property and support at the mercy of her unsympathetic and greedy son-in-law. Sally Gunning describes the events that lead Lyddie to declaring her independence of her son-in-law, and of the other men who become involved in her life - an Indian who becomes her lover for a time, and a lawyer who wants to marry her. Inspired by what she learned of James Otis, who fought some trade acts in a legal battle that John Adams described as \\"Then and there the child Independence was born.\\", Lyddie learns that she can organize and run her life without having a man as her \\"master\\".Sally Gunning presents well-rounded, very human and believable characters, with all of the faults, frailties, and triumphs of being human. Her setting and the events taking place around that community are very believable.For a feminist (me), this story is a reminder of how far women have come, told in a well-written fashion. All in all, a thoroughly enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Widow's War: A Novel","review":"I knew nothing about this book when I picked it up at my library. It was on a table of new offerings, so I took a look. As its milieu was Cape Cod, where I have spent many a summer, and it dealt with mid-eighteenth century living there, I took it home. I'm very glad that I did. Almost immediately I was deeply involved with the story of Lyddie Berry, recently widowed wife of Edward, a whale-hunter, and housewife in Satucket Village (modern-day Harwich), Massachusetts in 1761.The story opens with her husband called to get to his boat for there are whales in the Massachusetts Bay. The weather is strong and his boat capsizes. He is lost. Lyddie's one surviving child had married a twice-widowered man whom Lyddie does not particularly like. Nathan Clarke is an officious, self-important man who expects his will to be done, no questions asked. When Lyddie, as Edward's \\"relict.\\" is left dependent on Nathan under her husband's will, she chafes and, ultimately, rebels.The author clearly has done exhaustive research because the reader gets such a full understanding of Satucket Village, its social strictures and the hardship of living in those days. But this is more than a history lesson -- it is a terrific story. The writing is crisp and beautifully descriptive. One feels as though one has suffered through the long, cold, damp winter on the Cape with Lyddie. As a widow, she has no authority to live on her own, but as a capable, intelligent woman, she cannot abide being dependent on others. After all, she ran her household for months at a time when Edward was away on his whaling trips. She was her own manager then. What really changed? And now she must sit as a dowager in a back room of her daughter's home and become an old woman at the age of 39? Intolerable!The average woman of this time and place made virtually everything she needed from candles, to cheese, to linen, to beer. Lyddie was an expert at survival. Her only \\"misfortune\\" was to have had a strong spirit and a quick mind - not qualities appreciated in women of her day. But her story will be appreciated by all who take the time to read it."},{"Title":"The Widow's War: A Novel","review":"When Lyddie Berrie's husband is drowned while hunting for whale in the ocean off Cape Cod, she falls under the \\"protection\\" of the law -- which in New England on the cusp of the American Revolution is not such a good thing.This \\"protection\\" entails losing all her assets, savings and personal possessions to her nearest male relative (in this case, a boorish son in law), and allowing her either the use of only 1/3 of the home she shared with her husband or the option of taking up residence in whatever space her son in law will permit her in his own home, should he choose to rent out her former house or sell it. If she lives with the son, according to law, she is required to be as little bother to the family as possible, not ask to eat with the family (despite all of her income and assets now being in their possession), bake her bread separately at the hearth and only on day's when the family does not plan to bake, and become a useless relict at the ripe old age of 39!Lyddie rebels; she finds a lawyer and loophole in the law that requires her son in law to provide for her if she decides to set up a separate establishment. Lyddie's fight to remain vital, her struggle to continue as a person whose life matters, is what the book is all about. But it's also about daily life. The way it looked, the way it sounded, even the way it smelled. Lyddie's story is fascinating. The book never falters. The characters are vibrant, their interactions real and understandable.What this book is, aside from a great read, is a window onto Lyddie's world, and a mirror of the first faint stirrings of independency among the colonies: a fascinating look at life in New England in the 18th Century. From their clothing and how it was worn, to class interactions, sexual mores, social structure, even the meals that were eaten and how they were prepared -- every element of real life is seamlessly interwoven. I read the book in two sittings. During the second one, I armed myself with a tankard of ale (okay, a glass of Miller Lite, but it helped with the mood). Read the book and you'll understand why. In fact, you might want to add a hunk of bread and a bit of cheese. You will be travelling back in time, and should take the appropriate provisions."},{"Title":"The Widow's War: A Novel","review":"I enjoy historical fiction very much and this ranks with the best of them. Lyddie could be any woman, any era. She is strong, frank and forthright about her concerns and decisions. The issue of racial prejudice was handled with wonderful candor and honesty. The conclusion of the story made sense, without giving us a fairy tale ending. This would be a great discussion book."},{"Title":"The Widow's War: A Novel","review":"An excellent novel, based on historical facts of pre-revolution America.This novel revolves about the lack of rights afforded to women of this period under English Law. When widowed, a woman was allowed the value of one-third of the estate of her husband. The other two-thirds went to the closest male relative, who became responsible for the widow.In this story, the widow's home, livestock and property came under the control of a selfish son-in-law. As the story unfolds, with the help of a caring lawyer, she tries to devise a method to live in her own home rather than having to live with an unkind son-in-law."},{"Title":"The Widow's War: A Novel","review":"I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THE AUTHOR MISS GUNNING, AS I WASN'T TOO FAMILIAR WITH HER WRITING EXCEPT FOR A FEW OF HERLITTLE MYSTERIES .

(Photography)","review":"I'm just bowled over by the coverage in this book, it gives the complete range of contemporary photography from toe-curlingly throwaway fashion shots to grimy and harrowingly intimate documentary and breathtaking concept snaps.Easy-reading commentaries from the Curators are useful (but to be taken or left according to taste), and most dangerous of all are the select bibliographies and reference materials for each artist. 100 new book purchases become very tempting.

I practically had the book memorized. Sam Savitt's horse drawings singlehandedly put me on the road to becoming a horse artist myself, because of his ability to transmit the beauty and emotion of the horse through his drawings. The story is almost secondary because the illustrations are so perfect. When I bought this book and read it again after many years, I laughed because I practically knew the dialog before I read it! The pictures and text bring a great story to life.

He is able to state simply the interactions between a wide variety of animals, Ourselves included."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Ring;: New Light on Animal Ways","review":"Konrad Lorenz, a naturalist and author of King Solomon's Ring, explains different aspects of animal behavior and how their behavior is sometimes similar to that of humans in his book. He observes many different species of animals during his studies and he tries to explain what they are doing. Observing the body language and the noises the animals make are the main points discussed in his book. Also, he tries to explain that the balance of the ecosystem is crucial to the survival of the animals and plant life that is found there.Have you ever owned a fish? They normally are considered the easiest pet to own. However, Lorenz describes some of his experiences with fish tanks, and how to make one very interesting. He explains that having real, living plants growing in the tank helps with keeping oxygen in the tank for the animals that are going to be living in it. He gives advice to anyone planning on owning a fish tank. He also explains that having too many animals in the aquarium can be disastrous. Even the littlest change in the number of animals can be bad. Lorenz illustrates for his readers the balance of life that can be changed when a \\"robber\\" is present. The larva of the water-beetle Dytiscus is the predator that is described in the book. This creature devours whatever is in it's path when it is hungry. The development of an ecosystem is dependent on the balance of between the good and the bad in the environment; therefore, the balance is crucial to the survival of many organisms.Lorenz has had his share of dogs, and he explains the behavior similarities and differences between the Aureus breed and the Lupus breed. They have incredible loyalty and intelligence, and Lorenz tells his readers much about the way they exhibit that intelligence. Behavior of other animals, especially birds and water-shrews, are also explained in this book. Lorenz caught and observed the behavior of small, baby water-shrews when they are learning to explore. They are creatures of habit, as explained by Lorenz. They developed a certain way of doing things, and if they did it once, that is the way they will always do it if nothing has changed. Birds, on the other hand, are fascinating creatures that Lorenz spends a great deal of time with. He trained some of them to come at his call. He explains the mating habits of jackdaws, and their peculiar ways of choosing mates. These animals and their behaviors are what Lorenz explains in depth about in this book.When an animal and a human are put into similar situations, they will react similarly, and this is a concept that Lorenz explains in his book. When two animals are fighting, and one is losing to it's superior, they will surrender. They do this by showing their superior their most vulnerable area, normally the head or neck region. Humans, in a similar aspect, do the same thing. When they are losing a battle or fight, they will surrender by putting down their weapons and allowing their superior to kill them. Also, humans and animals guard their young fiercely. If a stranger is approaching their offspring, both a human and an animal will react in anger and try to get the stranger away from their baby. Lorenz describes the similarities of animals to humans in detail in this book.In my opinion, this book was very interesting and it taught me a lot. The reasons why an animal acts was a very interesting topic to read about. So many people don't think that an animal has reasons for his or her behaviors; they think they are just instincts. Some behaviors, of course, are just instincts; however, humans have behaviors that are instincts as well. Humans also have behaviors that have purpose, and so do animals. Whether it is for a mate or for a higher ranking position, animals choose to behave in a certain way. Lorenz's book clearly states important information about animals to anyone who wants to take the time to learn about them. This book helped me understand the differences and similarities of humans to animals. The development and behaviors are similar in situations and it really opened my eyes to animals and their behaviors."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Ring;: New Light on Animal Ways","review":"Konrad Lorenz was one of THE three European founders of ethology (the study of the natural behavior of animals in their environments). Nikolas Tinbergen, Von Frisch, and Lorenz were co-awarded the Nobel Prize in 1973 for their preceding bodies of work which created this new scientific discipline.This was extremely significant to the course of American psychology which, until that time, had grown increasingly dominated by learning theory and the laboratory method. American psychology, influenced by the achievements of physics and medicine,etc., preferred studying behavior under controlled, laboratory conditions as the means for getting nearer \\"ultimate truth\\", which, at that time, was thought to almost always involve learning at its core--in accord with the principles and theories of famous American learning theorists such as Thorndike, Watson, Skinner, Hull, et al. Comparative psychology was the American branch that studied similarities and differences between animal species but controlled problems in a laboratory setting were greatly preferred. Observations of behavior, while valuable for designing later lab experiments, were considered less rigorous.So the truths Lorenz, Tinbergen, Von Frisch and their other European naturalist colleagues reported was as significant as the child's observation of the Emperor's new clothes. The truth of a significant lack was revealed. The laboratory method could not examine or reveal all important aspects of animal behavior; the lab method obscured or eliminated those behaviors occurring in natural settings.Lorenz and Tinbergen discovered, explored, and brought imprinting to the attention of the scientific behavioral world. Imprinting is the lasting (often irreversible) effects of early experience (occuring within a critical period of development) on the later behavior of animals. This contrasted with the view of normal learning theories which found the strength of a response was mainly a function of the number of practice trials. (Von Frisch's work was in understanding the \\"language\\" of bees.)Lorenz's \\"King Solomon's Ring\\" was a significant contribution that enabled lay people to understand the importance of such observations and prepared (sometimes excited) beginning students in the behavioral sciences to take psychology in new directions. Within a few years, learning theory no longer formed the spinal column and much of the skeletal structure of American psychology.I was a psychology graduate student during these years and the laboratory instructor for my university's professor of comparative psychology. It was an exciting time, seeing the old \\"truths\\" and axioms become overthrown and helping to search for new ones.The \\"Ring\\" is still a delightful and interesting read and inclines the reader to look with different eyes at the behavior of our animal friends. Possibly because I've kept current on research on dogs, I think it's weakest chapter is \\"The Covenant\\", Ch. 10, which is on dogs. Here Lorenz decides that most domestic dogs descended from the jackal while a few also descended from the wolf. Having advanced that thesis, he then describes in detail the dichotomy of personality and behavior to which these two antecedents lead and which can be commonly found in all their descendents.WRONG!For the last 40 years, we've become increasingly certain that almost all domestic dogs descended from wolves. Lorenz speculates an incorrect premise and then proceeds to elaborate (with charm and erroneous fact and observations skewed by his belief) on this in great detail. It's interesting and illuminating to see how wrong Lorenz can be in some areas and yet was so right (or right enough) in others.So read the \\"Ring\\" to understand its and its author's deserved place in the history of behavioral sciences. Read it to increase your observational powers of your animal friends. But please do not read it as divine, ordained truth. Many thousands of scientists have since built on the foundations that Lorenz, Tinbergen, & Von Frisch built along with the contributions of Watson, Pavlov, Skinner, Hull, and others. (Serpell's \\"The Domestic Dog\\" provides a good source on more recent information about dogs. You can click on \\"read my other reviews\\" to get my evaluation of Serpell's book.)"},{"Title":"King Solomon's Ring;: New Light on Animal Ways","review":"This is a wonderful book with fun, easy to read, and informative information. The illustrations are cute and add an artsy touch to this book. Lorenz's brilliant discoveries have helped myself and other people better understand animal behavior. I have several animals at home and reading this book has helped me realize how unique each animal's behavior is. To listen to our three birds communicate through squaks, whistles, and squeaks is a truly enchanting experience. This book is awesome and I highly recommend it to all people, especially to those who are interested in animal behavior."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Ring;: New Light on Animal Ways","review":"I was introduced to this book through a college proffesor. I fell in love with the way Konrad Lorenz viewed the world. It is a very funny book about animal behavior. A must for every library."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Ring;: New Light on Animal Ways","review":"The last two pages of the book explain why the human species does not have time to evolve a method of conflict resolution. The wolf survives mortal combat by &quot;turning the other cheek&quot;, a behavior developed over many, many years. Humans enter combat with weapons that are not a part of their anatomy so the evolution of one on one response is not available. A learned method of conflict resolution is necessary."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Ring;: New Light on Animal Ways","review":"This book is an established classic. It's beloved by animal lovers the world over. Many of the observations therein are fascinating.And some of them are just plain hooey.Love it or hate it, you have to at least appreciate an author to dedicates himself so enthusiastically to anthropomorphizing animals to within a micrometer of their species' limits. The degree to which Lorenz interprets the intentions of his animals is positively breathtaking.It's an enormously fun read, but for your own sanity, take his conclusions with a small dose of caution."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Ring;: New Light on Animal Ways","review":"Perhaps because this book was so influential, a lot of what he says are now common sense. It's a good read and very amusing. Makes you want to bring in a bunch of animals to live with you so you can observe their behavior."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Ring;: New Light on Animal Ways","review":"&quot;It has been theorized that cats which present dead mice to their owners, and which play with live mice in front of their owners, are not seeking approval. Rather, they are attempting to teach their oversized, deformed, clumsy, learning-impaired two-legged kittens how to make a living. They are responsible for your welfare, after all.&quot; This is just one of the many theories found in Konrad Lorenz's &quot;King Solomon's Ring.&quot; In his book, Lorenz shows how some kinds of behavior are governed by the same process of natural selection as governs physical development. Animal behavior is absolutely fascinating. If you've never read Konrad Lorenz's &quot;King Solomon's Ring&quot;, buy a paper copy. It may very well change your view of animals for the rest of your life. More and more you will appreciate the complex things that go on as you watch animals. This book is easy-reading and is filled with humor. I recommend it to all ages of animal lovers."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Ring;: New Light on Animal Ways","review":"Confession - I'd never heard of Konrad Lorenz (even though he won the Nobel Prize in 1973), and I don't usually read books by Naturalists.I was driving between business meetings during the day, when I happened to tune in to BBC Radio 4 (same as National Public Radio in the USA), and by accident caught a book reading of Chapter 10 regarding Dogs. Then on another day I caught Chapter 11 on Birds. Captivated, I actually pulled over so that I could hear the whole chapter & find out what the book was and who the Author was.Then I ordered the book as a treat to myself for Christmas.Fantastic! With some abridging 'on the fly', this book could even be read to/by a younger audience say down to 8 years old, who would enjoy, laugh & cry at some of the stories contained herein.I wish my science teacher had read this to me when I was 8, rather than do some silly experiments with boring pond life (Chapter 2 would have taught me more about Pond Life)!"},{"Title":"King Solomon's Ring;: New Light on Animal Ways","review":"In readable, friendly style, Konrad Lorenz uses illustrations from his everyday life among animals of all kinds to illustrate a variety of fascinating points. The balance between anecdotes and theory is well handled and the book stands out both as education and as entertainment. I find the sections dealing with keeping animals in captivity especially worthwhile - Lorenz explains clearly and concisely why most people feel sorry for captive animals for all the wrong reasons, this section should be required reading for most people who think that they are promoting 'animal rights'. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Ring;: New Light on Animal Ways","review":"This is a gem of a book. Written by the father of ethology, the study of animal behavior in nature, it provides a surprising amount of fascinating information in such a small book. He covers a variety of animals, both domestic and wild, and a number of issues, such as breeding behavior and aggression. I read this book twice, the first time I whipped through it. Only after I read it more deeply the second time did I realize just how much is covered. It's a short book, with nice drawings and cute stories. So everyone should read this book. Even if you don't think animal behavior interests you, you might be surprised and this is the book that will get you hooked on the subject."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Ring;: New Light on Animal Ways","review":"I first read this book in college and thought it was okay, easy to read, friendly style, not too scientfic. But as the years have passed it is one of those readings that has stayed with me and been useful in my everyday life. I've even had a copy sent to my son who loves his fish tanks. I've grown up around animals, but since reading this book I see the actions of animals as so closely related to ourselves. To know that birds mate for life, makes listening to birds call each other so much more romantic. To know that even fish have mating rituals makes my own rituals that much better and acceptable. This book has given me that perspective for some 15 years, I can say it has definitely changed the way I have viewed the world, thus the way I have lived in the world- and for the better."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Ring;: New Light on Animal Ways","review":"This book is true to Lorenz' style - humorous, intelligent, large hearted and adventurous. Besides being entertained, I came away with humility borne of the knowledge that human beings aren't truly supreme. Even the littlest fish exhibits interesting thought processes and overriding maternal extincts. One just has to look hard enough!"},{"Title":"King Solomon's Ring;: New Light on Animal Ways","review":"I read this book while in high school and it prompted me to explore zoology. I recieved a BS in Zoology in 1969 and haven't looked back since. I suggest any parent to give this book to their child/children....it is mesmerizing. I now have geese to share with my grandchild and she dearly loves them."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Ring;: New Light on Animal Ways","review":"I read Lorenz's book when I was a boy and have never forgotten it, except now that reading it again I see that any number of the animal facts I would spout to people, giving Lorenz as my reference, are severe distortions of his positions. I would tell people, for example, that lambs and sheep are totally different species, and in citing Lorenz I now realize he said nothing of the sort. One of the great things about KING SOLOMON'S RING is how many species it treats. We also had to read an earlier book by Lorenz, in which he discussed only dogs and how to train them. Did you know that Konrad Lorenz was the first scientist to discover that in every pacxk of dogs (even in any pair of two dogs) one dog will be the so-called \\"alpha male,\\" even when they are technically female? Lorenz was a scientist, a trained observer, but he also had a big heart and this spills out into his books.They are each of them veritable fountains of good writing and common sense, though sometimes he goes overboard in his enthusiasm.Some of the animals hje observed in his heyday are acting differently nowadays! I wonder if that is part of natural selection, or if they are being changed due to the ozone layer brteaking up and global warming. Even the patterns of birds' migrations are no longer the same, and they seem to be no longer travelling the immense distances we once thought they did (from Tierra del Fuego to the Maritimes, for example).In other ways, although dated, KSR remains one of Konrad Lorenz's great accomplishments. I remember meeting him around the time the United Nations honored him for his work with animals. He was a humble man with a witty grin, and the flourish of one who should have been an actor in the movies."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Ring;: New Light on Animal Ways","review":"I first read this marvelous little book while taking a Comparative Ethology class in graduate school.

The treatmentof process cost accounting is thorough and highly simplifiedwith many detailed examples to illustrate the computation ofequivalent units. In process cost accounting, it is criticalto understand the physical flow of costs, as well as,interdepartmental transfers and modified cost assumptions.In addition, there is a thorough treatment of managerialcost accounting in the areas of discounted cash flow, internalrate of return, compounding, depreciation and cash flow,net present value, uncertainty, inflation, capital budgeting,payback and the accounting rate of return. Lastly, there isa good treatment of decentralization and transfer pricing.The book is worth the price of admission. Classic problemsfrom this text have been replicated on some form or anotheron professional and collegiate standardized tests.This work helps to support what is taught in a collegiatefinance course, as well as the cost accounting element.The thrust of a cost accounting course is for the B or betterstudent. There is a fair amount of work in this course.As such, it is geared for accounting, finance or economicsmajors. Quantitatively oriented students will enjoy the presentation as well as a wide constituency of teachersin academe.

Almost everything is derived through formula and there is very little explanations on why the formula is structured in that way.2.

The shcolarship is never pretentious or dull, and the stories are told with a sensitivity that avoids any awkwardness in dealing with subjects like magic. The stories are products of the Celtic culture and are presented in that context.

Giving Robert Silverberg the benefit of the doubt: rewriting the entire history of the world is a difficult thing to do. However, because of that most people wouldn't try it.The book would have been better as a collection of short stories. Each chapter is a story in itself, and then history normally jumps 300 years and all the characters who were in the last chapter are, clearly, dead. Another annoying thing about this method is that each chapter he has one of the characters recap the entire history of the Roman Empire, including all the chapters that you just finished reading.Silverberg is also pretty inconsistent in certain things. First, he tries to Romanize all the place names in the beginning to the point that sometimes you don't know where he's talking about. But then on the next page he mentions the German boarder. Not only that, but when they discover the New World (a.k.a., Nova Roma) they come across Mexico and Peru. Also, later in the book he talks about how \\"Londin and Parisi\\" were major cities. I'm not that up on Roman history, but were those really the names of those cities during the Roman Empire?There's also a bunch of historical inconsistencies. He wants to rewrite history as if the Roman Empire never fell, but yet there is still a \\"medieval\\" period (complete with knighthood) and a Renaissance. The Renaissance doesn't make sense because if there was no real \\"Dark Ages,\\" how can they have a Renaissance? However, if I recall correctly, the whole concept of knighthood was part of the feudal system that arose as a form of organization once the Roman Empire fell. WWI and WWII also happen around the same times, but under the names of the First and Second Wars of Reunificantion. However, he's also somewhat inconsistent about what these wars refer to, having the Second War of Reunification refer first to subduing fights in the outer provinces and in the next chapter having it refer to the founding of the Second Republic. He's also inconsistent in the numbering of Emperors. For example, all of a sudden he has Trajan VII who is from Hispania and yet somehow even though it's special enough to mention that he's from Hispania, his name is still the same as six other Emperors before him, also you cannot seem to figure out when these people ever ruled. Not to mention my annoyance at the fact that the languages in Europe develop in exactly the same way that they did, which I'm not entirely sure would have happened if the Roman Empire hadn't fallen.A big part of my annoyance comes from his treatment of the Hebrews. First of all, Silverberg is clearly of the belief that the Roman Empire fell because of the Christians. So how can he make Christianity not start in the first place? Well, clearly by having the Exodus fail and the Hebrews remain slaves in Egypt. Of course something that I realized toward the end of the book is that he refers to the Hebrews having followed the Law. If they never left Egypt, how did they get this Law? Not only that but I found it offensice that he portrays the Hebrews as being greedy and miserly with their money. He says that the Hebrews have a \\"knack for finance\\" (87) and one of the Hebrew characters in the first chapter is the only one \\"who kept the strings of his purse drawn tight\\" (28) while others are giving money to street entertainers. That stereotype arose in the Middle Ages because the Church restricted Jews to being moneylenders. However, (a) that's after the point in the story that the book starts at and (b) the stereotype would not have have been created if the the Roman Empire hadn't fallen. Yet Silverberg treats that stereotype as truth, and I find that offensive."},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"Yawn..............I used to enjoy Silverberg's books and stories. What has changed? Not very well done. I cannot recommend this."},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"The only reason I ever finished this book is because I used it as a sleep aid when I could not sleep. Forget about tylenol pm....try a little \\"Eterna\\"......"},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"Roma Eterna is an ambitious attempt at alternate history and the base assumption is audacious indeed. What, asks Silverberg, if the Roman Empire had never really collapsed but instead endured and prospered? Silverberg proceeds to answer this question by highlighting a series of 10 historical moments in such an alternative history that could mark key turning points in such an Empire. The vignettes themselves are often absorbing and Silverberg mixes in just enough actual history to make the venture worthwhile. Human nature, one sees, remains the same irrespective of ruler or system of government. The Empire parallels with real history like the bloody purges of Robespierre and the colonial voyages that subjugated (often brutally) the Orient and the New World. For all its ponderous bureaucratic inertia and the sheer logistic barriers, the Empire is pervasive and powerful enough to crush any attempt at true democracy - brief flickers of a \\"Republic\\" which is more an oligarchy or merchant aristocracy are as far as we go. In the end, a band of Hebrews seeks to escape to another plant as the only alternative to Rome's crushing embrace.Bold as this attempt at alternative history is, Silverberg strangely falters thereafter. His examination of the circumstances in each of the 10 events is disappointingly shallow and the ending in particular seems highly contrived. A map of the world using the Roman names for various countries and a parallel timeline linking the Roman dates with the AD calendar would have made things easier for the reader as well. Having read several of Silverberg's masterpieces. I expected better from him. I started reading this book as if sitting down to a delicious meal; by the end, it was as if the food had been but an illusion and my hunger remained unappeased."},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"Three characteristics recommended this book to me: 1) I am a fan of Roman history 2) I love SF short stories 3) Robert Silverberg is one of my favorite authors. With this combination, I figured I couldn't go wrong and bought this book on a whim without looking at Amazon's ratings, which I have come to rely on increasingly. I'll detail why all 3 of these characteristics failed this book and forced me to rate it 1 star, the lowest rating I have ever given a book. Normally, I don't finish books that bad but my mistake was to take too few books with me on my 3 week vacation (which was a Danube river cruise followed by a week in Constantinople/Istanbul since my hobby is visiting all the current countries that made up the Roman Empire at it's greatest extent). Therefore, I didn't have enough books to read and, once I finished everything else, I had to read this book or nothing during my cruise.1) I expected Silverberg to be more knowledgeable about Roman history. Reading this book, my illusion disappeared quickly but as I plowed through this incessant book, I expected that he would delve further into Roman history than tossing off a few place names and the barest outlines of the empire's history. Ostensibly, Silverberg visited a few well-known Roman sites like Tivoli and Capri since he constantly refers to them but the problem with that is he, well, constantly refers to them.2) The SF extrapolations and even simple plot elements are virtually non-existent. These \\"stories\\" are more vignettes with the last few pages wrapping up what plot elements there are.3) Silverberg's writing is well-crafted but his characterization is thin and his plots, as I mentioned above, don't exist.If you like Silverberg, I strongly recommend avoiding this book and buying some of his excellent work such as Nightwings, Dying Inside, At Winter's End, Kingdoms of the Wall, etc. If you like Roman History, read Tacitus, Suetonius, and even Procopius. If you like Alternate History about the Roman Empire, read Harry Turtledove's Krispos Trilogy, Videssos series, or Agent of Byzantium. Turtledove is a professor of Byzantine/Roman history and a master of alternative history. His worst efforts look good next to this mess."},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"I have to admit to a soft spot in my heart for anything by Robert Silverberg, since he's written some of the books that most moved me over the years. From Thorns to Shaderach in the Furnace to Up the Line, he has written an amazing number of classic novels and shorter fare. Despite the fact that he's written many pure SF novels, he also has a fondness and penchant for writing about the ancient world.Here we get a set of short stories (which is not clear from the cover: bad publisher, no biscuit!) which display the unique tone and amazing attention to detail that characterizes much of his work. The quality is a bit uneven, with some of the stories being somewhat unreadable, but the majority of them are quite good and one or two are very good indeed.For example, the first story after the front matter (\\"With Caesar in the Underworld\\") bears the plot of Shakespeare's Henry IV plays, with a lead character of Faustus (\\"Falstaff\\"), set in the wonderfully decadent ancient Rome of this alternate history. There are little sparkly details throughout that make the story bump along, teasing you with both the puzzles that form the alternate history bits and the tidbits of fun (parallels with the lifted Shakespeare plot, for example). It... tickles.Other reviewers have complained that Silverberg doesn't dive as deeply into the history part, that the stories are all little \\"what if...\\" one-trick ponies. But I think those reviewers are missing the fact that in virtually all of these character driven stories, there is at least one other \\"angle\\" that Silverberg is playing with. Once I recognized what he was doing, it was a lot of fun to both read the stories as straight AH yarns and also be watching for the sly games.This isn't the Silverberg of the great early 70's novels. Nor does it quite match his lovely time-travel novel \\"Up the Line\\" (if you've not read that, get it with this). It's just that no one except possibly Gene Wolfe quite matches his style and careful, multi-layered craftsmanship. I enjoyed this collection (despite, as noted, some warts) and, if you like alternate history, you probably will too."},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"Robert Silverberg's \\"Roma Eterna\\" is actually a collection of short stories he wrote between 1989 and 2003 detailing a Roman Empire that never fell. While each story is a stand-alone tale within the alternate history of the world, taken together, they read much like another recent alternate history that details a radically different history of Euroe and Asia: Kim Stanley Robinson's \\"Years of Rice and Salt\\".It becomes apparent very early in the book that Silverberg envisions not merely one but a chain of events as being necessary for Rome to not fall: a failed Jewish Exodus, Christianity never arising, a strong Emperor heading off the Third Century crisis, a definitive destruction of the Northern barbarians and Persia and an assassination of Mohammed before he could spread the word of Allah. In the context of world history we as we know it, the chain is a pretty fragile one, but it does make for an interesting exercise in history - much like the entire book. Some of his ideas have a very real ring of possibility to them: a Rome squandering the military might of a generation on an unsuccessful attempt at invading the Americas, Eastern and Western Empires that eventually fall on each other in a series of Civil Wars, a Rome grown fat and decadent on trade throughout the world that breeds emperors even more insane and bizarre than those known historically. However, for each of these interesting and realistic twists, he allows himself more than a few historical parallels: the World Wars, Leonardo da Vinci, the French Revolution - and his modern Rome (of 1970) bears a great deal of resemblance to a modern Europe under a traditional Roman hegemony.In all, though, I really liked this book, although I suspect it's not for everyone. In fact, I would direct scholars or fans of Roman and Byzantine history towards it before I would the average sci-fi/fantasy/alternate history fan. He knows his Roman history well, and he's not afraid to make obscure use of it. Sometimes this makes for neat touches (like having the Eastern Empire fall to the West in 1453, the year the Eastern Empire in actuality fell to the Ottomans), and sometimes it just makes for a lot of names and dates. The book is basically one great conceit to the 'what if' bundled inside an extensive history. If that's your sort of thing (and it certainly is mine), you'll love it. Otherwise, you may find youself rapidly bored or confused."},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"A collection of short stories that, alas, should probably have stayed short stories. Grouped together like this, the niggling little problems with each one amass into one or two huge glaring headaches.The premise of this book, of course, is that the Roman Empire never fell. Unlike most alternative history, this involves not just one point of departure, but a series of highly improbable occurrences that would allow the Empire - indeed, any empire - to last over 2500 years. If you can swallow that premise, you shouldn't have much trouble with any of the other stories in this book, give or take a few historical howlers.The stories are interesting historical fiction, but not until the end do they become good alternate history. 90% of the book could conceivably have taken place during the actual time of the Roman Empire, and didn't need to be set in the 14th or 19th centuries at all.The stories are told from an interesting perspective, all of them narrated by someone close to the Imperial throne but usually lacking any real power or influence. Unfortunately, there is no continuity in the characters from one chapter to the next. Kim Stanley Robinson achieved this masterfully in \\"The Years of Rice and Salt\\"; given the many comparisons to his book I wish Silverburg could have done the same. With no main character to root for, the chapters remain a set of disjointed short stories - enjoyable in and of themselves, but I wish a bit more work had gone into turning them into a full-length novel."},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"Honestly, I had to try to start this book three times before I was able to \\"get into\\" it. The apparent strangeness of Silverberg's Roman moral values and place names made it difficult to comprehend at first, but once I dug down and decided to finish it, I was extremely pleased by its twists and turns.What other reviewers have found bothersome about this book I found to be its greatest strengths. When writing an alternative history, what are the rules? Why shouldn't we have a Renaissance (of sorts), or similar language development? Silverberg (I have always thought) is a SciFi author, so why not include elements of that genre? Not being of the Jewish faith, I cannot speak for the \\"offensiveness\\" of those elements of the story, but I can't help but think that someone would bring it up; like it or not, the histories of Jerusalem and Rome are intertwined, and with a name like Silverberg, how could he not make use of those themes?I loved it. It took some time to get used to this different type of storytelling, but it was worth every penny."},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"If it hadn't been for our home computer acting up, I might not have ever finished reading this book.It's an interesting premise: Silverberg posits a world where the Roman Empire never fell. It just kept on going. And yet the way Silverberg tried to tell this story fell flat in so many ways.First of all, there's the structure. Rather than pick one time period and stick with it, Silverberg keeps jumping through time. The book is essentially a series of unconnected short stories, the only thing in common being the setting. Just when you're starting to care about the characters in the story, that story ends and they're never mentioned again. Or, if they are, it's an off-handed reference that really doesn't go anywhere.Second, there's the repetitious nature of Silverberg's backstory. If he told me one more time that Maximilianus III subdued the barbarians once and for all, I'm pretty sure I would have torn my hair out. He did this time after time after time. And I kept thinking, I know, I know, you told me this ten pages ago!.That's another problem. Lots of telling, not a lot of showing. It made for weak storytelling.But the thing that really bothered me the most was Silverberg's point of historical departure. He posited that the reason why the Roman Empire never fell is because Christianity never existed. Now I've got theological problems with that that I won't go into here simply because those reasons aren't the reason why my suspended disbelief kept trying to unsuspend itself. I know that historians have suggested that Christianity brought about the fall of the Roman Empire. Given that possibility, it's within the realm of reason to believe that a lack of Christianity would mean a longer lasting Empire. The merits of the argument are beyond the scope of this book review and I leave that particular debate to people with more abbreviations behind their names than I.No, there are two major reasons why I didn't like this point of departure. The first has to do with the idea of trajectory. Silverberg removes Christianity from the historical scene by having the Exodus fail. No Exodus, he reasons, no Isreal. No Isreal, no Jews. No Jews, no Christianity.So that might work, but my problem here is that that leaves 1,200 years (at least) where things would be substantially different. No Exodus, no kingdom of Israel, right? Well, that leaves a power vacuum in the ancient world that would have to be filled. Who knows what might have arisen in the land of Canaan. A Philistine Empire? Would Egypt, who was the nominal overlords of the region at the time, maintained their hold, thus allowing them to resist the Assyrians and Babylonians? Who knows?Silverberg's premise of removing the Exodus and only removing Christianity is far-fetched to the point of ridiculousness. It's entirely possible that by undoing the Exodus, the Roman Empire might never have arisen. The butterfly theory and all that.The second reason why this point of departure is so ridiculous to me is because of what Silverberg does in his introduction. He has two Roman historians meet and discuss ancient history and one of them says something along these lines: \\"Well, what if that Moses guy had succeeded? Well, then, a religion may have arisen, based on resurrection, that would have appealed to Roman society and radically changed our society.\\"Um, excuse me? That's an awfully big intellectual leap for someone to make. Too big of one, if you ask me. Sure, Silverberg is trying to explain what's missing, but that could have been made pretty clear in short order rather than with the ham-fisted way he did.According to Silverberg's biography, he's an award-winning author. Quite frankly, based on this book, I can't imagine why and I don't really care to learn. For me, if I want to see some good counterfactual storytelling in this same vein, I'll re-read Harry Turtledove's Agent of Byzantium. Much better and not quite so ludicrous."},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"When I saw this book at the library and read the synopsis on the book jacket, I thought it looked like a really interesting concept. I was expecting a story set roughly in the present in a vast all-encompassing Roman Empire that never fell. I wanted to see the differences of culture an technology and how they would be different in modern life if they had evolved out of such a mighty empire. However, what I got instead were several short stories set in a constantly decaying, but never quite falling, Roman Empire.Despite being a little disappointed that this was a book of short stories, instead of what I had expected, I still thought it might be interesting to see some of the things that I mentioned above, as the Empire evolves. However, while a couple of the stories were pretty good, most were just ok, and a couple (including the last) were terrible. Instead of telling stories about the greatness of the Empire and how it expands throughout the years, and the technology that comes along with it, the stories are more about how the Empire just barely hangs on (or doesn't, temporarily) despite many factors that threaten it. And the technology that I thought would be particulary interesting was barely mentioned at all. There are passing mentions of a printing press and picture postcards, and some talk of building an elevator that is never realized, but no discussion of how technological advancements were made in this alternate version of history. I was also particularly disappointed by the fact that the technology that was mentioned in the stories pretty much corresponded to when those things came about in actual history. But I would have thought, that if the Roman Empire never fell, technology would have progressed at a slightly faster, if not much faster rate, especially considering how advanced the Romans seemed to be in such things. Also without the Dark Ages that followed the Empire's collapse, I would think things would have progressed further in that time. Finally, the most annoying thing about the book was that the last story did not seem to belong at all. It was not a story about the Empire, aside from being set in it, and was completely different from all the others in the book. It was also one of the shortest and probably the worst of the stories in the book.I wouldn't recommend this book, although if you know what to expect going into it, you may enjoy it more then I did."},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"Years ago, Marvel Comics put forth a series of books called \\"What If?\\" These comics speculated on alternate realities caused by a key event in Marvel history occurring in a different manner than actually depicted (such as what if Peter Parker's Uncle Ben had not been killed). Sometimes things would be happier, sometimes much graver. This was my introduction to the concept of alternate histories, which is a healthy subgenre of science fiction. Robert Silverberg's \\"what if\\" scenario deals with Rome: what if the Roman Empire never fell?In Roma Eterna, the key event actually takes place even before the founding of Rome. The Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt never succeeded, therefore Judaism never became more than a minor cult. Christianity would never develop and Islam would hardly ever get off the ground. The full impact on Rome would not be felt, however, until the time of Constantine the Great, after which real history and speculative history diverge.The book is reminiscent of James Michener-style historical novels where there the only real character is the place. We are given episodes over a fourteen hundred year period that show the trials the Empire would face from civil wars to rebellions. The human characters come and go, but Rome remains.If there is a theme in this book, it deals with the inevitability of certain historic events. Even though the exact details are different, there are events that distinctly parallel that of the real world: the discovery of the New World, the French Revolution and the Russian Revolution. Technological development seems rather slow considering there were no \\"Dark Ages\\" to slow down innovation, but then again, there are also indications that the continued existence of the Empire has created intellectual stagnation.There is no real plot in Roma Eterna; the book is more like a biography, albeit one about a nation rather than a person. Silverberg's a veteran writer (he's been writing for half a century or so), and his experienced touch is definitely evident in this book, earning it a high four stars. This will be an enjoyable book for either fans of alternative histories or Roman history."},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"I read this book because the plot idea, an alternative history ofthe world without the fall of Rome, sounded interesting.

Or maybe the diversions from our real history should have been made a little clearer. Either way, there was a lot of wasted potential in this book. The way the story is told is probably the most appropriate but I honestly don't care for it too much. It looks more like a collection of old short stories that have been tied together by connecting or non-connecting pieces. There is no doubt that the scope is epic as advertised on the back cover, but the separate parts don't really come together for me. Again, maybe this a lack of historical background on my side - or maybe I just don't agree with the weighing of the different parts of the story. The discovery of the New World is interesting and then somewhat abandoned. The \\"French\\" revolution is dragging along and I am still waiting for some sort of enlightenment here. I would have wished that the story was told from a smaller perspective with more emphasis on the technical advancements also.

Lately his writing seems to be an exercise in sleepwalking. He can write so well that he doesn't need to put things in such as plot or characterization. He's done this in Alien Years and half a dozen recent books. Roma Eterna has two to three good novellas in them; the rest is blather. In fact, two of the middle stories (published in Asimov's no less) have no real science fictional content and are basically expository: someone is telling the reader of a story someone told _them_. There is little dialogue in this collection; mostly it's just Silverberg adroitly peppering his narrative with details he's gleaned from books about ancient Rome. Time and time again Silverberg seems to crank out passable stories and novels that will get published just because of his name's cachet. (Like Greg Bear, Orson Scott Card and Harry Turtledove, three more lazy writers.)Having said all this, you can't beat the Silverberg of the late Sixties to the late Seventies. Man, he was good back then. He wrote novels that were quirky and new . . . and now he just coasts. In Roma Eterna, he's just coasting, coasting, coasting . . . ."},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"I was disappointed. I have enjoyed all Silverburg's writing..going back muchas anos (I'm a'gettin' old). But, this one is too formulistic. It is fascinating and well written; but the premises are only loosley explained, loosley followed, and with all the possible emporers and their fauning courtiers and henchmen... loosely explained. There's plenty to think about... including some new (to me) twists and viewing of the new world and all its &quot;glory.&quot; But greatness... no, I'm sorry Mr. Silverburg... Majipoor, among others is MUCH better (and don't even mention some of the other REAL grand masters - Like Aurthur Clarke/Heinlein/Asimov from years ago....the past was much better written (and more interesting)!!!!

I've given it 5 stars because the good parts were excellent and made up for the rest. To me, the best stories were the analog of the French Revolution, the story of the last Emperor, and the very last vignette about the Jews and their second Exodus.There's no Christianity, and there's no Islam. I wish Silverberg would have given us his theories on why no religions developed to replace them. He was also vague about how the Western Roman Empire didn't fall in the third or fourth centuries A.D. He just mentioned that there were some emperors who were good generals and fought off the Huns, Visigoths and Germans. I thought at first that this was too simple, that the Roman Empire would have fallen no matter what, but then I thought about men like George Washington and Winston Churchill, who probably changed world history."},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"Several reviews I've read online of Silverberg's latest work compare it to Bruce Sterling's recent _Years of Rice and Salt,_ implying that somehow Silverberg \\"stole\\" Bruce's idea of a grand alternate history progressing from ancient times to our (alternate) present. This is simply silly, since all of these stories except the \\"Prologue\\" were published previously, several in anthologies, though most of them are somewhat changed in this volume to aid the historical and narrative flow. I very much enjoyed Bruce's book, but neither of these guys has to lift ideas from the other, believe me. Anyway. The Point of Departure -- as Alt Hist buffs refer to the crucial dividing line between our \\"real\\" history and what might plausibly have happened -- is the failure of the Hebrews to escape from Eqypt under the leadership of Moses. Which means no chance for Christianity to develop. (I'm sure the fundamentalists out there will accordingly regard this book as blasphemous. . . .) Silverberg takes this to mean that Rome has the opportunity to continue as a world power indefinitely. Not that the Empire doesn't have its ups and downs, though, its good and bad centuries. After Constantine founds Constantinople and divides the Empire between Western and Eastern emperors, the stage is set for a Latin-Greek tug-of-war that will last for two millennia and several of the stories are about various stages in that rivalry. The best of these, I think, is \\"Waiting for the End,\\" in which Rome, having wasted its substance on a disasterous series of attempts to conquer the New World, is simply outflanked by the Byzantines and the final, but quiet, fall of the Urbs Roma is witnessed by a Romanized Greek bureaucrat and his girlfriend. \\"Via Roma,\\" about the bloody establishment of a Second Roman Republic, is also very good, and so is \\"A Hero of the Empire,\\" in which a minor Roman official in Arabia Deserta has to decide what to do about a potentially dangerous rabble-rouser named Mahmoud. But there's a problem with setting stories in the far future of a world in which the Point of Departure occured in its distant past: Much of the enjoyment in reading stories like this is in seeing what happened to figures from our own timeline had circumstances been even a bit different. (E.g., Lincoln survives the assassination attempt, is later impeached, and retires to Chicago.) Once you get a few centuries down the line, though, the divergence is so great that all the characters are pure fiction with no connection to our own world, and you lose much of the \\"alternate history\\" aspect. That's what happens with most of the later stories in this volume. They're generally quite good *as stories* but the \\"what if\\" ingredient becomes pretty thin."},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"Robert Silverberg, with fifty years of writing and hundreds of books behind him, has been in the business too long to write a really bad book, but this collected short story series is the kind of thing that likely didn't take much effort of his to produce. Compared to the average SF alternate history book, the book is well written and enjoyable; but, compared to Silverberg's best work (much of which is shamefully out of print) it's not what one should read to get a true view of what this year's Science Fiction Writers Grandmaster Award winner is capable of."},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"The only thing you need to know you have from the other reviews for the book, except that the scene with Moshe holding the law was in a dream.

I had to order it from the used booksellers here, and it turned out to be an expensive purchase, but when it arrived I was just so very excited to get it. That lasted just about as long as reading the dust jacket blurb.....which was basically the evil Roman empire had kept the Jewish people in bondage for thousands of years and now they were going to finally escape in spacecraft. Oh no. No, no, no......I nearly didn't read the book after that, but, as it turns out, this isn't an evil Roman empire book at all and the blurb was just about as misleading a one as I have ever read in my life.No, this book has it's problems, but it certainly isn't about Romans persecuting Jews for thousands of years as implied by the cover. The problems I had with the book are that it is not a novel but a series of short stories showing an alternate hsitory in which Rome does not fall. The short story approach creates a very choppy narrative and overall I didn't find the alternative history all that plausible or the writing that compelling. The book is OK, and I have enjoyed Silverberg as a writer in the past, but I was left fairly disappointed with this work. Part of the problem I think is that Silverberg never considered this as a novel...it just a series a different ideas he had at different times and created short stories out of. Then they are all strung together to make this tale. I'd love to read an alternative Roman history work where the author sat down and figured out the big picture first and then colored in all the details later. Robert Conroy did a good job of this in his \\"1901\\" which I found fascinating. My overall recommendation: you won't miss anything if you don't read this one."},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"This is not a novel but a series of vignettes about a Roman Empire that never fell. Therefore, we do not have a singular location (except occasionally Rome), no set of major characters and no common theme. Still, some of the individual stories are good, a few are well-written.But the flaws are everywhere. There's the names. Every individual has three or more L-O-N-G names (\\"Germanicus Romulus Laedaerius\\"). I found myself skimming over Consuls, guards, Senators, etc. It was like reading an ancient Roman phone book. And those not so cute historical references. Alternate history is either like Tutledove - the same characters appear despite huge historical changes (dumb) - or an entirely new world is created (DUNE). Silverberg chose the former.Muhammed is consumed with Allah despite his unfamiliarity with Judaism and Christianity from whence Islam emerged. The blurb spoke of Romans cruelly conquering the Mayans yet all I read were failed attempts. And where is the \\"astounding technology\\" advertised? Unless it refers to the horrid last chapter and the rocket ship ludicrously built by a few Jews in Egypt. When it explodes, an onlooker suddenly screams that Moses, the man aboard, was God's son - despite the fact that children of a God is anathema to Jews. Did someone held a gun to the author's head and force him to finish it in 5 minutes?The treatment of Jews was simultaneously expected, trite and awful. Are we to belief that after 2,500 years only 20,000 are around? And how come the Roman government structure remains unchanged for 2,600 years? How does Rome launch an Industrial Revolution with the Protestant Reformation and private capital? Where is China all this time? My Grade - D+"},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"Like other reviewers, I found the ending rather awkward, however the majority of the book contains some of Mr. Silverberg's strongest writing in many years. The characters are varied and unique, and while many of them are duplicitious and scheming, they make for interesting plot twists. The story is well fleshed-out with eloquent descriptions that immersed me deeply in this alternate history.I must mention here in defense of the author, and reviewer complaints of stereotyping of Jews, that the author is himself Jewish. Events are told through the eyes of the characters, and most sophisticated readers will know better than to assume the opinions and perceptions of the characters represent objective \\"truths\\" in that fictional world or actual prejudices on the part of the author in our own. The real Roman empire was in fact beset with prejudices against various groups. Had anyone somehow missed all that, the ending should clear it up.Not Silverberg's best book, but relatively high on the list. The premise is ambitious, and he fulfills it well, with a humanism rare in alternate histories."},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"&quot;Roma Eterna&quot; is a collection of 10 different short stories masquerading as a novel, that raises some tantalizing questions to answer the central, overarching question in this book: What if the Roman Empire never fell, but not only survived, but endured to the present as the foremost empire on the globe? It is not Silverberg's best work of fiction (His finest works include early novels such as &quot;Shadrach in the Furnace&quot; and his critically acclaimed series, &quot;The Majipoor Chronicles&quot; which began with &quot;Lord Valentine's Castle&quot;.), and yet remains a compelling collection of tales which should interest alternative history fans. The best tales include &quot;Waiting for the End&quot;, where a Romanicized Greek bureaucrat awaits the conquest of the Eternal City by Greek Byzantine forces sent from Constantinople, attempting to unify the divided Latin and Greek halves of the empire, &quot;Via Roma&quot;, where a young aristocratic Celtic Briton witnesses in Rome the bloody downfall of the Empire and the rise of the &quot;Second Republic&quot;, and &quot;Tales from the Venia Woods&quot;, where two Teutonic children unknowingly reveal the hiding place of the last of the Caesars, the last Roman emperor. The final tale, &quot;To the Promised Land&quot;, about Hebrews building spaceships to escape Earth and an inevitable collapse of the Second Republic is among the least effective in this collection. And yet, to Robert Silverberg's credit, he has written a future history almost as compelling as Kim Stanley Robinson's &quot;The Years of Rice and Salt&quot;."},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"Robert Silverberg is my favorite author of sci-fi/fantasy/alternate history, and Rome is one of my favorite fictional subjects. I was, therefore, quite disappointed with this sporadically interesting compilation of previously published short stories as a single work.Given its origin, &quot;Roma Eterna&quot; is not so much a novel as a series of sometimes interrelated, more or less grand tableaux of incidents in the history of Roman civilization continuing unbroken to contemporary times.Some episodes are more interesting than others: Waiting for the End and Via Roma, for example, are often suffused with an autumnal glow of nostalgia which is very enticing and convincing. Getting to Know the Dragon, on the other hand, is simply boring, while the final segment, To the Promised Land, is just plain silly.I find two main problems with the book: 1) Silverberg violates a key ingredient in any successful alternate history by following the Point of Departure (the slaughter of the Hebrews by the shores of the Red Sea in mid-Exodus) by usually slavish imitation of real historical events between then and now. In a first-rate alternate history, the Point of Departure leads us to an entirely new world. 2) Since the book was originally short stories, every has the nature of a simple vignette, largely without any character development.And there's a certain sameness about it all, which gets stale after a while.As a history buff, I have other criticisms which may be irrelevant to some readers. For example, Silverberg apparently hasn't researched Rome enough to get proper names correctly -- he consistently mixes up surnames, clan names and personal names, which were logically ordered in Roman Latin and which this author mixes and matches without any order whatsoever. He should correspond with writers who really know Rome -- such as Lindsay Davis or Steven Saylor -- before attempting this sort of thing again. And then there are anachronisms, as in the final episode when the protagonist has a dream of the slaughter of his ancestors by the armies of Pharoah, while Moses holds aloft the tablets of the Law. However, the Law was given to Moses on Mt. Sinai AFTER the crossing of the Red Sea, so how could it exist in Egypt? Call me picky, but that's just sloppy writing and bad editing.So, forget Roma Eterna. If you want to know what Silverboerg can accomplish in the full flood of his enormous talent, read the never-surpassed Majipoor Chronicles."},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"Roma Eterna starts with an interesting concept: The Exodus failed, so there is no Jesus; Without the Christian church, the Roman Empire stands for all time (or at least until the end of the book). The book is chopped up into several short stories, and I found it to be very hard to put down initally. The writing is gripping, even if keeping dates and names straight can be a little tough.However, the book seems to run out of steam for the final 80 pages or so, starting with \\"Via Roma\\". This incredibly boring short story takes four pages worth of material and stretches it into fifty. Reading the book at this point became a chore. The story after Via Roma is better, but it and the final story don't really connect the way the first seven do.I wish I could give this book a 3.5, but since you can't do that, I've rounded it up to a four. Despite the disappointing final stretch, this is a good book. Recommended if you're something of a roman history buff. Those without much knowledge or interest in ancient Rome will probably want to pass."},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"Basically a series of vignettes, not a cohesive story at all, Roma Eterna falls victim to a couple of mistaken assumptions. The first of these is that without Judaeo-Christianity and Islam the Empire would have stood. The empire fell more from its own weight than any \\"outside\\" influences. The second, and, for me, much more glaring one, is Silverberg's assumption of an industrial revolution without any of the pre-conditions necessary for one. As stated by S.M. Stirling in his review of another work, without the Aquinan worldview adopted by post-medieval Christianity, there is no scientific or industrial revolution. The Romans were notoriously incurious about what made the world around them tick and their system of gods and goddesses had no rationality. Without those two elements, you have no reason or basis for the kind of systematic research which led to our world of today and simply cannot have the last third of the book. Still a nice read, but not anywhere close to Silverberg's best"},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"The Exodus failed to take the Jews from Egypt into the Promised Land. Thus Christianity never surfaces as the Jewish people remain enslaved in Egypt. Still Rome rises to defeat the neighboring Barbarians. The rest is history (at least alternative) as key global events fostered by ROMA ETERNA starting in A.U.C. 1203 (A.D. 405 our time) into the next fifteen centuries occur as the Roman Empire ebbs and grows.Robert Silverberg rewrites several of his related short stories into an epic alternative historical novel that engages the reader with intriguing theories of how much different the world would be if one pivotal event (albeit Moses leading the Jews) had a different ending. Though entertaining and easily hooking the audience, the tale still feels more like a short story collection as none of the characters (over the fifteen hundred years) feel fully developed. Still sub-genre readers will relish this fascinating saga of a seemingly eternal Roman Empire as each subsequent chapter builds off of events that chronologically (and literally) preceded it.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"This is a fun book: just suppose the Roman empire had continued for another 1500 years...? The stories are light and are written with the shallow depth of a young writer (which Silverberg is not). The chapters are a series of short stories, many previously published but recast here with dollops of cross-references. Silverberg takes the charming tack of seeing everything from slightly below, from noble Romans near the Emperor but on the outs in obscure places: an historian (for the key displacement event, of course: no intolerant Christians), an adventurer in the Roman Underworld (literally), an exile in Arabia (Mecca in the 7th century...), an underofficer in an army attempting to invade the Yucatan once more, a Greek translator to a cowardly emperor, etc. This device allows Silverberg to \\"sneak up on\\" key historic events and perhaps surprise the reader as well. He turns each chapter into something of a mystery: where is this chapter going? Besides Romans and Greeks, Silverberg is inordinately fond of Hebrews, a peculiar little holier-than-thou sect that pops up here and there.I was disappointed in my expectations. This book is not a more thorough projection of how a Roman empire could have continued and evolved. Silverberg merely adapts as somehow Roman several of the major trends and innovations of actual Western history to our present. The focus is mostly politics and religion, but written without developing significant change in ancient Roman belief and practices. He is forced to reference true ancient Romans as the heroic exemplars for his characters because only historical figures will carry moral weight to the reader&#65533;yet are most likely to have been forgotten by the lowly characters in the stories set a thousand years on. Nothing is too serious&#65533;there's little about what happened to slavery, to provincial government, the evolution of modern languages, or how they dovetail with technological developments. Because the chapters are set a century or two apart, there can be no continuity and development of his characters. Finally, the conclusion is a limp apotheosis. These may be my problems with the book rather than yours."},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"Hmm, well I have been a great admirer of Silverberg's short stories in the past, and there are one or two more than decent ones here. It does not however seem to have occured to the author that the idea of the roman empire persisting for 2000 years, rather than fascinating, could actually be quite dull if not handled very imaginatively. The problem with attemping this sort of thing is that the real history of the period in question is usually a lot more interesting than the alternate.It may be a a minor and idiosyncratic gripe, but abandoning the common english versions of names for the ubiquitous -us latin suffix, eg Hadrianus, Diocletianus etc etc etc, added noticeably to the sometimes pervasive sense of dullness for me at least."},{"Title":"Clifford Brown: The Life and Art of the Legendary Jazz Trumpeter","review":"For those interested in more details of Brown's life and some insight into his character and musical discipline, this is a valuable source.

It covers his entire life, from his birth, through his Blue Flame days, all the way to his historical work with Max Roach. The book also includes 8 or so pages of pictures in the middle, which is great for those of you whom haven't seen brownie, and a nearly complete discography in the back of the book. Simply put, Clifford Brown is one of the best jazz trumpeters of all time (my favorite, personally), and quite possibly the most tragic loss in jazz history. Any jazz musicians, Clifford fans, or general jazz aficionados should check this book out if they are looking to learn about one of the greats."},{"Title":"Clifford Brown: The Life and Art of the Legendary Jazz Trumpeter","review":"Catalano's book about Clifford Brown fails to convey much more than lame summary. The reader receives a readable account of the trumpeter's short life, but the writing itself leaves much to be desired in that it's unpolished, redundant, chatty, and rarely profound. (And it's got typos to boot!) How about this telling detail of Brown's stint in an R&amp;B band? &quot;Clifford Brown and Vance Wilson were quite close and got the kind of education that only comes from being on the road. One time, recalled Wilson, 'We were in Wildwood [New Jersey]. Clifford had never eaten raw clams and neither had I. So we dared each other. We went over to this counter where they were serving them, but we didn't know how to eat them.' They proceeded to put sauce on the clams and started to chew them, failing to notice other eaters who were 'slurping' them. Their exaggerated chewing made everyone laugh&quot; (Catalano 62). Catalano's choice of quotations, in my opinion, is very suspect throughout the entire book. It's as though he's a high-school-essay-writing-novice trying to round out a paper and show that's he read a thing or two or interviewed someone or another, as the case may be. Ok, the book does contain some analysis of Brown's music, and provided that not much else has been written of the trumpeter, I suppose the book merits a cursory glance. But be prepared for some dull, over-accessible, easy-reading."},{"Title":"Clifford Brown: The Life and Art of the Legendary Jazz Trumpeter","review":"Clifford Brown had one of the most beautiful trumpet tones in all of modern jazz, and technique that other players would die for. He was not your \\"typical\\" (as portrayed to the masses) jazz musician - he didn't drink, smoke, or use drugs; he had a family and a good marriage; he worked hard at his craft. The tragedy is that he was killed in a car crash at the age of 25 at the height of his powers. Even by then though, he had recorded a number of albums establishing himself as one of the greats in the business.Catalano's book competently traces Brownie's life, from the beginnings in Wilmington, Delaware, to his days with the Lionel Hampton band, early sideman dates in NYC, gigs in LA and Chicago, and finally the formation of the Brown-Max Roach Quintet with Harold Land and then Sonny Rollins on tenor. Catalano is a musician so is able to analyze Brownie's performances and recordings, which he does well, but the life history of the man is told somewhat blandly. We finish the book with a good skeletal outline of Brown's life and career, but much of the meat seems missing."},{"Title":"Clifford Brown: The Life and Art of the Legendary Jazz Trumpeter","review":"This is a good biography. Nevertheless, musical analyses are very weak and superflous."},{"Title":"Clifford Brown: The Life and Art of the Legendary Jazz Trumpeter","review":"At under 200 pages, this biography is as brief as Clifford Brown's tragically shortened life. Other reviewers have pointed out its faults: the writing is pedestrian and interspersed with minor annoyances (to cite one that grated on me, the author inexplicably and repeatedly refers to the well-known Pacific Jazz label as Pacific COAST Jazz). Worse than this is the work's inability to convey any meaningful insight into Clifford's music. Nonetheless, Catalano did at least one thing extraordinarily well, selecting as his subject one of the most brilliant of all jazz improvisers and, with his death at 25 in 1956, one of the most tragic.The author places Brown's early development in the milieu of the economically poor but culturally vibrant Black community of Wilmington, Delaware and traces his life from his birth into a large family in 1930 through his studies on trumpet and piano, the auto accident that sidelined him for a year in his late teens, his early forays as a working jazz and rhythm and blues musician, and his rapid ascent through the jazz ranks of bands of Lionel Hampton and Art Blakey, and on to the pinnacle of 1950s small group jazz creativity in the quintet he co-led with drummer Max Roach. I believe most readers will learn much that they did not know about Brown, for example, the severe physical problems that continued to dog him even after the long convalescence from the aforementioned car accident.Despite the uninspired story-telling, the power of Clifford's extraordinary life still shines through loud and clear. Even at his young age, Brown was beginning by his example to turn the tide of drinking-and-drugging that bedeviled musicians following in Charlie Parker's footsteps, a project revived a few years later by John Coltrane and others. He was extraordinarily hard-working, humble, beloved by friends and colleagues (nearly all of them, though there was the exception of the associate of Hampton who tried to knife Brown during his overseas tour with the band in the early 1950s), and mature beyond his years. It makes his death, along with jazz pianist Richie Powell and Powell's wife Nancy, in a car accident on the Pennsylvania Turnpike all the more tragic, as here was a man whose personal virtues matched his extraordinary musical achievements.One finishes the book wishing it had been much better, but this is probably as good a retelling of Brown's life as we will get. Most of Brown's family and associates are now dead, Max Roach, Art Blakey, and Brown's widow Larue Brown Watson among them. The last three surviving siblings of Brown, each of whom Catalano interviewed, are now gone: Google searches reveal that Leon R. Brown and Rella O. (Brown) Bray died in 2009 and Geneva Brown Griffin died in 2010. Their long lives add a sad postscript to the story, the possibility that but for that fateful night so long ago, Clifford, the youngest of eight children, might have lived a long, productive, and exemplary life right into the new millenium."},{"Title":"Clifford Brown: The Life and Art of the Legendary Jazz Trumpeter","review":"Clifford Brown really was 'too good to be true'...didn't drink,do drugs...incredible jazz musician.Nick Catalano reallydoes an \\"impossible job\\" in telling the story of the great trumpeter who died tragically way before his time-and Catalano's anaysis of Brown's recordings makes the case that Brown is a man who \\"coulda been king\\"(even though he sorta was anyway).."},{"Title":"Clifford Brown: The Life and Art of the Legendary Jazz Trumpeter","review":"This is a satisfactory look at the tragically short life and career of the great Brownie.

Of course the first thing I wanted to do when I got back to my records was listen to Brownie over and over again. Catalano paints a sensitive portrait in an approachable, occasionally shoddy style. Clifford Brown's music doesn't quite come alive, perhaps, but Catalano expresses the lucidity of the trumpeter's musical vision and astonishing melodic gift with some agility.

(She suggests Bernie named his children after the Kennedy's because John F and the other would be less likely to take them into the Vietnam war. But unfortunately the non Fiction truth is John F took us into Vietnam and Johnson kept us in and ratched it up and it was Nixon who pulled us out. Always amazed when people get that era wrong and more surprises when someone actually tells me that Nixon got us into Vietnam. Watergate yes but that sort of over shadowed the rest of that time. I give fiction writing a wide birth and so this one small little glitch is not enough to reject her books. She also makes up for it in her dislike for almost all politicians both sides of the coin and you can't ever quite tell which side she would land herself...sometimes it's looking more liberal then oh my gosh it's conservative and what she really is attempting and doing very well is keep us all guessing and suggesting they are all worthless and both sides on occasion get it right some of the time...just not enough."},{"Title":"A Cold-Blooded Business (Kate Shugak Mystery)","review":"I have enjoyed every Dana Stabelow mystery I have read so far.

Aleut investigator Kate Shugak goes undercover working on the pipeline for an oil company to find out who's supplying cocaine to its employees. I could have done with a little less detail on the processes involved in oil extraction, but there's a lot to enjoy here. Much of Kate's first day at the base camp is quite funny, and there are enough colorful, eccentric people to satisfy anyone. I enjoyed the interlude in Anchorage with Kate and her wolf-Siberian husky mix, Mutt, one of those dogs you find in mysteries who obviously have more sense than some of the human characters. The identity of one of the drug dealers really surprised me.

Knowing that her very presence at the oil company's home base will offend her formidable grandmother for all time, Kate nevertheless quickly gets used to the work, the comraderie--and most of all, the nonstop food, akin to a cruise ship. Between gorging herself on luscious steaks, homemade fries and all-you-can-eat ice cream sundaes, Kate begins to sense the evil and dangerous drug busines that lurks beneath the surface.With some much-needed &quot;down time&quot; with lover Jack and wonder dog Mutt (half huskie, half wolf) to clear her head, Kate uncovers a plot that threatens to undermine not only the giant oil company, but her very life as well.Fun, fast read...absolutely delightful."},{"Title":"A Cold-Blooded Business (Kate Shugak Mystery)","review":"The oilfields of Alaska's North Slope is the setting for the fourth installment in Dana Stabenow's Kate Shugak series, A COLD-BLOODED BUSINESS. Kate is a native Aleut who is a private investigator and this time she takes on a job that takes her to the oilfields where life is lived under harsh conditions, with employees working in isolated conditions and a hard-partying lifestyle after hours is ignored by management.Kate is asked to go undercover as an employee for Royal Petroleum to find out who is dealing drugs that have caused several overdoses and a death at RPetCo. Jack, the Anchorage DA, has asked Kate to take this job and for good pay, more money than Kate has seen in a long time. She agrees to take the job and goes to the North Slope of Prudhoe Bay as a driver taking dignitaries on PR tours. Kate finds out soon enough that this is not going to be an easy job. While she is there, there is an archeological dig going on and some Native American artifacts are found which Kate is very interested in and she gets caught up in the findings. This becomes a distraction to her as she goes about her investigation to find the drug dealer.This is the slowest of the first four in the series for me. Usually I read Stabenow's Shugak novels in two sittings, if not one, but I thought this one dragged on a bit. I enjoyed it, but not until the end did it really pick up and I was on the edge of my seat and turning pages fast. However, the artifacts were of interest and as always, the setting is a major part of the story, and this one was cold and unforgiving.

As a young woman, a recent graduate of nursing school in Vancouver, BC, Ms. Harold landed a job at a pretty good $90/month, it being 1935 and during the Depression! The only catch: She would be working on a remote island north of Vancouver, teaching and nursing in a First Nation's village. It was lonely, it was cold, transportaton was as likely to kill you as transport you and people her own age were hard to find. However, she remained for two years, made friends and found a new understanding of the independent, interesting people from all over the world who found their way to this remote patch in the Canadian Pacific. In writing her memoir, Ms. Harold did not sugar-coat her youthful reactions to circumstances through the hindsight of the over 50 years which passed between the time of her service and her telling of the tale. Her incredible poise when faced with the conditions she must work and live in is a real testimant to her determination and sense of adventure. (As often happens, or did before letter writing became a threatened art...saved letters to her mother during that time filled in many details she might have forgotten when she came to write the book.)

I contacted the seller, returned it and money was refunded."},{"Title":"The Rector's Wife","review":"Having read just about all of Joanna Trollope's wonderful books, I have come to regard \\"The Rector's Wife\\" as her very best, for so many reasons.For those of us who have ever felt the despair of knowing that love alone cannot save a marriage; for those of us who have been drawn into a loved-one's depression and cannot break free; and for any mother alive who has had a hurting, unpopular child--this book describes feelings that are impossible to put into words.Anna Bouverie (yes, I see the parallel to Madame Bovary, but Anna has more soul) is the wife of a village rector. Her life is rigidly circumscribed by the expectations of her husband's parisioners. Thus, it is important that she head certain \\"rotas\\" (I love that word; British for \\"rotations,\\" meaning committee members who take turns doing church chores). It is imperative that she appear impeccable in her clothing, her behavior, her mothering, and just about everything else. This is not easy, as her stolid, dogmatic husband Peter makes such a paltry living that their children have to wear parishioners' second-hand giveaways. In fact, the Bouveries are living in a kind of static hell, although nobody but poor, miserable schoolgirl Flora seems to realize it, and her perceptions are all about being a misfit in her horrid school.Peter and Anna are sustained by a bright vision of the future: Peter hopes to be named archdeacon, which will change their circumstances considerably. The bitter loss of this hope is the catalyst that eventually destroys Peter--and sets Anna free.As Peter sinks inexorably into a deep, surly depression, Anna's attempts to reach him, to connect as they did when their marriage was young, are angrily rebuffed. On her own, metaphorically at least, Anna, desperate to remove Flora from the hated school and place her in another where she can thrive, takes a practical step. She gets a job stacking shelves in a supermarket, so she can earn enough money to pay for the new school.The outraged gossip from a secretly delighted parish (not only is the rector's wife working; but she is placing their child in a Catholic school! Horrors!) Peter's icy, enraged reaction, and Anna's rebirth as a woman form the crux of the rest of the story. Events simply evolve, unstoppable and unpreventable, even as they race to their (...)conclusion.I love this book. I love the truth of it. I love Trollope's eye for rural British life; I love her characterizations; I love her understated and measured style of writing. If you only read one Joanna Trollope book, make this the one."},{"Title":"The Rector's Wife","review":"The beautiful Anna Bouverie (echoes of Madame Bovary) has lived for twenty years as the wife a poorly paid rural rector and mother to their two children. Her half-hearted approach to tasks at church disappoints the meddlesome, but well-intentioned, ladies of the church committee.When her husband is turned down for a much-needed promotion, Anna takes matters into her own hands. In order to raise money for her daughter's private school tuition and her son's road trip to India, Anna takes on a job at the local supermarket. To the consternation of the church ladies, the outrage of her husband, the embarrassment of her son, and her own personal delight, she keeps the job even after her money woes are lightened by the award of a scholarship to her daughter.The job begins a broadening of Anna's perspective that extends beyond produce and canned goods. As she attracts both the notice and the desire of several men, she turns to one for the affection that is missing from her relationship with her husband.Although it has its share of sadness and tragic turns, overall this is a story of personal growth and self discovery. Trollope's lucid prose and incisive characterizations make the book a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"The Rector's Wife","review":"All I can say is I love this book so much and have read it about five times. More than the story of a rector's wife, it's the story of a sensitive, caring woman trying to keep all the needs of her family together and yet care for them in her own way...in this case taking a job so she can send her daughter to private school. The small act of this job is a terrible affront to the wage earning of her husband and the small English parish. Her children are so real and so is her life. It deeply deeply touches me. There are not many books I read so often, but this is one of them."},{"Title":"The Rector's Wife","review":"I typically avoid contemporary British authors, finding them too provincial, or worse, cutesy for my American palate. I picked up &quot;The Rector's Wife&quot; because the title reminded me of one of my favorite movies, &quot;The Bishop's Wife&quot;, not expecting to find between its modest paper covers, a modern literary classic. I have revisited Anna Bouverie and her world many times since, and I never find a word that rings false. In her creation of a modern English village, and a dying middle-class marriage, Joanna Trollope's aim is absolutely true. In Anna, Trollope creates a character that haunts the reader with her authenticity; she could be anyone's daughter, sister or friend putting a bright outward face on the wreck of a stifling marriage while soldiering bravely on. Although our sympathies lie with Anna, she is not always an easy person to like; her acid tongue and occasional temper tantrums bring a very human dimension to her character, which saves her from being merely a cardboard rendering of the blameless, wronged wife. I'm not sure Trollope would agree, but it seems to me that Anna brings a great deal of unhappiness upon herself by her tardy realization that she made a hasty marriage to a man who was utterly wrong for her. Faced with this knowledge, too late, she chooses a self-serving path. Because the story is mostly from Anna's point of view, her husband Peter comes out much the worse for it; he is seen through Anna's eyes as the instigator of all of her misery, even though he is also victimized in his own way by marriage to Anna, who turns out to be both much more and much less than he bargained for as his wife. Despite Peter's prominent position in the story, he is more one-dimensional than many of the minor characters that populate the village of Loxford. Trollope's final solution to the problem of Anna's unsatisfactory marriage is likewise unsatisfactory--a sort of deus ex machina that absolves Anna of the consequences of her actions. While we hope all along for Anna's happiness, the way it is finally achieved I think mars the book and Anna, too. If Trollope only means to say that every woman has her price, then she succeeds. In the meantime, Anna is a fascinating character study, and all her supporting players are sharply,and in many cases, delightfully drawn. I recommend this book to anyone who labors under the illusion that life in a bucolic English village must be heaven on earth, and more importantly, to anyone who has doubts about the suitability of a potential or current mate. This book could be used, quite effectively, as a manual for marriage counseling, since it is a case study for the importance of open communication and shared goals within a marriage, and the fallout when two partners are not completely honest with one another. Anna's story will remain with you long after you have finished the last page."},{"Title":"The Rector's Wife","review":"I found this book uplifting beyond comment - although Anna's personal turmoil, her claustrophobic environment, and the tragedy of the story don't necessarily support the word &quot;uplifting&quot;, Anna's determination, willingness to grow and escape limitations, and her unspoken desire to know life as Divine was just what my own hungry soul needed to read. Trollope has once again presented a real woman from the very inside out."},{"Title":"The Rector's Wife","review":"This is a wonderfully written British book, with brilliant descriptions of villiage life and deeply developed characterizations. While I liked it very much, there were things that bothered me about it too. First, the British style of writing greatly slowed down the reading process for me. Secondly, there were many times when I just wanted to shake some sense into Anna. While she was taking baby steps towards her independence, she still remained too passive to her domineering and coldly disinterested husband. For example, allowing him to bully her into quitting the grocery job she loved.Anna was too concerned with appearances, and how things looked to the very uncharitable, very un-Christian-like members of her husband's congregation who didn't appreciate the assets of a passionate and giving woman like Anna. If my neighbors volunteered to clean my house, organize my chores, and take over mundane tasks and responsibilites that I hated and resented doing, freeing up time to be more dedicated to my children (Luke in particular seemed so desperately neglected) and to things I truly enjoyed, I would be elated....I certainly wouldn't complain or feel inadequate because I couldn't please all people all the time.I suppose I took this novel more personally than the author intended because I related almost too closely with her feelings of extreme loneliness and not being valued as a woman by her family and peers.I also thought the ending could have been better. I thought the way she escaped from her marriage was too convenient, and the other men who came into her life could have been handled differently.(PS: If you really liked this book, try The Sunday Wife by Cassandra King)"},{"Title":"The Rector's Wife","review":"of a village rector, who breaks out of her drab life, taking a job (horrors) in a supermarket to find a sense of self worth.

LOVE her, though some of her books are stronger than others. This one was good, not great. It was loosely based on Madame Bovary, by Flaubert. There was a shocking event towards the end, which I thought was unnecessary and a bit far fetched, and led to too tidy and ending, but I am not sorry I read the book. It seemed dated to me, not because it was written 20 years ago, but because women really had come far along at that point, but Trollope created a female character who was living as if it were 1950, not 1991. This would be a great book for a reading group as there is so much to discuss about life as the spouse of clergy. The book is not about religion at all. It is about the tight knit world of the church and how the families of the clergy are expected to live, and it's not always pretty. It is also about feeling oppressed and empty and longing to be true to yourself and find good work!"},{"Title":"The Rector's Wife","review":"To her credit, Trollope does give us insight into the isolation and invisibility of the life of a rector's wife in a small town in England. However, most of her characters are not developed, so that there are no grounds for the actions they take. The tidy way she gets Anna out of her troubles in the end could land her a job writing for &quot;The Young and The Restless&quot;."},{"Title":"The Rector's Wife","review":"Joanna Trollope developed the character of Anna beautifully. By the time she took her supermarket job, I was in love with her character. What drove me mad was that, for 200 pages, Ms. Trollope built an atmosphere of sexual tension. When Anna finally found \\"release\\", it was done hurriedly, in all of 2 paragraphs, and was dreadfully disappointing. I had followed this character through life-shattering trials, and was cheated in one clumsily written scene. Other reviewers have already pointed out the dissapointment of the ending, which convienently avoided a showdown between the two main characters over the central conflict of the book. Overall, I loved the character development and descriptions of country life, but hated the handling of love interests and the ending."},{"Title":"The Rector's Wife","review":"I've been in a Joanna Trollope phase lately, having read &quot;Other People's Children&quot; and &quot;Best of Friends&quot; and loving them both. This earlier title did not appeal to me as much, although I enjoyed it more towards the end of the story. The other two titles seemed simpler and yet somehow more complete and less contrived. Perhaps its just the growth of the author's talents.It did seem a bit much that suddenly, after living as the rector's wife for so many years, Anna was both fed up with her life and attracting the attention of multiple men. She barely interacted with Patrick, the rich city man who decides he's mad about her.However, I did enjoy the descriptions of English country life and applauded Anna's meager attempts to break the ties that bound her. The fury over her taking a job at a supermarket is priceless. One of Trollope's strongest suits is the way all of her character's actions affect their entire families. As in life, all decisions have fallout, and Trollope is a master at making that clear. Not her best, but worth a read."},{"Title":"The Rector's Wife","review":"Joanna Trollope, I believe, simply creates the best and most believable characters in all of post-modern fiction. The characters who people \\"The Rector's Wife\\" are no exception: the suffocating Anna, the bitter, self-pitying Peter, the nosy, gossipy, well-meaning (or are they?) ladies of the parish are all drawn so tightly and vividly, with such a fine acknowledgment of both the good and rotten sides of the human character, it's no wonder this book is such a gripping story.I suppose it isn't unusual to find a coming-of-age novel about a woman in her forties, but Trollope's is so different. Anna is one of the most likeable characters I've ever gotten to know in the pages of a book, and her level of burn-out with all the petty intricacies of being the wife of the village rector, plus her desire to be a good mother and even a good wife to her self-absorbed husband, and then even try as she can to be a good Christian and do the right and honorable thing, all while having the sense of completely losing her own identity...well, it all makes for a very good story. Anna's struggles for independence and her small victories and disconcerting losses will make you feel a compassion you might not have ever thought you could feel for someone who is, after all, a character in a book.Joanna Trollope has a stunning talent. Read every single one of her books. Go on, hurry up!"},{"Title":"The Rector's Wife","review":"This is story that keeps you interested -- I was amazed at how well the author captured the story of two people who really didn't know each other -- I have compassion for anyone who has to live in a marriage like this one!"},{"Title":"The Rector's Wife","review":"I enjoyed the book very much. It was very interesting and funny in parts. I usually always enjoy her books."},{"Title":"The Rector's Wife","review":"This is drama with well drawn characters that I can relate to and care about. I especially enjoyed the main character's self growth. This rector's wife realizes that her life is a poor fit for herself and her youngest child, who still lives at home. The steps she takes to find meaning and make a better life for herself and her daughter were realistic and, because they were realistic, inspiring. I really connected with this book!"},{"Title":"The Rector's Wife","review":"I love this book, and the only reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 is that a couple of the major plot points felt contrived to me (I won't say what they are for those of you who haven't read the book yet). Nonetheless, it was such a pleasure overall that I was pretty near willing to overlook or forgive those contrivances. The characters are all so well developed, and the social satire is subtle yet right on point -- and the protagonist's (and other characters') pain, struggles, and growth are palpably drawn. It's also got depth layered with wonderfully dry humor, and I laughed out loud more than once. This is the first novel by Joanna Trollope that I've read, and I will definitely be reading more by her. Brava!"},{"Title":"The Rector's Wife","review":"This story of a frustrated rector and his equally frustrated wife is realistic, but also quite witty. The main character has always thought herself as a captive of her husband's fate, however, when one of her children is bullied at school and finances do not allow a transfer to another school, she takes matters into her own hands. As she changes, so do the attitudes of people toward her. Unfortunately, as events approach an inevitable (probably explosive) confrontation between husband and wife, the author creates a truly disappointing &quot;cop out&quot; and, in my opinion, unrealistic ending"},{"Title":"The Rector's Wife","review":"I just finished The Rector's Wife this evening, and while I can identify with Anna, I am very much wishing that Peter had had a chance at his own epiphany."},{"Title":"The Rector's Wife","review":"What a waste of time! And I read the whole thing...why? Maybe because I wanted to see if it would get any better but it didn't, and I dislike giving up on a novel. Another shallow tale which jumped from one fanciful event to another. How convenient an ending for Anna to &quot;get on with her life&quot; minus the difficulties of a loveless marriage. This story is not a reflection on what real life is all about (I hope) but maybe I wasn't in the mood for escapist literature."},{"Title":"The Congress Of Vienna","review":"The author, Harold George Nicolson (1886-1968), served in the British Foreign Office from 1909 to 1929 prior to his impressive career as a scholar and writer. The present book was originally published in 1946 and clearly reflects Nicolson's diplomatic experiences. \`The Congress of Vienna. A study in Allied Unity, 1812-1822' is a historical (re)construction of the background, negotiations and result of the Vienna Congress in 1814-15. This chronologically structured volume begins with Napoleon's abandonment of his troops on the Russian fields in December 1812 and ends with the collapse of the conference system after the Congress of Verona in 1822. This unusual periodization is due to the author's intention with the work, namely to present \\"an examination, in terms of the past, of the factors which create dissension between independent States temporarily bound together in a coalition\\" (p. 46). According to Nicolson, the formation of the final coalition (The Quadruple Alliance) that defeated Napoleon began in 1812 and was dissolved ten years later.The main argument runs as follows: The basic principle that is required in order to establish an alliance is an agreement between at least two states to \\"subordinate their separate interests to a single purpose\\" (p. 49). In 1813 (as well as in 1914 and 1939) the purpose was the defeat of a common threat and enemy. However, once victory seems in reach, the common purpose begins to fade away on behalf of the separate interests of the allies. In other words, the constitutive element in the alliance is crumbling. The political controversials between the members are only brought to the surface once the war enters its final stage, even though the disinterests might have been latent all the way. Therefore, the negotiators often lack the necessary rational judgment once the political matter with the defeated enemy has to be settled which often results in frail peace treaties.This explanation theory appears very universal in its wording, which methodologically is a problem because it is only tested empirically on the Quadruple Alliance against Napoleon. But it is apparent, though, that the theory (as a hypothesis) seems applicable to the two world wars of the twentieth century as well. The Versailles Settlement, in retrospect at least, does not seem as the result of a very rational calculation, and concerning WWII we are already too familiar with the clash of separate interests between the two wartime allies, the United States and the USSR.Except for this issue of the seemingly general theory there are other flaws in the book. Nicolson's statement that Castlereagh's plans for a \`just equilibrium' objectively were ideal is difficult to maintain. Sure the scheme of the foreign secretary might have generated a perfect balance of power on the continent including Russia, but this was exactly in the (subjective) interests of Britain. As long as there would be no continental rival Britain would remain the world's undisputed leader. Nicolson does not deny this either but maintains that the British solution would have been the better for Europe at large. Why then, one must ask, was this plan rejected? I think the explanation is that the other great powers simply were not willing to accept British supremacy in order to establish a perfect equilibrium on the continent. If every continental power was prevented from gaining some kind of hegemonic status so should Britain. That is exactly why each power continued to achieve a balance-of-power-solution on its own principles claiming that this particular scheme would be perfect. Castlereagh's proposal was no different than any other idea. The reason for Nicolson's flaw is, perhaps, that he does not come up with any definition of the concept of \`power'. Directing his attention at the negotiators' various proposals to a post-napoleonic Europe he precludes any discussion of the power base of the participants. This is probably why Henry Kissinger has commented that Nicolson was \\"ascribing to negotiating skill what may have been due to a great many other factors\\" (Kissinger: A World Restored, p. 342).One last critique of this book: documentation lacks! Having in mind that the author solely draws on secondary sources (due to the war Nicolson was not able to consult archives across the continent) and that references are omitted, the reader must remain critical regarding the precise wording of quotes and exacts dates and times.Though I have focused on the negative, the book also includes many positive aspects. It is brilliantly written with an eloquence that ought to inspire many present day historians. What is an even greater delight is that Nicolson is completely aware and straightforward with his philosophy of history, that is the forces that determine historical process and the directionality of history.The book is suitable not only to professionals but also to the average historical minded reader."},{"Title":"The Congress Of Vienna","review":"The book begins with Napoleon's retreat from Moscow in 1812, at the point when the rest of Europe realized that Napoleon could be beaten and they began to band together to do so. It ends ten years later with the last of the annual European Conferences and the suicide of Castlereagh. I'm passing familiar with the military history of these years, but that history is so not the point here--the Waterloo campaign gets all of three sentences: \\"On June 12 Napoleon left Paris determined at any price to prevent the junction of the Prussian and the British armies. On June 18 was fought the battle of Waterloo. On June 21 Napoleon returned to Paris a defeated man.\\" No, this book is a study of international diplomacy and statesmanship OFF the battlefield, among and between the Allies and France; the eponymous Congress of Vienna does get pride of place, but is not the sole focus by any means.Mostly a study of personalities: the suave Metternich, Henry Kissinger's hero in modern times; the club-footed Talleyrand, who changed sides within France as easily and as often as Lord Gro in \\"The Worm Ouroboros\\"; the mystical and reactionary Tsar Alexander; and mostly Castlereagh, the British Foreign Minister: glacial, inarticulate, overworked and depressed, and (so long as Britain's rule of the seas is not questioned, as indeed it wasn't) totally dedicated to a perfect balance of power. Maybe: Nicolson's sympathies are completely with Castlereagh and Britain (Britain's interests are \\"our\\" interests throughout the book), and it's not always clear, reading between the lines, that those interests were as absolutely impartial and altruistic as he makes them sound.Note the date of publication. While overt comparisons are not drawn, the parallels with 1945 are clear: Great Britain and its allies finally defeat a continental tyrant after years of war, and now try to set up a new international order to keep the peace in future. And like 1945-46, the diplomats concentrate so much on making sure the defeated power cannot make trouble again, that they fail to anticipate that the allies will turn on each other once the common enemy is removed. More overt parallels are drawn with 1919--Nicolson was actively involved in those negotiations. (He was the husband of Vita \\"Portrait of a Marriage\\" Sackville-West, for those who are interested.) Date of publication may also account for why Prussia gets relatively short shrift in the book, by the way: either sympathy, or access to sources, may have been hard for Nicolson to come by in 1945.So, not impartial and with some gaps in coverage, but an interesting and readable study of a neglected side of Napoleonic history. And worth pointing out that the international institutions and balance of power established by the Congress did last for generations: Nicolson kind of glosses over the Crimean and the Franco-Prussian Wars, but certainly no war engulfed the whole continent like Napoleon did until 1914, a full century later."},{"Title":"This is My Story","review":"THIS IS MY STORY is about a communist party insider turned FBI informant in the late 1940's.

She, like Zola's Nana, makes her living off of other people. However, Carrie is a sympathetic character where Nana is not. Carrie brings down the men with whom she consorts in much the same way as Nana. Both girls are actresses, though Carrie has true talent while Nana makes it on the thrust of her hip. Carrie has only a few more virtues and redeeming qualities than did Nana, but I at least was just as overjoyed at Carrie's success in the theatre as I was satisfied at Nana's revolting end. This is a sign of how well written Sister Carrie is. Dreiser has taken a potentially weak or even vile (with different writing) character, and made her into quite the heroine! A wonderful read-I sat down one night and finished it at three in the morning-I couldn't put it down! The only problem I had was that Carrie never really overcame her bad characteristics, and she did ruin a few lives, but her ending was perfect. I think somehting should have been done to make up for that, but that's strictly personal opinion. It's still five stars despite that!"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"This novel hooked me from the first page - who can forget the opening scene where the young Caroline Meeber is &quot;spotted&quot; by the travelling salesman Charles Drouet on the Chicago-bound train? We follow in this novel two seemingly irreversible life flows: Carrie uses her beauty and ambition to rise in life, and Hurstwood falls from his secure position of middle-aged, upper-middle-class success to utter failure, all for the love of a woman half his age. It's the stuff of melodrama to some, but not when handled by Dreiser, who takes the reader into a vividly realized urban world with well-drawn characters whose virtues and vices are equally on display. You leave the book feeling that Carrie and Hurtstwood could very easily have stepped out of the pages of today's newspapers, such is the zone of uncomfortable truth inhabited by the denizens of this brilliant novel."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"I found this novel very intriguing and moving. The symbols and representations are very analytical. &quot;Sister Carrie&quot; causes one to think twice about oneself, and to reconsider one's own definition of true happiness and success. It shows one how society can influence one to think in the manner in which one does. The characters face good times and bad times and experience true tests of strength and survival. The results are both well developed and interesting to discover. It is difficult to put the book down. When reading this novel one must understand the sybolism and look deep into the context to acquire the meanings of it. Another interesting fact about this novel is that Theodore Dreiser actually wrote the novel in the year 1900. I am a junior in high school and I strongly recomend the reading of this novel to anyone."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"Sometimes free is too expensive.

Or something of which I can maybe not be understanding to do with anything."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"One of the reasons why Sister Carrie is worth reading has to do with the ending. If you've read any of these famous home-wrecking novels, where a young beautiful girl gets involved with an older man, and wondered if suicide always had to be the answer, here's your book. But surprisingly, the ending makes you sort of long for the good old suicide ending. Sister Carrie isn't bad, but a lot of the insights into human nature and society are expressed in the language of a talk-show self-help psychiatrist rather than a great author. There are better versions of this formula (Updike, Tolstoy, Wharton, Austen) but there is still something in Sister Carrie that makes it worth reading. Despite its title, the better character depiction in the book belongs to the lover rather than the heroine of the title. Like Updike, Dreiser makes you feel for the plight of the upper-middle class white man. And I mean that seriously, with no sarcasm."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"I was so excited to be able to download this work by Theodore Dreiser, from Amazon.

Much like Dubus' House of Sand and Fog, we find a story in which the dilemma(s) are wholly interesting, but the characters are impossible to sympathize with, Carrie especially. Okay, I'll admit, I had a pang of feeling for Hurstwood toward the end, but even he is too much of a horse's ass to take seriously. Every character's favorite phrase is \\"I don't know,\\" and it is true. None of them have any clue. It's all about surfaces/appearances. This is what the characters live for. They are all shallow and pathetic...and somehow, Dreiser still manages to deliver a good read---you know what they say about a train wreck... The fact of the matter is, the characters have no substance; they care too much about getting ahead to think about consequences. I once read that this novel was a favorite of F. Scott Fitzgerald (my all time favorite author). AFter having finished it, and comparing it to some of Fitzgerald's own shallow, self-absorbed characters, I can see why.This is a book that you will love to hate, at least as far as the main \\"players\\" are concerned. I thoroughly enjoyed it, though I would never want to meet a Carrie, Hurstwood or Drouet in person :)"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"\\"Sister Carrie\\" by Theodore Dreiser portrays the different lifestyles of the turn of the century. I think the main theme of this book is greed. The characters will do anything for money even jeopardize their relationships. The main character, Carrie, even leaves her family to go find money. She moves to Chicago to find work, which will end up being wealth for her. During this time large cities such as Chicago were places of great economic growth. They were full of factories. A fair amount of unwed women were working in these dirty factories to make around $6 a week. This money was just enough for food, rent, and maybe some odds and end stuff but definitely not enough for a young woman to be happy.During this time, and like today, people are judged by how much money they have. People will stare and know if you are of a lower class than them or of a higher and then they envy you. Your clothes play a big role in distinguishing between the different classes of wealth. Carrie hated her life as being in the poor class and wanted bigger and better things for herself and she knew the only way for that was with money.She gets in with two guys and we know she is just in it for the money. They are using her for her body and she is using them for their money. Both are forms of prostitution. They take care of the bills and by that then they own her and can do whatever they want. She is always acting. She is never a \\"genuine\\" character. She knows what kind of woman these high risers like and that's what she portrays herself as.Her acting continues throughout her life and never ends. She is used for her beauty and never for anything else. I think we as the readers know more about her life and what she is doing to it rather than she does. Even at the end of the story she doesn't know what her life means. She is lonely and doesn't understand why.This book is good but can drag on at times. The middle is a little dreary but perks up at the end. I enjoyed reading it especially with it being a historical fiction. Dreiser does a great job showing what life was really like at the turn of the century. The great moral of the story to me is that wanting is fine but if it interferes with the rest of your life is not worth wanting."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"Sister Carrie is a lovely book. It tells a rather profound story--placed specifically in its time, which was of course the 'Modern Day' for the time it was written. As a result a book that was once a critical document of patterns of behavior of some of the author's contemporaries has become, for better or worse, an important historical chronical of the dangers of selfishness and uninhibited personal ambition. Oh, the story is no longer anything unfamiliar, but the grounding and the character studies make this book very affecting and, true to the ideals of its unfortunate literary designation of 'Naturalism' (a meaningless term which limits instead of explains a readers' expectation, much in the way that science-fiction or horror classify something as not necessisarily what it in fact is), this is a very believable and realistic story.The writing itself, as other readers and critics throughout the past one hundred years or so have repeated when attempting to find fault with Sister Carrie, isn't the most impressive thing about the book. However, in its defense, the cut and dry, occasionally pasted on moments of philosophical conversation and the rugged and perhaps at times inconsistant speech patterns of the various characters somehow, for me, created an even more believable picture, zoning in on those people who attempt to speak both above and beneath their social class and educational backgrounds for either personal gain or in a futile effort to 'fit in'.A wonderful book, because of its flaws, in fact, that reads like a quick-paced and absorbing tale always on the verge of tragedy. That tension, that what-will-happen-next feeling pervades throughout the book and concludes by providing quite an impact indeed."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"After reading a few Edith Wharton novels and becoming interested in late Victorian literature, I found Sister Carrie and decided to buy it based on the reviews here - I'm so glad I did.This is a truly fascinating story of the decline of one person and the ascent of another. I guess the fact that after 100+ years it is still so riveting is the reason it's a classic. This is by far the best book I've read recently.I guess if I were to offer one complaint, it would be the amount of theorizing and postulating that Dreiser does concerning human nature - it bogs the story down a bit at times, but this is a minor annoyance for me. It's one of the few books that I know I'll read again. Definitely worthwhile!"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"This Kindle edition is missing words and has words wrong in the first paragraph!

I ordered it when I thought I was ordering another and it was delivered to my door. Since it was recommended for a creative writing class, I figured I might as well read it since I love a long, epic novel. Little did I know what I was getting into.Carrie reads abruptly Brittish at first, with all the proper nouns and pronouns making it seem, straight away, like a snobbish and bourgoise book. Once I got past the first few pages, however, I was at once intrigued and secretly invited to hear, not read, the tale of an original fem fatale.As I read, I could actually hear the dialog and ambience of the era, horse-drawn carriages, the buzz of a cafes, restaurants and lodges. And, of course, the rather brutish brother-in-law whom Carrie encounters as an adversary when she moves to Chicago in the late 1800's.The novel was the first for author, Theodore Dreiser, who later went on the write, \\"An American Tragedy\\", in 1925 a novel that brought universal acclaim.\\"Carrie\\" reads with the striking atmosphere of a completely different set of rules and behavior standards and though, the language is a little outdated, it still tells the story of a young woman's plight of constant rejection during a time of very strict ideals set on single and married women. Her's is a fairy tale of seeming immediate acceptance with dreadful undertones of ownership and emotional abuse.I'm incredibly challenged with the style and verbose writing of Mr. Dreiser and confident that a movie is sure to be in the works. A great read!"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"When I finished reading Theodore Dreiser's 1900 novel, \\"Sister Carrie,\\" I wrote in the margin, \\"We live in a depressing fiasco of a country.\\" This is to detract nothing from Dreiser's novel - it's just that the problems Dreiser outlines in \\"Sister Carrie\\" are problems, material and epistemological, that remain with us, unabated, over a century later. If contemporary novels like Wharton's \\"The Age of Innocence,\\" Woolf's \\"To the Lighthouse,\\" and Butler's \\"The Way of All Flesh\\" signal the end of the Victorian era, Dreiser's \\"Sister Carrie\\" certainly foreshadows the preoccupations of the 20th century. Dreiser's narrator has a detachment and yet a cynicism which inflects the story of a young girl from rural Wisconsin trying to find happiness in Chicago and New York.\\"Sister Carrie\\" begins as the eponymous heroine, Caroline Meeber, hurtles forth on a train from Waukesha, Wisconsin, to her sister in Chicago. Ostensibly, she is going to find a menial job and support herself under the protection of her sister and her sister's husband. On the train, she meets a young salesman, Charles Drouet, who is captivated by her. Arriving in the growing metropolis, Carrie has a world of difficulty adjusting to the drudgery of working and living with her joyless relatives. As the novel gets underway, with industry too consumptive of her individuality and her ideals, Carrie is swept off by Drouet, becoming his mistress, and leaving her sister. Through her association with Drouet, and subsequently, his friend, the respected resort manager, George Hurstwood, Carrie struggless to negotiate her ambitions and desires in the context of these two promising, but unfulfilling relationships.One thing permanently at the forefront of Dreiser's novel is money - how one gets it, who has it, what they do with it, and all the complications and frustrations that come from having too much or barely enough to survive. Dreiser opens up to us a world of widely varied economic circumstances, from the utterly abject homeless, to the 'scab' day-laborers during a public transit strike, to factory-girls, to resort managers, business owners, and seemingly everything in between. He also underscores the perceptible, and growing, disparity between subsistence and success, between respectability and celebrity. The differences that Carrie and Hurstwood, in their adventures together in Montreal and New York, perceive between getting by and really living, are some of the most excruciatingly rendered and pathos-riddled passages in the novel.The understated sexual relationships in the novel, and Carrie's status through most of the novel as a kept-woman/mistress, first to Drouet, then to Hurstwood, was of course shocking to the novel's first readers. However, as there is nothing explicit in the novel, we must read beneath the surface, seeing the novel's relationships, as both the narrator and Carrie see them - as means to an end, to fiscal comfort and social respectability. Also in these relationships, we can gauge the dynamics of gender relations in the first years of the 20th century - the narrator's insistence throughout the novel on \\"how women are\\" or references to individual characters as \\"types\\" of universal categories. Through all of this, we come to suspect the narrator, and must learn to judge Carrie and her escapades with those she encounters (Mrs. Vance, Lola Osborne, Robert Ames) on how Carrie herself might view them.Despite the wholeheartedly depressing tone of the novel as a whole, I think one positive, though qualified, means of redemption Dreiser leaves us with is the possibly transformative effects of journalistic and artistic production. Reading is something the characters in the novel do a lot of, and here too, there is a distinction drawn between what we can get from the written word. Dreiser seems to imply throughout the novel that through the word, written and performative, some greater relationship can be established between people - that something truly apocalyptic can be brought about by reading the right books or seeing the right plays. This is one of Dreiser's great achievements as far as I am concerned - \\"Sister Carrie,\\" if we can read beyond the devastating hopelessness of it all, is a work that desperately wants us to connect with those around us, especially since Dreiser's own characters seem fundamentally unable to do so."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"Dreiser is best known for \\"An American Tragedy,\\" which to my taste is one of the most boring books ever written. But Sister Carrie is a classic in the best sense of the word.Dreiser draws the reader back in time to turn of the century America, and immerses him completely in the hopes, fears, desires, and mores of that lost time. The now fading archetype of the travelling salesman as the dangerously seductive dandy despoiling virtuous young women comes to life here.Sound corny? Not in the least. Because Dreiser gets inside these people's heads, and they're just as interesting as anyone gracing the pages of People Magazine.The novel starts with a timeless theme, young girl goes to the big city and gets seduced by smooth travelling salesman. Every made for TV movie variation on this theme nowadays reduces this to a morality tale to warn young viewers.Not Dreiser. He turns this into what I'd argue is one of the first and least politically tainted feminist novels of the 20th century. Buy this book. It'll cost you half of the newest John Grisham or Stephen King novel, you'll be solidly entertained with page turning excitement, and you can brag to all your friends about the classic you just finished."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"I had to read this for a history class and found that it was much more enjoyable than I had predicted.

Overall a good historical book, though."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"This Bantam Classic edition has an introduction by E.L. Doctorow, author of \\"Ragtime.\\" It was helpful to read his description of Theodore Dreiser as a son of German immigrants who eventually finds his way from Indiana to Chicago where he worked in a variety of odd jobs from dishwasher,shipping clerk, truck driver, and bill collector. The inspiration for Sister Carrie came in part from his life experiences and those of his family--his sister ran off to Toronto with a married man. This story is of a young woman from a small midwestern town who comes to Chicago to stay with her married sister and find work. She soon finds it difficult to live in a cloistered environment with her brother-in-law who is overly protective and puritanical, and the sister with a small baby who is always tired and not much company for Carrie. Her first job in a sweatshop punching eyelets in shoes is grueling with long hours and in the company of girls who are silly and uneducated. When she feels like her life is becoming unbearable she encounters a man named Drouet that she met on the train who persuades her to abandon her place and let him help her. Helping her out eventually leads to both of them living together. Drouet also introduces another gentlemen named Hurstwood, who owns a saloon, is married with a grown son and daughter(unbeknownst to Carrie!) and is fairly successful except he has a cold, domineering wife. Now Carrie has two men at her disposal and increasingly spends more time with Hurstwood who seems more caring, understanding of her emotional needs, and much more polished than the travelling salesman, huckster, Drouet. Life for Carrie becomes even more interesting as she is persuaded by Drouet to take a role in a small production which gives her some feelings of confidence and ability. This is where the turning point occurs in this book as Carrie's existence becomes even more complicated as she ends up leaving Chicago in a somewhat coerced manner and eventually ending up in New York and being with Hurstwood who has left Chicago under some suspicious circumstances. Once again there is the challenge of making their ways in New York which leads ultimately to Hurstwood's downfall and Carrie's rise to fame. We are shown the cruel environment of New York's seedy side along with streetcar driver strikes, terrible poverty and the feeling of despair that one must have experiencing those circumstances. For a man like Hurstwood it's especially bad because he was once successful and is having to look for menial work which he feels is not only beneath him but it's work that requires skills that he doesn't have. Carrie's successes become greater but she is still left with very little that is meaningful in her life and she ends up alone once again. Dreiser's writing is very descriptive of the times although the characters' conversations seem very stilted and unnatural. The characters for the most part are very dry and lifeless. The only one that stands out as someone who has a clear perspective of the world and a sense of values is the young man, Ames, who finally takes an interest in Carrie and sees much more than just acting skills--she has an air of sympathy and he can see it in her eyes and mouth. Sadly he doesn't appear until almost at the end of the book!"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"Great local color regarding Chicago at the turn of the century (1890). Very descriptive. Modern in that the woman doesn't get punished for being superficial and materialistic."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"This book is classic American literature for the way it portrayed a young woman who climbed via a combination of feminine wiles, theatrical ability, and liaisons with different men - a daring theme for a book published in 1900. The story centers on young Carrie Meeber, who arrives in Chicago to live with her sister and brother-in-law. Carrie is expected by her hosts to work full-time, turn over her pay, and basically sit quietly in her free time. Thankfully, she rebels against such strictures and soon leaves. Carries soon finds herself rising via incredible talent on the theatrical stage and affairs with a couple of men. In time she leaves for New York City with Hurstwood, whom she splits up with (he ends his days in flophouses) when the time is appropriate.I found this book a bit less engaging than most reviewers, yet it is clearly worth reading. Author Theodore Dreiser (1871-1945) attacked the way women were made to be dependent on men, and his sympathetic portrayal of Carrie was considered highly controversial in 1900. As such Dreiser found his book banned and then published over a decade later with several sections omitted."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"In my English 3 honors class, we had to pick a novel out of a list, and then do a big project on it.

It ends totally different from the how it starts and there was no way to predict what was going to happen. I'd heard that this book was banned by some when it came out, I didn't find it offensive at all. Maybe women were'nt allowed to have affairs back then?! Overall, I enjoyed this novel and would recommend it to any book lover!"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"Sister Carrie is more a book of its times than universal appeal. The descriptions of Chicago and New York in turn of the 19th century are fascinating, and the industrial lens through which we see Chicago and the dazzling glamour through which we see New York mirror well Carrie's journey. From small town girl to brief hard labor to kept woman to playing at housewife to famous stage actress, Carrie is at times the protaganist but most often than not the passive participant that life and those around her act upon.You can almost see Dreiser's fearsome awe of the big city, Chicago, and later especially New York, through Carrie's eyes. And Carrie's evolution from country girl to renowned actress somehow had to start in Chicago and end up in New York. Chicago is depicted as a maturing city where young men and women in search of \\"bigger things\\" are often swallowed up by the industrial complex of the city. But at the same, Chicago is still small and collegial enough that a few bright luminaries can congregate at posh bars and dominate the social scene. In Chicago, Carrie rejects hard, manual labor and essentially allows herself to be bought by Drouet as pampered mistress. For a couple of years, as Carrie refines her graces, she gradually realizes that not only will Drouet never marry her but that she doesn't want to marry him. She has grown beyond him and grown weary of her living situation with him.Enter Hurstwood, a more sophisticated man who, unbeknownst to Carrie, is married with two children. Hurstwood has lived all his life by the rules, acquiring status marrying an attractive woman, having two promising children, and slowly amassing wealth -- all goals pursued and attained. He meets Carrie, who makes him realize how unhappy his marriage is and how unnecessary his presence at home is. His children barely respect him, let alone love him. They start a love affair that is discovered accidentally by Mrs. Hurstwood and Drouet. Once Drouet tells Carrie Hurstwood is married, she's hit by the harsh reality of her unhappy situation with the feckless Drouet and the lying Hurstwood. She yearns to leave Chicago to start again.In a sense, Hurstwood and Carrie are each other's impetus for eventually fleeing for New York. But whereas the young and vital Carrie ultimately finds independence and success in New York, the much older Hurstwood discovers belatedly that New York is the beginning of a physical and mental decline for him.There are many explorations of intriguing human foibles in this novel: ego (Carrie's ego tells her she is \\"better\\" than the factory girls she worked with, better than her sister and brother-in-law, and thus her belief that she should not be forced to do hard labor; to some extent Drouet's ego which occasionally deludes him into thinking he will do the honorable thing and marry Carrie but which ultimately convinces him that he is too charming to settle down with just one woman; Hurstwood's ego which stops him from seeking work beneath his dignified position in Chicago and leads him to lingering unemployment and finally poverty and despair), the fascinating mental descent of, happiness and the moving goalpost by which happiness is defined.Also interesting is Carrie's singlehood after achieving independence. She has at this point found her ideal man, but Dreiser doesn't allow his heroine to find love at the end of the story. Why? Is Carrie afraid that she'll be disillusioned yet again by her latest idea of the perfect man or is she somehow not allowed to find happiness?What many have declared as revolutionary is Carrie's success (but not happiness) at the end of the book despite her amorality as defined by 19th century society. I suppose Dreiser's refusal to punish Carrie, as Tolstoy does to Anna Karenin, is a major departure from literature as the final judgment on failed characters. However, the story is almost too indifferent to societal criticisms. A modern reader of today wouldn't be shocked terribly by Carrie's decisions. So in order to understand fully how revolutionary the book is, the reader has to keep in mind the times in which the book was written. What might have been more effective would have been for Dreiser to heap occasional societal scorn on Carrie but ultimately allow her to succeed despite society's disapproval.Overall though, the book is very well written and completely engaging."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"Be careful what you wish for, you just might get it is an oldsaying that everyone should take heed of. Carrie is a girl who desires money and new apparel. She comes from an average financial family and feels this isn't sufficient enough for her. She uses two men, Drouet and Hurstwood to achieve her dreams. All the characters of the novel were real and dealt with real life problems. Carrie, in the beginning, needed to pay board and get a job. Although she did not like the job, she still had to have the money to live. This was also true with most of the othercharacters. They were very relatable because you can identify with their problems. Even though they had they share of predicaments, there was not any suspense or major problem that had to be dealt with. Basically, thiswas a novel about the story of Carrie's life away from home. Sure, she had little troubles but nothing that would make you read on the edge of your seat. Even though at the end of the novel she was without problems and had what she wanted, she was not happy. She wished for money and to be like the upper class, and unquestionably she got it, but she didn't have anyone to share it with. Theodore Dreiser's, Sister Carrie, had no real plot or suspense in it. All in all, I enjoyed the novel, but he could have made it more interesting for the reader to read by putting in elements of suspense."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"It's a big world. We all don't enjoy the same pleaures and we certainly all don't like the same books. I read &quot;Sister Carrie&quot; about ten years ago. I still remember it vividly. Many times since then, I have thought about the characters in it, and what they did, so it's a bit of a surprise to see that some other readers despised it. I wonder what they've read that they liked and if I would like those books. I recommend &quot;Sister Carrie&quot; and Dreiser's other great novel &quot;An American Tragedy&quot; for those who try to understand what motivates us as we live our lives. It is just the circumstances we find ourselves in by chance or are their irresistable forces that drive us?"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"You're not happy -- so you do something about it. To make yourself happy, you compete with others and the strongest will survive. Hints of Darwinian thought mix with Dreiser's own opinions on society as the reader follows the tale of Carrie and Hurstwood. Carrie goes to the city from the country and proceeds to work her way up in life. Hurstwood begins in a good position yet makes a tragic choice to end up down in life. The strongest survive in the city, and Dreiser's characters are all trying to survive.

Sister Carrie is a profound book and well worth the time and effort."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"I read this book a few years ago. While I found Carrie to be a memorable character, I found Hurstwood to be even more interesting. I was gripped with a morbid fascination as I followed this man's downfall."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"Written in 1900, this book is an American classic that has certainly passed the test of time. From the very first page I was immediately so caught up in the story that I read 220 pages the first night and only stopped reading when I was too sleepy to continue. This is a fine story that keeps getting better and better as it progresses. I loved every word of it!There are three memorable characters in the book. The first is Carrie herself, a young woman who comes to the big city of Chicago at the age of 18. Her quest for a job and the challenges of working in a factory are clearly brought to light. I pitied her situation and was actually rather glad when the prosperous salesman, Drouet seduces her and she seems to better herself. He's not into marrying her but he supports her and treats her well. She even gets a chance to take part in a play that his lodge is putting on. There's another man who is interested in her though, Hurstwood. He is a manager of a prosperous restaurant-bar and has a good life. Even though he is married, he courts her. How this all turns out is the stuff of real drama.This book has it all, but most especially it is a deep exploration of character. Each of them is sympathetic in his or her own way. And they are depicted so well that I could view the world through their eyes and actually get under their skin. This is a powerful emotional story. It is as real as it can get and the cities of Chicago and New York are presented in ways that clearly impact the characters and the challenges they face.Don't miss this book if you can help it. It is a lush and real treat!"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"The novel, Sister Carrie, came about when the 28-year-old Theodore Dreiser wrote the words \\"Sister Carrie\\" on a sheet of paper, then composed the novel to figure out what it meant.It is the story of a young woman who moves to Chicago. Longing for clothing, leisure and privilege, she soon takes up with Drouet, a man willing to support her if she'll consent to live together, unmarried. From there, she develops an attraction for a married man, Hurstwood, and the power and privilege he possesses. Their relations and the result of their decisions constitute much of the book.This novel presented scandalous scenarios of a young, impressionable, and not especially moral woman in a rather dispassionate tone. It was a rebellious scenario for the times and worth reading for the glimpse it provides into American big city life in the early 20th century.The writing, however, is unsophisticated, especially in the first half and the characters are superficial. Readers aren't allowed a deeper look into their minds and motivations. Except at one point, when Hurstwood engages in serious deception, the book lacks the tension and strong plot that drive American Tragedy.For those who haven't read Dreiser before, American Tragedy is a better place to start. But for those who want to read more of his work, Sister Carrie offers a interesting look into morality, family, and urban life."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"With his first novel \\"Sister Carrie\\", writer Theodore Dreiser put his name on the map. Much of his following success is due to this book. Much of what he wrote in this novel is based on facts that happened to his sisters. When he submitted the work to a publisher he almost got a contract - if not a publisher's wife had read the book and found it immoral.For being so candid about controversial issues, Dreiser was label as immoral - but, as a matter of fact, he was frank, touching current issues that other writers and society used to (or still do) avoid. This is one of the main reason for reading \\"Sister Carrie\\". Being an X-Ray of time like nothing else made this interesting book survive through time. And nowadays it is considered one of America's greatest classics. It is such an important book, that many critics and scholars consider it a the first modern American novel and has influenced writers like Hemmingway and Fitzgerald.Thematic was not the writer's main concern in \\"Sister Carrie\\". The use of language was ahead of its time. Dreiser was not afraid of incorporating slang to his text. For that, the book is a portrait of its time, how people behaved and talked - what makes the reading more interesting for contemporary readers. Although the language used was the one current when the novel was written it is never difficult for contemporary audiences. Moreover, the interesting plot and developed characters only make \\"Sister Carrie\\" very accessible.The plot tells the story of young Carrie, a girl who leaves her hometown to move to Chicago to live with her sister and find a decent job. But she has other plans. After attempting unglamorous jobs, she flees to live with a womanizer. But that is just the beginning of Carrie's journey down then up.Were it written by someone less talented, \\"Sister Carrie\\" would easily have become a soap opera. But Dreiser bring depth to his characters and situations. Carrie could have been only another 'a-star-is-born' type of character, but she is much more than that.So is Dreiser. With his following work (mostly with \\"An American Tragedy\\") he proved that \\"Sister Carrie\\" was not a fluke, but the conscious work of a talented writer. More than a hundred years later, his first novel is still read and very important to Literature."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"This is the first Theodore Dreiser novel that I have read, and this proved to be a good place to start, being his debut work, written at the turn of the 20th century. Dreiser writes in a florid, descriptive type of way that takes a little getting accustomed to, but then establishes a groove. Let me give a word of warning: this is a very engrossing novel. It tells the story of Carrie, a young and impressionable girl of 18, who moves away from her small hometown to stay with her settled sister and brother-in-law in Chicago, and almost immediately (in fact, on the train journey to Chicago) makes an impression on a man, Drouet, with whom she would eventually develop a romantic relationship. That relationship sours when a more attractive prospect of a man appears within her sights, and she is in turn pursued by that man, Hurstwood. Both men are upper middle class achievers, both more than a little pretentious, but both smitten by Carrie, a plain Jane who becomes a beauty.The story encompasses her struggles with poverty and hardship, wanting desperately, having, and then losing it, only to regain it by her own pluck and ambition. We are, of course, referring to material gain. The themes in this story run very deep. We witness, in a very well told manner, the trappings of wealth, the comfort and predictability of it, and then the rapid decline in fortunes that Carrie endures with Hurstwood, a proud man who fails, and is struck down by both his obsession for, indifference to, and then ultimate reliance on Carrie, which would have seemed incredible in the early stages of their relationship. I found the story of Hurstwood to be moving in that he had been financially comfortable, married (albeit a predictable and dull marriage), with teenage children; and then out of perhaps boredom, a little arrogance and a feeling of \\"just because he could\\", he pursued Carrie, the circumstances of which led to his ruination. His business endeavours sour, and he is too proud to seek positions below those to which he had become accustomed. Dreiser writes very movingly about Hurstwood's declining financial status and the shifting sandbars on which he maroons himself. He becomes a morose, inert, and powerless individual, when there once was power. He is cast off by the type of people over whom he had previously had power. Surviving New York on 15 cents a day, even in 1900, must have been near impossible. In the end, for Hurstwood, it was. His indolence and pride destroyed him as a man.Carrie, in the meantime, achieves the kind of success that seemed fantastical when she had been but a poor shopgirl struggling for $4.50 a week in Chicago. She is ultimately dissatisfied with her new-found wealth and celebrity. She knows that her work is easy and her success not achieved by hard work or years of labour; her failure in both relationships (albeit with men a good deal older than herself) has made her guarded and lonely. She keeps longing for that which is \\"ideal\\" but which is just out of her grasp. She is always something of an outsider, elusive and therefore desirable to those around her.In the end, she is as tentative and alone as when the story began; as the author writes \\"In your rocking chair, by your window, shall you long, alone. In your rocking chair, by your window, shall you dream such happiness as you may never feel.\\""},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"Classic story of small town girl comes to the big city to make her fortune.

This book was incredible......Dreiser is a GREAT GREAT writer, there were some lines that I reread 2-3 times because i was so touched by his writing... Read this book !"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"I hate to reiterate a common point made by many reviewers but I feel it's necessary to say (once again!) that the middle of the book was some hard reading. It wasn't hard, vocabulary-wise, but because Dreiser went into *great* detail about Carrie and Hurstwood, separately and as a couple (among many other things) - so much so that it could have been its own novel. It has the potential to lose people who are short on patience. Perhaps five chapters could have been combined into two (if that!).Be that as it may, roughing it through the middle makes getting to the end feel as if you've accomplished the impossible, and your effort will be rewarded.The ending was unconventional, to say the least. Not to give it away but if a potential reader believes that Dreiser tied things up quite nicely, think again! Such an ending is a present-day writing teacher's nightmare.I must confess that as I was reading the book I was simultaneously checking out the reviews here on Amazon and was prepared to feel really sorry for Hurstwood. From what I understand, Hurstwood's deterioration is the main attraction of the book (and of the movie adaptation made in the 1950s). After seeing how he tricked Carrie into leaving Chicago with him - first going to Canada and then settling in New York, how he was a bigamist (throwing that in Carrie's face at the appropriate moment), and how utterly unprepared he was to fight his wife and live a new life in a new town, I wound up not feeling as sorry for Hurstwood as is expected to be. His lack of motivation and the lies on which he built his life with Carrie were of his own doing and, in a sense, he got what he deserved in the end.Carrie, on the other hand, has been portrayed as this vixen who gladly used married men for her own gain and nothing could be farther from the truth. She didn't even know Hurstwood was married until Drouet sprang that bit of trivia upon her (after he was informed by a maid of Carrie's frequent outings with Hurstwood). Also, Drouet was not married (but they did live together as an unmarried couple in a day when that was unthinkable!).To me, Carrie is the most identifiable character here, not because she's the title character but because of her need to overcome a repetitive life full of drudgery, routine, and never making her ends meet. This was summed up perfectly on Page 31 of this edition: \\"Unless Carrie submitted to a solemn round of industry and saw the need of hard work without longing for play, how was her coming to the city to profit (her sister and her husband)?\\"Carrie's attitude regarding work and her outlook on life is, on the surface, very frivolous and not at all of an adult: \\"Carrie ... bent over her work. She felt as though she could hardly endure such a life. Her idea of work had been so entirely different\\" (Page 38). She wanted more out of life than what the industrial 1890s had to offer, and anyone can identify with that sentiment (especially today in the hyper 21st Century. What are supposed to be 9-5 office jobs turn out to be something we practically live with 24/7 and then you're fired (or \\"laid off\\"), without warning, for reasons that wouldn't make sense to a preschooler. And, for our troubles, we die of cancer in the end. Translation: Nothing much has changed in one hundred-plus years in this country).Carrie had advantages (like men wanting to take care of her) that others don't have (nor ever get) but, when the going got tough in New York City, she put her feet to the pavement and found work (something Hurstwood was always putting off).Whether one feels Carrie deserved her fame courtesy of hard work or through sheer luck (of being at the right place at the right time), Ames's thought sums up the reason for her success: \\"The world is always struggling to express itself ... Most people are not capable of voicing their feelings. They depend upon others. That is what genius is for. One man expresses their desires for them in music; another one in poetry; another one in a play. Sometimes nature does it in a face - it makes the face representative of all desire. That's what has happened in your case\\" (Page 429).Did the good guy/gal win here? That's up for debate. One thing is for sure is that \\"Sister Carrie\\" is definitely not your conventional tale and is a fine representation of good American literature.One final note: It's worth checking out the scholarship at the beginning of Barnes and Noble Classics Editions (as well as other editions that offer the same). While I find the overall scholarship to be biased majority of the time, it is, nonetheless, helpful and aids in your reading of the text. - Donna Di Giacomo"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"This novel is a highly entertaining, soap-operatic critique of all that was wrong with the Industrial Revolution. Climb onboard for an emotional trainwreck through the bowels of the urban frontier. Imagine Henry James as a Marxist with a keen eye for fashion, high on caffeine and getting paid by the word, and you'll get a fairly accurate impression of this book. Though Carrie is naive, materialistic, and misguided, she is also compassionate, determined, and ultimately likeable. By making us care about his anchorless shopaholic waif, Dreiser sets us up for a delightfully bumpy ride. The slightly sagging middle chapters are small penance for the many bracing rewards."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"Theodore Dreiser, an American novelist of the \\"naturalist school\\" published this, his first novel, in 1900, to limited acclaim. The wife of the publisher, Mrs. Doubleday, was adamantly opposed to its publication since, in her opinion, \\"immorality,\\" by which she means, Carrie's relationship with men, was not clearly punished. At the end of my \\"Barnes & Noble Classics\\" copy, there is a spot-on retort from a review in the \\"San Francisco Argonaut\\": \\"But these critics will have little to say in condemnation of the immorality of a commercial system which offers young girls a wage of three or four dollars a week in payment for labor as destructive to the mind as to the body.\\" As with numerous other American novelists, their merit was first recognized in Europe, and then reflected back to the States. The novel was re-issued in 1907, to a much more receptive public. Dreiser grew up in Indiana, and went to Chicago as a newspaperman. The principal character, Carrie, is based on his sister, who, in the novel, went from Wisconsin to Chicago. Though re-issued in the same year that Upton Sinclair published his famous muck-raking novelThe Jungle, also set in Chicago, Dreiser's novel is actually set in the 1880's - \`90's. In terms of the social classes, the two novels both complement and contrast the classes depicted, and there is a dash of some social mobility thrown in.Carrie is a classic country girl, fleeing a big family, for the lights of the big city. On the train to Chicago she meets Drouet, a smooth-talking salesman. Carrie's domestic situation, living with her sister and brother-in-law is not a happy one, and she soon takes up \\"domestic arrangements\\" with Drouet. And in the much more sedate time of what was the Victorian era in England, that is all you learn: the panting, puffing and groping are all carefully excised. Hurstwood, a married man of some property, and limited propriety, and an erstwhile friend of Drouet, also takes an unseeming interest in Carrie, which borders on Maugham'sOf Human Bondage. With this essential dynamic, the novel is propelled forward, with the inevitable vicissitudes in the human interactions as well as the social standing of the main characters. Roughly half the novel is set in New York City, so the reader gains an appreciation of the two largest American cities in the post-Civil War period, an event that is never mentioned.\\"Naturalism\\" means a realistic account life in the aforementioned cities. No \\"stream of consciousness\\" or other innovative story-telling techniques. Just a straightforward story, an easy read. I felt that the characterizations of the men, both Drouet and Hurstwood, seemed to be more insightful. Carrie is depicted as a strong women, with an independent streak, but she is also simply swept along by events, and her motivation at times is difficult to understand. The economics of the times is also realistically portrayed, including the grinding poverty that was the fate of most. Unemployment, underemployment, many of the same themes that dominant today's economy were highly operative then. Carrie \\"made it,\\" at least in terms of achieving success as an actress, but as Dreiser said, in terms of her relationship to Hurstwood: \\"She forgot her youth and her beauty. The handicap of age she did not, in her enthusiasm, perceive.\\" She achieved \\"success,\\" but not happiness. But that was not enough for Mrs. Doubleday, even though Dreiser says: \\"It is but natural that when the world which they represented no longer allured her, its ambassadors should be discredited...In your rocking-chair, by your window, shall you dream such happiness as you may never feel.\\"Regrettably, this is the first novel of Dreiser's that I have read. His other major work, published a quarter century later,An American Tragedyis now on the \\"to-read list.\\" In terms of the characters, and the setting, it is an important American novel, relevant both then, and in our own troubled economic times. 5-stars."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"Carrie Meeber leaves her small-town home in Wisconsin to try to make a life in Chicago. After unsuccessfully searching for steady employment, she gives up and becomes the \\"kept woman\\" of a male acquaintance, Charles Drouet. She finds her life with Drouet satisfactory for a while, but when she meets his friend George Hurstwood, a wealthier and more sophisticated gentleman, she begins a secret love affair with this older, married man.I'm a big fan of the naturalist novel, and Dreiser is renowned as one of the best American practitioners of this literary style. Even so, I was disappointed with this book. Though Dreiser, like an exemplary naturalist, brilliantly captures the naked reality of social conditions and human behavior, that alone doesn't make a great novel. A great novel requires characters that the reader actually cares about, and that's what I felt was lacking from this book. It's unfortunate that Dreiser chose a female protagonist, because he doesn't display a whole lot of insight into the feminine mind. Based on this book alone, one would think his conception of womankind could be summed up in the phrase, \\"They like shiny things.\\" Carrie comes across as shallow and stupid from chapter one. She continually makes life-changing decisions based on her desire for fancier clothing. In the second half of the book we gain more respect for her as she shows some competence in her chosen vocation, but it's too little too late, and her basic nature doesn't change. Hurstwood is a far more sympathetic character, but he exhibits his own frustrating assortment of unforgivable faults.The best portions of the book succeed in spite of the characters and plot, rather than because of them. The expository comments Dreiser makes on human nature are far more insightful than anything being acted out by the book's cast. The more documentary portions of the book are brilliantly drawn, for example an account of a transit workers' strike, or the portrayal of the plight of the homeless. Unfortunately it's difficult to feel much pathos for the one poor character in the book because his fall from riches to rags is brought about by extraordinarily bad decisions. Instead of a \\"this could happen to anyone\\" feeling toward poverty, the tragic downfall of the character leaves the reader with the attitude of \\"that would never happen to me\\" and \\"serves him right.\\"Sister Carrie is to be commended for its groundbreaking lack of sentimentality and its disregard for the puritanical morality of its day. Its liberating influence on American literature is unquestionable. Enough moments of brilliance shine through this flawed book to show me that Dreiser did have the great American novel within him, and I'm going to keep reading his work until I find it."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"\\"Sister Carrie\\" by Theodore Dreiser was too scandalous in 1900 when it was originally published in a somewhat pared down version. Since then, Dreiser's original story has been restored and is hardly as scandalous by today's standards. It is a landmark work of naturalism, showing the rise of characters from poverty and the fall of the rich into despair due to egotistical decision making.Oddly enough, the title does not do the book justice, for the book is not solely about Carrie Meeber, a young woman from Wisconsin who hopes for a better life in Chicago. After securing factory work, she soon finds herself a kept woman, the mistress of Charles Drouet, a traveling salesman who routinely ingratiates himself with pretty women. While Carrie has more than she ever hoped for, she constantly yearns for greater things. When Drouet introduces her to his friend George Hurstwood, Hurstwood becomes obsessed with winning Carrie over. He is successful in his venture but not without injuring her through deceit and forever changing the course his life will follow. The rest of the novel is devoted to the hardships that Carrie and Hurstwood face when they move to New York and how the tide of fortunes change for both of them.Dreiser's story goes on far longer than it needs to, due to his moralizing strands inserted in an effort to pacify the more scandalous elements of his prose - an unmarried man and woman living together, shocking indeed for its time. Yet by the time the initial crisis of Carrie choosing between the two men arrives, it feels as if all of the story has been told. The middle section of the novel drags and while it is an easy read, it is not easy to keep reading. The reader will care little about Carrie or the two men in her life. She is vapid and two-dimensional, driven by lust for wealth and fame, while the men are just as empty-headed and egotistical, conscious only of what a beautiful woman will do for their own ego.Dreiser managed to capture a lot of history in his novel, from Chicago's World Fair to strikes in the poor sections of New York City. He truly shows how environment determines one's fate and how it could be possible for one to rise above their station but not consider themselves happy or successful."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"There's nothing like good ol' American literature that you can just sink your teeth into. A brilliant illustration of a period in history with characters and situations that not only give meaning to today, but also embody a dark period in American History (the Gilded Age of Robber Barons and sweatshops). Carrie becomes the toy of two men, whom she eventually uses as her stepping stones out of the sweatshop and onto the stage and a life of ease and rich trinkets. The world of poverty and the \\"walled city\\" of riches are portrayed as symbols of the breakdown and failure of the American Dream for the first time in American history. Driesler's novel is no moral tale, but a naturalistic, amoral illustration of American lives. Brilliant novel, wonderful prose, introspective into fascinating and realistic characters against a desperate, tragic, urban landscape of the end of the 19th Century."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"The narrator who reads this book uses very little inflection and has an irritating voice to boot. Being an auditory learner, I prefer to listen to books over reading the words; this reader makes it almost painful. Since the material itself is far from scintillating, the reader could make up the difference with a good reading with lots of inflection and characterization, but she doesn't. Blah!"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"\\"Sister Carrie\\", to begin with, is written in a most curious fashion. Theodore Dreiser, an author I'd never heard of before, writes in a very interesting and distinct style. Some would probably feel frustrated with it, as well as his rather blunt way of writing, but it's rather different and certainly good.A story of a girl's slow and steady rise, \\"Sister Carrie\\" will capture readers first with its intrigue. Obviously, the idea of young Carrie whisked away to the city and within moments as a wealthier man's \\"wife\\", will have raised a few eyebrows. The way her life progresses is interesting too, from extremely low, to good, to almost better off, to bad, to better, and then finally to excellent. Her personality, though relatively static, is curious to follow as well. At first, as a meek, shy, pretty girl, she gives off the very image of chastity. At the end, she is a strong, independent woman. The change is slow, and yet Carrie does not ultimately change all that much.Above all, though, it's a great read. It's written in such a way that's easy to read, and though there are the usual dry spots of an early 20th century novel, it reads well. Characters are impressive in their realistic qualities - their weaknesses, their faults, their virtues and their beliefs. The story progresses smoothly and will keep the reader hooked.A great read, cool writing, and a curious story. All in all, a pretty awesome book. I wish I'd found it sooner. Recommended!"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"Here is a snapshot, written by a journalist, of Chicago and New York of 110 years ago. Dreiser had never read American \\"naturalist\\" novels before he wrote this one, but had been heavily influenced by his newspaper reporting and by Balzac. What we have here is social and political messages delivered in the context of the life of a young, idealistic woman who comes to Chicago to escape the boredom of a small town and to make her way in the world. I'm reminded of the book Devil in the White City and how it emphasizes all the young women who flocked to Chicago in the 1880s and 1890s, in awe of that booming city's majesty and bustle and life. What Carrie finds, however, is utter indifference and misery until a man sets her up in a \\"love nest.\\" What a scandal! This story was controversial in its day and portions of the original manuscript were cut in order to prevent an even bigger outcry. Soon Carrie grows weary of her lover and is taken with the true tragic figure in this story, a successful married man named Hurstwood. Hurstwood falls in love with Carrie and blows his whole life up for that love. All of this is based on the true story of Dreiser's own sister, but Dreiser has embellished this squalid little tale to give us the demise of a man in minute and realistic detail, all the while commenting on the meaning of success, material well being, and what happiness is all about. This would all be trite if it weren't framed in journalistic realism. Carrie ends up a smashing \\"success\\" in the theater, but never finds true contentment, nor do any of the main characters. Question: What is the good life? Answer: It comes from internal sources, not external materialistic ones. But money, nevertheless, helps along the way to provide the leisure time to even contemplate this question.Dreiser gives us an excellent portrait of what women's choices were at the turn of the nineteenth century. Without looks, talent, or extraordinary intellect, women were out of luck. Even with such assets, women depended entirely on men for their financial well being. Dreiser makes this crystal clear in this work, which was way ahead of its time.The corrosive depression that Hurstwood suffers in the last third of this work is haunting, but the scenes of old New York hark to today's downtown New York, south of 34th Street, where you can still see the buildings Dreiser describes as well as the hard-luck homeless in the streets.This is a unique American novel, not to be missed."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"Wow! My family book club read Sister Carrie immediately after finishing a book about another Carrie -- Carol Kennicott of Main Street. What a great pair of books to read together.I found Sister Carrie to be even more readable than Main Street. To me, this book read much like a soap opera. The girl who \\"works\\" her way from rags to riches, the tormented (or tormenting?) men she leaves behind.This is a GREAT book for discussion, because we found that what we thought about these characters changed with each chapter. We also spent some time trying to figure out what the chapter titles. The \\"tinder box\\" theme was especially delicious.Sister Carrie was the type of book that you have a hard time putting down. What will happen next? Our group predicted and changed our minds a hundred times.I think this novel about a young woman's venture from country life into the city and all of the people she affects is definitely one most anyone would enjoy. I especially recommend reading it in comparison to Main Street, in which the opposite happens - a girl moves from Minneapolis to rural Minnesota.Also like Main Street, Dreiser uses personal experiences in Sister Carrie. In fact, the introduction by Richard Lingeman in the Signet edition was especially interesting to me. I recommend reading it after you've read Sister Carrie. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"This book is an interesting commentary on class relations at the beginning of the 20th century. Having been written at the time, I never got the impression that the author was stretching to capture the ethos of the period. The story of a girl leaving home life to escape poverty and experiencing many changes is one that can also be seen in Hardy's Tess D'Ubervilles and Shaw's Pigmalion. In fact, the author was influenced by those authors. The evolution of the characters is delicately written and extremely convincing. My one complaint would be that the characters are somewhat transparent in terms of their emotions and desires."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"Dreiser was only in his 20's when he created &quot;Sister Carrie&quot; - that is what, perhaps, amazes me the most. At such a young age he has already learned what many take much longer to surmise (e.g. the characters in this book), and some never learn for as long as they live. It's difficult to consider Carrie the protagonist in my view, as her shallowness was the main contributer to the utter and complete downfall one of the more likable characters in the book: George Hurstwood, whose love of her let to ultimate poverty. That is, in fact, my one complaint and what has prevented this work from being a &quot;5 star&quot; novel. I simply had trouble believing that the cunning, charming, affluent, and brilliant Hurstwood would not only rob Fitzgerald and Moy, but that he would eventually dissolve into utter laziness, as if a man of his worldliness couldn't have overcome the relatively benign obstacles placed before him. He was a horse one chapter, and a lazy mutt the next. There needed to be a longer and more believable transition period, but beyond that - this is an enjoyable yarn, a &quot;must&quot; for those whose interest lies in turn of the century literature."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"Theodore Dreiser's Sister Carrie is a wonderful novel to read, especially for those interested in stories about the past and women. This turn of the century novel, which was highly controversial at its time, contains truths that pertain to people at all times and for all ages. Dreiser does an excellent job of making the reader feel as if he is a part of the industrialized, late 19th century America. But he does an even better job of creating a sense of the details of the setting. Everything a character is seeing the reader is able to see just as well. Dreiser uses a great deal of imagery to communicate the characters' visions of even the finest details. This can also be said in regard to the characters' feelings and thoughts. Dreiser carries the reader into the deepest realms of the minds of the central characters. For this, Dreiser uses many symbols and metaphors to follow the characters' successes, failures, and motives. Although Dreiser is inarticulate at times and far too wordy at others, the effect of the novel still comes through. Dreiser also inserts many of his own philosophies into the novel and at times they come across as lectures to the reader. But by doing this, Dreiser has clearly become just as involved with his characters as he makes the reader. This is one of those books in which it's message, more than presentation, will stay with the reader for weeks after its completion. So despite the nagging criticisms of Dreiser's critical contemporaries, he still skillfully wrote the story of a young girl's struggle to succeed in America and her attempts to overcome any obstacles that would try to stop her."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"I finally got around to reading something by Dreiser, namely Sister Carrie. A friend raved it up about 20 years ago. The pink-covered old battered Bantam paperback he read is the same one I'm reading now. I'm only half-way through it, but I'm enjoying its grim working out of these characters' destinies. They are a rather hopeless bunch, but what fascinates me is how Dreiser brilliantly evokes the state of unhappiness and how quickly happiness can go sour and how impossible it is to hold onto happiness for any length of time, especially when people seek to base it on empty premises, as these characters do. Incidentally, I began to wonder if the great Tennessee Williams was inspired by Sister Carrie's opening when he wrote A Streetcar Named Desire. The early scenes are eerily like the one where poor Blanche DuBois steps off the streetcar and looks for the tenement where her sister lives. The big-city atmospherics, the weather, the buildings, the lonely crowds in Sister Carrie are very well done, very vivid. Dreiser is a real clutz of a writer, stylistically, and yet he manages to bring all of this off with undeniable hellish power. It's fun, now and then, to read one of these naturalistic, turn-of-the-century grim, doomy books. It's amazing how little human behavior changes. We see the same materialistic grasping, the self-centered greed and lust, and the same sorts people with so little insight into themselves in wandering lost in todays' world. That's another good reason for reading Sister Carrie. I'd recommend it."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"Somewhere in the depths of time a critic once labeled playwright Eugene O'Neill a genius with no talent. It's a description that could just as easily fit Theodore Dreiser, an uneducated, mercurial man who, while still in his twenties, and with virtually no experience composing fiction, managed to crank out what I consider one of the greatest novels in American literature. Very few authors have ever managed to generate the raw power that Dreiser does over the 500 or so pages of &quot;Sister Carrie.&quot; It is amazing how much of the human experience he has put into this book, how well he understands the hopes, fears, and desires--mysterious and contradictory as they often are--that drive ordinary people.The conventional judgment on Dreiser puts him in the naturalistic, social-realist tradition of Zola and Hardy. There is much in this; but I think his real strength lies in depicting character--Carrie, Hurstwood, and Drouet really come alive in these pages. His characters possess a depth and complexity of feeling that one rarely finds in fiction. Dreiser has a melancholy, fatalistic sense that the world may be too vast and impersonal for people to live in it comfortably, and yet his world is vibrantly human as well.I personally find Carrie a more likable heroine (if you could call her that) than many readers have. She is self-absorbed, yes, but also capable of compassion for others, and she is never intentionally cruel. Like all of Dreiser's characters she is somewhere between the angels and the devils.This is by no means a perfect book. Dreiser's rhetorical flourishes can become absolutely ridiculous, and so can his habit of injecting philosophical commentary into the texture of the narrative. But the total effect of &quot;Sister Carrie&quot; is powerful, and more than compensates for any defects in the novel."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"It is no mystery why Frank Norris praised to high heaven Theodore Dreiser's 1900 novel \\"Sister Carrie.\\" Norris, one of America's great naturalist writers, saw in Dreiser's tale about a young woman on the make a reflection of the same bleak vistas he wrote about in \\"Vandover and the Brute,\\" \\"The Octopus,\\" and \\"McTeague.\\" When Dreiser submitted his book for publication, it was Norris who read the book and made a glowing recommendation to the publisher. There were immense problems with \\"Sister Carrie\\" from that point forward: the wife of the publisher hated the story and worked hard behind the scenes to prevent its release. With a contract already signed, Dreiser's book did become a reality but the publishing house refused to support it with any marketing. The story languished for years in a paper limbo before finally emerging to great success and acclaim. Thank goodness it did because this may be one of the most powerful books ever written about social climbing and the perils of bad morals. Dreiser went on to publish more novels (American Tragedy, The Financier) before dropping out of the literary scene and converting to communism before his death in 1945.\\"Sister Carrie\\" doesn't promise much at the beginning. In fact, this is yet another story about a rural person arriving in the big city seeking fame and fortune. In this case, it is Carrie Meeber, a young woman moving to Chicago to live with her sister and her husband while she tries to find work. Carrie quickly discovers big city life is tough; her sister's home life bores her to death, the work she finds in a shoe factory is pure drudgery, and she doesn't have enough money to buy decent clothes because she has to pay her sister four dollars a week for rent. Carrie hates her base co-workers and spends most of her free time watching people pass on the street outside of her sister's apartment. When Carrie loses her job after an illness, it looks like she will have to return home to Columbia City and forget about her dreams in Chicago.Enter George Drouet, a semi-successful salesman with a voracious appetite for the ladies. George finagled Carrie's address when he met her on the train into Chicago, and now the two meet again by chance. The results of this meeting shape the rest of the book. Carrie abandons her sister's lodgings and becomes \\"kept\\" by George. It is during this period that Carrie meets George Hurstwood, the wealthy manager of a fancy Chicago tavern and friend of Drouet. Through a series of misunderstandings about the marriage status of Carrie and Hurstwood, and serious lapses in moral judgments, Hurstwood and Carrie move on to bigger and better things in New York City.It is at this point that Norris must have began enthusing, for Dreiser embarks on a harrowing tour through the destruction of a human being's body and soul. Just when you think a person could sink no lower, Dreiser yanks you back to reality and illustrates for you just how bad things can get before the inevitable occurs. When the author contrasts the utter humiliation of one character with the elevation in status of another, the tension becomes too much to bear. This novel is painful to read, but at the same time it is so riveting it is nearly impossible to put it down. We've all seen or known people who suffered the fates revealed in this story, or at least I have, and that makes it even more chillingly realistic. How Dreiser managed to capture the feel of his characters' lives is a mystery, but that is what makes this book great literature; it is timeless in its examination of the inner workings of the human soul.\\"Sister Carrie\\" is classic literature, but that does not mean there are not problems with the story. Dreiser's prose takes some getting used to before it starts to flow. In fact, this may be the best book I have ever read where the prose is often mediocre. I told one person that the author's style reminded me of an intoxicated welder, and I still believe that to be the case for most of the book. Dreiser has a tendency to jam his sentences together into an unwieldy mix of clauses and commas. After a few hundred pages this hardly seems to matter but it could provide a reason for someone just starting the book to quit reading it. Do not quit, however, because the story ends up being so good that the stylistic problems quickly fade into insignificance.Another difficulty involves the middle portion of the story, when Carrie, Drouet, and Hurstwood vie for position with each other. These chapters appreciably drag while providing no clues about the goldmine that soon follows. Looking at the story as a whole, I understand now why these chapters were necessary but I didn't while I was reading them. Again, do not give up too soon lest you miss out on the extraordinary buildup to the soul shattering conclusion.Ultimately, the messages conveyed by Dreiser outweigh the dual problems of prose and a few plodding chapters. The scandalous behavior the author wrote about angered many during his time because people believed that divorce, infidelity, loose morals, and social positioning were things better talked about privately than brought out in the open. The fact that Dreiser wrote such things without delivering a blistering rebuke about such behaviors also stunned society. Perhaps it is not too far off to say that Theodore Dreiser was the Jerry Springer of his generation, merely revealing things that everyone knew happened behind closed doors. Whatever the case may be, \\"Sister Carrie\\" is sheer brilliance. I was so fired up after reading this book that I went right out and got \\"American Tragedy.\\" I now understand why Frank Norris went into paroxysms of delight about Dreiser's book."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"This edition, which was prepared by volunteers, contains numerous errors, dropped words and punctuations, misspellings, wrong tenses, etc. It was so annoying to read that I purchased the Modern Library edition ($3.50) after about 75 pages.

The quality great!"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"Living an average middle-class life, I have always wondered how the very rich and the very poor get where they are. Sister Carrie is a beautifully written and fascinating tale of how one climbs and descends the social ladder of life. I am aware that some readers have criticized this book stating that Dreiser did not develop the characters very well and that Carrie was not very likeable. Well, it is my thought that Dreiser never intended for us to become solely wrapped within the characters. He meant for us to become enveloped in the circumstance. The two main characters, Carrie and Hurstwood, are truly victims of circumstance - Carrie's never-ending unhappiness and Hurstwood's downward spiral. As we go through life, there are so many events and choices that will guide our lives to what they are. When one stops and thinks about this, it is really quite fascinating. I believe Dreiser r was aware of this aspect of life and he wanted to write a novel that would effect the lives of everyone who reads it. I read the entire book in 3 days. I simply could not put it down. I recommend Sister Carrie to everyone. It will leave you thinking and thinking and thinking."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"The constant typos in this edition ruin Dreiser's literary style. I got what I paid for."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"I sometimes fear that novels heralded as &quot;classics&quot; may have been great in their time, but no longer have as much wallop. That was my prejudice approaching &quot;Sister Carrie.&quot; I'd read &quot;An American Tragedy&quot; years ago and was impressed, though not as much as I'd been led to believe. Thus, I wondered whether Dreiser's &quot;second most famous&quot; novel would be worth the effort. It was. Although firmly set in its time, it is not dated, and the book moves briskly from start to finish. The characters are well drawn, and I found myself drawn into their stories and the choices they made, with the consequences laid out as the novel progresses. Dreiser manages to convey the gritty reality of living in Chicago and New York at the turn of the last century, with the contrasts between wealth and poverty so pronounced. His attention to detail makes the scenes come alive, and he tells the story without being didactic or preachy. For example, there is an episode involving a streetcar strike, which the author tells in a way that makes clear his own political views, yet those views are not crammed down the reader's throat.This one is worth the effort."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"As I have aged, and become aware of the time left in life, I have returned to reading classic books that I read in high school, or overlooked for popular fiction works of today. And am I glad I did. When in high school, we read Dreiser's American Tragedy, and I remember being one of the few who loved it. I felt it reached me as a teenager as no other book ever had, and to this day it is one of my few favorite books of all time (then again I love American Romantic Period paintings, and not many people I know do, so maybe it's just my taste). Anyway, Sister Carrie is new to me, and I love it. Of all the books that explain women's true feelings that I have read, this is one of the best. I think it still holds true for many women...circumstances may be different, but the feelings remain the same. If you want to understand the woman in your life, study Carrie. And the path of the male character is astoundingly real, even today. It is a thoughtful book that warrants everyone's attention. And added benefit...the language is beautiful. Writers from our past used words in ways to describe the world that I have rarely read in modern times...you can feel the wind through the trees, sense the depression of winter days, understand the inner feelings of characters far better than much put into books today provides. I have read far too many books today in which action takes precedence over character. Read Dreiser, or Dickens, or Hardy, or Austen and then try a modern book..its shocking how little the new books can hold you after the experience. SISTER CARRIE is worth your time."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"I just finished reading the book \\"Sister Carrie\\" by Theodore Dreiser (1900). This book was a good, easy read and is strangely still current, even though it was written over a hundred years ago. With the economy the way it is it seems that not much has changed, except perhaps the value of money. Carrie's desire to be in the city, as well as her experiences with men who claim they love her are realistic, modern and honest. I recommend this book to people interested in realistic fiction and coming of age stories; also to people who like reading stories about the mid-west-- Carrie is from Wisconsin and moves to Chicago, then travels to New York City by way of Detroit."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"My mother told me to read this book about ten years ago when I was the same age as Carrie. I rarely listened to her, (I do now, always listen to your mother!) so she read me the first few lines, and I had to pick it up: something about a girl of eighteen and how she might fare alone in nineteenth century Chicago intrigued me. There was a hint that she might go bad! So of course I had to pick it up. Besides, I'll read almost anything, which you can see from my various reviews. I found I couldn't put it down.This is a great melodrama about a harsh and sprawling metropolis at the turn of the century, and like Dreiser's other work, it's also a story of the viciousness Darwinian nature of capitalism. In this case, he looks at the story through the eyes of a pretty young woman who comes to the city by herself-young Carrie, called \\"sister Carrie\\" in homey fashion by her rural family, to show the sweet origins of what ultimately becomes a not-so-respectable woman.Carrie, trying to become an \\"actress\\", relies on sexuality to survive. It's suggested that she doesn't have much of a choice, and that everyone is for sale in the city. Preyed on by more sophisticated men, she ultimately becomes successful in her own right. This leaves us with a sort of confusion-we've grown to symapthize with Carrie and understand her behavior is a survival mechanism, but she is also callous and begins to change from victim to conniver. At the end, we aren't sure whether to cheer her triumph, or feel bad for those she's left in her wake.Another entertaning, great Dreiser story that will teach you about American urban history, not to mention keep you turning the pages in great suspense as to what will become of lovely young Carrie. Thanks, Mom!"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"I must admit I've never read Sister Carrie, but it is a free Kindle book and I thought I had nothing to lose.

I've even seen the same sentence repeated on the same page. I really would enjoy this e-book much, much more, if it didn't appear to have been hastily thrown together.

The attractions and risks of the vibrant, everchanging society and confusions over the shifting values and the desire to maintain the appearance of the old morals, and one's life can change any minute by luck, misfortune, or choices resulted from impulsivity or lazy complacency etc. I gave only 3 stars because of the lack of personalities in main characters, they seem rather flat to me, not generating much emotions, neither compassion, or disgust.

'Sister Carrie' is a classic, written in 1900. And it still is...it is the great story of Carrie, a Midwestern girl who moves to Chicago, moves in with a man, gets stolen in a way by someone else and moves to New York. It is a story about wealth and poverty and many opposites. She makes her own life, starts out poor and living with her sister to becoming a succesful Broadway star while her husband in NY ends poor and eventually commits suicide.I didn't like it as much as 'An American Tragedy' but it is still very good."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"I found this novel very intriguing and moving. The symbols and representations are very analytical. &quot;Sister Carrie&quot; causes one to think twice about oneself, and to reconsider one's own definition of true happiness and success. It shows one how society can influence one to think in the manner in which one does. The characters face good times and bad times and experience true tests of strength and survival. The results are both well developed and interesting to discover. It is difficult to put the book down. When reading this novel one must understand the sybolism and look deep into the context to acquire the meanings of it. Another interesting fact about this novel is that Theodore Dreiser actually wrote the novel in the year 1900.

She is completely inexpressive, hence we never really get to know her -- to understand her motivations. Perhaps this is Dreiser's intention -- indeed, Carrie's lack of strength is likely the main reason for her downfall. I wouldn't know -- her character was so aggravating, with her wishy-washy, inarticulate ways, that the book did not make a truly lasting impression on me. Not bad, though, if you have more patience and more time than I did."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"There are many well-deserved reasons as to why this novel is a classic, all of which have been discussed by other reviewers. However, if you tend to find most classics to be something \\"better to have read than to actually read\\", be aware that Sister Carrie really might bore you to tears. Dreiser's awful, heavy-handed writing style is legendary, the novel is at least twice as long as it honestly needs to be, the characters are all cliched stock figures whose passivity makes them even more tedious, and the subject matter, which had been so shocking at the time, has long since lost all impact.Well, get over it. The real impact of the novel today is in the myriad little fascinating details of interest to anyone even remotely curious about daily life during the gaslight era of American history. Plus, of course, the realism. This had always been the point, but the fact that Carrie is based on Dreiser's real-life sister certainly adds a dimension. And while the story of Carrie Meeber's/Emma Dreiser's life would hardly be as scandalous today, the underlying emotions, ambitions and consequences are just as timelessly relevant."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"This book is boring and dull.

The one I received is about 8 inches wide, 10 inches high and about .7 inches thick."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"\\"Sister Carrie\\" is historically monumental, culturally meaningful, and a sloggy read from first page to last.It tells the story of Carrie Meeber, a Wisconsin farm girl who comes to Chicago in 1889 to find her way. After a brief, unhappy stay with her cheerless sister, she lights upon a drummer named Drouet happy to show Carrie a better life in exchange for her becoming his unmarried lover. The result is a happy one for Carrie, but two things threaten her ersatz domesticity: the possibility of a career on the stage, and the attentions of a philandering resort manager named Hurstwood.\\"Why, I should think that you would be very happy,\\" she tells Hurstwood at one point. \\"You know so much of the world.\\"\\"That is it,\\" he answers. \\"I know too much of the world.\\"First published (and famously suppressed) in 1900, \\"Sister Carrie\\" was infamous not only for the sordidness of Carrie's circumstances, but the utterly naturalistic approach Dreiser took to describing them. Like Darwin with a fossil bone, Dreiser finds broader implications for his minute observations on the lifestyle of Carrie and her friends, implications he often expounds upon at length.\\"It was not for her to see the wellspring of human passion,\\" he writes. \\"A real flame of love is a subtle thing. It burns as a will-o'-the-wisp, dancing onward to fairylands of delight. It roars as a furnace. Too often jealousy is the quality upon which it feeds.\\"Dreiser's point-of-view is rooted enough in reality to command respect, but the thin plot is a detriment as are the uninvolving characters at the center. Carrie is a strangely dull flower who is seen forever staring out at windows, content to float along on the tides of others' passions with only her beauty to save her. She generates no sympathy. Nor do Drouet and Hurstwood, the latter of whom seems especially ill-presented as a relentless go-getter one minute and lazy lounger the next. The then-29-year-old Dreiser presents this as the matter-of-fact result of turning 43.Positives of \\"Sister Carrie\\" include a Chicago so real you can smell the stockyards and the flophouse drunks, a treatment of Carrie's stage career that provides necessary diversion from the main storyline, and some mildly amusing glimpses at Hurstwood's loveless marriage. \\"Sister Carrie\\" lacks for humor generally, which along with the robotic characters make the book a dull read despite the fact it is written in a plain and accessible style, unlike Dreiser's later \\"An American Tragedy.\\"I really enjoyed \\"American Tragedy;\\" which benefitted from a masterfully-spun plot and engaging people. If the idea of someone actually benefitting from sex before marriage wasn't so objectionable at the time, I doubt \\"Sister Carrie\\" would enjoy the cultural standing it does today.

He takes charecters from different classes of the American economy, and shows how they are corrupted by the pursuit of the American Dream. Sister Carrie gets off to a slow start, but the reader is able to connect with the events that unfold. Dreiser's talent lies in the fact that he was able to describe life as he saw it, tragic.

She, like Zola's Nana, makes her living off of other people. However, Carrie is a sympathetic character where Nana is not. Carrie brings down the men with whom she consorts in much the same way as Nana. Both girls are actresses, though Carrie has true talent while Nana makes it on the thrust of her hip. Carrie has only a few more virtues and redeeming qualities than did Nana, but I at least was just as overjoyed at Carrie's success in the theatre as I was satisfied at Nana's revolting end. This is a sign of how well written Sister Carrie is. Dreiser has taken a potentially weak or even vile (with different writing) character, and made her into quite the heroine! A wonderful read-I sat down one night and finished it at three in the morning-I couldn't put it down! The only problem I had was that Carrie never really overcame her bad characteristics, and she did ruin a few lives, but her ending was perfect. I think somehting should have been done to make up for that, but that's strictly personal opinion. It's still five stars despite that!"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"I would have hated being the fallen man who ran away from his life to live and flirt with a flirt.

Dreiser is a thorough enough author that reading this book through any lens brings new issues and view points to the surface.

She runs into men, gets swept into going to New York where her life goes through great changes when the man she is with, who happens to be her sole provider, completely unravels emotionally, spiritually and financially. Carrie's life proceeds in a manner very atypical of heroines of that era. The story builds to a very fine conclusion.My only complaint with 'Sister Carrie' is that it does take some time to \\"warm up\\", and the author's writing style not especially fluid. I also felt after reading the book I never completely understood Carrie or the men in her life, ... but maybe the author left it to the reader ponder over afterwards??Bottom line: certainly a remarkable piece of literature in its day, and thankfully the material hasn't aged a bit.

His vivid descriptions made me feel like I was in turn-of-the-century Chicago. And his character development was so real that Carrie and Hurstwood became people I know. Dreiser writes about real life and real relationships and about the choices we make and their effects. He writes about life without the romantic heroism of Hemingway or the aristocratic ex-pat view of Fitzgerald. I love those authors, too, but in Dreiser, I've found a writer whose characters speak to me.Read Sister Carrie. Savor Sister Carrie.

There is nothing that I can give bad criticism in this story, except for the fact that some of the characters were disagreeable to me. But that is the beauty of Dreiser's work: you don't know who in the world to like or to hate, to believe or to not, for that is realism. A great read!"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"The pursuit of happiness may be the dominating adventure in the life of all men. For over three centuries, Americans have linked happiness with wealth and success. In Dreiser's Sister Carrie, Carrie is consistently seeking out this &quot;American Dream.&quot; Dreiser forces the reader to confront the question-- &quot;What will bring man fulfillment?&quot; This novel is devoted to pointing out that fulfillment does not come from material objects, but from honest labor. Sister Carrie follows the life of Carrie, in the last part of the 19th century, as she moves up from a small town girl to a Broadway star. Dreiser's simple style makes this book easy to understand. Due to Dreiser's lack of formal education, the language is a bit choppy. This lack of education, however, does not interfere with the power of this story. He reiterates his theme of materialism versus fulfillment with many metaphors. For example, he compares fortune to an organism--something that draws on the strength of outside sources. Dreiser's use of metaphors and his intense character developments makes this book enjoyable. It is a rags to riches story that does not lead to inner satisfaction. If you enjoy long books about women of the past, you must read this. It is not only valuable for its revelations of timeless truths, but also its history."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"Sister Carrie is an epic story of destruction and dissatisfaction when a person's self is centered around possessions. Dreiser tells the story fo Carrie's rise from rags to riches beautifully by incorporating vivid similes and metephors that capture the wealth Carrie yearns for. The main theme throughout the novel is the pursuit of happiness and the endless dissatisfaction that occurs when you base your self on wealth and status. We follow Carrie as she dreams of a higher position, receives it, is not quite happy, dreams of an even higher position, receives it, and the cycle continues never finding Carrie content. Dreiser developes the characters so beautifully you feel you truly know them. Life is presented as it really is. Dreiser gives very detailed accounts of the setting and continually gives insightful comments on situations, society, and character motives to effectively pull in the reader. Another important theme running through the novel is one of creating society as a show or play. Everyone is an actor. This is really effective as Dreiser illustrates the fact that people become what they must in order to get what they want. However, this theme is presented in a setting where the city becomes symbolic for all the corruption that occurs when presented with luxury. I loved this book and could really identify with the characters. In the latter half of the novel, Dreiser's juxtapostion of one character's assent to fame and the another's decent into poverty was so moving I do not believe I will ever forget it. The idea that the pursuit of happiness through worldly goods will lead to endless dissatisfaction was very insightful and moving throughout the novel. I would suggest this book to anyone, especially to those would love to be swept away by a beautiful yet realistic tale of wealth and corruption."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"This book was written at the turn of the century and it is a great portrait of American life and ideals at that time. It is the story of a young girl named Carrie who leaves her small town to go to Chicago to live with her sister and find work. She soon finds that living with her sister and her husband is very boring and that work is hard and dull. Soon she is a mistress of a pretty wealthy man, and the rest of the book is the story of her rise in society.One of the main themes of this book is materialism, and how people would do anything for money. During the book I could see how innocent Carrie becomes a victim of circumstances as she tries to fit into the environment around her and becomes swallowed by the anonymity of the city. I love Dreiser's style, although he goes off on unneccessary little lectures at times, and I really liked following the plot. The characters were drawn so well that I would forget they weren't real. This is a great book to read and it accurately portrays American cities at the rise of industrialism and materialism."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"I really enjoyed the first 495 pages of the book, with Dreiser's excellent descriptions, analyses, and an excellent plot. I'm very disappointed with the ending of the book, however, and I feel a little empty upon finishing it. If Dreiser had spent just a few more paragraphs, it would have made for a much better ending, but still, a fine first book from Dreiser."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"This turned out to be a surprisingly powerful novel. It starts out as a tale of a \\"fallen woman,\\" but ends up being the story of a broken man. Dreiser answers the question: what happens to a man who acts on his midlife crisis? Although the eponymous heroine is the catalyst for many events in the novel and the character through whom Dreiser explores the effects of materialistic culture upon the developing personality, this novel is really about George Hurstwood, a man who leaves behind his comfortable life, job and family and runs off with Carrie, a beautiful younger woman.The novel is set in the late 1800s, early 1900s. Young Carrie Meeber is a Wisconsin country girl determined to start a new life who one day boards a train heading for Chicago. It is the first time she has ever left her small town. Carrie's personality is unformed. She is impressionable and easily swayed -- but ambitious. As a character, she is interesting mostly for the effects she produces on the various men she meets and for the way in which her personality is molded by the attitudes of those around her. Carrie quickly realizes that money is everything in the big city. Material possessions define the man or woman. Money determines social status. Money enhances beauty. A person who does not have the best clothes, a beautiful home, and the wherewithal to dine in the best restaurants and to visit the hottest nightspots is not really much of a person, Carrie concludes. This is one of the major themes running through the novel, the idea that our very essence is defined by others and how they perceive us (with the depressing corollary that others judge us based upon our income). The strongest, suavest, most self-confident personality may be broken down to nothing if deprived of wealth and its appurtenances. Conversely, money has the power to catapult a nonentity to the highest social echelons. There is one character, Bob Ames, who attempts to dispute this worldview. Bob is an intellectual who appears at intervals throughout the novel, each time telling Carrie that noble deeds are more important than money, that she should read Balzac and Hardy instead of trashy novels, that she needs to contribute something substantive to the world instead of falling for the meretricious charms of the high rollers. Yeah, whatever, Bob. Yawn. I think that Dreiser intended for Bob Ames to be a pivotal figure in the novel, a person of depth battling for Carrie's soul against the claims of the material world, but Bob's arguments are not very convincing in light of the story's bleak ending. Although Dreiser leaves open the possibility that Carrie will eventually embrace Bob's philosophy, it seems unlikely. Why should Carrie listen to Bob when everything with which she is surrounded exhorts her to favor superficial appearances over internal substance?There are two brilliant portraits of men in this novel. Charles Drouet, a \\"genial egotist\\" and Carrie's first lover, is the spitting image of one of my ex-boyfriends. I suspect that most women have a Charles Drouet in their pasts because he's the type of man who holds great appeal at a certain time of life: the dashing, well-dressed, ridiculously self-confident ladies' man who is committed to nothing except his own pleasure, who genuinely likes women (on a shallow, self-serving level) and wounds them only inadvertently - that is, he does not maliciously seek to hurt anyone; he does so only as an unintended side effect of his self-absorption. The most masterful portrait, though, is that of George Hurstwood. The last third of the novel details his decline from wealth into seediness and finally into poverty, and it's some of the best writing I've encountered in a long time. (Drusier's style in the first two-thirds of the novel is bombastic - truly tedious at times -- but the last third more than makes up for it.) Anyone who has ever been unemployed for a long period of time will relate to the description of the lethargy and depression that sets in as Hurstwood's prospects grow dimmer, the self-doubt that takes hold and begins to emanate from his pores. I was on the edge of my seat during this part of the novel. It is SO GOOD. It is wrenching to see how Hurstwood's personality changes in response to his altered position in the world. When he is no longer accorded the respect that goes along with having money, he becomes a different man. Through Carrie's eyes - \\"the eyes of the world,\\" Carrie being both a product of society and its standard bearer - we watch as he is transformed from someone worthy of respect into an object of contempt.\\"Sister Carrie\\" was controversial when it first came out due to its profanity and sexual references, and it was released in numerous \\"edited versions.\\" I read the Penguin \\"unexpurgated edition.\\" It is disappointingly tame (for example, the sexual references are so oblique that I was unable to detect any of them), but I recommend the unexpurgated edition because other versions change the ending and cut out whole passages.This is a great novel. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"Sister Carrie is my favorite novel of all time. I have read it at least twenty times in the past sixteen years. I'll spare you the literary review, which I'm sure you can read anywhere, and tell you why it still holds interest for the modern reader.Theodore Dreiser's attention to detail was definitely one of his major strengths as a writer. I've always found the details of late 1800's Chicago and New York fascinating in this novel. If you are particularly interested in this time period, you may want to read this novel for the everyday historical details alone.The coming-of-age theme is also one that modern readers can relate to, even though Carrie is from a different time. She leaves behind her small town and her family at the age of eighteen and is dazzled by city life. We can all relate to the degradation and desperation she feels as she seeks out her first job, and her desire for independence. Ultimately, she is successful, at least in a material sense, and the journey the reader follows her on is engaging.I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but I would highly recommend Sister Carrie. I have read most of Dreiser's other novels and several of his short stories. This is by far the best of his works, in my humble opinion."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"Don't bother ordering this version...within a few paragraphs, one can tell that the book was transcribed very poorly, possibly by someone for whom English is not their first language."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"The 19th century marked the turning point, when mankind began to be urban rather than rural. All over the world, a process started of people abandoning their old homes and heading for the bright lights and the lure of fortune in town. It's still going on in much of the world. Similarly, writers of many nations traced the stories of such people, writers like Zola, Balzac, Dickens, and even Horatio Alger, who made a clich&eacute; out of it. (Nice work, Horatio !) Theodore Dreiser wrote this classic novel at the beginning of the 20th century, about a girl who leaves a Wisconsin backwater for Chicago. Unable to make ends meet through the drudgery of factory or shop work, she winds up as mistress to two men, the second of whom gives up home, good job, and family for her, committing a crime along the way. They flee to New York, where, as the long story unfolds, Carrie becomes a successful actress while Hurstwood, her star-crossed lover, slowly hits bottom, becoming a scab in a street car strike, having gambled away what little money he possessed.This gripping tale will take you time. It is couched in 19th century terms, that is, while it is about sex and power relationships between men and women, it is anything but explicit. Carrie at first is just a kept woman, but after an unexpected success in an amateur theatrical, she gains power. The themes of instinct vs. reason and raw desire vs. understanding suffuse the book. Carrie seldom thinks her way out of any situation, she isn't a schemer, rather more of a dreamer; she falls into everything almost by accident, but uses her sexuality to succeed and climb out of poverty.Unlike most literature of the time, and certainly unlike much of Hollywood's products over the years, a life of \\"sin\\" does pay here. Carrie climbs the social and economic ladder, despite her discontent with Hurstwood's lack of gumption. It's all quite the opposite of the American dream of Lincoln-like figures succeeding by dint of their hard work, study, and dedication. She merely longs for pleasure and luxury and through sex, clothes, and looks, plus taking advantage of small 'breaks', reaches her goals. She realizes along the way, though, that there is more to life, but she cannot conceive of what that might be. We leave her at last, a lonely, but successful figure, sitting at the window.This is one of America's classic novels. It goes without saying that it's worth five stars. Great story, great writing; it evokes the times so well, you feel as if you knew them yourself."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"Written at a time when women still lacked the right to vote, Sister Carrie offers an uncommon (and not initially accepted) commentary on women and independence. It also addresses that timeless theme of how the city changes the individual. Dreiser's turn of the century novel chronicles the young adult life of Carrie Meeber, who leaves her small town home for a more exciting life of Chicago. Taking residence at her sister Minnie's meager apartment, Carrie is immediately plunged into a pit of lower class struggles; to pull her weight she takes a job as a factory girl in a shoe shop for wages that can barely afford her basic necessities let alone the simple pleasures of Chicago life. Not quite used to the rigorous demands of intense manual labor, she yearns for something greater. By chance, she bumps into a wealthy, flirtatious gentleman - Drouet - whom she had previously met on her train ride into Chicago. His initial courting is unsuccessful but he eventually takes Carrie on as a kept mistress. Their relationship is at best superficial. He offers material things and compliments to her beauty.Without spoiling the rest of the story, Carrie's raw and innocent drive for success takes her on a series of relationships and adventures first in Chicago and later in New York. As a historical piece, Dreiser provides vivid descriptions of these two cities right down to the street level. He treats the city as a state of mind, with narrative insights weaved between powerful stretches of dialogue.100 years later, present-day readers might see Carrie as a heroine, despite her unabashed materialism. This was the very reason for its lack of marketing support; the historical fact is that the wife of Doubleday's CEO was upset by Carrie's bachelorette success going \\"unpunished\\" by the author.As was mentioned above, the \\"city\\" has transformed her into a woman who is set in her ambitions. Dreiser's style allows us to see things from the point of view of many characters and not just Carrie's. There are snippets of moralizing here and there which give the reader a sense that Dreiser was in some ways a prophet - he foresaw the unbridled potential of American individuality, its drawbacks, and how it is generally actualized in the American city. And for the time period, this was a paradox for women. But Carrie shamelessly lives her life they way she wants to. Classism and sexism aside, Carrie Meeber carries on the American dream."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"I had to read this book in college for a Modern Novel course. With the cover and title and length (and with 7 other novels to read that looked pretty good - except for Beloved, which is trash), I had to admit that this book looked like a huge bore to me. But from the beginning pages, you become part of Carrie's world, from her downfalls to her triumphs. This book showed me a bit of life that I knew little about and the story, plot, and writing style are excellent. I assume most people nowadays will only get the opportunity to read this some sort of class where it is required, but it will be well worth it! Surprise yourself with how good a book this is."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"In my opinion, there is no american author (with the exception of Steinbeck) who can create such powerfully moving stories like Theodore Dreiser. In Sister Carrie, Dreiser tells the tale of a girl who is disenchanted with her small town life, so she moves to Chicago in search of bigger and better things. The story is an amazing portrayal of a woman's life at the beginning of the twentieth century. Dreiser, through his characters, shows the difficulty of living as a single female trying to earn a living as well as maintain relationships. Throughout the book there seems to be a rather dark, somber mood, as if there is always an internal struggle and the dire need to improve one's life, but never achieving the goal. The romance, heartbreak, emotion, and power that are portrayed through the characters and their struggles are combined masterfully to make Sister Carrie one of the best works of fiction ever penned."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"&quot;Sister Carrie&quot;, first published 100 years ago, is Theodore Dreiser's ironic story of the acquisition and loss of wealth in a country devoted to commerce and pleasure. No one ever accused Dreiser of being sparkling -- one of my reference books calls him &quot;ponderous&quot; -- but he had the strength of his convictions, and he was convinced that American materialism was the root of American unhappiness. Caroline Meeber is a country mouse who, coming to Chicago in search of work, is pounced upon by big-city cats, including a flashy traveling salesman straight out of back-room jokes. When Charles Drouet seduces Carrie, it seems more like he's adopting a pet, she's so innocently compliant. And when she becomes involved with his friend George Hurstwood, it seems incredible she doesn't suspect that this middle-aged affluent man is probably married (or that Drouet doesn't reveal it to her long before he does). It is Hurstwood's abandonment of his family and embezzlement from his employers that is the plot's turning point. With his stolen money, Hurstwood and Carrie escape to New York, he to ultimate destitution, she to stardom on the stage. All this is interesting but terribly dry, like flowers pressed in a book. The main problem in &quot;Sister Carrie&quot; is Carrie herself, who's such a passive character it's difficult to feel much for her. Even her success in the theatre seems to just sort of happen. (But, a reader may ask, if Carrie is so boring, how does she become a popular star? Well, turn on prime time TV for ten minutes and there's your answer.) Of course, there is no guarantee that Carrie's alluring situation is going to last -- I kept thinking of Evelyn Nesbit Thaw -- and Dreiser only hints at the fine line between stage work and prostitution a century ago. &quot;Sister Carrie&quot; is worth reading because it's a serious novel of life in a dichotomous society. Dreiser details with equal skill the drudgery of daily toil (not to mention the search for daily toil) and the glittering pursuits of those who can afford Michigan Boulevard and Fifth Avenue. If his style seems a little -- well, ponderous -- it should be remembered he was writing strictly from the brain. Dreiser really seemed to have no warm sympathy for the vagaries of capitalism."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"It's a shame such a great novel has been digitized so poorly.

It's depressing, not cathartic. So it's depressing for no reason. They should attach a packet of Prozac to the last page. The characters are hopeless. You actually wind up rooting for Carrie, just because there is no one else to root for. The book is SO pompous and chauvenist, I could barely stand it. Every female in the story is either cold and materialistic, or young, materialistic and stupid. I haven't encountered such blatant sexism in a &quot;classic&quot; since Howell's &quot;Editha.&quot; I will say, though, that Dreiser's actual writing talent is incredible, he has a mystical and dark way with words; too bad he had to waste it on this. My life actually would have been better without reading this."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"Theodore Dreiser is considered to be the leading American practitioner of Naturalism--which consists of writing about sex and violence in the lower classes in order to reveal what I gather were supposed to be shattering truths about the bleak aspects of modern industrial urban life. To that end, Sister Carrie tells the story of a pretty small town girl who uses her feminine wiles to sleep her way from the factories and saloons of Chicago to the New York stage. Along the way, the tavern owning married man who stole to fund their escape to Chicago, kills himself after being abandoned by Carrie and ending up in Bowery flophouses. Meanwhile, An American Tragedy tells the story, based on a sensational true crime, of a young man who is working his way towards the American dream and refuses to let a pregnant former girlfriend stand in the way of his chance for romance with a wealthy woman. He takes the slattern out in a boat &amp; clobbers her, but is tried and executed for the crime.It is an open secret that even critics who admire Dreiser, consider him to be a horrible writer technically. American Tragedy has been called &quot;the worst-written great novel in the world&quot; and the otherwise loathsome Garrison Keillor has an amusing column about how bad he finds Sister Carrie on rereading it. His books have all the literary grace of the phone book.Thus, his reputation rests solely on the agreement of Left wing critics with his hatred of American capitalism. Well, 100 years on, I think we can safely say that the American system has served us pretty well and the Sister Carrie's of the world are not simply insignificant but, worse for a writer, uninteresting.GRADE: F"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"THIS IS POSITIVELY ONE OF THE WORST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ - AND I WOULD NEVER HAVE READ IT IF I DIDN'T HAVE TO FOR A SCHOOL PROJECT.

The scariest part of this book was how he chose to end his life, after bad mistakes and dreams. The total American life, taking its toll on the ones that haven't been able to handle success."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"Theodore Dreiser, more than any other novelist of the first half of the twentieth century,captured the brutish, corrupting power of large American cities, particularly Chicago, and most notably in Sister Carrie, based on the personal experiences of his older sister. Dreiser, like Stephen Crane whose body of work preceded Carrie by only a few years,was repelled but strangely drawn to the underbelly of large, impersonal urban centers beckoning young writers from the hinterland. In the case of Stephen Crane who consorted with the demimonde of New York's Lower East Side, and may in fact harbored desires of becoming one of the lost souls he portrayed, Dreiser observes the city with the dispassionate and clinically detached eye of a surgeon. He is interested in the social forces that compel man; Hurstwood's fumbling, faint-hearted attempt to remove money from his employer's safe only to have the safe door slam shut at the moment he begins to reconsider the consequences of his actions, suggests that man is powerless before the &quot;larger forces&quot; of nature which is a persistent theme found in Dreiser's best work. Sister Carrie and American Tragedy are representative novels of ambition, lust, greed,and envy in all its corrupting excess. The final scenes of Hurstwood shambling through the darkened streets of Manhattan during a raging blizzard, are among the most powerful and thought provoking images to be found in all of literature. A tour de force from one of America's greatest novelists, albeit one of its most politically Quixotic."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"I liked the literature aspect of this book and the picutre it presented from that period of time in US.

There can be no veiled gesture, no muted note, no conversational tone, in either discussion of the work in consideration, or in the work itself. Americans, eternal children that they are, in a cultural sense, will only be satisfied by the very biggest big-top, the grandstanding-est grandstand, the three-ringiest of three ring affairs. At this point, whatever P.T. Barnum quote springs to mind first may be mentally inserted by you, dear reader.Seen through such eyes -- that is, the wide-eyed ones of the American Child -- something like \\"Sister Carrie\\" may very well be \\"The Great American Novel.\\" For certainly, no one has ever painted the themes of MONEY, SEX, and CLASS, with a broader brush, or heavier strokes. Flannery O'Connor says that when Henry James received a manuscript that he did not like, he would return it to the sender with the remark, \\"You have chosen a good subject and are treating it in a straightforward manner.\\" The poor dolt on the receiving end of such a critique would go away thinking that his effort had been praised, unaware that the good subject is never properly disposed of in a straightforward manner. James's remark is particularly apropos of Dreiser's manner, which is straightforward in the way that a charging bull is so. Along the way, he shatters all of the china in the shop, crunching the medium-sized pieces into smaller ones under his massive heels. There is little or no art in his approach, and much of the book feels like \\"chaff\\".It particularly drags in those sections where he describes a single action by a character over the course of tens, or dozens, of pages. Two particularly egregious examples are Carrie's initial search for work, and then Hirstwood's subsequent search to the same end later in the book. Both of these episodes, although they are important to character development, could have had the same impact at about a third to a half of their unedited length. This same comment could be leveled at the work as a whole.In all, it is not surprising that Dreiser's reputation has shed much of the bloat that his novels never will."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"I finished it last weekend, it is not that difficult to read word wise but after you read it you have to digest all they Dreiser is saying. He is sending many messages through the plot that I realized at the end, you could really discuss the book forever because (published in 1900) it deals with all of the many changes in society.Some think of Carrie as a heroine but I dont think so. I did not really like her throughout the book until the end because she is sort of punished in a way (dont want to spoil it). She really was not proactive and destoryed almost everyone in her path.I like how sometimes at the end of chapters and at the ednd of the tome Dreiser will generally speak about the message he is deliverering.IF YOU ARE VACILLATING on wether (sp?) to read this or not, question your motives and what type of lit you like.

Yes, times were difficult for a single woman who had to go it alone; I will give that point. However, I don't see that as excuse to throw morality out the door, to use and be used by other people, and be constantly on the prowl for somebody better or more, prettier \\"things\\". I had a dislike of Carrie from early on. Dreiser repeatedly tries to portray her as a little country innocent when she was, in fact, a shallow, dull, weak-minded but evidently physically attractive woman. She uses her sister then dumps her; she uses her first \\"live in\\" boyfriend, then dumps him for a married man; she uses the married man but is on the lookout for another. She is always looking for happiness by latching on to someone else's money and finery. Wouldn't you know it, she manages to become a self-supporting actress after using everybody along the way. Oh, but she is innocent and naive the whole time--yeah right. Dreiser uses Carrie as a vehicle to attempt to show capitalism as being vulgar, selfish, and self-destructing. If Carrie were typical, he would have a point.The book is a little over-the-top, in my opinion. Carrie is just too pretty, too \\"innocent\\"; the men are incredibly stupid to be lead around by the nose by this creature.

It is a study in cause and effect -- how a character's environment, or change of environment, affects his or her values, especially with regard to money and the iniquity it brings.18-year-old Caroline &quot;Carrie&quot; Meeber, bored with her life in a small Wisconsin town, comes to Chicago in 1889 to live with her sister Minnie. The only employment she can get is a laborious, low-paying job in a shoe factory, and when she loses it and wears out her welcome with her sister's family, a well-to-do young man named Charles Drouet, whom she met on the train to Chicago, sets her up in an apartment where they pretend to be married.Drouet has a friend named George Hurstwood, a man in his late thirties and the manager at a local upscale bar. Hurstwood's home life is stagnant and empty; he has a self-centered wife whom he ceased loving long ago and two materialistic children around Carrie's age. He is going through what many decades later would be called a midlife crisis.Through Drouet, Hurstwood meets Carrie and they form a mutual attraction. Unlike Drouet, to whom life is all about social status, Hurstwood does not patronize Carrie; he makes her feel intelligent and important, and Carrie exhibits Hurstwood's ideals of youth and beauty. When Hurstwood's wife gets wise to her husband's affair and sues him for divorce, Hurstwood succumbs to the temptation to steal money from his employer and tricks Carrie into leaving Chicago with him. They go to New York and experience curious reversals of fortune -- Carrie becomes a rich and famous showgirl while Hurstwood drifts into inescapable poverty and a bitter end.This is no Cinderella story for Carrie. It may seem like she is being rewarded for her innocence and integrity, but since she realizes that her success is more the result of luck than talent, her new life is not as fulfilling as she thought it might be. I found myself surprisingly engaged by the story because Dreiser presents his characters as real people with unsolvable problems and doesn't try to teach a morality lesson. I finished the novel feeling miserable about the world, which is not something that many novels can do to me. My only complaint is that Dreiser's prose is a little awkward and excessively wordy without the benefit of clarity; it longs for the smoother touch of D.H. Lawrence or Somerset Maugham."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"Dreiser describes the psyche and actions of Carrie Meeber, a young woman trying to succeed in the late nineteenth century in America, and others she meets to show the struggle of young women trying to succeed in the newly industrialized America. When Dreiser first published Sister Carrie, his publisher censored the book due to its shocking content. Dreiser unfortunately has a tendency to ramble about some topics. Although Dreiser uses lengthy descriptions at times, he still manages to get across the horrible injustices that befell many Americans during this time. The book seems to revolve around chance. Although Dreiser shows the inevitability in the characters' lives and that everything led to death, he also shows that much of the events occurred by chance. The characters meet each other by chance, and the events that lead to Carrie's downfall happened by chance. Dreiser shows the world he lived in to the reader. Everything in the book is not random chance. It accurately displays life at that time in America. Dreiser took his story from Horatio Alger. Alger told of virtuous and ambitious men, however. Dreiser took a woman and allowed her to succeed. This added to the shock value of the novel. Another novel of shock value during this industrialization period is The Jungle by Upton Sinclair. This novel showed the horrors of the meat-packing industry. Sister Carrie spent some time exploiting sweat shops although that was not the primary focus of the novel. However, if one likes Sister Carrie, The Jungle would be a good book to read to learn more of the lives of the working class during the industrialization period in American history."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"Achieving happiness through worldly goods is a mistake that is often made in society today. In his novel, Sister Carrie, Theodore Dreiser explores this situation. Dreiser uses many different symbols, themes, and contrasts to teach the moral lesson that happiness lies not in worldly goods, especially when achieved by immoral means. Drieser beautifully states the cycle of Carrie's emotions, which involve first Carrie's aspirations, then her achievement, and then her unhappiness, which makes her aspire to do more. This cycle repeats throughout the novel, and through this cycle Carrie systematically climbs up the social ladder. Therefore, Carrie is the embodiment of the &quot;American Dream&quot; of rags-to-riches which was prevalent in the late 1800's. Dreiser also explores the idea that too much of a longing for something leads to disaster, but desire for the unknown or for improvement is hope, innocence or even a form of redemption. This contrast is shown later in the novel between Carrie and Hurstwood. Dreiser's main point in the novel is a contrast between material goods and true happiness or fulfilment. Because of Dreiser's beautifully created characters, the book has a sense of true reality due to the characteristics of each person in the novel. Carrie is susceptible to bribes, while Hurstwood is the typical working-class husband. Dreiser recounts the contrast of Hurstwood's decline into utter poverty and Carrie's rise to stardom, which becomes a central irony of the book. These two characters, along with all of the rest, are very easy to relate to and help to create a more powerful story. This book is a must read for anyone who enjoys stories of the past and of the struggle of women to find their place in society. This is without a doubt one of my favorite novels. The powerful reality and moral lesson of the story made a lasting impact."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"This book was a lesson in the journey from poor to rich and how even though moving up the ladder of success, Sister Carrie never achieved the peace and happiness she thought success and money would bring.

The year is 1889. \\"She was eighteen years of age, bright, timid and full of the illusions of ignorance and youth.\\"Carrie is soon overwhelmed by the difficulty of finding work, especially since she has no previous experience as a wage earner. When she finally does get a job on an assembly line at a shoe factory for $3.50 per week, she is exhausted by long hours of standing and poor working conditions. \\"Not the slightest provision had been made for the comfort of the employees, the idea being that something was gained by giving them as little as possible.\\" \\"The wash rooms and lavatories were disagreeable, crude, if not foul places, and the whole atmosphere was one of hard contract.\\"Carrie does well in spite of these hardships, but she must pay her sister's husband almost her entire salary for her room and board. With winter coming and the chill winds of a Chicago autumn upon her, Carrie has no money for a coat, hat, nor even an umbrella. She is absolutely wretched. Then she meets a young salesman, Charles Drouet, whom she had become slightly acquainted with on the train to the city. She is eventually tricked into living with him - seduced by his offers of marriage, and the economic security and comparative independence he provides her. She is still a girl and is motivated by impulses and her passive, overly trusting nature.Carrie makes another serious mistake when she allows herself to be deceived a second time by a well-to-do, married saloon manager twice her age, Mr. Hurstwood. Drouet, showing off, had introduced Carrie to his socially superior friend, and also thought to shine in Hurstwood's eyes by presenting him to his attractive, young \\"wife.\\"Disillusioned after a few years with Drouet, who loves her in his fashion but has proved to be irresponsible and flighty, Carrie believes Hurstwood to be single and herself to be in love with him. Hurstwood, a respectable gentleman who has never been a philanderer, is himself quite enamored with Carrie - enough to leave his family. He persuades her to flee Chicago and move with him to New York. He does this by outright lying to the young woman in his desperation to have her.Given the period when the novel was published and the morality and mores of the time, \\"Sister Carrie\\" was not only poorly received, the novel scandalized polite society. The heroine, a young woman who comes to the city, forms two out-of-wedlock relationships, eventually becomes successful in her own right, rising to fame and respectability. She is rewarded rather than punished for her moral lapses.Originally a newspaperman, Theodore Dreiser writes with a blunt journalistic style. In \\"Sister Carrie\\" and his other work, he deals with the gritty reality of life and is known as an outstanding representative of naturalism - a movement in literature and the arts where real life subjects are portrayed as they exist in the real world - with all their blemishes and defects.I originally read \\"Sister Carrie\\" 25 years ago and thought to revisit it when I found it in one of my book trunks. I loved the novel back then, but now I really appreciate what a great American novel this is. The characters are outstanding in their depth and realism. The story is compelling, and the portrait of American life as seen through Dreiser's eyes is exceptional. Highly recommended!JANA"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"Sister Carrie is probably best known for being the American example of the Naturalist school of writing. Centering around Carrie, a girl who comes to Chicago to live the good life in the big city, it follows her action from being a factory worker, to a 'companion', to a housewife, and finally to fame and fortune on the stage in New York City.Dreiser sets the measure of the game early, on the first page, with the statement that all women are provided two options in life. One is to work hard, live, and have children. The other is to fall into a life of sin.For those who don't hold with that line of reasoning, the book will be a bit hard to swallow. Dreiser operates along the same line of logic that Emile Zola set down when creating this genre. Every action Carrie makes is predestined, in Dreiser's eyes, by her surroundings. She will not and cannot make any decision contrary to her 'nature'.While this is all very well and good for Dreiser, it is not so for Naturalism. Thomas Hardy's famous Tess, and Jude, make decisions contrary to their nature all the time, it is society that is at odds with the characters and not the other way around. Carrie's society seems perfectly willing to accept her, but it is her decisions that one finds appalling. The feeling is more like being on a careening freight train, with the outcome inevitable and predestined but terrible nonetheless. There is none of the same despair and void that one finds in Hardy, and somehow that is the books biggest flaw.Hardy's novels, that were written a full forty years before Sister Carrie, explore naturalism in such a way as to make the character the hero and society the villain. Dreiser's Carrie is no such hero, she is just the unfortunate victim of circumstance."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"Maybe I'm just not as unforgiving as the other reviewers, but I found this edition to read just fine. Yes, there were a few errors, but not nearly as many as the other reviewers claimed. Aside from that, it's a great piece of literature from that era. It is a story of life in the factories of late 19th century Chicago, a story of an \\"immoral\\" girl being taken care of by men to escape the factory life, and the misery she caused them. Evidently, this book was considered scandalous in its day, as Carrie never suffers any consequences for her immorality. A good read."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"A girl named Carrie moves from Wisconsin to Chicago to become something. She gets in a love triangle with two men--the kind, but \\"inferior\\" Charles Drouet and the worldly, wealthy George Hurstwood. Carrie picks one of the two, and we see a reverse of good fortune. Carrie rises in society while her significant other, through a series of bad decisions, falls in society. Carrie uses these men to get what she wants, but I wouldn't exactly call her a maneater. Through failure and success and exposure to harsh reality, Carrie matures and toughens. She grows; though some may argue she becomes a worse person, not a better one.This was Theodore Dreiser's first novel. It is a very good story and a very easy read.Sister Carrie also delves into the cutthroat conditions of the late 1890's. The ease at which someone became homeless and was at the mercy of other people's compassion was very scary. This book made me deathly afraid of becoming homeless. I can't tell you how paranoid I was. Some people seem to think everyone who is homeless asked for it by being lazy or indulging in bad habits. But if we realized how quickly good fortune could change, maybe we could be a little more sensitive and sympathetic to people who find themselves on the street. It could easily be us: even those of us who aren't stupid or frivolous with our money."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"Sister Carrie, by Theodore Dreiser, is, in short, the tale of a small-town country girl's attempts to rise to aristocracy in the cutthroat world of the early 20th century. After many adventures, and some trials and tribulations, Carrie does find the affluence and financial success that she desired more than anything else in the world - but there is more to it than that.Carrie from the beginning seems to be the very emblem of a consumer driven materialistic society, and there seems to be no doubt about this as the book continues on. She seems possessed by the inanimate, and seems to completely disregard anything other than the right clothes, the right place to work, and her appearance. Carrie is seemingly vapid, and, as she struggles to \\"make it\\" by letting Drouet take care of her and give her his money, she hardly acknowledges the fact that he has helped pull her out of poverty. Once she is able, she throws him away in order to be with Hurstwood, a man of even more wealth and connection. However, it needs to be said that Carrie is not stupid. As materialistic and shallow as she seems to be, she is intriguing nonetheless. She knows how to get what she wants, how to manipulate others into giving her what she wants, and there is something about her that even the men of the novel seem to find irresistible. She is most definitely worth a deeper analysis.The fact remains, however, that none of the characters seem likeable. They all lack depth, don't seem to have agency, and remain basically static throughout the entirety of the novel. But this is brilliance on Dreiser's part, because it seems to serve as a commentary of the society in which the characters are a part. They seem to perfectly represent a world which also seems to lack in depth and focuses solely on exterior, surface-level qualities.Dreiser's novel is a powerful and accurate portrayal of a materialistic society and the ways in which living such a shallow life can ultimately lead to the downward spiral and complete end of a person, like Hurstwood, or the forever unfulfilled and never-quite-satisfied attitude of Carrie's. But Beware: the prose tends to positively drag in many places, mostly through the middle section of the book, moving at an almost ridiculously slow pace. Nonetheless, it is still worth the time."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"This equisite novel quickly worked its way onto my favorite books of all time list, ranking among Anna Karenina. Hurstwood's character reminded me much of a male version of Anna, and I believe Dreiser did an EXCELLENT job at writing his demise. The novel drips irony off every page. Hurstwood and Carrie have more or less switched social positions by the end of the novel. In order to understand the full value of the novel, and why it is so daring and ahead of its time, the reader MUST remove himself from today's time period. I compare this novel to Anna Karenina because much like Tolstoy wrote of Anna's demise in society, Dreiser writes of Hurstwood's demise in society: the new industrial America. On the other hand, Carrie was achieving unspeakable status all on her own. This was unheard of by a woman at the turn of the century.The second half of the novel Dreiser develops the theme of chance, and how it led Carrie, Hurstwood, and Drouet to where they are in life. Unfortunately, he does not ever return to Carrie's sister. I would have liked to learn a little more about her and her family as well as where times took them.Dreiser also explores Carrie's fascination with materialism. Probably one of my favorite parts of the novel was when Carrie realized money wouldn't buy her happiness. Here Dreiser reflects Camus' ideas of happiness versus reality. No matter what she bought, it was never enough, and Carrie was never able to achieve the happiness she dreamed of. &quot;In your rocking-chair, by your window, shall you dream such happiness as you may never feel.&quot;All in all, this book is an excellent read. Anyone wishing to find a book to fall in love with-- the characters, the setting, plot, etc.-- this book is a must. It is an easy and quick read filled with much more than what merely appears on the surface. Sister Carrie is a story of love, deceit, greed, violence, and much more. Definitely read it."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"I readAn American Tragedymany years ago. I do not remember very much about it. I remember that it moved me, but that I forgot it quickly. Sister Carrie is my second book by Dreiser.I was dreading the book, at least a little bit. It seems to be universally damned with faint praise. I have heard readers describe the prose as awkward and overblown. I remember a Salon column snarking about it some years ago. I have heard that Dreiser's prose improved with the other novels, and have been told that it was possible to skip Carrie. And so on.I loved it. That's a little bit lacking in nuance-- there *were* places that I got the criticism. At times I might have wished for other pacing. It has little flaws in the execution, and I suspect that you have to be able to swallow Dreiser's overall style. He's not lithe and little and zippy. His writing is sort of like a hoop skirt-- elegant from some angles, ponderous from others, not really very practical all around.This said, I have rarely read a novel that treats so very well with character in time and place. Caroline Meeber is the kind of woman I find utterly unsympathetic. Her literary heirs generally fill me with irritation and vague revulsion, no matter how sympathetically portrayed. You know what I mean-- the lovely young animal, the woman who wants but doesn't think, the actress. Dreiser does a remarkable thing. He doesn't really make her sympathetic, exactly, but he makes her understandable. He makes a type of person who rarely seems human very human indeed. And a product of her time. The book is as much about the fragility of success in the early industrial era as it is about the individuals involved. Carrie comes through the mill unhappy but unscathed. George Hurstwood breaks himself in the traps of the time, forgetting that by serving the wealthy he does not actually become invincible. Terrible and true.I believe that the strength with character in the text outweighs any flaws in the prose style. Perhaps I will be less impressed with a later reading, but right now, I would recommend it.(Sister Carrie has an odd publishing background, by the way. There are several published versions of the book. I read the Penguin Classics unexpurgated version, and it seems to make a real difference if you get the earlier published versions which Dreiser self-censored in order to get the book printed. If in doubt, take a quick look--not enough to spoil your ending!-- at the last few pages. If it ends with Carrie, you've got a bowdlerized edition. If it ends with Hurstwood, you've got one of the unexpurgated or repaired editions. I found the foreword of my edition by Alfred Kazin helpful in understanding the publishing history.)"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"hello all, my review for this book is based entirely on the quality of this text, not on the novel/story. Sister Carrie is a masterpiece and should be read by all, but this particular text is horrendous. The words \\"though\\" and \\"thoughT\\" are used interchangeably, words are left out of sentences, periods are placed randomly in the middle of sentences, and there are even instances where sections are repeated (i.e. six lines are followed by the exact six lines).If you want to enjoy the Sister Carrie that Dresier wrote, do not buy this edition! You will be disappointed. Please order a text from a different publisher."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"\\"Increase of material comforts, it may be generally laid down, does not in any way whatsoever conduce to moral growth.\\" Mahatma Gandhi\\"She (Carrie Meeber) wanted pleasure, she wanted position, and yet she was confused as to what these things might be.\\" p. 145 \\"Sister Carrie\\"Critics may scoff at the immorality of the main characters, the persistently subtle, yet always stinging slams at the evils of Capitalism, or how depressing the novel is. But despite it all, my interest never waned from the first page to the last. Yes, Dreiser's super-duper liberal (although liberal back in 1900 is a tad different than what we consider liberal today), but this man could sure write beautifully! At times, he's almost a poet, as I found myself reading some sentences and paragraphs two to three times over for their sublime brilliance.Dreiser's prose is both honest and brave. He develops his characters beautifully, at a slow, methodic pace, carefully unraveling the mysterious air of each of the three main characters until the very last pages. Yes, he's iconoclastic. Yes, he gets a bit too preachy toward the end of the novel. Yes, he's a bit dark and discouraging. Yes he's a bit too liberal for many folks. And yes, his bitter, but many times brilliant observations are a tad too cluttered with sarcasm and irony. Yet for me, I just couldn't put this one down, nor forget about it when I finally did.Carrie, Carrie, Carrie ... it is so easy for all of us to sit back and judge you. You slept your way to the top in many people's eyes. You sold your soul to become successful in our material world. Yet most people who have become successful in our society have led far worse lives than Dreiser's \\"Sister Carrie\\" and many of them are lionized. We have to ask ourselves, is it our jealous, judgmental nature that makes many of us go tisk-tisk about the lack of this gal's morals? My glass house is waaaay too thin to do this. Yet, I do not advocate in any way, shape or form using others to get what you want in life. The pursuit of materialism should never mean the sacrifice of one's ethics, morals and values. However, I do believe that Carrie was coming to this realization toward the end of the novel. In order to not disclose too much to those who haven't read this yet, I will say no more.As I stated above, this classic definitely isn't without its imperfections. If you are a staunch conservative, there's a good chance this writer will irk you a bit. I also thought Dreiser was a bit too harsh in regards to the fate of the book's male protagonist, perhaps punishing him for being the quintessential all-American, conservative Capitalist that he represented early on. He also is a writer who tends to be idealistic to a fault, getting way too preachy and sanctimonious for most of us mere, marred mortals to handle at times.Overall though, I really, really dug this classic novel. This is the first time I have read Dreiser, and I greatly admire his compelling, penetrative style. The story is well written, no real action, very little plot, mostly a character study of some very realistic people whom we all have known in life. The beauty of this simplistic story is the way it plays on just about every emotion imaginable, which made it for me, never a dull moment.I loved it. 5 Stars!"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie: A novel","review":"Sister Carrie is my favorite novel of all time. I have read it at least twenty times in the past sixteen years. I'll spare you the literary review, which I'm sure you can read anywhere, and tell you why it still holds interest for the modern reader.Theodore Dreiser's attention to detail was definitely one of his major strengths as a writer. I've always found the details of late 1800's Chicago and New York fascinating in this novel. If you are particularly interested in this time period, you may want to read this novel for the everyday historical details alone.The coming-of-age theme is also one that modern readers can relate to, even though Carrie is from a different time. She leaves behind her small town and her family at the age of eighteen and is dazzled by city life. We can all relate to the degradation and desperation she feels as she seeks out her first job, and her desire for independence. Ultimately, she is successful, at least in a material sense, and the journey the reader follows her on is engaging.I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but I would highly recommend Sister Carrie. I have read most of Dreiser's other novels and several of his short stories. This is by far the best of his works, in my humble opinion."},{"Title":"The Temp Worker's Guide To Self-Fulfillment: How to Slack Off, Achieve Your Dreams, and Get Paid for It!","review":"This book is quite a mixed bag.Its description of temporary office work is completely accurate: the enormous egos, the cold receptions, and the days of boredom. It is a funny, light-hearted look at below-entry-level office life, which outlines its bad parts (no respect, little security, no benefits) and its good (quick cash, little responsibility, free time to pursue your own goals).Where I start to have problems is in the 'advice' sections, which make up about half the book. Some of it is good, like taking office supplies within reason and lying on your resume. His tips on dealing with large temp factory-agencies is great.However, When he tells you to steal unused equipment that is lying around, I wanted to laugh. If you work for an organisation of any size, you are a fool to think that their stuff isn't inventoried, and that you are not being watched on camera. Most office buildings have camera surveillance, sometimes very extensively.I found the section where he mentions becoming a sexual predator to the young, insecure temp-worker population particularly repugnant."},{"Title":"The Temp Worker's Guide To Self-Fulfillment: How to Slack Off, Achieve Your Dreams, and Get Paid for It!","review":"I wish I had this book when I was temping...it's right on the money, and I laughed my _____ bottom off.

The author of the book makes some good points such as telling the types of Microsoft Word skills and Microsoft Excel skills that could possibly get you some temporary work and possibly help you out long-term in the work world. I also agree with him that as an outsider on a temporary assignment that you could more clearly and more objectively see the company you're working at than they could see themselves. However, he doesn't mention certain particular drawbacks of temporary work such as the absurdity of having to go out for long interviews for short-term jobs (even as short as one day) with client companies before you get hired. He also doesn't mention that some temporary staffing services deliberately mislead job-seekers by putting in ads for non-existent jobs to build up a pool of people or to bait and switch.

Its potential for life saving or life extending advances may cause far reaching social upheaval.His views are a good counterpoint to much hype about technology. Naturally, he cannot resist remarking on the Y2K imbroglio. How this was largely puffed up in an echo of the dot com and telco zeitgeist.

So I was extremely happy to see one of his best series translated into English. Unfortunately, a cartoon is still considered as something for kids in majority of people in the States. If you are one of them, please consider Tezuka manga (comics) as a new media, novels drawn in pictures. It is a new media that enables you to enjoy a story without sitting in front of a TV, or saving your time to go to a cinema, or taking less than half of your time to read a novel. Once again, this is not for small kids. This story deals with some deep issues, such as meaning of life."},{"Title":"Black Jack, Vol. 1","review":"This is my first Tezuka series and I'm really enjoying reading through these volumes (I'm on vol. 3 as of this review). I enjoy manga series that have lots of short stories involving many different characters with the same main character at the core to tie everything together. And obviously Black Jack does just this since I bothered mentioning this. These stories put its characters into serious situations (usually a matter of life or death) and their response to the situation show the best and worst of humans. I also enjoy that bit by bit we learn more and more about Doctor Black Jack. At first I was a bit put off by the art style, but now I'm really fond of it. I'd recommend Black Jack, I look forward to trying other Tezuka series but I have a feeling Black Jack will remain my favorite. But perhaps Phoenix will give Black Jack a run for its money that I'm not expecting ;) With regard to the book itself, I have no complaints about the cover, binding, or quality of paper so far. Each volume is jam packed and very fullfilling."},{"Title":"Black Jack, Vol. 1","review":"I have been a Tezuka fan since long, but this is the first time I buy a manga (comic book), and the first time I get to know the character of Black Jack.I really recommend this one for mature readers, since the topics are adult oriented and hard to take for children.

The storyline is very powerful and it unfolds more than just single story about a doctor of divine skills. It is about the medical case he gets involved with, the ethical questions that he faces and the contrast of feelings and emotions spread through out Black Jack's life.You get to experience the doctor's struggle with his own illness, his direct experience of failure to save doctor Honma, who was his savior and mentor. Yes, this manga is not at all about doctor and patients and their operations. It's about friendship and love, about perseverance and hard work, about evil and repercussion.It's just too good to be true. I will be buying every single volume of this manga on Amazon. Thank you, Osamu Tezuka sensei."},{"Title":"Black Jack, Vol. 1","review":"I would recommend this book both to people who are Tezuka fans and to people who are new to Tezuka's work. This volume contains twelve relatively short self-contained stories, so it might be a good choice for those who don't want to commit to reading one of the longer Tezuka stories like Phoenix or Buddha. I also think that this would be a good choice for people new to Tezuka's work because it's an example of his gritter, harder-edged work that shows that there's much more to Osamu Tezuka than Astro Boy or Kimba the White Lion (I enjoy Tezuka's more child-oriented works too, but they express only a very limited concept of what Tezuka was all about).I should point out that if you're looking for anything like a realistic medical drama here, you're going to be disappointed (On the other hand, wouldn't the medical dramas on tv be more fun if they had doctors who could throw scalpels like ninja throwing stars?). Black Jack is set in \\"Tezuka-land,\\" not the \\"real world,\\" so there's a fair amount of pseudoscience and a few really oddball bits that might make you ask, \\"Was this really written by a guy who was a doctor?\\"Tezuka's storytelling techniques might seem a little strange at first (He has a tendency to throw in jokes and visual gags at seemingly inappropriate moments, which might frustrate some readers, but I'm starting to look at it almost like a Brechtian \\"distancing\\" or \\"alienation\\" technique), but I think that this volume gives readers a glimpse of what a unique talent Tezuka was (I consider Tezuka to be one of the masters of world comics, not just Japanese comics). More importantly, I think that these are highly entertaining stories that fans of comics (or \\"sequential art\\" or whatever highfalutin' term you prefer) are likely to enjoy."},{"Title":"Black Jack, Vol. 1","review":"My biggest problem with the Astro Boy comics sold in the U.S. was that the art was mirrored, and I felt kind of betrayed by that. I really love Tezuka's art style and I try really hard to learn from it, I feel maybe looking at the art backwards makes it more difficult to get where Tezuka was coming from. It's nitpicky, but nice to know before buying, which I didn't know when I bought Astro Boy.. So Black Jack is NOT MIRRORED. It is in it's original format, but chapters are extremely out of order and it makes it very irritating, something I didn't even know until I finished all books. It really ruined the experience for me!But the chapters are out of order for a reason. For someone who is picking up the series without knowing anything about Tezuka, or Black Jack, or anything, that's why it's out of order; The most grabbing chapters at the beginning, so you get sucked in and won't get bored before better chapters come along.With that out of the way, let me review the book and story itself.I never read a Tezuka comic before Black Jack. Thinking before I read Black Jack is difficult. I had a completely different mindset, I was absolutely terrified by doctors or even the thought that there was blood and guts and all these gross things inside us, I was completely determined never to even consider becoming anything remotely similar to being a doctor, always saying, \\"What a horrible job they must have! They must hate it, having to deal with all those horrible and gross things!\\"However, after reading Black Jack, absolutely everything about that mindset changed almost immediately. I love the series so much and it has even inspired me to start shooting for a medical PhD. All my fears of insides are eliminated, I'm more fascinated by them than terrified. When I read the book in the living room and start small-talking about it with my family, they usually have the same reaction I did, \\"Ewww! That's horrifying! That's disgusting! Why would you want to read that!?\\"It's very obvious, however, that Black Jack is Sci-fi. Tezuka does a great job at making ridiculous things seem real, and when ridiculous goes just slightly over the top, it makes you laugh a lot. Black Jack, as a character, feels more real to me than most comic book protagonists. He's selfish, he's out for nothing more than revenge, he has massive mood swings with his adopted daughter (At one point spoiling her with money, at another yelling at her for having selfish thoughts.) You could say this is bad character writing, but on the other hand, Black Jack is extremely humanitarian. He goes through all hell, even reviving bodies that have been dead for a long while, pushing and yelling at everyone who tells him that it's useless, and he succeeds almost every time, and when he has to face that he can't save somebody because their time has come, he steams into a tear-filled breakdown. Black Jack is real, he's messed up. He's blunt. He is unpredictable, but predictable. He's human, especially for his traumatizing backstory.Even though Black Jack as a story is dark, creepy, and horrifying, it's goofy, light-hearted, and funny. Black Jack's interactions with his adopted daughter, Pinoko, is extremely cute. This story is so well-written, but still knows it's cartoony, and takes full advantage of it. It manages to take Micky Mouse and examines his anatomy. I remember one chapter where two characters were all over eachother kissing, and as the scene went on, the woman casually swallowed the man's head, but it was never really acknowledged in dialogue.I wouldn't really recommend this to young children, it definitely has an 'M' rating. There's a chapter about a teacher and a delinquent who uses some pretty awful language, also naked women's chests, but it's not there for sex appeal. (It would be quite irritating if Tezuka had to censor women's breasts when Black Jack has to operate by cutting open their chests all the time. Be reasonable.)I also bought this with school money, with the excuse that I'd learn lots of medical stuff. I did!! But a lot I had to look up on Wikipedia to keep on track with what they were talking about, sometimes. The story is still totally understandable without knowing, however!I give it a three-star rating for that chapter rearrangement, otherwise a solid 5/5 10/10 100/100."},{"Title":"Black Jack, Vol. 1","review":"I had a series of Black Jack books when I was under 12 (almost 30 years before).

He single-handedly made Manga respectable after WWII and pioneered the use of cinematic techniques.

He has his flaws, such as his scarred face, and his greed for money, which at this point in the series we don't really understand.Each chapter of this book has a separate tale of Black Jack which is self-contained. Usually there is a moral to the story, or a message about life, but many times Tezuka just sets out to entertain us.In this volume, we learn how Black Jack \\"created\\" Pinoko, his little sidekick who thinks she is his \\"wife.\\" This is an obvious allusion to Pinnochio- instead of a wood-worker creating a child, he is a super-physician, creating a girl out of human organs.

The surgeries aren't particularly gory, but you get the point of what's going on.This is my introduction to Tezuka, and I really liked his surgical hero.Favorite story:Sometimes like pearls.Highly recommended, especially if you like medical stuff, House MD, or just interesting stories that are slightly odd but engaging."},{"Title":"Black Jack, Vol. 1","review":"Years ago, I saw a Japanese friend's collection of Black Jack in Japanese.

Thus, Black Jack. I was first introduced to Tezuka through Ode to Kirihito, and thus this more traditional manga came as something of a surprise to me; it has the usual episodic feel of manga (not surprisingly, given that they're usually published in installment form in magazines before being collected into single-title books like this one).In this initial installment, we simply meet our main character, Black Jack, a brilliant but disbarred doctor who continues to practice anyway, charging exorbitant fees in order to offset his black-market status. It becomes obvious fairly quickly that there's much more to Black Jack than meets the eye, but that's for later volumes. A fine start to the series. ***"},{"Title":"Black Jack, Vol. 1","review":"I have mixed feelings about the stories here. They tend to be a bit formulaic in that there tended to be a twist at the end, and I tended to see the twist coming a few pages ahead of time. I like them, but with that part of me that dreads the day I will be absorbed in sci-fis or murder mysteries and will know that I am truly in my dotage. As a smattering of plots, they weren't bad, but they weren't good either.I don't think the point of this book is so much the stories, as it is about building Black Jack as a character with a past and a sidekick. As far as that goes, it unfolded well. We don't learn many facts about him, but we see him respond to ethical dilemmas and face the limits of human biology and what a surgeon can't do even if they are the greatest super hero surgeon in the world. On this level the book is really good."},{"Title":"Black Jack, Vol. 1","review":"As for the Tezuka work, this work has inadvertently become feelingssaid reading neatly until recently neither 'Phoenix' nor 'Buddha' atthe junior high school though it has read willingly why.It was passing this time even if the one made an image might be seenseveral times, reading, starting a short collection this work, andhaving known untouched.Why did it think that read through this book, and is interested in ownfeelings.Only respect where this work made mild is dark remains in theimpression in making to the image when reading and it is reluctant.People who die noisily even if it does with a talented technology oftwenty-one and people whom might not be never saved even if survivingThere is an end that the impression is bad not to endure reading onthe inside, too.Mortality rate..absolutely..life..longevity..extend..empty..save..mind..sad..abstract..theme..surgery..operation..concrete..production..draw..technique..complete..wait.To read through whole volume turning around, time and energy werefairly spent , saying that \\"I was a patient\\" and \\"I am twenty-one\\" bythe scene scene with the impact.There is always an appearance of twenty-one confronted even so thoughit is annoyed by a powerless feeling to the confrontation to thelimit as the life at the same time in such a scene fresh not toendure reading.It says to his of that appearance and the impression that cannot beknown is remembered.Are not you because only this impression is the maximum feature of itof this work?The impression that this work gave became a chance to consider themeaning directly though it might be heard that the role as the doctor(science), the law person (standard), and the religionist (truth) wasoften bases of all roles of the world.Moreover, I think it to be might impression through the refractedhero who demands an unreasonable reward and doesn't brandish an easysense of justice.There was an interesting question \\"Isn't twenty-one an appearance ofMr. Tezuka?\\" in the explanation.Mr. Tezuka seems to be said, \\"After all, it might be a cartoon\\" evenif the work that scoops out the nature of humankind such as 'Phoenix'and 'Buddha' is created having been making twenty-one as unlicensedand there to be an interpretation of sarcasm to the torment of authoritarianism and the preconception that contents put in order are notaccompanied.I thought the idea of having made the hero project a silent criticismto it expecting that the gap of the preconception of cartoon (lowvaluation) that Doctor of Medicine (high appraisal) had written wouldhappen when he who had the title of Doctor of Medicine certainly putout this work to the world to be interesting view."},{"Title":"Black Jack, Vol. 1","review":"A super-hero surgeon seems a pretty unlikely protagonist. but Tezuka pulls it off with his hero Black Jack. Like any proper rouge, Black Jack lives outside the rules of society, sweeping in when his skills are needed and making the corrupt pay for their mis-deeds. Hey, he even wears a cape.Each story manages to set up a situation where a super surgeon is necessary. However, due to Tezuka's fine writing skills, there is a humanist element to each tale, that is often melancholy. Black Jack makes other's happy, but he is rarely happy himself. He cannot taste the forbidden fruit that is peace of mind. Life, death, failure, lost love, childhood and age, these are all the themes presented here. Each story is some sort of morality tale, so the logistics behind the melodrama are not as important.Tezuka's cartoony style can be off-putting to those who are used to more refined Japanese manga artists, but it soon flows into the story and is admired rather than questioned. Those already familiar with Tezuka will find the art here as fine as anything done by the \\"God of Manga.\\"All in all, a really excellent comic. Give it a chance, and you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Black Jack, Vol. 1","review":"BJ is considered to be one of Tezuka's best comics. The whole series consist of twenty-two paperback volumes of short stories. The main character, BJ, is a genius surgeon who practices without a license. Although BJ is an outcast, many people rich and famous are willing to pay top money for his service. Through out the people and events that BJ encountered, Tezuka questions the value of Doctors in the medical systems, the meaning of a qualitative life, and the price of health.update: 9/16/2010 - fans of BJ are in luck. Vertical has published the entire BJ in 12+ volumes. Thank you."},{"Title":"Black Jack, Vol. 1","review":"This is manga at it's greatest! I admit, when I first picked this book and thumbed through the artwork, I had my doubts, but reading the first novel changed my view on Black Jack for good :) Black Jack has to be one of the most engrossing mangas that I have ever read. The storyline of this novel has yet to be surpassed in my mind. The depth of the storyline is fantastic. The stories themselves - although maybe seeing far-fetch at times - always have a great twist or turn. What is most intriguing about the storylines though; and the philosopical and psycological implementations in each story. All events have a good reason - there is no mindless play-fights or brain-knumbing stupidity. Black Jack is written with intelligence and intergrity. Although difficult to explain, Osamu Tezuka has a way off exploring the human interlect, in ways other manga artists cannot. (Many have tried, but never quite made it).To sum it up. Black Jack is for anyone who enjoys a good intelligent story. There is also a good spattering of comedy, (You see Astro Boy hidden in the odd corner, or running out of buildings occasionally!) and raw human emotion. The manga is rendered in Osamu Tezuka's typical loose style, but the characters have a feel of their own.An absolutely fantasic read."},{"Title":"Black Jack, Vol. 1","review":"Cool stories and one cool main character. Strong character designs and crystal-clear storytelling. I hope that more of Tezuka's work gets translated for the U.S. market -- I like his style!"},{"Title":"Black Jack, Vol. 1","review":"Having seen a few episodes of \\"Astro Boy\\" and \\"Kimba The White Lion\\", I never considered the possibility that anime/manga legend Osamu Tezuka was capable of heavier fare. So needless to say I was thrown for a loop when I picked up and leafed through a copy of \\"Black Jack\\" volume 1. It's significantly more mature in theme and story than Tezuka's more notable works, and contains some fairly graphic depictions of surgery. But considering the fact that the books' title character, Black Jack, is the world's most skilled and naturally gifted surgeon, I should've at least semi-expected it.The book contains eight one-shot stories, and have no linkage to each other. Probably the most significant chapter is the one that tells the origin of Black Jack's \\"daughter\\" Pinoco, since she makes appearances in a few subsequent stories. Another significant chapter is the \\"origin\\" of B.J. himself, which tells the story of what inspired him to become a healer, and introduced (and sadly, also bade farewell to) his mentor. But quite possibly the most unusual moment is our hero's reunion with a lost love-an interesting take on the popular manga &amp; anime formula of gender-switching. There's quite a few other offbeat moments inside this tome, which you'll have to read for yourself...Quite a few of the secondary characters depicted in Tezuka's renderings are reminiscent of early Warner Brothers and Hanna-Barbera cartoon shorts, with a little bit of the \\"Speed Racer\\" look thrown in for good measure. For someone who's considered the originator of the modern anime and manga genre, I guess it was only natural that Tezuka had to draw his inspiration from somewhere. It's a rather unusual hybrid of mature storytelling and cartoonish artwork that I found to be a bit off-putting at first, but got used to as I kept reading.The only tiny problem I have with this book is the dialogue. It's a bit clipped and relatively simple,likely due to the complexities involved in the translation of the original Japanese text. When the characters \\"speak\\", they usually get right down to the point and waste few words. As a result, I found this volume to be a pretty quick read. Oh what to do...\`Late"},{"Title":"Black Jack, Vol. 1","review":"How many volumes will there be?This edition of Black Jack has a total of 17 paperback volumes, containing about 12 stories each. It is based on the Japanese 17 volume Akita bunkouban edition.Wait, paperback? so what are those expensive hardback versions?Vertical also published special limited hardback editions of books 1 to 3 in the series. They are limited to 1500 (vol.1) and 1200 (vol.2 & 3) copies and distributed through Diamond to brick and mortar comic-book stores.The difference is not only in the cover, they include three additional stories (one in each) NOT included in the Japanese edition on which the Vertical paperbacks are based. These three stories will not appear in the softcover books. More on this later.Is this The Complete Osamu Tezuka's Black Jack, then?Well, no. Even if you buy all the three hardcovers, the answer is still no. No book edition, including all the Japanese editions so far, includes all Black Jack stories as originally serialized in magazines. Also, not all the book editions omit exactly the same stories. It is a bit messy, actually. More on this later.Why were some stories excluded from the books?In many cases, criticism or controversy about the medical conditions depicted. Some of the stories missing from the books deal with lobotomies, for instance. Or are inaccurate. Or relatives of patients with the disease depicted in a story would complain. Tezuka was very sensitive to all this criticism. In other cases he simply thought the stories weren't good enough to be reprinted in book form.So, how *complete* is this?Very, actually, one of the more complete there is. There are a total of 243 issues of Black Jack. 5 \\"sealed\\" issues where never collected in book editions because they contained controversial or sensitive material. 20 more issues are excluded from some, but not all, of the Japanese book editions. 12 of these are included in the bunkouban edition on which the Vertical edition is based. And three more of these 20 appear in the special hardcover volumes 1-3. So. If you have all the Vertical paperbacks you will have 230 out of 243 stories. If you also buy the hardcovers you will have 233*.*i researched all this at tezukaineglish.com. of course i might have misread or miscalculated something.Is Black Jack a series or a serial?A series. Each chapter is a self-contained story. You can read them in almost any order. In fact, that's what you're already doing. This edition does not present the stories in chronological order of publication, but in the order Osamu Tezuka himself indicated for a deluxe edition planned shortly before his death, in 1989.For instance. The stories in this first volume are not issues #1 to #12 of the serialized manga but rather issues #1, #167, #12, #52, #29, #50, #86, #185, #57, special issue between #113 and #114, #54, and #49. There is a rationale to all this. Several of the stories give backstory information about Black Jack, where his scars come from, why he decided to become a doctor, etc. So Tezuka decided to put them at the beginning of the series in this new form.Where can i learn more about Black Jack and and all this mess about the excluded issues?Go to 'Tezuka in English' website (tezukainenglish.com). That's where i dug all this stuff up, all kudos to them.Is Black Jack really that good?As a surgeon? Definitely. As a comic-book classic? The answer is also yes. Black Jack is as classic as Tintin or Terry and the Pirates, but with surgical gore."},{"Title":"Black Jack, Vol. 1","review":"Following the knowledge, logic, guesswork, and touch of luck that goes into diagnosing a patient is like reading a great detective story. The mysteries contained within the human body have fascinated us since the dawn of time. Even today, television shows like CSI, Bones, and House have taken such a hold on the American imagination that juries in actual courtrooms expect to see forensic evidence admitted with every case. Knowing this, is it any wonder that Black Jack is one of the most popular manga of all time in Japan?Black Jack is brilliant surgeon, able to operate successfully on a score of patients in a matter of minutes. But due to a series of conflicts with the medical profession, he remains unlicensed. Instead, he operates outside the law, remaining one step ahead of authorities as he moves from one country to another, charging patients exorbitant rates for his services and remaining cold to their pleas for mercy--or for a discount. But Black Jack isn't heartless; he just operates under his own code of ethics and fair play. He'll travel for miles to save a man who once did him a favor. He'll give aide to any doctor prepared to go all-out to save a patient. He'll cry after a failed operation. And he always chooses to fight for life rather than settle for an easy death.In Black Jack, Tezuka has created an iconic character, one that has a predictable set of actions and responses but still manages to surprise the reader. Sometimes harsh, other times moving or laugh-out-loud funny, each chapter is a complete episode. Many times the stories are about characters whose lives are touched by the rogue doctor, and these are often the most memorable. But no matter who the star of the story is, Black Jack is thoroughly addicting.Before becoming a professional cartoonist, Tezuka studied to become a medical doctor and it's easy to see that he had a ball putting his training to use on the page. The scenes in the operating room are as graphic as what you'll find on primetime television, and some of the plots are just as outlandish. But Tezuka's tongue is firmly planted in cheek as he takes his antihero up and over the top, and he keeps the reader engaged for the whole ride.Vertical is releasing the Black Jack stories in the order Tezuka set out before he died, and they're great. They are also beautifully put together, with artful covers and illustrated inner covers. This may be the only time a gorgeous package actually hinders sales. These stories are perfect for teens and adults, but the covers do nothing to attract a teen reader. So, please, buy these books and read them. Then buy a set for your favorite teen, male or female, and make them sit and read a story or two. These stories will become favorites and you will instantly be the coolest adult in the room.-- Eva Volin"},{"Title":"Black Jack, Vol. 1","review":"I remember seeing the Black Jack series years ago at a con I was at, and from that moment on I was hooked. I searched for the comic books, which are rare and hard to find, and I ordered the original Mangas when they were first released in the states, but the copying of the art was shoddy, and the translations were terrible. When I heard that they were re-releasing the Mangas I was delighted. As soon as I got my copy I knew I would be pleased. The page spacing is perfect for the artwork, the translations are wonderful, and I am happy to see this beautiful example of Japanese manga released in a format that will apeal to American and European readers. The stories themselves show a deep and probing knowledge of the human heart and psyche, and each story helps you look into the choice between right and wrong. In anycase, after several decades, this is still an amazing series whith a rich and deeply developed plotline, and this edition truly does it justice!"},{"Title":"Black Jack, Vol. 1","review":"I must admit, I didn't know what to expect when I first picked up Osamu Tezuka's Black Jack Volume 1. While Tezuka's Astro Boy is often hailed as the cornerstone of modern manga, reading it has always felt to me like more of a 'study of the grand masters' than an honest-to-goodness engaging read. (Sort of like reading the first few dozen issues of Superman or The Green Lantern -- the art's amazing and the characters are iconic, but goddamn if the stories aren't repetitive.) But Black Jack? Wow. The collection's first story, Is There A Doctor?, quickly establishes the series' playful perversity. The plot: When a famous tycoon's good-for-nothing son is disfigured in a car accident, genius surgeon/man of mystery, Black Jack, is called in to save the boy's life. But there's a catch. In order to obtain the body parts needed for the operation, someone else is going to have to be sacrificed. With no time to waste, the tycoon bribes the police and the courts into convicting an innocent pauper of causing the accident, thereby getting a suitable set of replacement parts. Although Black Jack appears disgusted, he agrees to perform the operation -- so long as he's paid his multi-million yen fee. I won't spoil the details of the ending, but suffice it to say, heads are swapped, paupers become wealthy, and the scarred surgeon known only as 'Black Jack' sees to it that justice is served.In the stories that follow, things just get more and more bizarre. Take for instance, Pinoko, Black Jack's pint sized side-kick and comic relief. She's literally an old doll filled with the living remains of an unborn Siamese twin that was removed from the psychic tumor of a famous actress in chapter 3. (Go on, read that last sentence again. I'll wait.) Or how about the return of Black Jack's long-lost love? Pinoko is jealous until she finds out that years ago, Black Jack had to perform a sex change operation on his true love in order to save her (now: him) from uterine cancer. And then there's the close-up, gross-out panels included in nearly every story. Usually occurring during an operation scene, these are the one place in the comic where Tezuka switches from his normally cartoony style to something closer to life drawing. While it could be argued that these are there for educational purposes, truth be told, I think that Tezuka just likes giving his readers the willies at the sight of an abdomen being pried open by medical equipment.All of this would just be mind-warping eye-candy, though, were it not for the fact that Tezuka makes each of these stories so emotionally affecting. There is a genuine undercurrent of sadness throughout, a haunting sense of heartbreak, and even, at times, moments of inspiration and elation. As strange as this is gonna sound (especially after the tumor-becomes-a-main-character reveal), while reading Black Jack, I kept being reminded of Carl Barks' classic Disney duck stories. Both series feature moody, misanthropic leads. Both use short, self-contained adventures as a means of slowly exploring the backgrounds and motivations of their lead characters. Both are drawn in an unabashedly 'cartoony' manner; their deceptively simple styles showcasing their creators' mastery of the artform. Oh, and both comics are hella fun to read. Yes, Osamu Tezuka's Black Jack might be the answer to that age old question: What would an EC Comic by Carl Barks look like?"},{"Title":"Black Jack, Vol. 1","review":"With Vertical, their hands were wet after they tackled just one great Tezuka achievement. But then came others; \\"MW\\", \\"Phoenix\\", \\"Dororo\\" - and now they've gone and outdone themselves! A reprinting of \\"Black Jack\\" finally has its home in America.An elitist surgeon for hire, Black Jack works without a license, and some say without morals. But as deeply as Tezuka loved medicine (he himself never practiced, but it's worth noting) he loved a good story, and the story telling in these twelve stories is top notch.Many of them have morality as a central theme. Some would say this is overdone or tedious after awhile, but Tezuka has a wonderful way of making each story interesting. Included here is the beginnings of Pinoko (\\"Teratoid Cystoma\\"), the MD's lovely home-made daughter, erm, make that 'WHIFE'! Among other things, the doctor must detect a killer from a patients haunted eyeball (\\"The First Storm of Spring\\") as well as diagnose a gruesome devilish face sore (\\"The Face Sore\\"). A personal favorite of mine is \\"U-18 Knew\\", which depicts an entire hospital run by a single robot, now diagnosing himself as sick and asking for Black Jacks direction.Black Jack's mentor is also given a story in \\"Sometimes Like Pearls\\", which, like other stories, ends in demise but sprouts knowledge about its characters and adds depth and meaning to the human quality each story has in itself. This collection of Black Jack works is among the best around, and starting here is a must.A NOTE ON THE TEXT:Vertical has done a great job wrapping these stories in lovely artwork and even accompanying them with extra stories assuming you through in the extra cash for the sought-after hardcover editions of these books.The traditional Japanese sound effects are kept in original kana form, with subsequent English translations next to them. Most signs and labels are kept in Japanese as well and this is appreciated by any manga fan who wants their Tezuka preserved as it was meant to be.From what I hear the touch-ups from the original BJ releases in English are very well done and the overall presentation in monochrome is wonderful, especially sice Vertical is going with a larger palette and charging a bit more (Tezuka is worth it to me).One (very minor) complaint I could have is the exclusion of any chronology of the stories in an Appendix. It's apparent by later Volumes in the series that these stories are not in chronological (as they were printed) order and to have a reference of original publishing dates (& cover art) would be appreciated.But for what Vertical has done, I can only applaud."},{"Title":"God Made Me","review":"This is a delightful personal scrapbook your child will enjoy filling in.

I borrowed it one day when I had nothing to read while soaking in the bath. I'm so pleased I did. I read the first eighty pages before cold bath-water forced me out.This book explains the ORIGINAL American concept of freedom, as expressed so beautifully by Thomas Jefferson in 1776: \\"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.\\"Change the words \\"all men\\" to \\"all humans\\" and you have, without doubt, the greatest statement ever written outside the bible.The American Revolution, or War of Independence, was not about aggression, territorial expansion, or cultural imperialism. It was about RIGHTS and SELF-DETERMINATION and LIBERTY.Oh, how marvellously the early American patriots created a new nation! It still had a long way to go until white women, all blacks, native Americans, and other minorities got to enjoy freedom, but it rested on a genuinely wonderful foundation.Looking at America from the distance of New Zealand, and surveying the carnage caused by current American foreign policy, my only question is: how on earth has American walked so far away from its excellent founding principles?"},{"Title":"SOCIAL DARWINISM IN AMERICAN THOUGHT 1860 - 1915","review":"Typically, I bestow five stars on books I think profitable to read. This book is a classic: it is imperative to read.I disagree with the reviewer below (Mr. Landon) who calls for a repudiation of natural selection. I do not believe that sufficient evidence exists to recall the theory of natural selection.Richard Hofstaedter is not, I repeat, is not calling for that, either. Recalling a scientific theory because of political difficulties caused by misguided adherents is neither right nor necessary. And Richard Hofstaedter demonstrates why it is not necessary right here in this book.The take-away from this book is that social Darwinism, the belief that only the \\"fittest\\" (whatever that means) people among us should survive (rule, whatever), is on shaky ground. Always a morally repugnant doctrine, Hofstaedter shows social Darwinism to be logically suspect as well.As Hofstaedter points out, one can start with the social Darwinist's appropriation of (or more accurately with their failure to reckon with) the term \\"natural\\". Darwin's principle of natural selection never addressed individuals within a species, and its application to individuals is a tremendous mistake. Writing about individuals striving to be \\"fittest\\", Hofstaedter here, from the pen of Mr. Darwin himself:\\"People who are selfish and contentious will not cohere, and without coherence, nothing can be effected.\\"Rugged individualism is repudiated by its supposed inventor, and is fatally wounded.One ponders the origin of the social instinct. Social Darwinists believe it to be contrived. But we were either created or selected to have it, this Darwin seems to know. And we should know it, too.Hofstaedter avoids bombast, ideology, and religion. Yet he most effectively shames any false philosopher who would trample underfoot the least of his brothers and pronounce it \\"inevitable\\", by demonstrating the fallacy of his \\"logic\\".By revealing the spurious origins and assumptions that form the foundation of the doctrine of social Darwinism, Hofstaedter undoes the false conflict between evolutionary science and Christian ethics.In the end, Mr. Landon and I agree: Five stars. If you're interested in the most significant question arising in the past couple of centuries for social science, ethics and religion, the buck stops here."},{"Title":"SOCIAL DARWINISM IN AMERICAN THOUGHT 1860 - 1915","review":"Richard Hofstadter is an excellent historian of the trends in American political, social, and religious thought. This book chronicles the rise and fall of Herbert Spencer's philosophy as a reinforcing doctrine for laissez-faire political economy. Hofstadter deftly combines his own observations with carefully selected quotes from the thinkers themselves. One lesson that may be gleaned from this work is that controversial and complex ideas such as Darwinian evolution may be used for a multiplicity of purposes, some of them conflicting. For those who seek a greater insight to the struggle between individualism and collectivism in American political culture. I would also recommend reading Will Durant's chapter on Herbert Spencer in The Story of Philosophy as a supplement."},{"Title":"SOCIAL DARWINISM IN AMERICAN THOUGHT 1860 - 1915","review":"If by chance you are unaware of what Social Dawinism is and/or do not know how it has flowed through America's bloodstream (most virtually since the Civil War) you are in for a reader's exploration that is destined to change your world view. For sure, you will realize how social Darwinism is alive and well today and, I offer, that you will be howling to leave it by the wayside by the time you've turned the last page of this unexpected history. This is a cornerstone read for the history buff and a must read for anyone seeking reasons why life--for most of us--is not as joyful or pleasant as it could be...In this light Richard Hofstdter's book is a teacher of both the mind and heart!"},{"Title":"SOCIAL DARWINISM IN AMERICAN THOUGHT 1860 - 1915","review":"This book doesn't really take much of a position. Rather, it is a historical chronicle positions others have taken. But if there is a hidden 'thesis' to this book, my guess is that it would look something like this: Evolution is a unique science because it touches on the very idea of who humans are, individually and as a group. Becuase of this, there has been a great urge to make sweeping proclomations applying evolution to politics, ethics, economics, etc. This book is the historical record of various attempts.What one learns in this book is that far from being limited to Spencer and the laissez-faire crowd, evolution has been invoked to support just about every governmental and economic scheme imaginable: Kropotkin tied 'mutual aid' to anarchism; Marx applied it to communism; Spencer to capitalism; Dewey to government interventionism, etc....etc....Hofstadter takes us on a ride that begins with Darwin and winds its way through these varied schemes. Everyone, it seems, wanted to apply this newly found science to their side before the other guy could monopolize it! If you couldn't link your beliefs to evolutionary support, then your beliefs may risk seeming unscientific (especially if the other guy COULD claim evolutionary support). And this is the story of that multifarious race.Obviously Spencer and Sumner are written about quite a bit, as they have become the public face of 'Social darwinim.\\" (As it is a bastard philosophy, I refuse to capitalise the \\"d\\" in Social darwinism.) Kropotkin and those who tied evolution to altruism are also gone over a good deal. From there, we get a survey of the often neglected pragmatists and their understanding of Darwinism (I think they got it right; particuluarly William James.) We end in somewhat of an irony, with the anti-Spencerian economists who applied evolutionary thought to the OPPOSITE conclusion from Spencer's.It is a good read, especially for those interested in the history of ideas. But anyone looking for much of a thesis in this book will be disappointed. The book is not pro- or anti-evolution in any way whatever. The book only suggested (to me anway) the danger that comes when evolutionary thinkers unhinge themselves from the empirical and begin philosophizing about normative things like ethics and politics. Evolutionary psychology is one thing, but evolutionary ideology is quite another (in whatever shape it comes)."},{"Title":"SOCIAL DARWINISM IN AMERICAN THOUGHT 1860 - 1915","review":"ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS WRITTEN ON THE AMERICAN WAY OF THINKING AND EXPLAINING THE UNDERLYING ATTITUDE and beliefs regarding our attitude about social issues and social responsibility.

And I give it three stars because it did introduce me to many of the ideas and thinkers Hofstadter highlights.But I can't give it more than that. Hofstadter overstates the significance of social Darwinism. It wasn't the whole of the case for laissez-faire economics. After all, David Ricardo made that case well before Darwin saw any finches on any islands. And Ricardo's disciple, Harriet Martineau, was popularizing and idealizing the free-market case in the 1830s, still long before Darwin or Spencer or the rest of this lot.In the US, the arguments of classical economists combined with the old Puritan ethos to gain force. One interpretation of Darwinism strengthened such thoughts, but RH takes that out of context."},{"Title":"SOCIAL DARWINISM IN AMERICAN THOUGHT 1860 - 1915","review":"Hofstadter's classic work remains one of the outstanding challenges to the effect of Darwin's theory of evolution on social attitudes and beliefs. One of the great fallacies of evolutionary thinking can arise from the assumption of universal application of its mechanism of natural selection to all times, thus to the present and future. This is a fallacy and an inherent trap in confusing evolutionary process with a natural law, as in physics. The result of Darwin's theory was to make 'natural selection' a social strategy in the minds of many in a total confusion of theoretical domains of application. The outcome was the many variants of Social Darwinism that stretch into our own times. Hofstadter's documentation of the many shades of opinion generates a sense of deja vu, for few of the viewpoints we hear now are new and appear somewhere in the book, in a merry-go-round of confused thinking. It is a dreadful legacy that too many fell obligated to correct in the wrong fashion, by exempting Darwin entirely, and blaming those who came afterwards. In fact, the perception that Darwin's theory is simply wrong or incomplete is the only antidote to social Darwinist attitudes, which linger in the tacit belief of too many in the need to mimic the ruthlessness enjoined by a confused theory. Robert Bannister's Social Darwinism is also a partial comment on Hofstadter, but does not supercede this original and enduring work."},{"Title":"The rich man and Lazarus (What is man, what is his destiny?)","review":"Dr. Bullinger defines death as going to a place where the soul sleeps, no activity whatsoever.

Unfortunately there is very little of interest about the man himself aside from his incredible talent and psychological make-up. One stands in awe at his ability to overcome serious injury and return to complete domination. The reader does get an overwhelming sense of just how much better Doohan was than his competition. Oxley does a nice job covering Doohan's career and early beginnings and the photographs are excellent. I would have liked to read more detail and even more quotes and thoughts from his peers and competitors. The paragraphs about his and Max Biaggi's jibes and digs throughout the '98 season are the best in the book. Now that Doohan has retired, after winning an incredible 5 world championships in a row this book is well worth having in your collection."},{"Title":"Mick Doohan: Thunder from Down Under","review":"Mick Doohan first and foremost is one of the most accomplished GP500 racers in all of history, his stat's. and dominance in the sport easily convey this. However, what his fans want to know most is what makes Mick really tick and what were his thoughts on specific instances and circumstances. While this is done in the book, it's only on a surface level, and the book really seems to be more of a story told to us by the author, not by Mick himself. The best part of the book is the relationship that Mick was able to establish w/ Eddie Lawson, and his thoughts after his surgery. The book is nice, the pictures are excellent, but I would only buy it second hand. I give it three stars for the pictures and Doohan history that shed fine details on what most of his fans already knew before buying the book, but overall well done and a decent Sunday read."},{"Title":"Mick Doohan: Thunder from Down Under","review":"I ENJOYED THIS BOOK AND WOULD RECOMMMEND IT TO ANY RACING FAN FROM WAY NBACK WHEN,,,,"},{"Title":"Mick Doohan: Thunder from Down Under","review":"Mick Doohan is arguably the best GP500 rider and this book has so many details about his success, particularly his come-back after the accident in Assen Holland which almost ended his chance of ever walking again let alone riding a motorbike.

Collectively, it is an embodiment of and a response to both medieval and Renaissance themes and devices. The medieval romantic and Arthurian genres are blended with Petrarchan techniques and Neoplatonic philosophy. Nevertheless, Spenser maintains a distinct style all his own; the nine-line stanza is, in my opinion, one of the most beautiful conventions in poetic verse. Oh yeah, and it's a darn good story too.This edition of the &quot;booke&quot; far outshines any other I've encountered. The text itself is annotated with copious footnotes which explain unclear passages, point out allusions to classical, medieval and contemporary events, and provide criticism. All of the peripheral material associated with _The Faerie Qveene_ is also provided, including the dedication to Raleigh and introductory sonnets. Other value-adding perks include a comprehensive bibliography, a chart showing minor changes made between the poem's three publications, and a character guide.Though this thick volume may seem daunting, it is in fact quite enjoyable. The notes are fairly unintrusive, so the casual reader can skim or read through the poem at his or her own pace, with the option to delve deeper if he or she desires.I strongly advise anyone with an interest in Renaissance literature, Shakespeare, poetry, or English literature as a whole, to purchase this book, and to dish out the bit of extra money for this particular edition."},{"Title":"Spenser the Faerie Queene","review":"This is the second edition of the best version of The Faerie Queene available. It is a marked improvement over the first edition. For one thing, you can actually read the type. The first edition looked like it was mimeographed (for those of you who remember what that looked like). The layout is now much better, and the notes (on the same page and with the same size font as the text) and cross references remain indispensable for anyone not born in 1600."},{"Title":"Spenser the Faerie Queene","review":"Spenser's marvelous amalgamation of chivalric quest-romance, Ovidian mythology, phantasmagoric allegory, and classical-cum-Renaissance epic comes the closest yet to a definitive edition in this reissue of A. C. Hamilton's Second Edition of the poem. (Second Edition still, according to the splendid and majestic new cover; Revised Second Edition, according to the title page; Third Edition, according to the Acknowledgements!) When Hamilton was tapped some 35 years ago to edit the original Longman edition, I don't think I would have deemed him the best person for the job, but I must admit that by this time his combination of expertise, wisdom, balance, and lucidity would be hard to beat. His introduction and extensive footnotes make an invaluable guide for anyone embarking on a serious exploration of this vast, 400-year-old world of words and wonders. As to the text itself, prepared by Hiroshi Yamashita and Toshiyuki Suzuki, it is certainly high time for Spenser once again to have editors who understand that their readings for Books I-III should, generally, follow the 1590 first edition rather than the 1596 reprint. On the other hand, it is absolutely unfathomable to me how they can have rejected so many revisions, extending even to entire lines of verse, which can only have been made in the 1596 text by Spenser himself. Fortunately, Hamilton always give the later reading in his footnotes, so this is a RELATIVELY minor complaint. Still needed is a complete edition of the poem in modern spelling: despite what you may read elsewhere, Spenser's spelling is almost never more archaic or eccentric than that of Shakespeare or other contemporaries, provided that they, too, are read in authentic old-spelling editions--but they almost never are, making Spenser seem much more alien and difficult to read in comparison than he really is."},{"Title":"Spenser the Faerie Queene","review":"This second edition of Spenser's The Faerie Queene is massive. It's huge. It's a Titan of a book. Double-columned and small-printed, it's a 735-page extravaganza that abounds with meticulous academic footnotes - and get this - all in a humongous book whose size is exactly like one of those cumbersome science textbooks from high school. And the footnotes. I'm just gonna say that they are just way too detailed for a first read, though there are some helpful explanations and clarifying paraphrases of some lines. I think it's best to skim the footnotes and enjoy the poetry. There are, however, two footnotes that are too hilarious not to share:Arthur sees a poor squire pursued by a formidable knight whose eyes are literally emitting laser beams (For from his fearefull eyes to fierie beams/...did proceed... (IV viii 39)), and Spenser describes the chase:He all the way did rage at that same Squire,And after him full many threatenings threw,With curses vain in his avengefull ire:But none of them (so fast away he flew)Him overtooke, before he came in vew...(IV viii 40)And the footnote to lines 4 and 5 reads: \\"The squire is fleeing at supersonic speed.\\"Another instance is when a heroin sees her archenemy work a black magic:That horrour gan the virgins hart to perse,And her faire locks up started stiffe on end(III xii 36)And the footnote to the second line reads: \\"up started: stood up. A formidable sight for her hair extends to her ankles; see ix.\\"So yeah, these are pretty funny instances where you're not really sure if A.C. Hamilton is making fun of Spenser or just being dead serious. But anways, I digress. This book is not shy at all in its use of footnotes, and they are more for the academics who are interested in knowing what kind of academic papers are out there about the most miniscule things in the poem.The presentation, let me tell you, is gorgeous. Quality paper, ink that doesn't come off (e.g., Oxford's Chaucer book uses cheap, dirty, gray newspapery paper with cheap ink that smears and comes off so easily that it turns your fingers all inky as you flip through the pages), and nice covers. But the question is: is it worth the $50? I'd say Penguin's $14 version is good enough for anyone with the balls to plow through 4000+ stanzas, and only after you plowed it through to the end and feel like you need MORE, then by all means, buy this edition, which will probably give you references to a lifetime of academic papers to read and fulfill your death wish.On to the poem itself. GOD it's LONG. But it's not so bad, actually. Once you get used to Spenser's English and get into the rhythm of the poetry and story, it's enjoyable, because after all, Spenser chose the form of \\"historical fiction\\" to \\"delight\\" the reader. There are tons of stanzas where Spenser expatiates on the details of a scenery or a building, but they are bearable (except in Book IV, Canto XI where he describes all the rivers in England and Ireland, taking up a whole goddamn canto, and that makes it quite a 10 thick pages to enjoy). Overall, I think, the first book and the fifth book are the most fun (i.e. no homiletic descriptions of buildings and sceneries, and this terminator of a character in Book V is just absurdly invincible and fun to read about esp. when he decimates tribes and nations), and the rest are pretty good as well. I'd say Spenser is a mix of Chaucer, Malory, and Ovid, and takes the best from each, as he never forgets to keep the story going (there is always something happening, like Malory's Le Morte D'Arthur, but none of his interminable digressions and formulaic monotony), keeps it real poetically (like Chaucer, but none of that Middle English difficulty), and seamlessly integrates various romances into a coherent whole (like Ovid, but none of his overwhelming abundance of characters).So, all in all, a goodish ok read = 2.5"},{"Title":"Spenser the Faerie Queene","review":"There's no question that this is a lot of book for the money, and it's an essential volume for the serious student. The introductory matter is a disappointment, though; instead of guiding us into this massive work with a view to our gaining pleasure from it, Hamilton gives us a dense and barely readable collection of quotations from other critics and cross-references to scholarly papers. Many of the footnotes in the text suffer from the same kind of high-priestly scholarship, mixed with a tendency to ferret out sexual symbolism wherever it can be found. There is plenty of information in the notes to clear up the inevitable confusion modern readers must experience, but at times one wishes a giant could wield a club without being followed by a tribe of commentators chattering about phalluses and biblical parallels.In short, this volume contains all that is good and all that is bad about \\"literary criticism\\". It is illuminating for those who want to dig deeper into the meaning of the poem, but it takes a lot of fun out of the reading. After all, The Faerie Queene wasn't written to keep academics busy; it was an entertainment, to be read aloud in groups, and to inspire wonder and laughter.My advice to those who are new to Spenser is to read the poem quickly, without worrying too much about full comprehension, and referring to the notes only occasionally. You may be surprised at how quickly the antiquated language (much of it idiosyncratic even in Spenser's day) becomes familiar to you. First learn to love the flow of words, the characters, the action, and the humor; later you can come back for deeper study."},{"Title":"Spenser the Faerie Queene","review":"I would have to disagree with the reviewer that called Spenser's epic &quot;fun&quot; to read... it is a lot of work, not only because of the length but because of the archaisms involved in Spenserian diction. On the other hand the work is definitely fruitful, one finds passages of indelible beauty and insight. For scholarly criticism I would recommend the Oxford edition (&quot;Poetical Works&quot;) with an introduction by E. de Selincourt: he often points out just the stanza or two that helps place the entire poem into a new perspective. Make no mistake about it, the Spenserian stanza (ababbcbcc) is a difficult read, whether one is talking Byron's &quot;Childe Harold&quot; or Novak's &quot;Requiem&quot;: in all cases (I would say) a significant amount of effort is required, simply to follow the train of the author's thought, which, because of the difficult nature of the stanza perhaps, is not necessarily clearly linear... but in the long run, MAKE NO MISTAKE the effort is clearly worth it, and Spenser, if not exactly conforming to one's expectations, will not exactly disappoint them either. A worthwhile read, even in bits and pieces, if you cannot adhere to the storyline as a whole."},{"Title":"Spenser the Faerie Queene","review":"The Faerie Queene defies description and ought to be experienced by any 16th century poetry buff. Concerning the Longman paperback: it doesn't hold up so well with repeated readings and my current copy has pages pulling away from the spine. However, there are footnotes (as opposed to irritating endnotes) and the book itself will lie flat on a desk to allow for extended periods of study. Nothing like trying to write notes on FQ when you're holding your Penguin Classics edition open with one hand!If you are mainly interested in reading and enjoying the Faerie Queene without writing a paper on it, then you probably don't need the Longman. The Penguin version is fine, and there are other, older versions available as well. The only thing you might miss are the footnotes, but they also might not be worth $40 to you. For the serious student, however, this version is invaluable due to its extensive critical apparatus. If you can, try to secure a 1st edition hardback. Most of the additions to the 2nd edition were nominal at best, and you can always catch up on your bibliographic references by searching the Spenser bibliography online. Most importantly, the hardback holds up better than the paperback they are issuing now. Also, some of the notes in the 1st edition are quite funny (referring to Britomart as \\"bitchy,\\" for instance); academic relics from the seventies are great. And if you're going to be studying the Faerie Queene long-term, you will need something to preserve your sense of humor."},{"Title":"Spenser the Faerie Queene","review":"For those who are in search of a serious, scholarly edition of Spenser's seminal work, this text is a must. The editors have taken painstaking care and attention to running down obscure Classical (Greek, Latin and Italian) sources Spenser uses so liberally throughout his epic poem. Contemporary readers of FQ would have understood the references to Tasso and Dante; later readers need a sure guide to assist them through the thicket of references. Therefore, this volume serves a couple notable purposes for the true Spenserian (and English-language Renaissance) scholar: (1) It provides superlative context upon the historical (or historicist) period in which Spenser worked; and (2) It reinforces an appreciation of the wide learning incumbent of authors of high repute in Elizabethan England."},{"Title":"Spenser the Faerie Queene","review":"This second edition of \\"The Faerie Queene,\\" with A.C. Hamilton as the editor, again sets the standard for critical editions of Edmund Spenser's classic poem. This volume replaces Hamilton's first edition of the poem as the standard academic text. Anyone who is serious about studying the poem should purchase this particular edition. In addition to featuring a much clearer typeface than that of the first edition, the second edition contains critical commentary about the poem that is as current as one could expect (i.e., through the \`90s). The footnotes are conveniently and unobtrusively placed at the bottom of the text, so one can easily ignore them, if they prefer. However, the labyrinth of cross-references are highly informative, provocative, and illustrate the poem's incredible richness. I find myself so engaged in the contemporary criticism of the poem that I'm constantly going to the library to read the articles to which the notes refer.If you already have the first edition that was edited by Hamilton (or if you were lukewarm about reading Spenser in the first place), you may not need this updated edition, unless you would like to read the updated essays and commentary. However, if you love \\"The Faerie Queene,\\" this particular volume will provide you with many hours (and possibly years) of enjoyment. It is well known that the poem is one of the greatest ever to be penned in the English language. In the second edition, Hamilton helps us all understand why this poem speaks so powerfully to us over four hundred years later. This is truly a marvelous poem and a great academic text."},{"Title":"Spenser the Faerie Queene","review":"This is a great resource for anyone studying The Faerie Queene. Hamilton's notes are excellent; he provides religious and historical contexts for Spenser, precise definitions of unfamiliar words, and helpful cross-references. My Spenser professor this semester uses the first edition, and he claims that some of the notes have been altered for the second edition; he doesn't approve of some of the changes. However, for myself I haven't noticed information that's missing. Anyone who needs to have an understanding of Spenser's great work should definitely consult this one!"},{"Title":"Spenser the Faerie Queene","review":"I'm a fun girl who likes to party!!!!

Paton","review":"God is as real in modern times as in the Book of Acts and He still does mighty things to glorify the name of Jesus. Jesus can transform the most degraded, hopeless people into new creatures who live godly, righteous, productive lives. John G. Paton's autobiography shows how that happened to Cannibals in the New Hebrides Islands (now called Vanuatu) through missionaries (the author being one) who set aside their own earthly agendas to make Christ known to those who have never heard of him and to extend the kingdom of God where Satan had deceived the entire population and held them captive.This book also shows how John Paton came to faith in Christ in his godly family in Scotland and was prepared for many years before going overseas as a missionary. It was good to see how like Daniel in the Bible, faithfulness in his youth built a foundation for him to do greater works and trust God in the midst of greater difficulties later on. It all started with seeking to glorify God in more ordinary sounding situations when he was young.As a missionary to the New Hebrides he went through great suffering, heartbreak, and danger. Yet he was miraculously strengthened in spirit and body and delivered from many attempts on his life by angry cannibals, who did not want their degraded, violent, superstitious way of life threatened for anything. (Listen to the sermon \\"Ten Shekels and a Shirt\\" by Paris Reidhead regarding missionaries' suffering). Yet he persevered believing God would be faithful to him and would not let his labor be in vain. In time, his perseverance and that of his coworkers was rewarded abundantly. An incredible testimony of Christ's power over nature/circumstances and even more incredibly a demonstration of Christ's ability to sustain one inwardly in the face of seemingly impossible to overcome trials, as well as his ability to conquer hearts in great darkness with his glorious light."},{"Title":"Coming to Terms with Chinese Buddhism (Studies in East Asian Buddhism)","review":"One can generally take it to the bank that anything in the Kuroda Institute series (in conjunction with the Univ. of Hawaii Press) is going to be a worthwhile scholarly contribution to Buddhist studies, and this book is no different. Here, we're looking at a (short) 8th-century Chinese syncretic work which incorporated (imported) Indian Mahayana Buddhist concepts with indigenous Chinese Taoist concepts. The arrival and assimilation of Buddhism with native Chinese beliefs over several centuries was a seminal occasion in Chinese history, and produced an important volume of religious/philosophical literature, of which this treatise is a sophisticated representative. Alas, this body of literature is hardly known outside of the scholarly community and arcane specialist study, which is really a shame in many ways. We'll get back to that in a minute.We're looking at, in this case, an obscure work entitled the \\"Pao-tsang Lun\\" (or Baozang Lun- \\"Treasure/Jewel Store Treatise\\"), which one discovers was rather highly esteemed in Chinese Buddhist circles by important thinkers such as the eminent Chan/Hua-yen master Tsung-mi, as well as famous medieval Chan (Zen) masters such as Yun-men, Yen-shou, Ta-hui and others. In fact, two cases in the Chan classic \\"Blue Cliff Record\\" (Pi-yen Lu) were derived from the Treasure Store Treatise, which ought to catch the attention of Zen students interested in probing the background context of \\"Golden-Age\\" Chan in more depth. We can go further...Zen students OUGHT to be paying attention to much of medieval Chinese literature displaying an assimilation of Buddhist with Taoist concepts. Why? Simply because these works are a good background for deepening one's understanding of the cultural milieu of their favorite Chan masters.Author Robert Sharf is well-known to fellow scholars (or should be) for his many contributions to Buddhist studies, from his penetrating examination of new Japanese religions and Japanese nationalism, to his examination and critique of East Asian scholarly trends in general, to an interest in Asian iconography and esoteric/Tantric streams of Buddhism (not to mention fine translation work here as well). Alas, his name probably doesn't ring a bell with readers of popular Zen (and other Buddhist) literature. The reason for this is the same as in any discipline- fact is, there is a huge gulf between the popular literature of religions and what the scholarly community knows and discusses (this is as true in Christianity as in Buddhism). What is perhaps sad about this \\"gulf\\" between popular vs. scholarly knowledge is that many are not even aware of the magnitude of the gulf...but I digress.Back to the book. The title, \\"Coming to Terms with Chinese Buddhism\\" is probably well-chosen, for what Sharf examines actually goes far beyond merely a translation of an obscure text. In fact, among other topics, he attempts to entirely re-focus scholarly trends regarding so-called \\"sinification\\"- i.e., how Buddhism and Chinese culture developed through their mutual encounter and dialogue. Sharf sees many problems with prior scholarship in this regard. A detailed description of his critique won't be attempted here, but suffice it to say Sharf takes issue with the trend to see Chinese cultural developments during this period as the interaction of distinct, discrete \\"sects\\" or \\"schools\\" or \\"lineages\\"- i.e., as separate, autonomous entities such as Pure Land, Sanlun, Neo-Confucianism, etc.. His contention is that scholars not only have set up a false so-called \\"master narrative\\" that views these interactions in terms of distinct sects, the exaggeration of \\"separate entities\\" can, according to Sharf, even be extended to supposed distinctions between \\"Indian Buddhism\\" vs. \\"Chinese culture\\" in general.What to make of all this? Certainly Sharf's critique of the tendency to categorize is peppery and no doubt has provoked scholars to re-appraise assumptions concerning the issues of sinification, but probably not all critics will buy his own analysis. One suspects Sharf might have overstated his case to some degree, and indeed, Sharf seems to contradict himself later on when examining various \\"influences\\" on his translated text itself - he can't seem to help himself when identifying various concepts of \\"sects\\" having conceptual similarities with the Pao-tsang Lun - i.e., the Ox-head \\"school\\" of Chan, \\"Gentry\\" Taoism, \\"Two-school\\" Taoism, etc..A logical deduction seems to be that the various \\"schools\\" really DID have some lines of demarcation, and although Sharf may have a point seeing distinctions to be exaggerated, scholars are probably going to keep on describing Chinese sinification processes in terms of the interaction of distinct \\"schools\\". It may be difficult to do otherwise. Although a common thread certainly would be expected to run though Buddhist doctrinal developments in China, there are also tremendous differences in emphasis on particular doctrines among various \\"schools\\", as well as differences in the external cultural contributions.Sharf goes on to develop other themes in his book, which a short review can't do justice to. Some of his excellent contributions, too many to detail here, include an important discussion of how certain Indian conceptual terms correlated with, and thereby were transformed by, Chinese cosmological beliefs in terms of \\"sympathetic resonance\\" (kan-yin). There's little doubt in my own (humble, of course) mind that Sharf's penetrating discussion makes a very fruitful contribution to East Asian studies in this regard...Also interesting is Sharf's deconstruction of so-called \\"lineages\\" in an Appendix on \\"esoteric\\" (Tantric) Buddhism in China. Sharf looks closely at later Japanese tendencies to extract a self-conscious \\"esoteric\\" school or lineage from the T'ang period and the resulting Japanese attempt to attach a \\"pedigree\\" to Japanese esoteric schools, such as Shingon and Mikkyo. Sharf sees little evidence for a self-conscious Chinese esoteric movement separate from the Buddhist mainstream. This is another section that no doubt challenges conventional assumptions and makes for good discussion, particularly regarding the claims of the Japanese esoteric schools.Now that we've established this book offers much of interest to scholars of Buddhism and East Asian culture in general, what about Joe Blow Buddhist fan in general? I'm thinking here of our typical Zen devotee, who has waded through the modern pop books on Zen (and unfortunately, the great majority of these modern efforts belong under the \\"pop\\" label), and who have perhaps waded through some of the translated T'ang and Sung Period material on the great chan masters, and have maybe even tackled a few of the major Sutras (no easy task for moderns). What can a book such as this offer him/her?Probably the simplist reply here is to recognize that works such as the Pao-tsang Lun represent a period when the merging of Mayahana doctrines with indigenous Chinese thought produced some very interesting literature, which also reached a high level of sophistication. The fact that classical Chan masters of the stature of Yun-men (Unmon) were inspired by such literature (including other works more properly attributed to Seng-Chao, dating back to the 5th century) is food for thought. Zen people, take notice. It behooves practitioners to become more familiar with the background material that helped formed the teachings in their chosen discipline, no?"},{"Title":"Coming to Terms with Chinese Buddhism (Studies in East Asian Buddhism)","review":"The author, a respected Buddhologist specializing in East Asia, has conducted a solid inquiry into the nature of the Chinese cultural environment that produced the _Baozang lun_, or _Treasure Store Treatise_.

It's a good idea, just not executed well.Alexis Lopez is a slightly overweight talent agent, with a nasty \\"gangsta\\" boyfriend and a longing to break Meximericans into the spotlight. She finds her possible breakout star in Marcella Gauthier Bosch, a stunning rich wild child who wants to be a serious actress, but keeps getting offered roles as \\"maids\\" and \\"crack whores.\\"As Alexis struggles to find Marcella an outstanding role with no jiggle, she encounters Olivia. Olivia is a dowdy, traumatized young mom, with a crumbling marriage. But she's also written the brilliant \\"Soledad,\\" a screenplay that chronicles her mother's life -- the perfect vehicle for Marcella. All three women struggle to bring \\"Soledad\\" to the screen, and struggle just as hard to deal with their delicate relationships with men...At first glance, this sounds like a feisty romp, with three very different Latinas plotting to challenge the behemoth that is Hollywood. It's a cool idea, and one ripe to be explored. Unfortunately, Valdes-Rodriguez doesn't give it everything it needs to really bloom. There's too much book here for too little plot -- it putters out about halfway through the book, and just sort of limps to a finale.This is probably the only book I've ever read where the women think about sex about fifty times more often than the men. In fact, at times it seems to be all the women think about -- even the joyless Olivia checks out porn. If Valdes-Rodriguez wants to portray Hispanic women in a uncliched light, she might want to avoid that. Her writing is solid enough, with looks at the different lifestyles and social positions of L.A., with a look at how hard it is to get a stereotype-free role in Hollywood if you aren't a blonde Caucasian.While Valdes-Rodriguez succeeds in making three radically different women, only one of them is really likable. Olivia is as faded as her sneakers -- she doesn't register a single emotion you can identify with. Marcella is a little too insistently wild and decadent, not to mention bitter. The ultra-nice Alexis is much more likable, with her seemingly hopeless love for a sexy Cuban rapper and body image problems.Valdes-Rodriguez had a good idea, just not the characters and plot to flesh it out. \\"Playing with Boys\\" is a dullish, overstretched slice of chick-lit, without much to make it come to life."},{"Title":"Playing With Boys","review":"I find it strange that I am the first to review this item, but not strange that it is now priced as a bargain book.I decided to read this because I enjoyed this author's last work, The Dirty Girls Social Club. This was another good read, but there were entirely too many political references for me such as (ugh, she is a Republican or ugh, she is a Democrat). References I found out of place in a chick novel like this.I also tired of Alexis' fat girl complaints, such as \\"nobody will like me\\", etc. etc. Also out of place in a chick novel ... we need more inspiring women!But ... overall the book does not disappoint and there is quite a bit of inspiration in the story of these three women.So enjoy the book but be wary of the political and \\"Jemima J\\" references. Chick lit readers will know what I am talking about!"},{"Title":"Playing With Boys","review":"Alexis Lopez is a transplanted Texas conservative living among the liberal left in PLAYING WITH BOYS, the latest novel by Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez, whose first was the bestselling THE DIRTY GIRLS SOCIAL CLUB. Alexis manages Latino musicians and her most famous band is the Los Chimpances del Norte, a Norteno band that is world famous among those of Hispanic persuasion.The opening chapter has poor Alexis worrying over the band, all of whom are misbehaving badly at an exclusive party honoring the band members who had just donated $5,000,000 to UCLA's Center for Chicano Studies. The band, dressed in brightly colored outfits with huge belt buckles, is embarrassing Alexis, who believes in dressing conservatively in public, especially at these high-society functions. She also believes that those with money would know how to behave appropriately, but this rule does not seem to apply to \\"The Chimps.\\" These men are millionaires, yet here they are at this fancy party groping the female guests.One of the women who the bandleader, Filoberto, decides to grope is a famous Latina actress, Marcella Gauthier Bosch, known for those popular Mexican telenovelas. Alexis doesn't recognize the actress at first, because Marcella is working as a server at the party. When she explains to Alexis who she really is, Alexis is star-struck. At the same time, Alexis does not understand why this wonderful actress is working at a party when she should be the star of the party.After Alexis saves Marcella from the hands of Filoberto, she bumps into Samuel, who had helped her set up the party and the donation to UCLA. Standing next to him is a very petite woman who turns out to be his wife. She's very quiet, shy and insecure, but once they get to talking, Alexis finds out that Olivia has written the script for an intriguing movie.The three women's lives become entwined, as Alexis decides to buy Olivia's script and make it into a movie starring Marcella as the woman who portrays Olivia's mother, Soledad. Soledad and Olivia had witnessed the murder of Olivia's father in San Salvador many years ago, and this movie is the story of Soledad's life. As the deal is inked in pen, the three women bond and become unlikely friends.In the meantime, Alexis is having boyfriend problems, and Daniel, a Pulitzer Prize-winning news reporter, becomes rather psychotic after she decides to break up with him. Soon after the breakup, she meets (by accident, literally) a handsome Cuban named Vladimir (Goyo), who takes the reader to Cuba and the story of his girlfriend, who is still trapped there, living in an oppressed country without any freedoms. Alexis feels an immediate attraction to this man and has no idea that their lives will soon intersect in more ways than one.PLAYING WITH BOYS takes on a light tone throughout, but underneath the comedy lies a more serious theme. While Alexis's Hispanic friends are living a life taken for granted in the heart of Los Angeles, the stories of Soledad and Goyo remind them of what it was like for their friends and families before they came to the United States. Olivia suffers through reoccurring nightmares of what she experienced as a child in her homeland of El Salvador, while Goyo dreams of his lost love trapped in Cuba. And through it all, Alexis, Olivia and Marcella become friends despite their differences. What they share are universal feelings about men, relationships and what it is like to be a Hispanic American living in California.It may take a while for the reader to get into the novel, as it takes some time to set up the characters and the plot. But once the reader gets past this, PLAYING WITH BOYS will keep one absorbed until the very end. The author does a good job describing Southern California, from the Valley to East Los Angeles and in between. The many different characters, both major and minor, are fun, fully developed and real. The story itself is original, with flashbacks to Goyo's and Olivia's childhoods, although the ending may be obvious to most readers. This reviewer gives PLAYING WITH BOYS four stars out of five and will definitely get a copy of THE DIRTY GIRLS SOCIAL CLUB.--- Reviewed by Marie Hashima Lofton (Ratmammy@lofton.org)"},{"Title":"Playing With Boys","review":"PLAYING WITH BOYS by Alisa Valdes-RodriguezSeptember 10, 2004PLAYING WITH BOYS is the latest novel by Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez, whose THE DIRTY GIRLS SOCIAL CLUB was a big hit the other year. In this novel, three Latina women living in Southern California become friends through a movie script written about a woman that endured horrors while living in El Salvador.Alexis Lopez, originally from Texas, is now living in Southern California, and manages Hispanic musicians. Due to some \\"mishap\\" that involved her most famous act, Los Chimpances del Norte, she discovers she may need to expand her horizons. She comes across a woman, Olivia, with a wonderful script about her mother's life in El Salvador, and Alexis decides to buy it and make a movie out of it. She also hires out-of-work Latina actress Marcella Gauthier Bosch to play the lead in the film.The three of them become friends, but in the meantime, they each have their own set of problems. Alexis is dealing with a psychotic ex-boyfriend. Marcella is dealing with a mother that never showed any support for Marcella, despite the fact that they are both actresses. She is also worried about her fading beauty, insecure that some younger actress will take her place in the world of Latina beauties. And Olivia is dealing with nightmares, memories of life in El Salvador. She's losing sleep and weight.When Alexis meets handsome Cuban singer Vladimir, her life takes on an interesting turn, but learns he's still in love with a woman he left behind in Cuba. His goal is to get her out safely and to be reunited with her. Alexis is disappointed that she will never win his heart, but takes him on as his new manager and does what she can to promote his music, and to help him bring his one true love to the United States.I enjoyed reading PLAYING WITH BOYS. Although it took a while to get into the novel, once I saw where the plot was heading, I was hooked. The strength of this novel are the characters, who come to life and feel as real as the person sitting next to you. I would love to read a sequel to this book, if only to see what the future brings to these wonderfully created characters. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Playing With Boys","review":"Unfortunately this book has NONE of the spark of the authors' first novel, which I truly enjoyed. This novel is cliche' all the way in regards to LA, and I didn't find the characters realistic or even likeable. The main character is a slightly self-righteous Mex-Texan Republican entertainment rep/agent, who has recently relocated to LA. If that is not enough in itself- she constanly uses annoying phrases like \\"geez-Louise\\" and \\"darlin'\\". She is truly a loathsome creature-one of her fav food groups is lard- ugh.. The dialogue is completely unbelievable and the characters do not mesh at all. The only likeable character is Olivia and she is a side act in this awful book. This is a huge flop. If you like the sassy \\"Dirty Girls Social Club\\", and you have good taste- you do not want to buy this book! No sass and just plain dull."},{"Title":"Playing With Boys","review":"There are two separate reviews I would give this book.Regarding entertainment value: less than average.Regarding inspiring debate: above average.Entertainment value:You should read this \\"novel\\" if you really just have too much time on your hands. I'm not saying it is useless, but if I'm going to start recommending books for people to read it would not start with Playing with Boys. I put novel in quotes because I think this is very \\"on and off the shelf.\\" I was not moved. At times I was offended. The foreshadowing was less than impressive.Debate:As I read this to analyze representation of Chicana and Latina identity, I found many ways it could possibly challenge the constructs of race, gender, and sexuality. However, I found myself having a weak argument as I was greeted with many strong opposing views. Some claimed how the novel reinforced many of the same constructs. Examples are the ways in which the women of the novel lack autonomy.Most of the men in the novel are nothing short of \\"tools.\\" I mean this not only by way of their surface level portrayal, but they are merely present as a cause/effect relationship with the women. The men don't respect the women they are involved with. They screw-up and the women find men who do respect them. The sad thing about this portrayal is the women meet the respectable men while involved with the tools. Why is it that these women are portrayed as having to settle? Their identity lies in being with a man?While much of this is only speculation, there is, unfortunately, many controversial portrayals of femininity, masculinity, race, and sexuality."},{"Title":"Playing With Boys","review":"I read the book because I really liked Ms. Valdes-Rodriguez's first book (Dirty Girls..). This one started out well and had an interesting twist with a political side to the characters. Unlike other reviewers, I did not mind that aspect and felt it worked well with the story. It did not get a higher rating as I felt the last few chapters could have been left out. Once she did the wrap up at the end she could have ended there (not to give away too much of the plot)she could have left off the few short chapters at the end. The \\"mush\\" factor went up too high for me and resulted in a lower rating. Life is life and has good and bad."},{"Title":"Playing With Boys","review":"I picked this book up on a whim and was very pleasantly surprised.Though I found it slow in the beginning, I pushed through the first 100 pages or so and then I was hooked. Valdes-Rodriguez writes charmingly and weaves an intricate storyline full of complicated, realistic characters - each loveable in his or her own way.Alexis is a plus-sized music manager with an eye for talent. Texan born and raised, she is friendly to a fault, always smiling and going out of her way to help others. Though underneath her innocent exterior is a witty, bright, even sexy girl with a true eye for talent and real potential to make it in the industry. Her self consciousness is endearing rather than annoying, and the respect she recieves from the other characters only enhances her appeal. It is impossible not to root for Alexis as she seeks success in a cut-throat business, while trying to balance a busy social life and an unrequited love in the meantime.Marcella, a former soap actress oozing confidence and beauty, refuses to be degraded by Hollywood, which offers her only stereotypical Mexican roles, such as the foreign maid, or \\"Hispanic Stripper Number One.\\" Seemingly heartless, Marcella is not afraid to be a [...] After all, she was raised by two parents immune to love and affection. But over the course of the book, Marcella gradually softens and becomes Alexis' number one confidante. Their relationship is touching, and an example of a great womanly bond.Olivia is most unlike the other girls. In her mid-thirties, she is stuck in a lifeless marriage, suffocated by the burden of caring for her energetic two year old, and perpetually haunted by a gruesome, heartbreaking past. She has let herself go - her hair is streaked with gray and she could care less about fashion. But Olivia has one passion that still burns, despite her depression and hopelessness. She loves to write, and harbors an impressive talent. When she pours her heart, soul, and history, into a riveting screenplay, she is bound to get noticed. Though meanwhile her home life falls apart.As the title implies, the book is centered around the girls' exploits with men. The male characters are well-developed, too, but in particular, Goyo shines. He is undeniably sexy and if the girls can't keep you glued to your seat, I'm willing to bet Goyo can.This book is definitely recommended to chick lit fans. Its happy ending will leave a satisfied smile on your face."},{"Title":"Playing With Boys","review":"In all honestly she ddin't live up to her first book. This is very disappointing in comparison. It seems as if she used a few of the ideas that created the old charcters and just switched their names or sexes.The title its self is quite misleading, it should have been, \\"Relationships with boys, who aren't men yet.\\" I guess I kept reading it hoping it would get better, and in some ways it did, right after page 100.Suprisingly I did not care for one of the main charcters for half of teh book, and wouldn't have cared if she got hit by a bus. Its quiet predictable, and its as if she was very angry when she wrote it, so much negativity, and viciousness. But it was a fun book, to pass time.I am highly afraid of reading her third book, because it might be another repitition."},{"Title":"Playing With Boys","review":"I gave this book 2 stars because although some parts did make me laugh and some parts were enjoyable, for the most part I I kept reading just to finish rather then because it was a page-turner. In my opinion it was not nearly as good as \\"The Dirty Girls Social Club\\". Also, I know it's fiction and all - but this author tends to give everyone a nice, happy ending in like the last 2 pages... So not believable...."},{"Title":"Playing With Boys","review":"I am a Latina from Texas and could really relate to these characters. These are smart successful women who are hopeless romantics at heart. I could definitely relate to Alexis and her crippling need to make people feel good, because it is most certainly how we're raised in Texas. Marcella's need for shopping and beautiful things is every woman's guilty pleasure. And of course the gray life of Olivia is something we mothers have all dealt with. Nothing is more important and exhausting as staying at home with a child. It is a great luxury and incredible stress at the same time that I myself could write abook about."},{"Title":"Playing With Boys","review":"I loved the author's other book, \\"The Dirty Girls Social Club\\" that I had to read her this book also.

If you love a great \\"bad girl\\" character, one who doesn't give a sh*% what people think and yet under that f-you exterior is someone quite vulnerable and human, you'll find yourself cheering for Marcella. Only Alisa can create characters who are daring enough to show their darkness and yet they shine even brighter because of it.And if you love a weak woman who finds her backbone and tosses bad rubbish out the door, you'll also cheer on Olivia and Alexis.Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"Playing With Boys","review":"I have read both of Alisa's books and thoroughly enjoyed both of them. The characters are humorous, smart, strong-willed, along with alittle insecure. I don't know if non-hispanics will laugh in all the places I laughed, because some of the humor is in the hispanic slang or little sayings we have in our culture, but I love the way the book is written to appeal to the average reader and not to literary critics. If you are looking for a fun book to read this is it.I am a professional hispanic female who averages reading 3 books a month, and found this book to be very entertaining. The book I read previously was \\"The Lovely Bones\\", which I thought was an excellent book as well."},{"Title":"Playing With Boys","review":"This was really three mini-stories in one. Yes, the three characters had some interaction with one another, but I found the jumping from character to character a little annoying. One story would just be getting interesting, and - bam - she switches narrators. It probably didn't help that I really only liked on of the characters, tolerated one of the others, and downright disliked the third. I think if I had really liked all three, it wouldn't have been so bad. It was okay, but it wouldn't top my recommended reading list."},{"Title":"Playing With Boys","review":"I am always looking for books, movies, plays or tv shows that tell our stories: Hispanic stories. There are so rare! This book tells great ones! Stories of Hispanic American people in all the spectrum: the civil rights leader but also the famous mainstream actress, the great mother, and the smart young entrepeneur, and they all tie up as a bunch of Hispanic success stories, which are also rare to find in maintrema media. I strongly reccomend it!"},{"Title":"Playing With Boys","review":"This book took awhile to get into, but our three main characters end up becoming the best of friends and discovering life together. This was my first book by this author but it won't be my last. It was graphic at some points but I enjoyed the story none the less!"},{"Title":"Playing With Boys","review":"This has to be on the list of one of the WORST 10 books I have ever read. I had to force my way through it because I was on vacation and didn't have another option during my down time. I was greatly disappointed as was the friend who passed it on to me. We both concur that one doesn't give a damn about these characters, mostly because the way their lives come together is highly improbable and unrealistic. Alexis' relationship with Goyo...? Come on... not even in the movies. How contrived were these characters' situations!!! If you're looking for a novel that is forced and trying much too hard to appear like a good read, this is it. My only consolation is that I didn't pay for the book myself. I can only wonder if this this book was published in a hurry, or if there was a blind editor on hand. Save your money and your time, people."},{"Title":"Playing With Boys","review":"Unlike most others, I actually read this book before reading Dirty Girls Social club, and liked this one better. It mixes the fun with the serious, the shallow and the deep, and the gossippy girl book with a more serious novel.While the main complaint of the reviews I have seen is that this book is just not beachy enough, I actually liked that. Don't be fooled by the title, this book actually has some meat to it. The women deal with love, work, pain, pasts and new people, all in a realistic and moving way.The characters are vibrant and real, while being interesting and distinct. The three stories balance each other nicely: Alexis's smart but self-deprecating personality evens out with Marcella's kick-a$$ confidence which contrasts sharply with Olivia's kicked-puppy mentality. You can realte to certain aspects of each of them. Yes, there are a few political references in the book. You can ignore them if you'd like. And JLo comes under criticism. Ditto with ignoring it if you don't want to hear it.This is not just a quick beach read, but I literally couldn't put it down. I finished it and then read it again a week later. If you simply want something amusing, with no substance, don't pick this one up just yet. But if you want a smart, sassy and captivating novel, defenitely give it a try. Five stars! And try Dirty Girl's Social Club as well--not quite as good in my opinion but defenitely fun."},{"Title":"Playing With Boys","review":"This book focuses on three women, two of whom are working on a career and one who is working on a marriage. It was interesting to read their points of view, although I didn't find the characters to be the most easy to relate to. My favorite character is Marcella, a beautiful woman struggling to be taken seriously as an actor. She is rough on the edges but you can't blame her considering all the crap she deals with from her family and men. Alexis has the best sense of humor in the book and I loved reading her quips.I love this book because it makes you laugh but also makes you think about the stereotypes women in L.A. have to deal with."},{"Title":"Playing With Boys","review":"THE DIRTY GIRLS SOCIAL CLUB was the first book I read from this author and I LOVED it. So I picked up this book and quickly realized a pattern. Another group of women (and one man in this case) who each had a story to tell. And the story goes back and forth from each perspective. I was nervous that the characters would be too similar given the same format and tone, but was pleasantly surprised at the stark contrasts. The author writers very well and has you rooting for each character, and really the characters are so different than DGSC. But I guess it's all in what you make of it. This reminds me of John Grisham's books in that you either think all of his books are the same or....not really."},{"Title":"Playing With Boys","review":"i had this book laying around for a couple years, given to me by a friend, and never got around to it. finally finished the book and i loved it! it was exciting, emotional, funny, and sophisticated. it made me laugh, cry, and ponder. it was a great read, and i highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Playing With Boys","review":"This book was quite enjoyable. I found myself getting so drawn into the characters, I couldn't wait to have a few free minutes to read more. I'd say it was like having a great TV show that I make a point of seeing each week, but better because I didn't have to wait a week inbetween episodes. I'm a sucker for a \\"romantic comedy\\" and a \\"happy ending,\\" so I loved this book!"},{"Title":"Playing With Boys","review":"I'm amused with the reviews for this book that state the reader was unhappy because the book was so far from \\"real life\\". Isn't that why we read fiction??? I found this book easy to get into and easy to follow.

Alexis is a Texas-born princess, who has an up-and-coming career in PR representing Latin clients. Marcella is a cynical but gorgeous former Novella soap star who wants to cross over into English-speaking movies, and Olivia is a brilliant woman who has become a stay-at-home mom but has written a great screenplay about her heroic mother.All of these women's lives come together, as Alexis tries to get Olivia's movie made, with Marcella as the star. There are also many interesting sub-plots, however- Alexis falls hard for a Cuban rapper who is already spoken for, and also starts her own PR firm. Marcella has to deal with emotional scars left by a perverted uncle, and also with her rich family's disapproval of her career choices. Finally, Olivia is haunted by her father's brutal murder when she was a child, and also has to deal with an unfaithful husband, and finally, finding love again.The only problem with listening to this book is that the abridgement is awful! It starts out fine, but then starts skippin all over the place. For example, all of a sudden Marcella and Olivia are friends, but we didn't get any sort of scene where they meet. The narration is terrific though, all three characters get different voices which suit them perfectly. Highly recommended, but get the entire book on CD, or read it instead, so you won't miss anything good!"},{"Title":"Playing With Boys","review":"I love this author, I read Dirty Girls Social Club and found myself laughing outloud as I read.

I also had a hard time getting into it, but once I did I was so drawn into the lives of the characters and the plot that I looked forward to my commute. I really think that the actress who did the reading did an awesome job of coveying the characters that might have been hard to get reading it in print. Give it a try!"},{"Title":"Playing With Boys","review":"The abridged audio version has 4 CDs and runs for 5 hours.I agree with the other audio reviewer, the voices of the author and two actresses make this audiobook sparkle. The plot is a little bit light and predictable, but the characters are so charming and human, and the light and relatable humor in every sentance made this a pleasure to listen to.I don't think I would have enjoyed this nearly so much had I sat down and read it, because the accents of the readers and their intonations really brought the dialogue and characters to life.Fans of her earlier book, The Dirty Girls Social Club, will find this a little lighter, but still enjoyable. I can't wait for the next one!"},{"Title":"Playing With Boys","review":"I just loved Alisa Valdes-Rodriguezs'books;\\"The dirty girls social club\\", and \\"Playing with Boys\\". I just finished \\"Playing with boys\\", and can't wait for her next book. Her books deal with issues that every Latina deals with. Just like the characters in her book, Latina's don't want to be characterized just as house wives barefoot and pregnant, cooking tortillas for there men. Alisa hits on the modern Latina living with two cultures. Striving to be succesfull and independant, but at the same time keeping their culture. Her characters deal with the same sterotypes and discrimination that Latinas (heck, women) deal with everyday. In a male dominated society it is nice to read a book that details the success of women. Not just women, but Latina's. As intertaining and funny as her books are, these books have a message. Her characters are succefull and vulnerable at the same time, and not always like-able. I think that we all have a \\"Marcella\\" in our own group of friends. I liked this book because I can identify with the characters. I enjoy how Valdes-Rodriguez sometimes writes in \\"Spanglish\\", with sayings that don't tranfer to english to well, but that doesn't stop her from writing how she would speak. I probably enjoy it because that is how my girlsfriends and I would talk to each other. \\"Playing With Boys\\" is a story of friendship, heartache, and determination that I would recommend to anyone wanting to read a modern, entertaining, funny, culterally rich book. I can't wait to read her next novel."},{"Title":"Playing With Boys","review":"\\"Playing with Boys\\" is Alisa Valdez Rodriguez' debut novel, but it reads as if the writer has been crafting characters and stories for years. Each of her three protagonists-- Marcella, Alexis, and Olivia-- have unique and strong voices of their own. While they are not perfect by any means, their flaws are embraced with a sense of humor and an undeniably real tone, which makes them extremely relateable to the readers. Each woman is three-dimensional and comes with her own set of baggage, and remarkably, Rodriguez manages to tell chapters from each's perspective and never muddy or cross the lines of their personalities.The only drawback to this novel is that while Rodriguez expresses so explicitly her disdain for people who stereotype young, opinionated, powerful, ETHNIC females, she falls into many stereotypes herself as a writer, namely when dealing with Los Angeles and the entertainment industry/media. It is as if she has stepped into a world she doesn't have first hand knowledge about and therefore falls into the traps of the assumed when depicting that world. While some of her observations did make me laugh, I couldn't help but notice they were one-sided and just as unfair as some of the ignorant remarks her characters fight off being those strong, ethnic women.However, after the first hundred pages or so, you can virtually forget about the commentary offered about Hollywood in the beginning because you focus instead on the odd friendship these three very different women are forming, and it is a friendship born out of necessity in a way but one that still manages to grow into something beautiful."},{"Title":"Playing With Boys","review":"predictable yet divertido. love the spanglish and the character building. the latinas say things that I often feel but don't often express out loud. the story moves along without being complicated, ideally to be read with a nice cold corona while digging your toes into the sand with juanes singing thru your ipod. even though you see whats coming you don't want to put the book down for long as you enjoy the girl time and hopefully see a bit of yourself in each chica."},{"Title":"Playing With Boys","review":"This book is amazing, Alisa is a wonernful author. I truly recommend this book to anyone and everyone but particularly Latinas. Love it and its a must read."},{"Title":"Before The Storm (Arabesque)","review":"Ms Schuster has given us two love stories in one book that could have each easily stood on their own. Each had their own twists and surprises. I read the book in one setting. This is a must read! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Before The Storm (Arabesque)","review":"What can I say but Melanie Schuster has created another Deveraux/Cochran Saga that I couldn't put down. This time the sizzling romance features two(yes TWO)of the Deveraux clan in Paris' daddy, aka-Mac-aka-The Judge and brother Julian, Jr. We get a glimpse of the sparks igniting between Mac and Ruth in THE CLOSER I GET TO YOU and we are held captive as a full fledged fire rages between them in BEFORE THE STORM. I think for me one of the things I enjoyed most about Mac and Ruth is they are a sexy mature couple who know how to celebrate their golden years in style. Mac can definitely teach his sons and nephews a few things about romance as he is determined to get the relationship shy Ruth to make a serious committment to have him in her life. Ruth has to exorcise a few demons before she's willing to accept the dapper Julian, Sr as a man whose love she can feel secure in, the heat between them is definitely on the rise and their journey to reach their perfect place is a sensual and romantic experience.Julian, Jr. and Maya were married after Julian pursued her all the way to the altar and anyone knowing the Deveraux/Cochran's know that there is no way out after the I Do's. However, there is always an exception and it seems Paris' older brother and his wife Maya's wedded bliss is doomed by rumor, innuendo and lack of trust and fueled by elements meant to ensure their happy-ever-after is short lived. But the power of love and Deveraux determination can never be overlooked not to mention when it's wrapped in a cute little surprise.Although both couples in BEFORE THE STORM could have been stand alone I never felt I missed any details surrounding both relationships. Thank you Melanie, as always you are one of the best."},{"Title":"Before The Storm (Arabesque)","review":"Melanie has done it again. I knew this book would be good with Mac and Julian but it surpassed even my highest expectations. As usual I read it in 1 evening. I can't wait to read the other Brothers stories."},{"Title":"Before The Storm (Arabesque)","review":"People should stop giving this book such a great review. The author lied about who the story was about. You barely ever see Julian Jr. or Maya in the book. The book is about Ruth and Julian Sr. and if I had known that, I would not have purchased the book. I'm taking it back to yhe store ASAP."},{"Title":"Before The Storm (Arabesque)","review":"Even though i love the book, it should been a book about Ruth and the Judge. It should have told more about Maya and Julian story. Because on the back it never mention anything about Ruth and Julian Sr. Just Maya and Julian Jr. so i'm thinking that's who story i'm getting. But overall it was a good book."},{"Title":"Before The Storm (Arabesque)","review":"Ms. Schuster, just when I thought my heart belonged to someone else, you introduced me to the Devereaux men who have stolen my heart!My heart belonged to the Cole/Kirkland clan in Rochelle Alers novels, until I purchased \\"Before the Storm\\", only to be swept away by the Devereaux clan. Ms. Alers has some serious competition. Now I have to go and find ALL of Ms. Schuster's books that are out of print. This book is a must buy for die hard romance readers like myself. Outstanding!"},{"Title":"Before The Storm (Arabesque)","review":"I give this book 4.5 stars. Great continuation of the Deveraux series. Tall, handsome, black men who appreciate woman in all shapes, colours and sizes. I loved the story of Julian Snr and Ruth more than Julian Jnr and Maya, maybe because it was tagged on at the end, they deserved their own book to flesh the story out or because father finds secret baby has been done to death in this genre? I found Maya to be a bit of wimp to be honest. This book needs to be read right after The closer I get to you which is Paris and Titus story for some of the events tie in.Looking forward to reading about Wade and the twins Lucien and Phillipe."},{"Title":"Before The Storm (Arabesque)","review":"Two Deveraux's are spotlighted in this book, Julian, Sr. with the blossoming of middle age romance and Julian, Jr. with the story of first love. Each story was well written with tenderness and passion. This book was great reading. I loved the two different story lines going on. I also liked the follow-up on the Parris story line. I love the Deveraux clan which I have followed from the beginning. I love the way this author writes her characters, the women are not all model thin and the men are strong, passionate men who love their women. It was nice to see middle age love blossom also."},{"Title":"Before The Storm (Arabesque)","review":"I really enjoyed this book, despite the false advertising on the back cover. This is really Mac and Ruth's story. Julian & Maya are kind of added on as an afterthought. I know I gave the story 5 stars but Mac & Ruth have such a beautiful love story. It's not often you see such a sensual love story between 50-somethings. They were hotter than the youngsters. I feel Julian & Maya should have had their own book or at least their part expanded. It was wrapped up rather quickly, though a bit comedically. I still really liked it though. The old folks were a lot of fun. And the reactions of the kids to them was hilarious. The scene with the cat and the strapless bra was great! Despite the wrong info on the back cover, I would definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Before The Storm (Arabesque)","review":"A fantastic and endearing must read!!! The book seamlessly weaves a muntigenerational love story together. There is adventure, surrender and the joy of letting love pull you into another world. Ms. Schuster takes us there once more with the Louisana Deveraux men. I personally can't wait for the next installment of the Cochran/Deveraux clan. Melanie, please hurry!Doc. j'"},{"Title":"Before The Storm (Arabesque)","review":"Ok so we are given a treat this time around from Ms. Schuster. We get 2 stories for the price of one. We get to read about Julian Sr. (Mac) and Ruth. Now even though Mac is old enough to be my daddy he is the man ok!! And his son Julian ain't no slouch either. He learned a thing or two from dear old dad. We also get introduced to a new little one in the book. Little Miss Corey is too cute and adorable for words. Like with all of Ms. Schuster's stories on the Cochrans and Deverauxs you get to check in with old favs. You are able to get your laugh on, get mad, be happy and warm all at the same time. Even though the book was about 2 couples the story flowed from begining to end. Also in the story Ms. Schuster touched on Hurricane Katrina which was touching and well written. Definite recommendation!"},{"Title":"Before The Storm (Arabesque)","review":"This book was great! You get 2 love stories for the price of one! I really liked the way Melanie wrote this story. Mac Deveraux's is the man, his game is TIGHT. The younger Deveraux's and Cochran's can't touch him. Yes he was a mature man, and definitely knew how to handle his business. He could definitely hold a class on romance. I like how they did not play the cat and mouse game. Julian and Maya's story was good also, I like how they didn't spend a lot of the story on the why's and did not try to hide the love that they still had for each other. and the daughter was an absolute doll!!. I was great to peek in on the other Deverauxs' and Cochrans too. The only thing that I did not like about this book is that it had to end!! Once again GREAT read. Another home run Melanie!!!"},{"Title":"Before The Storm (Arabesque)","review":"The book was an ok read.... it wasn't at all the story that I expected. The cover description was very inaccurate, the story is mainly about Mac and Aunt Ruth, and the Hurricane Katrina backdrop is almost non existant. This is the first book I've read by Melanie Schuster.... many of the other reviews state that her books are good reads, so I would skip this one, and pick up one of her other books."},{"Title":"Before The Storm (Arabesque)","review":"I try desperately not to judge a book by its cover; front or back. And with BEFORE THE STORM that was a good thing. The story was far more involved than what was expressed on the back cover.Readers are re-united with the powerful Deveraux clan of New Orleans. This story centers on Julian Deveraux, senior and junior. Fifty-seven-year-old Julian, Sr. has been widowed almost twenty years; he has successfully raised his children and is content with his memories. Thirty-three-year-old Julian, Jr. has been divorced for almost five years, and has sworn off love and marriage. He has not talked to his ex-wife since she left. Paris Deveraux has other ideas for both of them, and has dusted off her bow and arrow. Paris' friend Ruth is age-appropriate and perfect for her father. And while planning for her own wedding, Paris crosses paths with her brother's ex-wife, and stumbles on a secret. She seizes the opportunity to become a savior of sorts for each of them. Can she really pull it off?BEFORE THE STORM is two stories in one, about two sensitive men who need to overcome past losses. A reference to the tragedy of Hurricane Katrina adds realness to the story. What I love most about Ms. Schuster's writing is that the adults are truly adult, and the stories are passionate and real; they make you believe in overcoming all odds. There are several more Deveraux stories and I eagerly await their arrivals.Reviewed by aNNof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Before The Storm (Arabesque)","review":"I have been waiting for this book for a while, as I've read all of the books in this series. The story was beautiful, however, the preview on the back of the book was not accuate. The majority of the book focused on the story of Julian, Sr. (and Aunt Ruth), which is ok - I just was not prepared for that. The story of Julian, Jr. (and Maya) was not long enough in my opinion. It seemed rushed after experiencing the first story. All in all it was a good read, but only 4 stars based on my comments above."},{"Title":"Before The Storm (Arabesque)","review":"This author has always been one of my favorites. Once again, she did not disappoint. I love this story. You basically get two stories in one book. With Julian Sr. and Jr. It shows that the older people can find romance just as the younger people. Each couple had to over to overcome thier differences but in the end it made them perfect for each other when they finally together. You're going to enjoy this story."},{"Title":"Before The Storm (Arabesque)","review":"I have been a fan of Mrs. Schuster's for a long time. Her books are always captivating. Her stories provide vivid details of how men and women are supposed to treat one another and love one another. Both Judge and Julian prove that they know what they want and how to get what they want. I truly enjoyed reading about Ruth finding love again after she terrible experience. Julian and Maya proved that love does last even through heartache. I can't wait until Ms. Schuster writes about the rest of the Deveraux men."},{"Title":"Before The Storm (Arabesque)","review":"I brought the new year in reading this book and I'm so happy I did! Before the Storm was a pleasure to read, as are all of Ms. Schuster's books. Her stories about the Deveraux/Cochran family always leave you wanting more. With this book you get to two stories in one, without one story overpowering the other. In most romance novels, the characters are in their late 20's or in their 30's. Julian \\"Mac\\" Deveraux Sr. and Ruth \\"Aunt Ruth\\" Bennett are an older couple and BOY OH BOY, they have just as much fire and passion as the younger folks...if not more. They could teach the younger ones a little something. I loved reading about them falling in love and showing each other just how much they loved one another.Julian, Jr. was no slouch either. The way that he handles his situation with Maya is amazing. After falling in love, marrying and divorcing Maya he vows to never love again. Four years later they reunite and....get the book, you won't be disappointed!!If this is your first Melanie Schuster novel, believe me, it won't be your last. I know that you will love this story and like many of us you'll become a fan for life!

Not only does Melanie give us a great story, but she gives us two for the price of one do you hear we get TWO DEVERAUX and they are OH SO FINEEEE. Mac & Ruth story is off the change. I enjoyed reading their love story so much because it shows that couple in there 50's still has it going on Mac was something else and his sons can learn a thing or too from him. Mac & Ruth story shows that LOVE A SECOND TIME AROUND IS GOOD even thought Ruth has never been married she has been in love, and we all know that Mac was deeply in love with his wife this is a muture love story and you will love it.Now Julian, Jr. and Maya story you will get to see another side of Julian and of course you get to see Paris do some a little more match making as well. Paris is a wonderful sister and her brother will do anything for her in the world. When Julian meet Maya he knew she would be his wife and we know once those Deveraux make us there mind there is nothing you can do to change it, and he is know different. Julian and Maya was married, but just like all marriage things happen and it seem that they was happy for a while at least Julian thought so, but as in all relationship nother is perfect. I can't give to much away, but PLEASE READ THE BOOK YOU WILL LOVE IT.Thanks MelanieLouise"},{"Title":"Before The Storm (Arabesque)","review":"After reading the summary for the book I was very interested in getting to know Maya and Julian Jr. story; however, the book focused on Ruth and Mac's story.

I would have even appreciated if the stories were more intertwined, but Maya and Julian's story fel to the waste side.

I especially loved the relationship between the Judge and Ruth. They give hope to us middle aged folk. They were like a fine wine. I am so glad there wasn't a bunch of drama before they could get to the meat of their relationship. Julian and Maya were meant to be together and I am so happy their reunion wasn't long and drawn out. Ms Schuster cut to the chase with both of these stories, which why I love her writing so much. You don't have to endure endless love/hate drama before these characters become a couple. Although this is part of the Cochran/Devereau stories, you won't feel lost reading this story first, however I guarantee once you've finished it you are gonna want to read the others in the series too!

It goes to show what great lengths this woman's love went to share her daughter with a family that she would one day meet and greet.

If you are looking for a toast for a particular situation, just go to the category index in the front pages and thumb your way through.You will laugh, you will learn, you may even get a little grossed out.

I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Toasts: Over 1,500 of the Best Toasts, Sentiments, Blessings, and Graces","review":"Like a real pro, Paul Dickson has produced, actually concocted, a rich compendium of examples and answers to any query and questions about toasting and hosting. Getting a copy even helped me articulate my sincere attestations when I entertain a few close friends and acquaintances in my modest home; though frequently with coffee or irish cream or shandy, seldom with wine.Dickson does not preach, he guides and suggests. As your reading progresses, you easily learn, comprehend and take heart what is appropriate if perfect, and then sense what to avoid or perceive what is uncalled for when giving someone or something a toast.This book is not only amusing. It's a deliciously entertaining and concrete fount of infos and references for fledgling hosts and party impresarios.

The introduction and &quot;Brief History of Raised Glasses&quot; provides a brief, gentle, and highly useful education so that you can oh so suavely back up immediately any question or challenge to the quote you've chosen from this cornucopia of highly organized toasts for just about any occasion imaginable.The illustrations are superfluous, but the footnotes are very, very useful. At first glance a bit pedantic, they allow the user of the toast to speak (and understand) the traditional language, such as &quot;stook,&quot; &quot;murphies,&quot; and &quot;banns.&quot; The different subject areas, plainly intuitive, and listed alphabetically in the table of contents include such further instructive chapters as &quot;Hints for Effective Toasting,&quot; &quot;Odd Customs,&quot; a &quot;Selected Toast and Tipple Glossary,&quot; and &quot;Skoaling.&quot; The different subject areas are also modestly cross-referenced to each other, such as the entry &quot;see also 'friendship;' 'general;' 'guests'&quot; concluding the &quot;Hosts and Hostesses&quot; section.

This book is aimed not for the police or for military personnel, but for an audience that is most likely to carry the snubby revolver--civilians who want something light and comfortable for self-defense.With this audience in mind, the book succeeds quite well. He covers not only the basics of loading and firing the gun, but also various concealment holsters, the most effective ammo to use for concealed carry, as well as an honest assessment of the snubby's stopping power compared to heavier semi-automatics.True, he doesn't say much about tactics, but that's not the point of the book. NO book on handgunning can substitute for a good class in gun safety, marksmanship, and conflict avoidance.Personally, and I know I'm going to ruffle some feathers with this statement, I don't see any good reason for a civilian to carry any other weapon than a revolver for self-defense. While semi-automatics are good for cops and military personnel who sometimes require more firepower and greater ammunition capacity, the fact is that civilian gunfights are over in about 2.5 shots on average. Lovette states it succinctly in his book: \\"Most gunfights are resolved within the capacity of the five or six rounds the revolver carries. Reloading is necessary in about 10 percent of the documented gunfights involving revolvers. There is a great deal of truth to the fact that if you have to reload during the gunfight, you are either missing a lot or you bought the wrong weapon.\\" In short, revolvers are simple, reliable and provide more than enough firepower for the vast majority of civilian gunfights. This book provides important information and is a good starting point for anyone looking for a comfortable concealed weapon."},{"Title":"The Snubby Revolver: The ECQ, Backup, and Concealed Carry Standard, Revised and Updated Edition","review":"The Snub-nose Revolver could be classified as a subject in much need of discussion but with limited material available. This is why I wanted to read this book since the snubby .38 Special or .357 Mag is a very common carry gun by licensed civilians and used as a back up by law enforcement officers. There have been many instances cited where this type of gun saved someone's life.There are flashes of brilliance written in this book but mostly the author loses momentum very quickly and you're wanting for more. Another reviewer stated that this book was a compilation of \\"gunzine articles\\" and though I am not sure if it was, the book certainly could flow better.Some examples of things I liked were the reloading of the revolver. One pearl was that you should reload opposite the way the cylinder rotates so if you have to slap the cylinder shut and fire in a hurry the bullets that were loaded will be available to be shot. Also his technique for aiming at just two cylinder holes versus all five or six promotes accurate and less cumbersome reloading. The author knows the different types of snub nose revolvers and though I would have liked him to be a bit more descriptive, there are certainly examples for you to look at if you are thinking of getting one.Some things that were big misses: His chapter on the trigger and use of the front sight was just a tease. There are many important factors regarding trigger control that are absolutely necessary for the snub nose revolver to shine and it is glossed over at best. He barely mentions dry firing which is an intricate part of mastering this type of gun if you want to learn how to shoot it well. The proper grip is very important and this is barely covered. The small barrel of the snubby means that you need every tool available to shoot it accurately and take advantage of its close quarters capabilities and the author just doesn't take the time to discuss this. When I tried to learn the revolver I found that I had to hold the gun with no thumb pressure or I would string laterally. I also needed to shoot it with my strong hand gripping the gun no harder than shaking a man's hand or I would shoot low. A shooting wheel like the one in the US Army pistol manual would really help you at the range and the snubby needs as perfect control as you can muster to hit your target, especially at distances greater than 5 yards. You may want to look at www.sportshooter.com in the target section for this wheel. It is free to download. The chapter on tactics is just awful. The author interjects examples, which do not contribute much to the points he is discussing. It just seems to fill up paper.The book has helpful sections, don't get me wrong, but it could have been a lot better and though it misses its mark it is nice to see a book about a very useful weapon be promoted. The one thing I absolutely agree with the author on is that the first rule of any gunfight is to have a gun and the snub nose revolver makes that a lot easier."},{"Title":"The Snubby Revolver: The ECQ, Backup, and Concealed Carry Standard, Revised and Updated Edition","review":"This is a decent book but the title is a bit misleading. There were only about 3 chapters specifically on the snubby. I don't regret buying it but as someone who carries a snubby daily, I didn't learn anything new."},{"Title":"The Snubby Revolver: The ECQ, Backup, and Concealed Carry Standard, Revised and Updated Edition","review":"\\"Some things endure because they do what they do better than anything that can be designed to replace them. And so it is with the short-barreled revolver.\\" So says Ed Lovette on page 15 of THE SNUBBY REVOLVER, and I think he's exactly right.For most civilian purposes, revolvers, though they may not be as sexy or cool as tricked-out autoloaders, are superior in practical terms. And for concealed carry, it's very hard to beat a good snubby -- it's simple to use and very reliable; when concealed, its rounded, irregular outline generally doesn't 'print' through clothing as much as an auto; and, to me one of the best advantages over an automatic is that you can leave a revolver fully loaded indefinitely and not worry about any spring fatigue (which can be a problem with autopistol magazines, no matter how high their quality, if you leave em loaded long enough.) For all those reasons, I'm a snubby sixgun fan and was delighted to find a book devoted to them. I found a lot of good information and pointers here (I really liked the stuff on knives as supplements to the snubby), and overall the book was an enjoyable, fast read. The author seems to know his stuff, with a background that includes Special Forces, law enforcement, and the CIA.All that said, I'll agree with some of the criticisms of this book: while the parts focused on snubbies were good, there was a lot of space devoted to 'defensive mindset' matters, which, while certainly important, I thought would've been more appropriate in another book. (Ed Lovette even tells you that he co-authored a book on that very subject; why he doesn't just refer you to that, rather than reprinting chunks of it in this book, is beyond me.) And I'll agree that sometimes there are too many short anecdotes, some of which are kind of served up a la carte without a lot of analysis and explanation of their point.But I still think this is a worthwhile book for anyone who carries a concealed weapon or is considering doing so. And I for one appreciated the fact that the author did NOT fill up the book with a bunch of ballistics charts and tables and tiresome lists of makes, models, and specs, as so many 'gunwriters' seem to love doing. I'll take practical real-world advice from an experienced person over the theories of armchair ballistics theorists any day."},{"Title":"The Snubby Revolver: The ECQ, Backup, and Concealed Carry Standard, Revised and Updated Edition","review":"This book provides little useful information for any reader of firearms magazines or internet gun forums. Much of the information is dated, and there are many glaring omissions of current, relevant information on the subject. Issues such as currently available models, ammunition selection and performance, variant comparisons, materials of construction, durability, and carry options are inadequately covered -- if at all.Much of the book has nothing to do with snubby revolvers. Topics like defensive tactics are not covered particularly well, and were apparently inserted in the book to lengthen the page count. They certainly don't add much to the purported subject matter. There are several other books that cover tactics, combat mindset, and related topics far better than Lovette does here.While it may be an easy way to write a book -- republishing a series of old magazine articles -- it hardly makes for a satisfying read in this case. Unless one seeks the most superficial introduction to the subject, pass on this book."},{"Title":"The Snubby Revolver: The ECQ, Backup, and Concealed Carry Standard, Revised and Updated Edition","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. It seems to be primarily an argument of why one should choose the short barreled revolver as a defensive arm( and not a very compelling one at that), but my guess is that most folks contemplating the purchase of this book already own one or more short-barreled revolvers.I have owned and trained with snubbies for years, and was looking for insights on how to use them more effectively. This book failed to deliver much that was very useful to me. The one useful thing I learned was that Crimson Trace offers blue guns with their Lasergrips already installed.I really don't think this book would be of much use to a novice, either.The author gave some IMO very bad advice about choosing ammo types; he advocates Magsafe which offers insufficient penetration for effective use against human predators in all but a few limited circumstances.The book spends a fair amount of time discussing terrorism; this seemed to be a waste of time and ink to me.The author also repeatedly mentioned favorably other books published by the company that published this book, Paladin. I didn't buy this book to get a commercial for Paladin's other products."},{"Title":"The Snubby Revolver: The ECQ, Backup, and Concealed Carry Standard, Revised and Updated Edition","review":"This is a historical perspective of the Snubby for its use, carry and concealment. The text serves as a supplemental text to \\"Defensive Living\\" by the same author. This is by no means an instructional guide. The author covers anectdotal experiences of the advantages of certain carry and concealment methods. He also discusses the choice of ammunition for practical use of the Snubnosed Revolver, practical needs for reloading, using a speedloader, situational awareness, point shooting, and preparational methods. He recommends carrying two guns or a gun + speedloader, and he suggests augmenting your defense plans with non-lethal alternatives. A valuable section is the chapter on thwarting carjacking attempts which seem to be a common occurrence in this current time.If you're looking for an instructional book, this will not suit your needs. If you're looking for the strategies and rationale of the Snubnosed Revolver, this book is a good read."},{"Title":"The Snubby Revolver: The ECQ, Backup, and Concealed Carry Standard, Revised and Updated Edition","review":"Im looking for a carry pistol. This book was very educational. Though I was already leaning toward a revolver.

I was indeed wrong. So far I have read it three times and still find nuggets of information I had missed. I highly recommend it. - Kent Williams"},{"Title":"The Snubby Revolver: The ECQ, Backup, and Concealed Carry Standard, Revised and Updated Edition","review":"This book represents a personal expression of well-justified perspective on the utility and use of the snub-nosed revolver. The author has formed his opinion, and he states it is his opinion and not fact, for preferance over many years of use and his reasonings are well-founded. The latter half offers some dated tactics for use but most still apply in all actuality. If you carry a weapon for defense it is a worthy read for options. If you like the snub-nosed revolver already it is a fascinating offering on its proven utility. It is a slightly dry read at times, but nothing like Ed McGivern thankfully!"},{"Title":"The Snubby Revolver: The ECQ, Backup, and Concealed Carry Standard, Revised and Updated Edition","review":"I found this book to be a waste of time and money. The main focus of the book seemed to be how inadequate the Snubby is for self-defense and I like Snubby revolvers. The author missed or minimized most of the good reasons to carry a revolver other than that they can be lite in weight."},{"Title":"The Snubby Revolver: The ECQ, Backup, and Concealed Carry Standard, Revised and Updated Edition","review":"A concise book covering everything about snubbies (pocket pistol, concealed carry), including background, terminology, accessories, loads, use and care of short pistols. Great book!"},{"Title":"The Snubby Revolver: The ECQ, Backup, and Concealed Carry Standard, Revised and Updated Edition","review":"The updated verstion of Mr. Lovette's book is well-done. The first edition covered the techniques, tactics and tips of carrying and using a snub-nose revolver. This edition updates the first edition by presenting new technology in bullets, sights and laser sites. The author provides real-life experience and the knowledge he obtained in law enforcement and intelligence work to present the information throughout. He does not waste time with charts and ballistic testing. Rather he outlines actual events and applies them to the average citizen with a CCW. There is no bull@#$% in this book. JUST WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW."},{"Title":"The Snubby Revolver: The ECQ, Backup, and Concealed Carry Standard, Revised and Updated Edition","review":"Not long and drawn out, but it gets the correct info and message it is designed to deliver, and it is worth the money any day of the week. After years of semi autos, I now carry a S&W 360PD, and this book had a small part in helping me recognize what I was missing. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Snubby Revolver: The ECQ, Backup, and Concealed Carry Standard, Revised and Updated Edition","review":"I read the book and thought that it was thoughtful and well written. I enjoyed the organization and layout coupled with the historical and personal information. It helped me to understand the nature and the real intended purpose of the weapon. Even though I have been carrying the snub for over 30 years now, it never hurts to review and to be reminded. I would highly recommend this book to the novice and the veteran gun public it is chock full of helpful tips and information."},{"Title":"The Snubby Revolver: The ECQ, Backup, and Concealed Carry Standard, Revised and Updated Edition","review":"Although the writing is a bit confusing at times, it is a good read for the price. Validates the reason why I buy revolvers & carry them as main firepower & as backup to another revolver or pistol."},{"Title":"The Snubby Revolver: The ECQ, Backup, and Concealed Carry Standard, Revised and Updated Edition","review":"This is without a doubt the very best book I have ever read that addresses the practical and conceptual issues of self defense using an easily carryable weapon.The author obviously has a wealth of in-depth real world expertise, including CIA experience, and he does a great job of \\"teaching\\" its high points within this short but highly focused book. He also uses excellent, true life illustrative examples.This book gets my strongest recommendation.Jim G"},{"Title":"The Snubby Revolver: The ECQ, Backup, and Concealed Carry Standard, Revised and Updated Edition","review":"Ed does a good job of outlining the values of the snub nose revolver. He discusses the simple advantages of this reliable handgun. Methods of carry and tactics are outlined as well. Ed's experience in law enforcement training has given him first-hand experience in extreme close quarter fighting. He has passed these experiences to us by sprinkling them in the book to help prove his training points. My recommendation: read this book, take the NRA firearms training course, read the book again, get a CCW and keep reading this book. The government in many states is too paralized to protect the citizens and it also is too paranoid to allow the citizens to have access to the means to protect themselves. They have lost the moral and ethical standing to deny YOU the right and means to protect YOURSELF. This book is a keeper."},{"Title":"The Snubby Revolver: The ECQ, Backup, and Concealed Carry Standard, Revised and Updated Edition","review":"Good book with lots of anecdotes about the author's time as a CIA paramilitary handgun trainer. The thing about hanguns that a lot of people forget is that if you have to use a handgun for defensive purposes, it will be within 5 feet, and will be over within 3 seconds (on average). Thus, having a gun and getting it into the fight fast is critical, not whether or not you can hit a bullseye at 25 meters, or fire off 17 rounds in a row. Also, the thing most people forget is that during a confrontation, if the bad guy grabs your autopistol, you might not be able to fire it again, because the slide can stick. With a revolver, you don't have to worry about that. If the bad guy gets his hand on your gun, it is much harder to render the gun ineffective."},{"Title":"The Snubby Revolver: The ECQ, Backup, and Concealed Carry Standard, Revised and Updated Edition","review":"I bought this book thinking it would be more of a history of the snub nosed revolver or a review of current models or something like that. It's more of a tactics book devoted to people who for whatever reason go around poorly armed, with just a snub nose."},{"Title":"The Snubby Revolver: The ECQ, Backup, and Concealed Carry Standard, Revised and Updated Edition","review":"I have just finished reading the book. In fact, I've read it twice. I've made my 14 adn 12 year old daughters read it. It not only lays down the basics of a short barrel revolver, but persoanl awareness and survivablity. I'm not a military or active cop. I'm a armed civillian, with more than just the basic training of weapons and tactics.First of all, the author layed out the book very well. It flowed from subject to subject nicely. Enough \\"war stories\\" in to keep the reader interested and to show why a snubbie in this or that situation worked or would have worked better. Not Monday morning quarterbacking, just some good critical thinking.Second the author lays out, to the reader, what the reader should be looking for in weapon and personal awareness training. And no book is going to replace personal training, be it from big name schools for the local range. The author has gathered several real life examples and gives a great layout of what a regular person can do, if faced with a serious threat. The author does state that alot of the reason these regular folks survived is due to their mindset of wanting to survive. And no amount of training and class time is going to help you there. And during research, the author found no \\"prfessionally\\" trained gun fighters or big name instructed victims, just plain old folks who read, watched, or was shown how to work the revolver or weapon. And, its a snubbie, so there isn't alot of \\"cool\\" drills you can do with it. The author suggest upclose to contact range shooting and unarmed protection practice. Sorry if this makes the range drill masters mad and wanting more. Simple is , simple does.Third, the author is open minded about the snub nosed revolver and lays out its pluses and minuses. He goes over smaller calibers vs larger ones, 38 vs 357, and 5 shots vs 6 shots. As far as holsters, ammo, and other gunnie stuff, the author touches base and theses and gives the reader other venues to follow if the short list isn't enough. But truefully, its a snubbie, and there isn't much you can do with it except shoot it, carry it in a holster, and clean it. Sometimes I think that is why the snubbie gets shunned by \\"serious\\" shooters, not enough add ons.Even if you don't have a short barrel revolver, you can get your money's worth out of the information on personal awareness and what to do in a carjacking or kidknapping.Jerry"},{"Title":"The Snubby Revolver: The ECQ, Backup, and Concealed Carry Standard, Revised and Updated Edition","review":"Not very informative.

That role had historically been filled by the venerable and reliable \\"snubby\\" revolver. Lovette provides a proper perspective on what an ECQ (or CQB) weapon should be, and why the snubby is far from obsolete. Indeed, it often remains the professional's choice. Well written, it is a highly recommended addition to anyone's gun library. Here is an informative and entertaining read that will provide valuable insights regarding choices in personal defense firearms; a reality check against the heavily marketed semi-auto pocket pistol.

The issues Jeffrey deals with in this book are SOUL issues. It is just that he has accessed the place through himself as a man and through all his vast experience in dealing with the LIFE issues of other men as well.My husband and I are also Wilderness Guides and have discovered that we humans seem to best be able to reach the depths of our own souls when we first explore who we are as men or women apart from the other sex. The confusion, judgment, and competition of sexual energy is thereby easily escaped and space for clearer self understanding prevails.This book is one in which to pause and digest as it is read, as the author himself suggests. In stopping to deeply consider the issue discussed, I have more than once discovered healing truths,--gifts from my own soul.If you want a vehicle to help you hear and hold ALL the pieces of our story as humans, read this book."},{"Title":"Stories of Men, Meaning, and Prayer: The Reconciliation of Heart and Soul in Modern Manhood","review":"For those truly interested in personal discovery, growth, understanding and a better internal and external life, this is a must read book.

Whether male, female, an elder or a youth, if you are on a quest for better inner understanding and outer living, you'll benefit from this book.

From the moment the door of the room at the top of the stairs is opened for her by sympathetic and sensitive housekeeper, Mrs Pilton, imaginative and lonely Sabrina conjurs up an entire history revolving around the room's previous inhabitant, Hilary Shenstone. The Shenstones own Nuns Farthing and the youngest son, Hilary is off in India carrying on in his father's dangerous tradition of intrepid Englishman working for the Home Office. As Sabrina thumbs through Hilary's library at home, we glimpse a bit of the adventure of Hilary's life as his plane goes down miles away from Nuns Farthing. Instantaneously, thoughts of his childhood mysteriously and irrationally capture his mind, and Hilary finds this inexplicable longing compells him to make the long journey home. After much soul-seeking and understanding, Hilary reconciles with his old life and moves towards his new one back at the home of his childhood. When he arrives, Mrs. Pilton recognizes him on sight and sends him with her blessings up to his old room where she knows Sabrina innocently awaits. And as Hilary first lays eyes on the lovely fresh-faced girl, he realizes why he was driven to make this homecoming---this is the girl he is destined for, the ONE he has been waiting for up until now to make his wife. Sabrina already half in love with him from her own imaginings, cannot help but fall for him, head over heels. Magical halycon days lie ahead for a couple star crossed in their love for one another . . .except for one slight detail . . . Hilary died in the plane in India.Sound intriguing? It is. Written in a sweet yet unsentimental way that is perfect for all age groups, the story moves along swiftly, keeping the reader wondering 'what is to become of the two lovers?' living on different planes. The likeable characters epitomize the era between the World Wars; the politeness and sensibilities portrayed enhance Sabina's wistful frustrations and emphasize Hilary's desperate need to make this one last connection work.This bittersweet love story is recommended to all who love spending a rainy afternoon watching romantic black&amp;white films while fantasizing about that perfect lover."},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"Agreeing with all the other reviewers, this is one of the best romantic stories I have ever read, as well as a stunning and beautifully handled novel on the afterlife. Along with the film The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, Tryst is one of the wonderful stories about love that truly meant something, not like what we read about or see in films lately. The book is emotionally moving, but also intelligent, being a contrast to a lot of the nonsense being written these days. This is a hopeful story as well as a tragic one, and it has haunted me for nearly 30 years. I was ecstatic to discover it was in print!"},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"I read this book when I was in high school, remembered it deeply, clearly, and have hunted for a copy of it for nearly two decades. It's a very sweet love story, with all the undercurrents and tensions of complex human lives. I agree with the reviewer that said that the situation of the out-of-sync lovers is both memorable and so deftly resolved.I loved this book enough to search it out after decades of remembering it."},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"This book is one of the memorable ones from my adolescence. I was a freshman in high school at Ursuline Academy in Wilmington Dealware, when my school had a book fair with a bookmobile full of new books for sale. I picked out Tryst, read it, fell in love with it, and read it over and over again through my high school years. It was the perfect read for an introverted, bookish teenage girl who, like Sabrina, had a much more romantic idea of love than what passed for romance with the silly boys wanting to make out in the back seats of cars.Hilary and Sabrina - a love story, a ghost story, a romance of adventure even though Sabrina never leaves the staid English countryside.I have a used book business now, and I listed my battered old copy of Tryst for sale, for $26. I couldn't resist, most mass market paperbacks have far less resale value. Obviously, there are others who appreciate this book and love it as I do.Yesterday somebody bought my copy. So I had to give it one last read. i stayed up all night, carefully turning pages so as not to make a well-worn book even more so. I just finished it again, and will ship it tomorrow. Sigh. Will I ever see the book again? It is true, it reads as well for a 55 year old as for a 14 year old."},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"...perfectly balanced, perfectly plotted, and perfectly wonderful.I wish I had written this book. I wish I *could* have written this book. Tryst is the story of a love that death could not destroy, and is my favorite romance book ever. Sabrina and Hilary transcend time, and their love will widen the range of your heart."},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"Simply put, TRYST is the single most romantic book I've ever read. Sweet without being soppy, romantic without being cheaply sentimental, TRYST is the wistful, delightful love story of Sabrina and Hilary, two of the most truly lovable characters in all of fiction. Forget the box of Kleenex -- grab yourself a lace-edged linen handkerchief and a sunny window seat and revel in a pure true love that death can't end and time can't cheat."},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"\\"You will find yourself reading this one over and over. The plight of these out-of-sync lovers and the resolution is very touching. It has many moments of light humor, wonderful descriptions of England in that period and well-developed characters. Treat yourself to this wonderful book.\\" (my earlier review)Ms Thane's descriptions are perfect of the young girl's fascination with the forbidden room in their rented country house and of Hilary Shenstone return from a premature death. The characters and situations delight the reader. The romance touches my feelings with each rereading."},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"I was introduced to TRYST in 1967 when I was a high school senior. I have read TRYST again every year and still love it dearly. What is it about this extraordinary book, written in the 1930s that still holds so many of us enthralled? The idea of eternal love, that death is no barrier to? Young Sabrina, sheltered by her aloof father and somewhat dingy aunt, comes to a home called Nuns Farthing and falls in love with an absent son of the family -- away on a mission in India. She loves him sight unseen and waits for his return. But the Fates have thrown them a curve ball. Nonetheless, Hilary and Sabrina find one another. The philosophies in this book come out the more you read -- the thing you're reaching for won't be there until it's time for you to have it. Hilary and Sabrina may be star-crossed lovers, but their story is one that continues to touch the hearts of all who read it. It is timeless -- in every sense of the word."},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"I was first introduced to this book by Miss Florence Naudain, the high school librarian at Corinth Central School in upstate New York. It was the late 1960's or early 1970's--I graduated in 1974. I went to her and asked for a \\"ghost story,\\" and she suggested Tryst.Miss Naudain knew best, and this romantic tale has stayed in my mind all this time. I finally bought a copy from Amazon and finished reading it last night--I thought about reading only a few pages a day to draw it out and keep the story from ending but I couldn't stop reading it. It was as wonderful as I had remembered, and the tears were flowing down my face by the last page. Wonderful!"},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"No other book compares! My favorite since I first read it when I was 13. Every time I read it my heart aches for Hilary and Sabrina's misfortune. Miss Thane weaves a rather believable ghost love story that you will want to read over and over again!!"},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"Book was exactly as described. This is a hard to find book! I was extremly happy to find and acquire it"},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"Tryst, written by Elswyth Thane, is a book that I read (many years ago) as a teenager, and fell in love with the characters in the book and the whole romance of the story. I have been looking for the book for the past several years and finally found it on Amazon.com. Although I enjoyed reading it again, I did not find it as exciting, or as romantic, as I did when I was a teenager. I realy hope my view on romance has not changed all that much since that time, as I do enjoy romance novels very much."},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"I first read this book when I was around thirteen, and loved it so much that I have read it at least once a year since then, guarding my paperback copy carefully ( which I must, since I'm 56 now, and that makes both the book--and I!!--practically antiques!!)If it found it's way onto the bestseller lists today, this story would be an instant classic. But unfortunately, it was published way back in 1939, long before the world coined the term \\"YA (young adult) novel\\". Unfortunate indeed, since this lyrical supernatural romance has a simplicity of writing and a depth of emotion that puts the 'Twilight' characters to shame.So:1) why has this beautiful book been out of print for so long?2) why hasn't anyone discovered it, written a screenplay for it, tracked down the required small but elegant British cast, and turned it into the next big thing in YA films?It is so truly unfortunate that a quiet little masterpiece like this is allowed to fade into obscurity. What steps can be taken to bring these overlooked, forgotten books back into the public consciousness where they belong?Since that probably won't happen, heed this review, find a copy if you can, and cherish it for the subtle, understated gem that it is."},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"Like so many of the other reviewers, I first read this book in high school, over 50 years ago. And I still love it. I have a copy set aside for my granddaughter when she becomes a teen. I hope she remembers it as fondly as I."},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"I read this book years ago when I was a teenager. I had read all of Elswyth Thanes Williamsburg novels and loved them, and decided to read one of her other books. I chose Tryst. It is a very different story from her other books, not a historical novel, but a romantic ghost story. It is a lovely story for a girls first romance novel, and I looked for it all over to give to my 14 year old granddaughter, who loves Twilight. I think she will like this book too. It was hard to find, only on Amazon was I able to find it at a reasonable price."},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"I read this book as a young adult and fell in love with the story. I managed to get a copy of the book but unfortunately it was stolen some seventeen years later. Since then we've emigrated to New Zealand and for the past 30 odd years have been keeping an eye out for a copy - finally, I got lucky on Amazon! It's a lovely story of young love and how, by a twist of fate, two young lives do not turn out the way they were supposed to. It is set during the beginning of WWII - some may say it's predictable however, there is an unexpected twist at the end. A great read for a cold, wet afternoon by the fire."},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"The Romance Collection (The Lake House / The Phantom of the Opera / You've Got Mail)I first read \\"Tryst\\" after reading Elswyth Thane's Williamsburg Series while in high school in the 1950s. Over the years I have collected the Williamsburg Series and reread the seven books many times. This weekend I watched The Lake House on television, and although it isn't clear that the plot is a ghost story, it reminded me so much of \\"Tryst\\". Today I ordered \\"Tryst\\" to add to my collection so that I might own a copy to reread and added a DVD of The Lake House to be able to watch the film often. I was an English and history teacher for many years, recently retired, and recommended the book to a number of my students. They loved Thane's books also; therefore, romance and belief in enduring love really haven't totally gone out of style.

I explained it was a story about love forbidden by circumstance with an ending which is simultaneously tragic and sublime. I remembered how this story had touched my heart, and although I had subsequently read hundreds of books, it still remained one of my favorites. I just turned 34, and my aunt found this book on amazon.com and gave it to me for my birthday. I feel like I have just found a long lost friend, and I can't wait to read it again! In fact, I think I'll start it right now...."},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"As so many others have said, I read this wonderful book in the 60s and the treasured memory of it has stayed with me. I found a paperback copy about 10 years ago and, not without trepidation, reread Tryst. Not to worry--my feelings about the book had not changed! It will always be in my library--the perfect book."},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"This is just quite simply one of the most romantic, satisfying, and wonderful books that I have ever read."},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"I remembered this book from my teenage years, and it has &quot;haunted&quot; me ever since. It is a love story which explains the inevitability of union when two souls are aligned. Brought to a quiet English country house by her professor father and maided aunt, our shy, bookish heroine is quite content to be tucked away in the hinterlands. She has no suspicion that her life will be forever changed, or rational explaination for why she is so irresistibly drawn to the locked room at the top of the stairs. On the other hand, our hero only knows that he must follow his unreasoning desire to get home, and is all the more determined to do so after the drama and strain in the Asian desert, his most recent completion of what the high commissioner always called the &quot;almost impossible.&quot; Death, someone explained, only ends a life; it does not end a relationship. In &quot;Tryst,&quot; it begins one."},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"Tryst has \\"haunted\\" me for 30 years...I'm not a Harlequin Romance type, but my librarian recommended it as a \\"ghost story\\" when I was 12, and I've remembered it ever since. The book \\"Portrait of Jenny\\", by Robert Nathan, is the only one that even comes close and is one of my all-time favorite movies. I can't believe that Hollywood has overlooked Tryst. I am thrilled to find a copy and to read the reviews from those who were likewise affected by this beautiful book."},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"I agree with all the other reviews- I read this book 30 years ago and was delighted to find a beat-up paperback copy for my &quot;permanent&quot; library. I reread it about once a year. It's a simple, lovely story in charming language and one of Ms. Thane's classics."},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"I first read this book in l946 and have never forgotten it. I recently purchased it from Amazon books and will always treasure it. It is a love story on two planes. In 1946 the after-life was not widely written about, but is just as mysterious today as it was then. A beautiful story."},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"This book represents what an American author thought was the &quot;ideal&quot; of English country living in the graceful period of butterfly collections, duty to country, and &quot;public&quot; schools. It's the melding of the Edwardian age with its &quot;God and country&quot; patriotism with the modern hustle bustle of life--and the Edwardian age definitely comes out ahead. I still have my very yellowed paperback copy published by Tempo Books in 1962 and purchased by me for 50 cents. I can't wait to receive my new hardcopy which I shall retain (along with my old friend). I read this book as a teenager and think I'll go read it again this afternoon. My images of England are inextricably painted by the language Miss Thane used--tea and crumpets always sounded so &quot;civilized&quot; to me. I highly recommend this as a counter to the cynicism of modern times."},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"What is it about this book? I too read Tryst as a teenager and could not forget the book. It has taken me 20+ years but I've managed to acquire all of Elswyth Thane's novels. I have a large library but Tryst and the Williamsburg books remain solid favorites (although one does have to ignore some pretty dated language on the subject of race in the Williamsburg books). If you loved this book and haven't read any other Thane titles, give them a try -- The Williamsburg books are a singularly lovely way to learn American history!"},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"This is one of my personal favorties of Ms. Thane's fictional works. Her writing style is simple, but elegant, and I really felt like I could identify with her heroine, Sabrina. This is a truly classic love story and ghost story interwoven into one delightful book you'll want to read over and over again."},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"I've just finished this incredible book and my eyes are red and snot is dripping from my nose and I have the worst headache from sobbing uncontrollably, and all I can say is I wish I could feel this way more often about a book.- I LOVED this book.- I ADORED this book.- I wish I had written this book.- I wish this was one of those black & white movies from old Hollywood ala \\"The Ghost & Mrs. Muir\\".- I wish I had read this when I was 17 years old.and my highest praise of all....wait for it....it's coming....drumroll....- If this book was a man, it would be Richard Armitage....;DThis book was pure romantic escapism, pure comfort, pure old-fashioned delight, simply charming, and utterly delicious. This simple ghost/love story, written in 1939, was what A Certain Slant of Light should have been, as it tells the story of a dead man and a live woman who try to bridge the gap between life and death. Their love story is dream-like, poignant, bittersweet and very touching, and if I have one complaint (and I do), it is that writer Elswyth Thane brought this story to a completely unnecessary abrupt end, and left me feeling like a baby whose pacifier had been taken. Three more pages would have been reading perfection.If you enjoy clean, cozy, totally romantic, 2-hanky love stories, find this hard-to-find novel at your library, used book store or granny's bookcase and give yourself a treat.You can thank me later :)"},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"Elswyth Thane's TRYST made an indellible impression on me when I frist read it as a teenager.

I love it! I taught middle school English for 27 years, and every year I would try to get several of my students to read it. My brother got me a leather bound reprinted copy for my birthday and I reread it at least once a year. It is a perfect book for a cold, rainy day snuggled up with a hot cup of tea and a warm afgan. In fact, after looking at this site I think I'll reread it again tomorrow."},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"TrystI really was being to think that I was the only one who had read and been haunted by this book.

And when she climbs the stairs to the locked, forbidden room, impelled by something stronger than curiosity, she enters into enchantment. When Hilary Shenstone, British secret agent, takes on one more dangerous mission on the Indian frontier, he is dogged by unreasoning homesickness. Even his death wound does not release him from the growing necessity to return to his home in the hills. Sabrina and Hilary were born to meet, and they do meet in that quiet book-lined room--perhaps not quite as they were meant to.

The first read was from the library. I couldn't remember the title or author. I've watched used books for years without success. Thanks to amazon and their search category!!

It illustrates the dilemma faced by executives of established companies when disruptive technologies emerge from laboratories. With his meticulous studies on the data from different industry fields, primarily the disk drive industry, Professor Christensen effective demonstrates the model of disruptive technologies and analyzes the impact caused by disruptive innovations.

The dilemma; the logical, competent decisions of management that are critical to the success of their companies are also the cause of company's losing the leadership position and possible demise. This is a must read for anyone who works for or belongs to the management team of a technology company. The innovator's Dilemma, deals with changes in technologies that cause disruptions in existing technology growth trends. Management is aware of the customer requirements. Customer is the source of all revenue. These customers have their requirements which are based on sustaining technology. Market share of the disruptive technology is not large enough for the company to meet its growth requirements based on the projected stock prices. This new disruptive technology has a much lower margin and therefore not feasible for the company to go to that market. What is the motivation for the company to commit its resources? Especially, when there is not guarentee that this technology will ever be viable. Managers in every organization must resolve &quot;the innovator's dilemma.&quot; Dr. Christensen's book provides examples from different market segments when time and again company have fallen pray to disruptive technologies. Even those companies, who once used a disruptive technology to attain its market leadership. The author argues that even the most successful companies fall victim the Innovator's Dilemma, because it is a natural law of business, satisfy the customers' requirement.

I felt that it also dwelt a little bit too much in the raw data rather than providing analysis of the results as well as direction. That said however the book is certainly a worthwhile read for anyone in business as it covers a rather unique topics that I don't remember seeing elsewhere.The major topic around disruptive technologies and their impact is truly a fascinating study and some of the conclusion are very much unexpected.

The &quot;Disruptive&quot; technology developments are those which don't immediately seem to meet the established customer's demands. The basic problem is that often the large companies get blindsided by disruptive technology, and they either don't react, or react too late. Normally someone will figure out a slightly new market for the disruptive technology, improve the basic process, drive down the costs, and then go after the more established markets.Clayton shows how this model applies to a number of different industries over the last hundred years. He has a lot of hard data from the Disk Drive industry, but he mentions a number of other industries which underwent fundamental changes, and shows how the old companies were not able to adapt to the changes.&quot;The Innovator's Dilemma&quot; and &quot;Crossing the Chasm&quot; go well together. They are addressing many of the same issues from different perspectives. Clayton Christensen is looking at changes in the market place from the point of view of the large established companies, while Geoffrey A. Moore is coming from the other direction, that of a small startup company with some new cool technology. Clayton is more concerned with technology, while Geoffrey is focused on more on marketing issues.This is a very well written book, good for anyone in business. It reads well, and I found it very thought provoking. There are a lot of good ideas here."},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"What more can be said about this book that hasn't already? Even an individual contributing developer like myself in a non-management role benefits from it, as there are great examples of how new products move from niche to mainstream and upset their competitors. After reading it, you should understand why it's so dangerous to keep your head down and *only* listen to your current and up-market growth customers.The only downside to the book is the lack of practical advice on how to avoid being out-innovated, and Christensen's follow-on book, _The Innovator's Solution_, nicely addresses even that."},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"In my 15 years in high tech, I've seen many established companies being done in by smaller competitors. While this is going all we would all shake our heads at the stupidity of the management of the large companies ... couldn't they see the trends?This book gives the first lucid explanation of why this happens. It shows that the managers were not being stupid. On the contrary, they were doing exactly what their customers wanted them to do ... and what they could afford to do.This book also lays out an excellent foundation that allows you to recognize the pattern and accurately predict where it could happen again.Great work!"},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"There are many helpful reviews here, but they're long. In a nutshell: Christiansen points out that makers of high-quality products can't merely pamper their customers. They must also be alert to new low-quality products that may eventually improve so much that they steal those customers.A prominent example is Kodak. Digital photos started out with a fraction of the clarity of photos from film. Then digital cameras improved until they drove Kodak out of business.Kodak isn't an example in the book; digital was only a threat when the book came out. But Christiansen could have predicted it. He very ably describes the vulnerabilities of successful companies to unlikely competitors."},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"This book had a profound influence on my thinking when I read it, in the year it was first published. The concept of disruptive technology is potent - a proof of its influence is that virtually every business looking for funding claims to be disruptive! - and the level-headed description of how successful businesses drive calmly and steadily over cliffs makes sobering reading.The central case series (if that's the way to put it) studies the hard disk industry, and the way that relatively humdrum changes have led to seismic changes in industry leadership. The book observes what could be the next wave of change - but with the benefit of hindsight the implied conclusion (that the 2.5\\" disk manufacturers would take industry leadership) certainly hasn't played out - certainly not as dramatically as the previous generations.So does that invalidate the text? Hardly. Its core value is in documenting real events and identifying the human and organizational tendency to ignore inconvenient truths and to squander market position. You have to think of Blackberry - a bright star when the book was published; of Dell - hardly a failure, but an industry revolutionary that's failed to live up to its promise; and the converse example of Apple - who went from nearly dead to totally dominant by making small but disruptive innovations that overturned two categories and created a third.I know a lot of people who talk about this book but, when pressed, admit they haven't actually read it. A lot of the business books on my shelf don't need to be read through in detail: read the summary boxes and you have the value. \\"The Innovator's Dilemma\\" is a book you need to read all the way through, or you'll reach logical but utterly wrong conclusions about both what Christensen is saying and what the case studies demonstrate.So read this book with confidence. Don't be put off that the examples look back a few years: Clayton Christensen is one of the most influential business thinkers of 2012, and this book is the perfect introduction to his insightful style.As a complementary read, why not tryPoke the Box? This is a book from a very different kind of author. But there's a thread that joins the two: Seth Godin is the constant advocate of new business thinking, pointing the way to disruptive change; Christensen is the documenter of the potential consequences for managers and corporations who choose to ignore this rising tide."},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"Excellent research into business and innovation.

After reading this interesting piece on business strategy, it is no surprise why executive level management teams enjoy quoting this book. Innovator's Dilemma is a thoroughly researched investigation into an age old business phenomenon: How do businesses who were once dominant players in their industry get displaced by smaller, upcoming rivals?Well documented and lush with real world examples, The Innovator's Dilemma details case studies from a variety of industries where large corporations had the dominant market share and then abruptly lost it to upcoming rivals that seemed to come out of the blue. Did these \\"good\\" companies fail because of poor management? Were these companies blindsided because their organizations were too bureaucratic to react to the marketplace? \\"No\\", says the The Innovator's Dilemma. Many times, a even when a large corporation follows conventional business school training and \\"does all the right things\\", it can still be overcome by a smaller, nimbler newcomer to the market.Two kinds of marketplace changes are outlined: incremental (sustaining) and disruptive technologies. While the R&D; efforts of large companies respond well to incremental changes in technology, they perform poorly against disruptive changes in technology. A disruptive change is when a new technology starts off catering to the needs of a low-end niche market, and then through incremental improvements, becomes a viable contender to the larger dominant players up-market. A host of examples are reviewed to show how this change takes place: the churn of dominant disk drive manufacturers, the shift from cable-based ground excavators to hydraulic excavators, the rise of low-volume high turnover retailers like K-Mart versus the low turnover department store models, the proliferation of small steel manufacturing plants.This book explores why large corporations are so unequipped to deal with disruptive changes. Surprisingly, they often yield to disruptive changes in their marketplace not because of poor management, but because the goals and objectives of such large corporations causes them to overlook the threat posed by the newcomer. Think of how IBM overlooked the advent of the PC because they had the mindset, \\"Why would anyone need a personal computer in their home?\\"Although written in 2002, changes in the marketplace over the last ten years have only given its ideas confirmation. We have seen the Innovator's Dilemma dynamic play out in Apple's iPhone upsetting the dominant Blackberry, the Kindle replace traditional channels of publishing, and the rise of cloud computing beginning to displace established \\"big business\\" ERP companies. The Innovator's Dilemma is an informative and fun read executive teams, marketing managers, entrepreneurs, and anyone with an interest in business strategy."},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"Lots of good assessments in other reviews, but I'll share my take nonetheless.

Required reading for our key staff."},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"The Innovator's Dilemma is a unique approach to understanding corporate failure. Christiansen's thesis is that well managed companies with all the best processes in place do fail. The failure is not due to inefficiency, bad management or bad processes but due to companies being responsible in terms of listening to their customers, investing in technologies that their customers' demand and rationally allocating resources to high-margin products. Christiansen argues that these investments are made on sustaining technologies as opposed to disruptive technologies. He reason's established sector leaders do this because the initial market for disruptive technologies is too small to justify the investment and sustain corporate growth. This provides new entrants with time and space to establish themselves in the emerging market and that when the performance of the disruptive technology intersects the needs placed on the traditional technologies in an industry, these disruptive technologies will start to take over from the traditional sector leaders.Christiansen's thesis is that disruptive technologies exist in value networks with lower cost structures and lower margins than the value networks occupied by market leaders that focus on sustaining technologies and incremental technological developments. Christiansen argues that there are obviously more tangible benefits for competitors in value networks with lower costs structures (and margins) to attack value networks with higher margins. On the contrary, there is very little incentive for companies embedded in high-margin value networks to target sectors in the parallel network. And this then is the dilemma: how do current market leaders grow and develop substitute products that will make their current catalog redundant when the substitutes offer very little margin and won't contribute to the overall growth of the company.Christiansen does suggest a few ways in which managers can facilitate the development of disruptive technologies. He first says managers should not grow disruptive technologies in established companies. Rather he argues they should create separate business units or companies with organizational sizes that match the market size. He also suggests that no one can really forecast the potential of market for disruptive technologies since the market doesn't exist. He suggests that instead of acting that forecasts are accurate, companies should learn and grow together about needed features and applications for their new products.Even though the book was first published in 1997 the ideas are still valid. We have recently seen the rise of netbook computers and while Taiwanese companies are leading the way in the development and innovation of these products, traditional notebook and PC heavyweights like Dell are arguing against entering this market. Responding to Acer's recent rise to the second largest PC company by volume (Q3 09) in the world, Dell suggested they are more concerned with revenue and margin as opposed to volume. Another example closely aligned to the rise of netbooks are ARM processors. ARM processors are low cost processors licensed by a UK company. While they do not have the performance parameters of any of Intel's PC processors and chipsets, ARM processors (low performance, cost, power etc.) have been growing in the mobile phone space and are now entering the computer space through netbook computers on a different business model to Intel's or AMD. Of course Intel crushed AMD through a brutal price war since they both had similar business models. Even though I won't bet against Intel, it will be harder for them to disrupt ARMs growth.Christiansen's book is well argued, clear and concise. His extensive use of case studies from a variety of industries including the hard disk sector, steel mills, discount retailing, and the excavator industries are enlightening and educational. He does reemphasize his points time and time again using different examples but he is merely honing in on his ideas and supporting them from a wide array of industries. It's a good read and essential for managers and executives who have the power to influence investment strategies for firms and resource allocation. However, for most of us who work in the trenches it is interesting and educational and I do recommend it to managers and other's that hope to develop new technologies and applications."},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"This text excels on several levels: It is very readable, and tells a story which is understandable and compelling even at a cursory pace.

Prior to reading this book, the term \\"disruptive technology\\" was foreign to me. I always thought that the large company's misfortunes were largely an indication of how short-sided or greedy their management have become. The more I read, the faster my previous assumptions disappear. We have had many companies come out of no-where and become a technological sensation over night, with products that are destined to become main stream. I never viewed those innovations as disruptive technologies but rather as fresh approaches to the same problems that have existed for sometime, which may seem sound to some, but to others who were focused on that core of business, they will see how some new innovations may spell the death-sentence for some companies as well as retire the current de facto products that are in that void. Christensen also discusses how companies can survive disruptive technology attacks and benefit from them to maintain their active participation as well as leadership in their respective industry. Foresight and the courage to invest in those disruptive technologies is key to keep the core business balanced as well as staying in touch with the new competitors."},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"Today, traditional, well-known and well-respected companies are faced with a marketplace that is suffering from the impact of geopolitical issues of war and terrorism, regional and worldwide economic difficulties, and the extended global reach of formerly regional players. If that were not enough to keep a manager up at night, many are also facing disruptions from rapidly changing technologies. In his book entitled, The Innovator's Dilemma, Clayton Christensen tackles the concept of disruptive technologies - what they are, how they are nurtured, and how they have the potential to turn previously successful companies into the roadkill of capitalism. This book is well written and insightful, bringing the concepts to life with a variety of real-life examples. I highly recommend this book for business executives, both those who are living the experience today and those who think they are immune. For me, it is on to the just published sequel, The Innovator's Solution."},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"It provides eye-opening, research-based insights to the problems of managing innovation.

Professor Christensen drives to understand root causes and extract fundamental principles based on thorough examination of the failures of many large, established companies to take new technologies from the lab to market. A must read for anyone within large or small firms involved in bringing innovative technologies to market. One of my favorite courses and professors in grad school."},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"This is a book that packs academic research around a key insight driving disruptive change. The authors cite ample research in the hard disk and other industries to track why most companies fail to anticipate the key changes in their markets.The very counterintuitive insight presented is that market leaders get trapped into listening to their current customers too much. Current customers relatively satisfied with current products tend not to drive price/performance leaps. The distruptions come from new companies that target ways of reaching low end customers that are considered too small for major players. When the low end technology reaches a certain maturity, it winds up capturing the entire market. Seems simple, but very few companies anticipate this. The book walks through the research supporting this, as well as suggestions for how companies can cope.The one knock... The business climate is changing from a \\"Let's topple the market\\" to \\"Let's refine our business\\". In the short term, we'll see less market making moves, and that will diminish the relevance of this book.

Similar to our discussions in class on business ecology, the stage of &quot;becoming and institution&quot; with no re-engineering or innovation can lead to death for an organization. This is the notion that Innovator's Dilemma captures and examines. It takes several companies and industries and looks at their history, their framework, their business decisions, and their management to identify what went wrong or what led to their decline. By finding a common thread related to a lack of innovation or, more specifically, an inability to focus on emerging technologies or opportunities based on a current focus on profit and current customer needs and product/service, organizations prevent themselves from or avoid looking to the future. It also becomes challenging to look at the futures because the immediate profit margin may not rational from a business standpoint and there is not enough data on new markets to determine long-term ROI (return on investment). Thus the I never happens, let alone the R.This book made a nice companion to our reading and discussions in the Pepperdine doctoral program in educational technology. As we look at future thinking, business ecology, leadership, effective management strategies, and technologies as part of the larger educational leadership and technology picture, this book gave some key insight into tangible examples of business practices that are vital for success. It also became evident that there are consistencies in business through the years, but that real challenges come with progress and change. The ability for &quot;thinking in the future tense&quot; (another recommended book in the program) and to be adaptive may be the new foundation for business ecology. It may shift from waiting until the need arises to re-engineer and simply infuse this into business acumen as a constant. Going beyond trying to improve products, or coming up with a new marketing approach, organizations need to be aware of entirely new markets and products. This gets tricky, but this book lays out some principals to aid an organization or leader in shifting their approach. It also helps widen perspectives and an organization's view. I found it interesting reading and insightful (while also easy to read and follow), but not a comprehensive guide to market ownership.

I was primarily attracted by its title at first, which is nothing surprising as it was chosen from a given list. The fact that it was obviously dealing with innovations made this attractive, as I work in the Silicon Valley, where innovations and new technology is rampant and is the main source of success of a company. This book looks at a variety of companies in industries from the disk drive to the Mechanical excavator in the past couple of decades, and why they have become leaders or failures. The author explains the reasoning behind the failures and how one can reduce this problem. Some of the key approaches are the fact that every company, product, market , time should be dealt in a situational manner. It is not wise to simply apply textbook information to a business, this is a sure guide to failure. A strong attribute to success, according to the author, is by focusing on disruptive technologies as opposed to sustaining technologies. Disruptive technology, being radical new products where no customers expressed needs for. Meanwhile sustaining technologies consist of improvements on existing products, that originate primarily from what customers have expressed they would like to see. It is more common to find small companies creating disruptive technologies, as unlike big companies they are in search of any kind of market even a small one, and are more risk taking.

The book does a comprehensive analysis of the phenomena.However, I am not convinced with the analysis. People make wrong forecasts of trends and miss emerging markets for many reasons. New entrants fail in trial and error with this extremely high risk game. Does it make sense for an established company to maintain an independent unit for playing this high risk game at a considerable expense? Or should they be the follower and let small companies bear the initial high cost ? I don't think there is a clear answer like what the author has suggested.There are some uncommon and incorrect use of technology terms (e.g. Java \\"protocol\\",computer \\"automated \\"design), which let you doubt the credibility and seriousness of the author.

But it can be repetitive in many places, revisiting the same materials."},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"Christensen is a Karl Marx of change: \\"Innovators of the world, unite!\\" could easily be the subtitle of a very readable book.The thesis is that change comes as a surprise to those who have enjoyed success. The old business saying, \\"whom the gods would destroy, they first give 40 years of success,\\" applies here. High profits, and entrenched customer and supplier communities can thwart change, until it is too late.Using the disk drive industry as his first case study (because, he writes, like fruit flies, the average company life cycle is so short), Christensen examines how, when a new technology came along, the company housing the innovators failed to capitalize, with only the rarest exceptions. The paradigm discovered by Christensen is that of the value network. Companies have scarce resources for which there are alternate uses: Common sense dictates that they be directed to satisfying the demands of current, paying customers, and not be diverted to risky projects for markets that either do not yet exist, or which are low-profit. Research and development continue in their established courses and product cycles, and at some point, the product may have excess value - performance than the average user needs, but for which they must pay, if they but the product.The result of this eminently rational decision-making process is that when a new product establishes itself, it is usually the work of a start-up company, which has little to lose and is willing to accept lower profits than mainline companies will, or can. (Cost structure in bigger firms may make low-end products unprofitable.) At some point, the rising product becomes good enough to substitute for the established one. At this point, crisis looms. The expertise, experience, and momentum are with the upstarts. The replacement process is likened to a tornado, wherein only a few use the new product at first, but as its' capabilities cross the threshold of minimum utility for the mass market, a sudden whirlwind of change happens, and seemingly overnight, the mainlines have lost control of the market. The mainline companies may choose to cede the bottom end of the market to their rivals, and focus on the upscale, highly profitable segments. This Christensen relates in telling of the rise of Nucor Steel and other minimills as challengers to US Steel and other giants of industry.The Nucors started out only working the bottom of the steel market: \\"Rebar\\" steel, low-tech and low-profit. As they advanced on the learning curve, they moved upmarket, into Big Sttel's remaining baliwicks. At each juncture, better business models and lower cost structure allowed innovative technology to help the upstarts capture market share. At each stage, Big Steel retreated, and by concentrating on only the highest-end, lucrative parts of the market, and masked their decline (even to themselves)with record profits. Only when the minimills came knocking on the door for their last market did they wake up and start playing serious catch-up.The lesson in all of this, retold in a page-turner style suitable for light summer reading, is that radical change is seldom accomplished by those on top - it comes from the outside. Vested interests, within and without the organization, will fight for their budgets, their turf, and for their status. Only top management buy-in, the continual dedication of resources, and, optimally, setting up a seperate entity to innovate the radical (as opposed to incremental) change process holds real hope for success. (GM setting up Saturn as a wholly-owned but otherwise independent company is an example.)One of the interesting points that the author makes is how, at some point, products may become commodities, and brand names lose influence, relative to price, in driving sales. Looking ahead, if this process begins to happen, one can expect that substitution with cheaper alternatives is not far away. (Linux' rise vis a vis Windows may be the beginning of this process in the PC Operating System market.)This model has application far outside the business world. One can think of many examples, such as generals preparing to fight the last war, while innovators, like Erwin Rommel or Billy Mitchell, develop the weapons and tactics that will win the next one. One can see it in politics, where major parties have ignored culture and immigration as issues, only to find Pat Buchannan, the late Pim Fortuyn, and others making it their signature issues. If Christensen's model applies, them the rise to power of third parties will follow, unless established ones move quickly to co-opt their issues, at the risk of offending their current constituencies. Gary North (linkable through lwerockwell.com) wrote a column that described the rise of Methodism and Baptist churches in early America. His explanation parallels what Christensen wrote regarding the disk drive, excavator, and steel industries: lower fixed costs (lay preachers vs. seminiary-trained ministers), an unexploited market (frontier settlements vs. back East), and a product that could be substituted for its extablished competitor (mainline churches), led to sudden growth and market capture. Other examples will occur to the reader, which is part of the electricity of this book - it stimulates the mind to apply its' teachings elsewhere. \\"The Innovator's Dilemma\\" is well worth your time.&lt;-Lloyd A.

Such technology initially proposes attributes that are not valued by current, mainstream customers. The technology is initially attractive to a small market segment -- making it unattractive for larger firms. Therefore lies the innovator's dillema: how to allocate resources to developing a technology that will target a smaller market and at lower margins.Thoughout his book, Mr. Christensen develops a framework for managers and executives (also valid and valuable for consultants and analysts) to be able to resolve this dillema.If you are to read only one book on business this year, the Innovator's Dillema should be it.The reviewer is a certified management consultant and earned his MBA from the Schulich School of Business at York University and completed the Wharton School Multinational Marketing and Management Program.

And many of them. He addresses all the key issues about the dilemma, starting with the difference between sustaining &amp; disruptive technologies. He explains how a company may identify a disruptive technology coming on and how it can best strategize with its resources, values &amp; processes to handle the new technology most effectively. He takes the reader through detailed case studies of several industries -- disk drives, excavators, minimills, etc. He also provides specific examples of companies that have dealt with such changes in the past -- IBM, HP, Apple, etc.His analysis of companies that have proven themselves successful through a wave of disruptive technology provides insights about what a company must do differently ... in terms of managing its resources, processes and values. He also compares first-to-market consequences for both disruptive &amp; sustaining technologies.Having worked for both a big company &amp; a startup myself, I can appreciate the differences between the two establishments and how each would deal with technology changes (sustaining or disruptive).He does a great job of explaining how companies could fail by doing all the &quot;right&quot; things -- listening to customers, planning a certain growth rate, projecting demand, etc. He explains how customers could adopt a completely different technology overnight leaving companies in the lurge.This book is not just about the tech industry -- it offers insights on how companies can effectively deal with changing technologies. If you have ever wondered what it takes for a company to be constantly on top of things, and how some companies seamlessly adopt new technologies while keeping their customers happy and their financial goals right-on, this book is for you."},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"This is possibly the best book on the impact of technology in business that I have read.

In \\"The Innovators Dilemma\\", Harvard professor Clayton M. Christensen studies several industries to discover why companies that are doing all the right things loose their leadership positions or fail altogether. Christensen's focus is on \\"disruptive technologies\\" and the innovators that create them and introduce them to the market.Micro ISVs should understand Christensen's discovery of characteristics of disruptive technologies. The micro ISV model closely follows the descriptions of successful, disruptive innovators in The Innovator's DilemmaReview these and see if your small software company has an opportunity to become a disruptor. (Note that Christensen uses the term \\"technology\\" not in the sense of \\"Information Technology\\" but as a general term meaning the state of any industry. His study covered industries as differing as excavation equipment, motorcycles, disk drives, and steel).Characteristics of Disruptive TechnologiesAnd Where Your ISV Fits\\"1. The Weakness of Disruptive Technologies Are Their Strengths\\". Christensen profiles companies such as Conner Peripherals that created small disk drives. The established marketplace at the time did not value the limited storage capacity of the drives so Conner Peripherals created a market in portable computers. By seeking and encouraging a market that made physical size more important than storage capability, Conner Peripherals changed the basis of competition.Christensen goes on to say though that the challenge is not one of technology. In the cases he studied, he found that firms with successful disruptive technologies won because of a marketing focus not at technology focus. In his words, they were able to \\"build or find a market where product competition occurred along dimensions that favored the disruptive attributes of the product.\\"\\"2. Disruptive Technologies are Typically Simpler, Cheaper, and More Reliable and Convenient than Established Technologies\\". Quoting: \\"Because established companies are so prone to push for high-performance, high-profit products and markets, they find it very difficult not to overload their first disruptive products with features and functionality.\\" Christensen goes on to study the success that Intuit found with Quicken. Scott Cook, founder of Intuit, followed just this model when introducing Quicken as a simpler alternative to the complex accounting programs most individuals and small businesses had available.These observations of successful innovators should be an encouraging guide to micro ISVs. You have the opportunity to turn our perceived weaknesses into strengths and to focus on being the simpler, cheaper and more reliable and convenient offering to take on competitors in your segment.To lead your company there, Christensen discovered four \\"principles of disruptive technology\\".Principles of Disruptive TechnologyAnd How Your ISV Can Leverage These Principles\\"1. Companies Depend on Customers and Investors for Resources\\" You must not be customer driven to a fault. This seemingly contrarian advice bears itself out in the study of several different industries. Most companies listen to their biggest customers and develop their products along the lines of what those customers say they want. These companies find themselves unable to respond to disruptive technologies or to think of a future beyond the customers' current self-expressed needs. Companies spend resources trying to please their current customers and loose sight of potential new markets and changes in what capabilities the market values and what capabilities are really leveraged vs. simply stated desires.Your ISV is not constrained by large, mainstream customers - in fact you may not even have customers yet. Your ISV is not constrained by large institutional investors more concerned about this quarter's growth rate than establishing a foundation for the future.To break this dependency on customers and investors for company direction, Christensen recommends managers form small, autonomous, breakaway teams that are not constrained by what their mainstream customers want. These small teams then find new markets and a new world of capability-value for which the larger organization is not aligned.Your ISV is a small, autonomous team out of the box.\\"2. Small Markets Don't Solve the Growth Needs of Large Companies\\". Your small ISV can be successful addressing new markets that are under the radar of large companies.\\"3. Markets that Don't Exist Can't be Analyzed\\". Established companies have effective market research and planning organizations and processes. Yet these organizations and processes are not effective ways to discover new markets.Christen presents the case study of Honda's entry into the American motorcycle market in the 50's and 60's. Honda found success discovering a small-bike (50cc) market that the big makers (Harley, BMW) did not pursue. By offering a reliable, fun product, Honda identified a market segment and a value proposition that other makers later tried to emulate. By then Honda had an established dealer network and low cost production capability while Harley dealers wanted to keep focus on high margin large bikes. While large bikes provided high margin, they turned out to produce low growth rates. The small bike market had a much larger growth rate.Your small ISV can be much more effective at discovering new markets and taking advantage of their fast growth rates.\\"4. An Organization's Capabilities Define its Disabilities\\". We touched on some of this earlier. Companies often become successful on the basis of their processes and values. By definition though, processes and values do not change rapidly so a company defines itself by these and also defines what it will or cannot do by these capabilities.As a new ISV, you have the opportunity to create new capabilities. Ensure that your processes and values server your desired target or goal and do not unnecessarily constrain you from leveraging capabilities that you do have.\\"5. Technology Supply May Not Equal Market Demand\\". Christensen presents examples of industries where technology capabilities exceed what the market really wants leaving a \\"vacuum\\" in the lower price points.Your new ISV can fill this vacuum.Summary1. Study Clayton Christensen's The Innovator's Dilemma for guidance on seeking opportunities and evaluating strengths of your new ISV.2. Do not be sucked into competition based on length of product's feature-lists. The features that customers value change quickly. It is more important to be able to meet the most important features well than to have the absolute greatest number of features.3. Discover and tackle the vacuums left by established competitors.4. Prefer large growth rate opportunities to large margin opportunities.Agree? Disagree? Comment and let me know."},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"With the Innovator's Dilemma, Clayton Christensen delivers a very powerful analysis of the role of innovation in gaining market leadership. The question raised is whether market leadership can be sustained through innovation alone. Indeed, the core of the Innovator's Dilemma illustrates how successful companies with established solutions, marquee customers and a valued brand keep being threatened and at time vanquished by start-ups. A recent example would be how established enterprise software vendors have been shaken up by disruptive startups: Remember Salesforce.com vs. Siebel Systems? Christensen addresses a difficult problem that most successful customer focused companies face. Precisely, because it is a formidable challenge for an established company to bring disrupting technology to its own installed base of customers."},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"I advised my professor to add this book to his reading list and contemplate making this required text.

The book fundamentally asks what makes superbly run companies fail in the face of disruptive change, and how to avoid these failures. It debunks the idea that failures, such as DEC, were driven by shortsightedness or bad management, and instead looks at the overall structure in which they failed and why, leading to an examination of how disruptive changes impact organizations.The book is filled with case studies and is an interesting read, and I walked away with many ideas about how to think through some of the issues that face my company... a disruptive player... and how to keep leveraging disruption. Thus, since I found things in the book that I am directly applying, I give it high marks.The only negative thing for me, besides a somewhat weaker concluding chapter, is that by using the fast moving hard drive industry as the core study, the book would benefit from updating since many of the companies discussed and technologies discussed have gone through further disruptive changes.Regardless, definitely worthwhile reading for any business team leader."},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"In The Innovator's Dilemma, Clayton Christensen shows how even great companies, with great managers, who are doing everything \\"right\\", can still be stymied, and can even be put out of business by, what he calls \\"disruptive technologies\\".The term disruptive technology is bandied about quite a bit today, but often people seem to mean by it a technology that is radically different from what went before. This in contrast to technologies that build upon well-practiced capabilities, otherwise known as incremental improvements.But Christensen shows that established companies can introduce either incremental or completely radical technologies and be very successful, as long as they are sustaining and not disruptive technologies.What makes a technology \\"disruptive\\", if it is not how radically different it is? Let us say you are in an established company. A disruptive technology is one that your own customers do not want. It doesn't fit their needs, for one reason or another. It doesn't fit into your established markets.Meanwhile there is some other market elsewhere that does want it, but that market tends to be small, it tends to be undefined, and as a result it is not of interest to an established company. It doesn't fit the growth needs of your company. Often a smaller company will create and nurture this other market. Because the company is smaller, it can get excited about this smaller market.Finally, the disruption comes about because the new technology improves enough that your own customers now want it. But as you haven't been paying attention to it until now, the smaller company has all the experience in the new technology and proceeds to methodically take all your customers.The Innovator's Dilemma outlines this phenomenon and gives many examples from wildly different industries. The process happens in fast moving industries and slow moving industries. It happens in medicine, greeting cards, notebook computers, utility companies, and disk drive companies. It can happen to YOU.Then in the second half of the book, some ways to address the dilemma are outlined.Chirstensen writes well, and includes plenty of examples and charts and graphs to illustrate his points. Sometimes business books can seem dull or plodding or irrelevant to someone without an MBA, but not this one.Highly recommended to anyone interested in how companies in their own industry can better handle change and disruption."},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"It is a really classic book regarding innovation and how to cope with it. Initially it takes some time to realize some concepts like \\"do not listen to your customers all the time\\" or \\"sometimes, principles of good management are not the most adequate'.Disruptive innovations are distinct from radical ones (breakthroughs) and should be addressed differently. Small markets do not solve the growth needs of large firms, but they might hold opportunities to paradigm changes that will revolutionize an entire industry.Clayton Christensen tell us the story of disruptive innovation in some industries and lead us to see the evolution of these changes: hard-disk drives, excavators are some of the examples. A new perspective is presented and it is absolutely vital to understand it. All entrepreneurs should read it."},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"Great book that goes beyond the typical explanations of why great companies never see their downfall coming."},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"This book starts by looking at why leading, well-run companies miss the boat when it comes to certain types of key innovations. The author shares 5 principles that are largely responsible-1. Companies depend on customers and investors for resources2. Small markets don't solve growth needs of large companies3. Markets that don't exist can't be analyzed4. An organization's capabilities define its disabilities5. Technology supply may not equal market demandEach of these is a fascinating topic, on which the author provides actionable information. Some may seem somewhat obvious, but the author goes below the surface to illustrate these carefully, even going as far as introducing an organizational capabilities framework to help assess capabilities and hence disabilities.The author makes the case that the above principles are only indirectly responsible for the stumblings of the large companies. The direct cause was managers not heeding these principles. This is likened to the first aviators not understanding the principles of drag and lift. Once understood and obeyed, those principles allowed for flight.The book begins with a twenty page introduction that gives many examples of leading firms stumbling badly, and then outlines the basic premise of the book. The first four chapters then show examples with much more details, as well as showing how other theories fail to explain the results. The next five chapters focus individually on each of the principles listed above. That is followed by a case study, applying the principles to how the author would assess and deal with electric vehicles. Finally, the book ends with a summary tying it all together. The book is very clear and well written."},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"This book is highly engaging and actionable and helps companies understand how innovation is powerful and long-lasting.

Since the time this book was published, many progressive companies have learnt the lessons revealed here - larger companies set up incubators/shell-companies to pursue different lines of business (witness Cisco's spin-off and subsequent acquisition of Andiamo for instance). Similarly companies recognize and respond to disruptive technologies faster (witness Oracle's buy out of open source database technologies). Still a must read for anyone in the business of innovation."},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"Clayton Christensen came up with an explanation for why is it that large companies always seem to miss the wave for the next big innovation in their business. He observes that change comes as a surprise to those companies that have enjoyed success before, with very few exceptions. The author postulates that the conventional way for big companies to handle sustaining technologies is largely geared to make them fail when they meet what he calls disruptive technologies.The author uses useful examples to reinforce the book's core arguments which greatly enhance the understanding of the message. In this regard, Christensen uses the hard drive industry, the excavator and steel industries, among others, to illustrate how companies simply fail to notice the likelihood of disruptive technologies. Such companies have a tendency to focus on satisfying the demands of existing customers, and largely avoid being diverted to risky ventures for markets that are not yet in existence and where the profit potential is uncertain.Hence the strategic potential of technology is overlooked, and the innovation ends up being exploited upon by the smaller and more nimble competitors who can plant and grow an emerging market because they get excited about smaller volume sales. They have the energy and drive to find markets that do not necessarily need the more elaborate features that may be associated with the existing product.The book gives advice on how a company may identify a disruptive technology emerging and how it can best strategize with its capabilities, resources, values and processes to effectively handle the new technology. Christensen's suggestions make sense; appear to be practical and useful. This book is important not only for those in the technology industries but provides insights on how any organization can effectively deal with changing paradigms."},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"Professor Clayton Christensen introduced the term \\"disruptive innovation\\" as a management buzzword, the whole book spins around this concept and offers very perturbing views on why being a star performer is a major threat to pass the next opportunity.First, a definition: disruptive innovations are those that offer \\"less\\" in the critical performance parameters of current customers. As a consequence disruptive innovators have to look for different customers than the ones that established companies already have.To make the point a deep analysis of the hard disk drive industry is made. More than 100 innovations are analysed and only 5 are claimed as being disruptive: the progressive reduction of size from 14\\", to 8\\", to 5 1/4\\", etc. All follow the same pattern: the innovation had lower performance on capacity which was the critical parameter for existing customers and innovators had to find new customers, eg for the 8\\" drive the mini-computer manufacturers instead of mainframe manufacturers. In fact innovations were so disruptive that almost none of the established companies was able to be successful in the new market. Although current players where by and large able to bring forward the other 100 sustaining inovations without major troubles.The second part of the book recommends how to make disruptive innovations work, with supporting evidence from examples. This are:-Create a new organization to deal with the innovation-Match organization and opportunity size-Allow the organization to fail rapidly and inexpensively and move on-Leverage some of the existing resources but not the values and processes of the main organization-Spend time looking for the right customers rather than the right technology.The surprising learning is that what impedes that good companies cannot profit from disruptive innovations are that they are good at what they do in their main business not that htey are bad. The hot topic is still when a disruptive innovation is comming how can we spot and capitalise on it, and put ourselves in the dilemma of chosing the best option.A well laid out, thought provoking and seminal work on innovation."},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"Christensen writes about the failure of good, well-managed companies to stay atop their industries when they are confronted by certain types of disruptive market and technological change. This has happened in industries that move fast and those that move slow, and in manufacturing and service industries. Companies that fell prey to these disruptive changes include Sears, IBM, DEC, Xerox, and integrated steel manufacturers.Christensen defines \\"sustaining\\" technologies as those that improve the performance of established products along dimensions that major customers have historically valued. \\"Disruptive\\" technologies, on the other hand, generally under-perform established products in major markets but have new features that a few new/fringe customers value - generally smaller, cheaper, simpler (eg. PCs, discount retailing, off-road motorcycles, transistors, and HMOs).Disruptive technologies, when viewed by \\"rational\\" decision-makers, offer lower margins (due to their generally cheaper and simpler nature), are first commercialized in new or small markets (thus, they don't solve large corporations' growth needs), and are not valued by major, current customers. Thus, they wait for new market entrants to exploit their potential, and the strong, existing firms risk becoming obsolescent due their being late to change."},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"\\"Disruptive technology\\" is a term that is used a lot lately amongst innovators and entrepreneurs; however, not many people really understand the difference between sustaining and disruptive technologies. \\"The Innovator's Dilemma\\" thoroughly explains what the difference is between sustaining and disruptive technologies, gives examples of each in several industries, and gives techniques to help identify whether or not a new technology is disruptive. The author explains why large organizations often fail to successfully develop and implement disruptive technologies. He also offers suggestions as to how to deal with disruptive technologies and what their ideal development environments are. Overall, \\"The Innovator's Dilemma\\" is an excellent read.

And he not only proves what he says; he tells others how to avoid a similar fate.To be a successful entrepreneur you must be able to capitalize on change. \\"The Innovator's Dilemma\\" is all about dealing with change, from the incumbent's point of view. How valuable do you think it would be to understand how your larger competitors think? That's exactly what this book talks about.Most large, established firms are inherently weak in one area - they cling to the status quo with a vengeance. While talk of innovation is commonplace, it is the attacker (entrepreneurs) who holds a definitive advantage.

It explains a very important concept - how radically new (disruptive) technologies can overtake existing well-established (sustaining) technologies and in the process beat market leaders at their own game.Large companies typically ignore small markets and instead look for growth in established markets. All too often executives of large companies are reluctant to take on challenges in small and unknown terrain since they are always trained to \\"think big\\" - which is good news for Aspiring Entrepreneurs.Take heed, read this book and learn how to fully exploit disruptive technologies and become the next \\"great company.\\"-----------------Michael Davis - Editor, Byvation"},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"Christensen not only shapes the thinking of the business community, but by default, may shape the thinking of the educational and service arenas as well. He shares that it is precisely the attributes that make a firm successful in an incrementally advancing marketplace, that make it difficult for it to appreciate oblique new markets. Ultimately, at times, the new market consumes the existing mainstream or core market of the firm. This principle may work in the educational arena as well, where non-traditional universities or corporate universities are beginning to shoulder a portion of the corporate professional development workload. Fortunately, for members of the status quo in contemporary business firms, the author also provides mitigating strategies. However, this reveiwer appreciates the difference between a firm knowing the answer and successfully implementing the answer.Other sections of society should take notice of this phenomenon. Health care, utilities, universities and the like, should be aware that newcomers are, at first, often seen in &quot;bad odor, ridiculed, scorned, condemned as 'illegitimate,' as observed by Professor Malcolm McNair at Harvard (Christensen, pg. 94, note 1). It is no longer enough to know your business or industry, but you must also be able to detect &quot;disruptive technologies&quot; in all aspects of organizational life.Other reviewers have shared the mechanics of Christensen's research, but, more importantly, it is critical to know that this book will widen your view, increase your perception, and, perhaps, create a touch of anxiety. I am glad that I read this book."},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"Clayton M. Christensen thoroughly and systematically analyzes the impact of both disruptive and sustaining technologies on well-managed enterprises. The author shows us how these enterprises belonging to very different industries fail precisely because they do all the right things in developing and bringing sustaining technologies to the market, i.e. 1. Listen to their customers carefully; 2. Invest enough money in developing new technologies that meet or exceed customer expectations; 3. Research market trends thoroughly; 4. Excel in allocating resources systematically to innovations that optimize returns.Christensen clearly explains to us why and how enterprises that are paragon of the above-mentioned approach to the market can lose their balance while dealing with the emergence of disruptive technologies. Well-managed enterprises ultimately fail because they ignore or fight the five laws of disruptive technologies that Christensen has identified for us, i.e. 1. Tackle the disruptive technology appropriately, usually by setting up an autonomous entity free of the influence of mainstream customers; 2. Penetrate small markets through the use of an appropriate vehicle such as an autonomous entity, even if those markets don't allow well-managed enterprises to reach their targeted growth rates quickly; 3. Practice what Christensen calls &quot;agnostic marketing&quot;, i.e. gaining first experience in using a disruptive technology, often made possible by watching how real people use it rather by listening to their wishes before making plans for implementation; 4. Pay due consideration to internal processes and values that make well-managed enterprises strong in one context and weak in another one; 5. Realize that mainstream customers are not necessarily able or willing to absorb any performance improvement that investing in sustaining technologies makes possible.To summarize, The Innovator's Dilemma brings a fresh perspective to an intricate issue that well-managed enterprises need to address sooner or later in their life."},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"In my opinion this book is a must read for senior managers, esp. in large organizations, experiencing the growing pains of becoming too big. It illustrates its underlying theory by mainly using the disk drive industry as an example but the learnings can easily be replicated to all kind of companies including FMCGs.The theory, proof and remedy suggesting that great companies fail because they are doing the right thing (!) is intriguing and makes sense after reading the entire book. For novice professionals and students this book might not be the best introudction to management or the subject.Granted, Christensen does repeat himself a little too much, sometimes gets too detailed about the disk drive industry and some of his charts are a pain, but in summary this is a stand-out book.Don't give copies to your co-workers but instead your boss since, as the book illustrates, the innovator's dilemna can only be overcome from the top.

It would have saved me a lot of problems, worries and money. I'm late to the game - I first heard of this book in Isaacson's marvellous biography on Steve Jobs, but it was written before some of the dot.coms exploded. It was one of few books that really fascinated the strong-willed Jobs. And it's easy to understand why...Innovations drive markets forward. But innovations are not just about technology and biotech. One of my favourite cases in this book is about the mini-mills and how they outsmarted the huge integrated steel mills of America. In the end, innovations are either sustaining or disruptive. Sustaining innovations closely resembles making improvements to existing products and services. They are what we usually focus on, regardless of if it's in strategy books, management speeches or business school cases. It's about listening to customers, investing aggressively to give customers what they say they want, seeking higher margins and targeting larger markets.Disruptive innovations are more uncommon, trickier to manage and much harder to analyse and forecast. They happen when product qualities exceed market needs. Professor Christensen has termed it \\"Performance Over-supply\\" which perfectly describes this situation.These situations create opportunities for products that are simpler, smaller, cheaper and frequently more convenient to use. Therefore, they open new markets. \\"Further, because with experience and sufficient investment, the developers of disruptive technologies will always improve their products performance, they will eventually be able to deliver sufficient performance on the old attributes, and they add some new ones\\".Why do well-managed companies fail with disruptive innovations? Professor Christensen answers this crucial question with facts that first surprise you. \\"Doing the right thing is the wrong thing.\\" For sure, it's not because management is stupid or lazy. It's rather the opposite - the same goals, practices and value networks that made them successful are now to their disadvantage with disruptive innovations.\\"Perhaps the most powerful protection that a small entrant enjoy as they build the emerging markets for disruptive technologies is that they are doing something that simply does not make sense for the established leaders to do. Despite their endowments in technology, brand names, manufacturing prowess, management experience, distribution muscle, and just plain cash, successful companies populated by good managers have a genuinely hard time doing what does not fit their model for how to make money. Because disruptive technologies rarely make sense during the years when investing in them is important, conventional managerial wisdom at established firms constitutes an entry and mobility barrier that entrepreneurs and investors can bank on. It is powerful and pervasive.\\"But there are ways for an established market leader to handle disruptive innovations successfully. It's easy to be a believer in Christensen's recommendations. His thoughts were e.g. behind the decision by Intel to launch a new label with simpler products (Celeron) along the established Pentium, in order to avoid being attacked from \\"below\\" and keeping market shares. But this is one of rather few successful examples. It is easy to list companies that lost their market position and hence their profitability and most of their market capital.As an investor, this new understanding gave me significant clues regarding guesstimating the period of competitive advantage - years of excess return - although Christensen never explicitly mentions this in his book.There is lot of additional wisdom in this book, e.g. on assumptions in NPV calculations, corporate culture, the RVP (resources, values, processes) framework and much more. Harvard Business School Professor Christensen is a brilliant man - named the world's most influential business thinker in 2011 - and not only because of his strategy research. I truly recommend his speeches on Youtube on various issues. His new book - How do you measure your life? - will be my next buy.This is a review by eqtbooks.com"},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"This is a pretty good collection of background information for those who might consider themselves innovators.

According to me this is a brilliant book and a must read on how technology impacts businesses. The author also lays emphasis on the importance on investing in disruptive technologies as compared to the sustaining ones. He tries implying that it's really important for a company to understand the job that customers are trying to accomplish instead of understanding the customers themselves.\\"Disruptive Innovation\\" is a term that people like me in the IT industries are very well aware of. I have been involved in this industry for the past 9 years and have seen how it can impact the market and jobs. I knew about the existence of \\"Disruptive innovation\\" but never took it seriously till the iPhone came out. Surely there were other touch phones in the market at that time but what happened why did the iPhone became so popular. I am not trying to defend Apple but at that time they innovated and provided the experience that everyone was looking forward to. As a result it made the other manufacturers re-think their strategy. Look at Nokia, they make great phones but they are struggling now. These days it's true that if companies don't innovate they lag far behind. Amazon, iTunes, eBay, Google are some of the examples that comes to everyone's mind when you think about innovation. But it's not like that their every product is successful. Out of the several products they release only few of them are accepted by the people. The fact they come with so many features and products tells us that they keep on innovating and experimenting continuously. The author tells how a company must do things like managing its resources and processes differently in order for it to survive. Similarly the term \\"Disruptive Innovation\\" can be applied to any field like media, automobile etc. The author gives examples and establishes the facts that I mentioned above. As an individual I feel these innovations do make our life easier but on the other hand it also forces us to keep on innovating so that we don't lose our jobs. The questions that often keep popping in my mind are:-\\"Out of the so many different technologies and innovation that happen each year how do we know what will ultimately be disruptive to the current market? How do we shield ourselves from such disruptions that might take away our jobs? Is innovation the only key to survive? \\"The author has answered those questions to an extent however some doubts still remain. I think I have some ideas which I should implement in order to shield myself but there is a long road ahead. Another good read from a great author can be found on Dr Dale Callahan's Blog. He is the professor of the IEM program that I am attending at University of Alabama at Birmingham."},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"This book give you goods ideas to how companies shout work with new technologies.

This book won't answer your answers.Sure, those are all things which have to do with the vaguely described disruptive technologies exposited in this book. This book doesn't tell how to make decisions at all. It's a montage of cherry-picked anecdotes like many other self-proclaimed revolutionary books on business.If being (perceived to be) a successful business person were as easy as reading a book such as this, then everyone would be exceptional. Which, by definition, isn't possible.There's no magic in here. I somewhat enjoyed the recounts on disk drives, earthing equipment, retailing, motorbikes, steel, and whatever else he talked about with actual facts. I hated the fluffy and vague everything else which made it a painful read.The book doesn't go into the right details or answer the right questions. When I wanted to know why certain things panned out the way it did, all I get is a chart showing that some odd businesses tried X before and they made Y money. Okay, but why?\\"Because him\\" isn't a good enough answer. \\"Because the line goes this way\\" isn't an answer. Why does that line matter? Is that line the only one that matters? Why not a line for X, Y, and Z?I don't think the author could run an electric vehicle company successfully just because of the things described in this book. Just knowing the data points of past ventures alone doesn't mean you'll be good manager. He says the electric vehicle example is only to give you an idea of how one might go about planning a business assumed to be disruptive. All I could think about is how much it sucked. Electric golf carts and scooters have been around forever, that's your market. It sure as heck wouldn't be disruptive. How are you going to solve the range problem for road going vehicles?It's been just about a decade and a half since this book was released. Awareness alone isn't a solution.What was promised on the back cover wasn't delivered. And that pissed me off. (OH, I SEE NOW. There's a book called \\"Innovator's Solution.\\" Yes, pay more money to get pissed off some more. That's marketing genius.)There's very little explanation, but a whole lot of \\"because I said so\\" and repeating vague gibberish about disruption.Also, the book needs an editor, the author is exceptionally verbose."},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"For decades, the United States has been the bastion of great Capitalist Innovation. With the American system, it was thought, you had the greatest chance to take a great idea to tremendous wealth and power. What does that really mean? It means having a great education system, a great financial system, and a great patent system. When you finally take your widget to the market, your accountant might even tap you on the shoulder and ask you about taking the company public. An IPO (Initial Public Offering). Taking the company public is a great way to motivate your employees (they can be paid in stock), and allows the company to grow rapidly in value, based on public perception. A few years later you're issuing quarterly reports and the stock price is bouncing up and down based on the contents of that report. After a few years, the company begins to stall out: your widgets are more advanced than they ever were, but you latest model hasn't done so hot in the market. Your loyal customers are content with last year's model, so the growth prospects are middling, and the stock starts to slide.What the hell just happened?The Innovator's Dilemma reveals the true source of groundbreaking and game-changing technologies, and why the Modern Corporate System works against real innovation. If you can understand why certain companies and entrepreneurs stall out, you can understand how to avoid it.Notice the word Dilemma in the title. These are failed companies. They're enormously successful ones. Once you understand that these companies are very smart and very successful (and still subject to this effect), you get a hint of cause. Having an army of loyal customers sounds like a great place to be right? This book is about how those very same customers, if you listen to them, if you focus group them, if you beg them for feedback, will probably run your company into the ground.There are two forms of Innovation mentioned in this book: sustaining and disruptive. Sustaining technologies are essentially evolutionary upgrades: taking the same product and bumping up the specs, giving it a bigger screen, or a faster processor. Shallow things like \`new colors' also fall into this category. And these sustaining innovations are exactly the kind of things that customers want, and will ask for, if you're listening. Customers look at the widget and ask, \\"Can you make it smaller? Can you make it so there's no noise? Can you do one in gun metal grey?\\" The technologists in the company declare, \\"Sure we can! Because it's been about 9 months since we released a new model, and in that time, the price of those high end chips has come down, and they're even smaller. Here you go.\\" And the next version is released. If you listen to your customers, you will keep putting out tiny evolutionary upgrades like this. As we learned in Lean Startup, most of the time focus groups lead you astray. But listening to your actual customers...as a bad thing? What happened to \`Customer is King' or \`The Customer is always Right?' I suspect those little sayings were actually cooked up years ago by bosses told to their employees, especially in retail operations, to cut down on complaints. That is not a very good mantra for R&D; Labs. If the customer was \`right', he'd be working at Boeing, Microsoft, or 3M.The Customer isn't an expert. Rather than let them boss your around, maybe you should start to take away a little bit of their power. Sometimes the customer isn't the end user, but the retail store. Retail stores like Walmart won't be eating the food your company makes, or wearing the clothes. They just want your stuff a dirt cheap prices, and will push you do make uncomfortable compromises to hit those price targets. Are you sure you want to let these guys ruin your flagship product? Sometimes, like Enterprise computing, the customer is the IT department. They want your stuff to be cheap and modular, and they don't care about the User Experience, because they're not the ones using the product. To get around this, many companies have done their own distribution channel (open your own retail stores, or just quit retail altogether and go to the web directly), or fired their customers (by killing a product that wasn't part of the company's core competency). As a result, these companies are leaner, better branded, and more focused (and more profitable).So what if you can ignore the customer for a few minutes, and consider developing a disruptive technology. What is that anyway? Intuitively, if sustaining technology is evolutionary, then disruptive must be revolutionary, right? Not quite. Disruptive technologies take a current technology and apply them to a new market. This is like when Nintendo released the Wii. They found a way to make Videogames less expensive, and more fun, to a broader market (everyday people, women, girls, seniors,etc). The result was the most dominant era in Nintendo's history. Little did they know that they would be disrupted a few years later by ... mobile phone gaming. Part of the reason why disruptive technology is so great is that it takes really long to copy. When Microsoft set about copying the Nintendo Wii, first they had to wait a few quarters to see if it was successful (because it was a brand new gaming experience, no one knew if it would take off). For the first 18 months of release the Nintendo Wii was sold out everywhere. Microsoft decided to start copying them. To make up for lost time, they looked around and acquired (link) a company with similar tech, that didn't even require a controller. While they set about integrating the \`Kinect' into Xbox, Sony was doing their own copycat device (Sony Move Controllers). All this time, Nintendo is reporting amazing financial numbers. They were in the Blue Ocean, and making billions. When the Sony and MS devices came out, they were very late, and the response was middling at best: while the Nintendo tech camed bundled with every Wii, the Sony/MS versions would be add-ons, which meant developers had a very small market to develop for this new gameplay. Who wants to sell a game aimed at 15 million users, when they can sell almost the same thing on a Wii, and hit 85 million users? The result is almost no Kinect/Move games are being made, and tech isn't really being used. Kinect is currently being developed for Windows.The Sony and Microsoft technologies didn't fail because management was arrogant; the management team was just being conservative, and smart. They failed because the technology (which had been available for years and years) didn't make sense until it was too late (when Nintendo showed them the way). You can't get their by copying, you can only get there by having a visionary leader who looks at the technology and says, \\"We need to invest in this, even if it doesn't make sense right now. This is where the industry is going.\\" The Nintendo Wii, launched in late 2006, had been in development since 2001.Disruptive technologies can also evolve. This is where you start to see amazing changes in the Industry. The iPod was disruptive at the low end, but eventually evolved into the iPhone, and later the iPad. The iPad sell about 25 million units per quarter now, and is reason both Apple and Microsoft are drastically redesigning their OSes. Mac OS X Lion released this year, has many touch elements, fullscreen mode and even an iOS-style launcher. Many expect Apple to ship iPads running OS X within the next 5 years. Windows 8, due out next year, will be Microsofts answer to iOS for iPad. It will have an App Store and fully touch interface. Can you imagine back in 2001, when Bill Gates first gawked at the iPod, he ever thought his company would redesign their cash cow Windows business because of it's disruptive powers? Amazon did the same thing with the Kindle. Disrupt at the low-end, fine tune it, then move it up the market (in price and features). In just a few years, I expect Kindle to be putting out some very beautiful Kindle Fires, to give Apple fits.It's obvious how the innovators dilemma works for companies. Rather than listen to the customers, ignore them and try to make the best products you possibly can, by eliminating assumptions about what a product should have. I wonder though, if that same lesson can be applied to people. How can people be rapidly innovative and creative? By ignoring the career that makes us the most money, and follow our instincts about what a ideal lifestyle looks like? Why do I have to be married? Why do I have to own a home? Maybe I live in a new city every year, and rent beautiful apartments. Maybe I live with friends and couchsurf for a few years. Maybe I spend ten years mastering my favourite languages and living in various countries around Europe. Or maybe, I'm constantly changing jobs, looking for new work, emulating Howard Roark-an idealist a snob, who falls ass backwards into money and repute? Or maybe, just maybe, following your own path, will lead you to tremendous wealth and power (and just maybe, those white collar guys who told you to get a \`real' job, will find themselves sideswiped by disruptive technology).After all....what could be more replaceable (either by software, or machinery, or outsourcing) than a passionless, unoriginal, hopelessly conservative and painfully average employee?More Reviews like this on 21tiger"},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"I purchased this book for my husband on someone's recommendation.

Concepts like leadership vs. followership, disruptive technologies, S-curves and value networks, set a framework for complex analysis of entire industries.Much of the discussion is fairly straightforward: the need to match resource allocation to the nature of the innovations, and the gap created by the rates of change of technology and its needs, for instance. When coupled with powerful concepts like the reasons behind organizations' failure to attend to disruptive innovations, and the fallacies loyalty to customers bring, the pages read like a treatise on what make some companies great or lousy innovators.The only criticism I could draw is some repetiveness - but I would not hold that against the author: the underlying themes are too closely interconnected."},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"Clay Christensen combines the science of empirical research with the art of organizational behavior in his best-selling &quot;The Innovator's Dilemma.&quot; The book provides tangible advice on how to foster innovation within a corporate environment. His case studies draw from the successes and failures of American companies within numerous industries (disk drives, excavators, motorcycles, software). Christensen's strong points include a creative presentation of data, lucid writing and frank admission that the advice in his book is not a one-size-fits-all panacea for management challenges. But a heads-up to readers: perhaps 50% of the book centers on the disk-drive manufacturing industry. Although the lessons learned in hard drives are interesting, a more balanced approach would have been welcome. &quot;The Innovators Dilemma&quot; is a well written management how-to, in the same league as classics by Peters or Hammer. The book seems to be written for managers in large organizations, but entrepreneurs will probably find the material just as beneficial."},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"Christensen not only shapes the thinking of the business community, but by default, may shape the thinking of the educational and service arenas as well. He shares that it is precisely the attributes that make a firm successful in an incrementally advancing marketplace, that make it difficult for it to appreciate oblique new markets. Ultimately, at times, the new market consumes the existing mainstream or core market of the firm. This principle may work in the educational arena as well, where non-traditional universities or corporate universities are beginning to shoulder a portion of the corporate professional development workload. Fortunately, for members of the status quo in contemporary business firms, the author also provides mitigating strategies. However, this reveiwer appreciates the difference between a firm knowing the answer and successfully implementing the answer.Other sections of society should take notice of this phenomenon. Health care, utilities, universities and the like, should be aware that newcomers are, at first, often seen in &quot;bad odor, ridiculed, scorned, condemned as 'illegitimate,' as observed by Professor Malcolm McNair at Harvard (Christensen, pg. 94, note 1). It is no longer enough to know your business or industry, but you must also be able to detect &quot;disruptive technologies&quot; in all aspects of organizational life.Other reviewers have shared the mechanics of Christensen's research, but, more importantly, it is critical to know that this book will widen your view, increase your perception, and, perhaps, create a touch of anxiety.

As I read the book, I wondered if the universities and colleges in the United States that have been so successful are not facing the same dilemma. Some might claim that their largely non-profit status exempts them from the crux of Professor Christensen's argument. However,higher ed seeks to grow its revenue, its academic prestige, and frequently its physical footprint. While higher ed may not seek profits, it clearly has to seek positive financial margins from its operations, which includes philanthropic donations enhanced by its pursuit of academic prestige.Higher ed has had a very successful model developed since the 19th century. It has had the ability to increase the cost of its service at a rate higher than the general rate of inflation for 30 years or more. Declining state appropriations to public higher ed over this time has forced public universities to pursue new or enhanced revenue streams (e.g., tuition) that makes them more like private institutions of higher ed. In this environment, the leadership of higher ed has pursued these revenues and shaped their institutions, in the main, successfully. The current leadership of higher ed has matured in this environment and has, until recently, experienced only unquestioning support. Like many of the businesses examined by Professor Christensen, the business of higher ed, certainly at the elite level and more broadly, stands at an apex joined by only a few universities outside the United States. The book notes that this is the point from which unthinkable change begins to occur.Higher ed faces technological challenge, which has marked the inflection points for other industries reform or decline. This challenge arises from the internet that has already profoundly affected the music, book and general retail businesses. The response of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) to this challenge is new and growing. Many of the elite institutions of higher ed (Harvard, Stanford, MIT, etc.) are entering this arena because of the challenge that the application of the internet poses to their business models. Other parties seek to provide educational services apart from the traditional institutions (Minerva, Udacity, etc.). Many of these new players are funded by venture capital that sees a world-wide market for educational services that is not being adequately serviced with the current business model.Higher ed also faces a cost challenge. State funds for higher education have generally been shrinking for several decades. Federal funds are now likely to decline as well. Higher ed in the United States is now encountering significant resistance to further cost increases in tuition. The demands of laws and society coupled with the need to pursue funds for their enterprises have caused administration to grow leading to tension with the academic side of the businesses (academics find it infuriating that higher ed is described as a business, but it simply is). The growth of costs must now be constrained. As Professor Christensen notes, it is very hard for businesses to reduce their cost structures. So, good managers adopt strategies that enhance revenues. In the University of California System, one response has been to admit foreign students who pay much higher tuition at the expense of California students who do not. So, Professor Christensen's observations are proving true.The book is fascinating and well worth your time. I would like to see the Professor apply his analysis to higher education. You may find that the Professor's analytical framework applies in your areas of interest as well."},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"The Innovator's Dilemma is insightful, relevant and current for all businesses.

For example, after the recent Facebook re-design, Mark Zuckerberg claimed that the most innovative companies don't listen to their customers, to the outrage of commentators. In the light of The Innovator's Dilemma, it makes much more sense.It's quite scary that to this day, companies continue to fail time and again in the face of disruptive innovation. Christensen's book helps to make sense of this phenomenon. I like the way the Forbes review put it: \\"This book ought to chill any executive who feels bulletproof -- and inspire entrepreneurs aiming their guns\\".Regarding the criticisms that the book is written in too much of an academic style and is too repetitive, I think they are valid, yet not too jarring.

Why is it that the passionate penniless come up with the big ideas? The first flight, the automobile assembly line, the iPod, Windows, Walmart, McDonalds. Then, why is it that Microsoft didn't think of the iPod, Xerox didn't mass-market the personal computer, WoolWorth's didn't think of Target?Christensen shows us that large companies are dutifully held hostage by their loyal customers. The customers give them one option - Give us more of what we like. They want it faster, larger, smarter. It's called upward mobility. Companies are smart to listen to their customers and provide what they want. It's just good business.What is the downside of upward mobility? You can only be innovative in a very small way. Large companies that hand their customers a new and innovative product always get the same reactions. \\"This is nice, but I don't really need it\\". It's true, those customers don't need it because they already have a more powerful, higher quality solution.The key, and the reason you should read the book, is downward mobility. The concept is exciting, and the implications are all encompassing.Reading the book is bland, and sometimes hard to get through. I believe that Christensen is a better lecturer that writer. That is the only reason I didn't give the book 5 stars; it was over written, and under stylized."},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"In The Innovator's dilemma, Clayton Christensen describes the dynamics by which some of the largest, most successful companies in America fail due to &quot;good&quot; management. In his analysis, firms that dedicate themselves to listening to and serving their customers the best, place themselves most at risk for future failures as they are overtaken by smaller upstart competitors with innovative technologies.The Innovator's Dilemma makes a compelling argument based on the author's study of the computer disk drive industry. Disk drive manufacturing was chosen for its frequent turnover of technology and competitors in a relatively short timespan.Cristensen places technological innovations in two categories: sustaining and disruptive. Sustaining innovations are those that help sustain an organization's existing customer base by improving the performance, capacity, reliability, or value of an existing product technology. Disruptive innovations produce products that are technologically inferior from the perspective of a firm's existing customer base. Disruptive products, however, may include improvements that, while unimportant to the existing market, hold potential for new and emerging markets. Christensen uses the example of the introduction of small 50cc Honda motorcycles in the late 1950's. From the perspective of the existing motorcycle market at the time, the Honda was inferior compared to larger, more powerful motorcycles such as Harley Davidson and BMW. Honda found a niche, however, as a dirt bike - an emerging market that had not been explored by other manufacturers but was ideally suited for a small, inexpensive motorcycle.Once a market is established for a disruptive technology, it can then evolve into the mainstream and become technologically improved to the point of competing with and eventually overtaking existing mainstream technologies. In the case of Honda, once a market was established, small motorcycles were technologically improved to the point of appealing to a mass market rather than just dirt bike enthusiasts.Organizations overlook disruptive technologies for a variety of reasons. Often, larger organizations listen to their existing customers and what is important to them, overlooking small, emerging markets. The innovator's dilemma is that at the time disruptive technologies are introduced, mainstream companies are often wildly successful marketing their sustaining technology to existing customers. Investing in disruptive technology necessitates a diversion of resources away from the organization's most profitable activities that its customers are asking for, toward an unproven technology with a small, uncertain market. Disruptive technologies are often not as cost effective to manufacture or sell when they are viewed from the perspective of existing markets. Small 3.5 inch disk drives, for example, initially cost more per megabyte of capacity compared to larger 5.25 inch drives while, and they had less overall capacity Although they were not attractive to desktop computer manufactures, they represented a cost effective solution to the needs of the emerging mobile computer market where size was more important than large capacity.Citing examples from a number of industries, Christensen makes the point that traditional business planning works well for established markets and sustaining technologies. In the case of disruptive technologies, however, he argues that strategy should be based on discovery of new opportunities and that individuals working on the development and marketing of disruptive technologies should be organizationally separate.Overall, the Innovator's Dilemma is a concise, well written book in which the author is able to effectively convey a technically complex study on a technically complex industry. Overall, the Innovator's Dilemma should be required reading for anyone in an business planning role."},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"The Innovator's Dilemma explores how the creation of new technologies can cause companies to lose market share or their markets entirely, even companies that do everything right such as listening to their customers, watching the marketplace, and investing in research and development. The author argues that, while existing thriving companies can be successful with sustaining technologies, these same companies often falter with the advent of disruptive technologies. They either often do not want to put their resources into developing the new technology, because their existing customer do not want it or they attempt to fit the new technology into the existing market instead of looking to create new markets for the new product which generally doesn't work. Both of these decisions cause the company to lag in the development of the disruptive technology and eventually wither away to the competition of smaller companies that focused on developing the eruptive technology.The dilemma examined is, while it is important for companies to give their customers what they want to be successful in the present, they need to know when to begin to move their resources into technologies or services t hat represent the moneymakers and markets of tomorrow. Though concentrating mainly on the disk drive industry, the author also looks at the retailing industry, pharmaceutical industry, and automobile industry including the development of the electric car, among others. Examples of disruptive technologies include the evolution of disk drives from 14 inch to 8 inch to 5.25 inch to 3.5 inch to 1.8 inch, the introduction of off-road motorcycles to North America. The replacement of transistors by vacuum tubes, and the creation of discount retailers such as K-Mart. Sustaining technologies are those that improve upon existing products or technologies 'along the dimensions of performance that mainstream customers in major markets have historically valued'. Most advances in technology have been sustaining in nature, which may very well be one reason why, when faced with a disruptive technology, ordinarily successful companies fail with regards to those disruptive technologies. Another reason for successful firms failing to capitalize on disruptive technologies, this goes against what is normally considered 'rational financial decision-making'.Generally, disruptive technologies have low profit margins, are geared to 'emerging or insignificant markets', and a company's best customers usually do not want, need, or cannot use the disruptive technology. The author outlines four basic principles to successfully deal with disruptive innovations which he likened to man first learning how to fly. In the introduction, he wrote that when man first learned to fly, he ignored the basic principle of physics. Once the basics principles of physics were recognized and put to use, man was able to fly. Similarly, he argues that once managers recognize and utilize the principles of disruptive innovation, they will be able to successfully deal with such innovations. These principles are: Companies Depend on Customers and Investors for Resources. Small Markets Don't Solve the Growth Needs of Large Companies. Markets That Don't Exist Can't Be Analyzed. Technology Supply May Not Equal Market Demand. These four principles are discussed in the firs half of the book. The author argues that if managers can understand and use these four principles when faced with disruptive technologies, they then can and will be able to effectively navigate through those unknown waters. One of the reasons put forth for repeated failures is that the then-successful companies focused solely on providing what their customers wanted and neglected to look to or invest in nascent technologies. Their total customer focus caused them to lose sight of new and potentially lucrative markets and products. Also put forth as a reason for these failures is the companies' fears of cannibalization; that us is, the companies feared that the new disruptive technology would be purchase at the expense of their more successful products. However, as he points out, disruptive technology never initially replaces and existing technology, and , as such , the short term fear of cannibalization of existing high profit products is unfounded. When and established company waits to introduce a disruptive technology until the market for that product is already established, then the fear of cannibalization is much more real.The author looks also to value networks to determine whether or not a company will be successful with regards to disruptive technologies. A value network is essentially the framework that a company uses to solve problems, deal with its customers, and generally do its business. It is from within this network that marketing decisions and 'perceptions of the economic value of a new technology' are formulated. As can be deduced, a large, established firm will have different marketing plans and value perceptions of a new product for a small or unknown market than would startup or smaller company. Often times it is through this value network that the decisions to pas on a new technology are made. Shadow prices are discussed in relation to how different value networks view the varying characteristics of the product. The author outlines six steps in the evolution of a disruptive technology: Disruptive technologies were first developed within established firms. Established firms may have chosen not to market the technology, but they knew how to develop it. Marketing personnel then sought reactions from their lead customers. The most important customers have no use at the moment for the new technology and, therefore, show little interest in it. Established firms step up the pace of sustaining technological development. They do this in order to keep up with the needs of their current customers and thereby 'win the competitive wars against other established firms which were making similar improvements'. By taking this tack, established firms neglect possible competition from entrant companies with disruptive technologies. New companies were formed, and markets for the disruptive technologies were found by trial and error.Often the people who developed the disruptive technologies at the established firms would leave and form their own companies to market their innovations. In the process, they would develop and new market. The entrants moved up-market. Once these new companies developed their own markets, they were able to make some changes to their products and begin to move in on the established firms. Established firms belatedly jumped on the bandwagon to defend their customer base. By this point, it is generally too late for the established firms. Those that succeed in getting the new technology to market generally don't get any significant market share. They basically just hang on. The author examined companies such as Apple, Hewlett-Packard, Kresge, Woolworth's, and Honda. He concluded that the successful managers took the following steps when faced with disruptive technologies. They embedded projects to develop and commercialize disruptive technologies within an organization whose customers needed them. When managers aligned a disruptive innovation with the 'right' customers, customer demand increased the provability that the innovation would get the resources it needed. They placed projects to develop disruptive technologies in organizations small enough to get excited about small opportunities and small wins. They planned to fail early and inexpensively in the search for the market for a disruptive technology. They found that their markets generally coalesced through an iterative process of trial, learning and trial again. When commercializing disruptive technologies, they found or developed new markets that valued the attributes of the disruptive products, rather than search for a technological breakthrough so that the disruptive product could compete as a sustaining technology in mainstream markets. The decision making process that the MBA students learn at Business Schools, including decisions under risk, the minimization of regret, etc., would be among the proper and useful methods to use when making decisions regarding sustaining innovations according to the book. However, it seems that the author is arguing that it is these exact decision analyses that often cause firms to fail when faced with disruptive technologies.Disruptive technologies have to be analyzed using different decision models and that is what The Innovator's Dilemma sets out to demonstrate. The Innovator's Dilemma shows that, if addressed properly, disruptive technologies can prove highly successful and profitable. If addressed using the common decision-making approach best geared for everyday issues and sustaining technological improvements. Then disruptive technologies could prove to be a disaster for the existing staid corporation"},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"The Innovator's Dilemma presents the idea that even if you do everything right, you can still be wrong if you don't see what's coming. unfortunately, that all depends on what you can see. In this case Christensen's hindsight is 20/20 and he can say &quot;Of course they didn't see it coming.&quot; The problem is applying this to modern business. That said, it does present a very interesting way of looking at disruptive technology changes, and how sometimes you just aren't in a position to do anything unless you scrap everything and go from there. Much of his case relies on the hard drive industry, which he has some good quantitative data to work with. At the same time, it is some of his other examples, with backhoes, and steel mills that can illustrate his concept to a greater extent. Part of this is because while computer componants is a fast moving field, it is these more lumbering machine parts area that scream &quot;steady as it goes.&quot; Thus his thesis is stronger. It is almost too bad that the newest version is only updated and with a new chapter. Much of his computer hard drive case is only through 1996 - a lifetime ago in terms of technology changes. I would have been fascinated to see him revisit his data and see what it shows. Granted, that would be a complete rewrite of his book, but something that is so groundbreaking as this requires more thorough updating. Overall it is a very good and though provoking book that makes you think. Will it help you catch the next wave and survive the disruption? I am not sure I can say I took that away with me."},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"In a landmark study, the author argues that the basis of competition among businesses undergoes a paradigm shift everytime a disruptive technology is born. So what is a disruptive technology? Remember what Walmart did to Sears? Of course you do, because disruptive technologies are usually products or services that are faster, cheaper, smaller, and more convinient. Ultimately, good companies must refrain from doing what got them to the top in the first place--listening to their customers and believing everything comes down to superior technology--in order to successfully compete with the onslaught of start-ups redefining both the buying hierarchies and value networks in which they are implicated.This is without a doubt one of the best business books I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"Let's admit it, most of the books crowding business sections of large bookstores are nearly trash. If they serve any purpose at all, it is mainly to supply upper- and middle management with a lexicon of faddish buzzwords for reports, presentations and conference calls; in a few years nobody will remember most of these buzzwords and bullet points. &quot;The Innovator's Dilemma&quot; is a rare exception. It does present a new paradigm of how technological innovations actually develop and win over the previous technologies. Many reviewers pointed out key organizational aspects of the &quot;Innovator's Dilemma&quot; - &quot;how great companies fail by doing everything right&quot;. I will not repeat them. Instead I will concentrate on the important and overlooked technical side of the issue.One of the key concepts in the studies of the technological progress that emerged over the last decades is the so-called S-curves. They are usually depicted as a cascade of similar shaped curves, ascending in upper-right directions in a system of coordinates describing the performance of each new technology vs. time. According to this concept, as a new technology emerges, its performance is at first much below than the established one. As it develops, its improvement ran for a while roughly in parallel to the established technology and below it. Then, as the older technology matures, its performance improvement becomes slower and saturated (the upper end of the S-curve), and eventually is overcome by the new technology. Then the cycle repeats itself with yet another disruption.&quot;The Innovator's Dilemma&quot; in fact proposes a radical revision of this concept. New technology usually wins not because the old one exhausts its potential, but because continued improvement in the performance of old technology becomes progressively less important and valuable, what the author calls &quot;technology oversupply&quot;. Instead of the S-curves Clayton Cristensen presents what I'd call a &quot;#-pattern&quot;, although he doesn't use this term. The #-pattern consists of two pairs of parallel lines, both inclined in the upper-right direction, but at different angles. The steeper pair of lines represents the &quot;technology trajectory&quot;, of which the upper line stands for the established technology, and the lower line - the new, disruptive one. They run roughly in parallel, so that at all times the performance of the established technology is superior to the new one. The reason why the new technology triumphs nevertheless can be understood from the second - less steep - pair of lines which represents the market demand at the lower and upper ends. Initially the trajectory of the disruptive technology establishes a beachhead by meeting low-end market demands (intersecting the lower of the near-horizontal lines of the #-pattern). Then, while both established and disruptive technologies improve faster than the market demand, the disruptive one is capable of satisfying all segments of the market. At the same time at is typically much better by other criteria - e.g. cheaper, smaller, more reliable than the old one. Eventually the old technology is driven out completely.The problem for the established technology arises not because the a disruptive technology quickly overcomes it in terms of the existing metrics, but the metrics itself changes. For example, 8-inch disk drives could still pack far more megabytes than 5-inch drives in the early 80's. But the new emerging products - PCs - could not yet absorb all the megabytes allowed by the 8-inch drives. The size and the price was more important for them - that is why the 5-inch drives won.The fact that the established technology continues to hold an edge vs. the disruptive one helps explain why it is so difficult for dominant companies to perform a successful transition, even as they are often first to discover new technology. They see that their current products are far from exhausting their potential for improvement, and their customers continue to demand them. They often happy to relinguish the unappealing lower end of the market to the struggling upstarts, which seem a very long way from being credible challengers. And eventually they lose.I think that this is a very important thesis, and it is consistently presented and well-explained throughout the book. I was dissapointed to see most of the book reviewers either overlooking it or completely misunderstanding this crucial point. Kudos to C. Christensen for putting forward an original, innovative and convincing concept."},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"This book is full of insight. Here's a summary, in case you want to get a good feel of what's in the book or want to refresh your memory without re-reading the whole book.(Here, the term \\"technology\\" refers to not just engineering and manufacturing, but also marketing, investment and managerial processes -- anything that transforms the inputs of production, like land, labour and people to products and services of higher value.)(Some of the examples are partly my own conclusions.)INTRODUCTION:- Why is it so hard to *sustain* success?- Is success so unpredictable as it sounds?- This book is not about poorly-run firms. It's about why well-run firms often lose. It addresses the first question above and partly the second.CHAPTER 1:- Innovations can be sustaining (better than the previous product on the same terms) or disruptive (worse than the previous product when judged by the traditional criteria, but better in different ways).- Sustaining vs disruptive is different from incremental vs radical. The latter comparison is about the degree of change; the former about the dimensions on which the judgment is made. For example, moving from a 1 GB to a 2 GB hard disc would be an incremental change, and moving to a 1 TB hard disc would be a radical change (1000x capacity), but both are sustaining changes, since the things that matter are the same (capacity, cost per GB, etc). Whereas moving to an SSD is a disruptive change, since it performs worse than a hard disc on the traditional criteria (capacity, cost per GB, number of write cycles) but is better in terms of new criteria (speed, size, power consumption, withstands shocks, etc). So, forget about incremental vs. radical: it doesn't matter here.- Incumbents beat newcomers at sustaining innovations, but lose with disruptive innovations.- Disruptive innovations are often technically simpler than the previous generation. Example: PCs vs. mainframes. So the incumbent usually has prototypes of the disruptive technology in their labs -- they just choose not to bring it to market or to be committed about it. The failure is a business one, not a technical one.- The essence of a disruptive attack is to force the incumbent into a position where it has to destroy its strengths in order to compete.- A disruptive firm takes its technology as a given and asks, \\"who can I sell this to?\\" whereas the incumbent takes its market as a given and asks, \\"what technology can I develop for this market?\\"- When a firm tries to determine what's right, it does so in the context of its value network. For example, better for an enterprise hard disc maker might mean higher reliability or built-in encryption, while for a laptop hard disc maker, better may mean smaller size or lower power consumption.- A firm may think it's listening to the market, but it's usually listening to its market -- a subset of the entire market.- Markets that don't exist can't be measured, so it's harder to find data in support of them.- Firms that are well-managed and do the right thing (like listening to customers, investing resources to build higher-performance products that yield higher profits, going by data, etc) often can't handle disruptive innovations, and lose. If anything, the \\"right\\" thing may be counter-productive. This is why it's an innovator's dilemma.CHAPTER 2:- Technology improves in S-curves. Improvements are slow initially when a technology is new, then rapid as it's understood, then again slow as it matures. This repeats for each generation of technology.- Disruptive innovations are worse initially in traditional terms (3.5-inch hard discs had lower capacity than 5.25-inchers), so they struggle to find a market and find a marginal one, but technology often advances faster than the market needs, so they become good enough along that dimension (capacity, in this example), and their other advantages come in to the picture (portability, price, reliability, etc), so they take over from incumbents.- At some point, they may also beat the traditional technology on its own terms (capacity), because they are on a different S-curve, i.e., a different generation of technology, that eventually beats the older one. But this happens in only some cases. Even if the original technology retains its advantages over the disruptor for ever, the market doesn't care, since both technologies are over-serving market needs along that dimension. The other dimensions where the disruptive technology is better become competitive advantages. (It doesn't matter whether 3.5 or 5.25 inch discs have more space, if both have more than you need. The small size of 3.5-inch hard discs was more important, since it let manufacturers build smaller computers.)- The position that a firm occupies in the market dictates the firm's organizational structure, cost structure and margins. A mainframe component supplier may have a high cost structure, with an expensive sales force, because that's needed in the mainframe market. When a mainframe component supplier evaluates the PC business, the low margins will cause their profits to go down, below their cost structure, leading to loss, so the rational thing for them to do (from their point of view) is to not enter the PC market. Besides, their org structure and values will come in the way.- A downmarket company looks upmarket and finds higher margins, so is happy to go upmarket. The upstream guys, however, as described above, do not find the low-end market appealing, so it's a one-sided fight, with a disastrous outcome for the incumbents.- This is worth repeating: companies find it tempting to move upmarket but hard to move downmarket.- By the time the disruptive product reaches the mainstream market, it's too late for the incumbent -- the upstart has the experience and volumes, etc. Besides, the incumbents have little time to react -- they enjoy a lot of success and profits till the day the disruptive technology becomes good enough, at which point the market switches over, and they die quickly.CHAPTER 3:- Setting up a separate division in the incumbent company generally doesn't work. The division isn't given enough resources, or the cost structure or the management structure or the parent organization's values come in the way.- One effective strategy for an incumbent is to take a stake in a disruptive company so that it can eat its cake and have it too.CHAPTER 4:- Sound resource allocation causes companies to move upstream (margins are higher) but not downstream.- There are three theories on who makes decisions and allocates capital at big companies. One says that it's senior management. The other says that middle managers first filter out ideas that lead to low margins, or are incompatible with the firm's strategy, or don't have a ready market, etc, and pass on only the \\"good\\" ideas to senior management. Senior management merely thinks they are making important decisions, but the actual decisions have already been made by middle managers. The third theory (\\"resource dependence\\") says that the customers really drive the direction of the company, resource allocation, etc -- they have more of a say in the company's decisions than the people in the company.- Even when a senior manager decides to purse a disruptive strategy, the people in the organization are likely to ignore it or, at best, cooperate reluctantly if it doesn't fit *their* model of what it takes to succeed as an organization or as individuals within an organization. Well-run companies are not populated by yes-people.- Another reason it's harder for a company to move downstream is that their customers can themselves be moving upmarket. The company may not notice it's moving upmarket.- There are five reasons why it's hard to respond to a disruptive attack, but if you understand them, you can use them to your advantage.1. Customers effectively control resource allocation in well-run companies.2. Small markets don't provide sufficient growth for big companies.3. Applications for disruptive technology is unknowable in advance, and you need to fail your way to success.4. Organizations have capabilities, processes and values independent of the people within them. These strengths within their current business model are disabilities when dealing with a new market.5. Technology supply may not equal market demand.CHAPTERS 5 & 6:- It's critical for a company to develop disruptive innovation early, but not so important whether it's early or late with sustaining technology.- Companies are able to make huge, multi-year, bet-the-company investments on sustaining technology, but can't make small, technologically-straightforward investments on disruptive technology.- Developing a new market is considered risky, but it's actually less so, and more promising, than to enter an existing market dominated by entrenched companies.- The size of the organization should match the size of the market. A big company can't attack a small market. Instead, create a spinoff or acquire a small company (and run it as a separate business).- Small markets cannot generate the revenue that a large company needs, to grow at a good rate. Being big is a very real disability for an organization.- Building new markets requires iterations -- repeated failures till you succeed.- A big company can't usually speed up the growth of the market to make it attractive to it.- Asking users what they want may not help, either -- they don't know.CHAPTER 7:- Emerging markets are discovered together by suppliers and customers -- they are unknowable ahead of time by either party.- Strategies and plans for dealing with disruptive innovation should therefore be plans for learning and discovery rather than plans for execution.- People are trained (both at school and on the job) in managing existing markets, but not in discovering new ones.- Applying management and investment strategies for sustaining innovation to disruptive innovation will be disastrous. For example, these processes demand quantified data on the size of the market, revenues, etc.- Act as if your forecasts for the market are wrong, rather than that they are right.- More important than coming up the right strategy right out of the gate is to make sure you don't run out of resources or credibility until you iterate to find the strategy that works.- A big company penalizes managers for failing, making it hard to iterate.CHAPTER 8:- Managers think about whether people in the team have the capability for the job, but they should also think about whether the organization itself has the capability for the job.- An organization's capabilities derive from resources (people, cash, equipment, brands, etc), processes (how to do a particular task; processes can be formal or informal) and values (what's important?). Looking at these three separately helps us better understand what an organization can or cannot do.- Clear, consistent and broadly understood values are important as a company becomes bigger, since they allow employees to act autonomously and consistently, but they also define what an organization cannot do.- Companies have processes to bring sustaining technologies to market, but not disruptive technologies. This is partly because disruptive technologies show up rarely.- In a startup, people (resources) account for much of what gets done. Over time, processes and then values become more important. As this happens, it becomes harder for the company to change to new problems. Processes are less flexible than people, and values even less so.- This is because the very raison d'etre for processes is to do the same thing consistently, over and over again -- processes are meant to *not* change. The other reason is that processes result in the creation of organizational boundaries, which in turn resist a change in the process.- Some big companies, like McKinsey, have taken this to an extreme -- hundreds of MBAs join, and leave, every year, but they churn out solid work year after year, because the organization's strength is in its processes and values, not people.- Small companies are actually more capable of disruptive innovation than big ones, despite having far less resources, because their processes and values aid rather than come in the way of disruptive innovation.- Processes can impede disruptive innovation because of their task-specific nature -- you can't ask one process to do two fundamentally different things.- One way of looking at a potential acquisition is to ask: am I paying for resources, processes or values? To what extent is each responsible for the company's success?- If an acquired company's processes or values were the real driver of its success, the last thing you want to do is integrate it into the parent organization, because you're destroying the very thing that let it succeed.- Financial analysts often have a better intuition for the value of resources than for processes.- For example, Cisco has a very good sense of what it's doing. When it acquires a small company, it throws away the startup's processes and values, because that's not what Cisco paid for, and integrates the people into Cisco. But when it acquired StrataCom, a bigger, more mature company, it did not integrate it into Cisco. It let StrataCom stand alone, and infused its substantial resources into StrataCom, enabling it to grow at a faster rate.- Similarly, Johnson & Johnson acquired small companies building disruptive technologies like disposable contact lenses, endoscopic surgery and diabetes blood glucose meters, let them stand alone, infused them with resources, and grew each to a billion-dollar business.- Setting up a division within a big company to work on disruptive technology is hard, because while the division may have a lot of resources, the parent's processes and values hold it back, for the same reason a small company is more capable of building disruptive technology.- Toyota upended the world automobile industry by better process (for development, manufacturing, supply chains, etc), and GM responded by buying fancy equipment for $60 billion (resources), which helped little when plugged into an antiquated process. You can't fight process with resources. Again, most of a big company's value is in process and values, not resources.- Spinning out a company requires it to not have to compete with the parent company for resources; otherwise the parent company's values will starve the spinout. Only the CEO can ensure that this doesn't happen. Whether the spinout is physically separate is less important.- The less the fit between the parent's and the child's processes, the more heavyweight a team the child needs to be. When there's no mismatch, you don't even need a separate team; a product manager can co-ordinate across existing functional groups (like software engineers and user experience designers) in the parent organization. When there's a huge mismatch, you need a separate team that uses its own processes to get work done.- The less the fit between the parent's and the child's values, the more autonomous the child's organization needs to be. If there's a strong, sustaining fit, you don't need a spinout or a skunkworks -- the energy and resources of the parent organization will coalesce around it. If not, you need a spinout; otherwise the team will be starved of resources.CHAPTER 9:- When technology grows faster than the market demands, the disruptive technology becomes good enough, and customers choose products based on other attributes. This leads to a new phase in the product life cycle. People initially bought computers based on their performance, and laptops were seen as underpowered (and expensive) machines. Once laptops became powerful enough, people decided that the performance advantage of a desktop isn't as important, and they'd rather have portability, and switched to laptops.- Once a switch happens, it increases demand for the new generation of technology, and the economies of scale cause a reduction in price, so the price premium for the newer generation reduces, sometimes to zero.- Disruption can happen several times in an industry. People first bought hard discs based on capacity till both 3.5 and 5.25 inch discs had enough capacity, then bought discs based on the size, till disks became small enough, then bought discs based on reliability, until most discs approached a million hours of mean time between failure, and are now buying disks based on price.- Commoditization (competing solely on price) is the last phase of evolution of a product, when all aspects of the product have evolved to be good enough.- The \\"buying hierarchy\\" model is a generalization of this, and describes the following four phases: users buy based on functionality, then reliability, then convenience, and finally price.- We can look at the same progression from the point of view of the user rather than the product: early adopters buy based on functionality. As the required functionality is built, the market grows and late adopters enter the market and buy based on reliability, leading to another round of growth in the market, and when all products are reliable enough, the late majority come in and buy based on price. (This description leaves out the stragglers, who don't want change of any kind, and buy touch-tone phones only because you can no longer buy rotary dial phones.)- The attributes that make disruptive products worthless in mainstream markets are typically their strongest selling points in emerging markets.- So you're better off looking for a new market for your technology rather than trying to improve the technology to please the existing market. That is, look at it as a marketing challenge rather than a technical one.- Disruptive products are usually simpler, cheaper, more reliable and more convenient than established products.- Don't spend a ton of resources building a better-performing product than the market demands. A disruptor will eat your lunch.- Since technology oversupply is dangerous to incumbents, they can try to prevent this situation by making sure that demand continues to rise. Microsoft and the computer hardware companies did this, probably unintentionally, with ever-increasing hardware demands for newer versions of Windows, causing customers to continue to demand beefier computers. But this can't go on forever, since people are finding the previous version of Windows to be good enough and are not upgrading. The resulting technology overshoot led to the popularity of laptops and now the iPad.- Any of these three strategies to deal with technology oversupply (stick with the present technology and go upmarket - dangerous, move with customers's needs and adopt the disruptive technology, or prop up demand to postpone oversupply) requires predicting the two curves (technology supply and market demand) to be successful.CHAPTER 10 (case study about electric cars):- The best way (that the author knows) of identifying disruption is to draw a graph between performance improvement demanded in the market and performance improvement delivered by technology. If the two lines look like they'll meet in the future, that's the time where the industry is ripe for disruption. Of course, that requires you to identify the y-axis -- what do customers care about? There may be several of them that need to be addressed.- The attributes that matter in a car are the ability to drive 125-150 miles without refueling, to accelerate to 60mph in 10 seconds (to safely merge with freeway traffic) and a wide array of options.- Electric cars can be disruptive only if they manage to improve along these dimensions faster than market demands increase. There's a 2-4% p.a. improvement in technology along the above attributes, and only a 1% improvement in market demands, so they could be disruptive in the future.- Electric cars are disruptive, so by definition the incumbents don't see them as a threat.- Saying that electric cars will never perform as well as gasoline cars is missing the point. The question is: will they be good enough for the market?- Experts are bad at predicting the future of disruptive technology and the market sizes, so we should be skeptical of them (just as we should be skeptical of our own analysis).- If you're an electric car manufacturer, how would you create a (unsubsidized) market?- First of all, the market we're looking for is not the current market, by definition, since it's a disruptive technology.- Most car manufacturers will focus precisely and myopically on the current market, because of resource dependence (customers decide where a company invests) and small markets not providing sufficient growth for big companies.- So, look for a market that's okay with a slow car that doesn't travel very far.- Second, no one can learn ahead of time what the early markets for electric cars will be, whether by market research, asking customers, etc. The only option is to iterate in the market by selling real cars to real people who pay real money.- Government incentives or mandates are likely to distort the search for a market, rather than aid it, so don't take those into account.- Third, the business plan must be a plan for learning, not for executing a preconceived strategy. Don't spend all your resources on the first iteration, like Apple did with the Newton.- Speculation on potential markets: cars for teenagers, whose parents don't want them to go fast or far, or taxis and other vehicles for use within congested Asian cities, since electric vehicles can be more efficient in stop-and-go traffic.- Chrysler is trying to improve the technology for the market (building a car with almost 1 ton of batteries, which costs $100K) rather than trying to find a market for the cars as they exist. Ford's doing the same thing. Wrong strategy.- Performance oversupply seems to have occurred in cars -- people don't buy cars based on which one accelerates to 60mph the fastest, and there's overchoice in options.- Which means that the basis for competition will change. The first electric car will be simple and convenient.- Since we need to iterate several times, design so that features, function and styling can be changed quickly and cheaply. Get the initial design out quickly and cheaply.- Design for a low price. Disruptive technologies typically have a lower sticker price, though the running costs may be higher. Smaller disks were cheaper, but more expensive per MB. Hydraulic excavators were cheaper, though they cost more to move a given quantity of earth in a given time. Similarly, an electric car must be cheap, even if it costs more per km to run.- Don't hope for technological breakthroughs. A technological breakthrough is needed only if you choose to view electric cars as a sustaining technology, rather than choosing to harness the laws of disruptive innovation.- Maybe electric cars will eventually have a range of 150 miles, but those will be built by companies that create a new market and then develop the sustaining technologies need to take them upward into more attractive markets. Remember that companies are upwardly mobile and downwardly immobile.- Remember that we'll need to create a new distribution channel, as has happened historically with disruptive innovation, because existing dealers won't accept it. The electric car won't fit the dealers' model for making money any more than it fits the incumbent car manufacturers' models for making money.- Create an autonomous business unit or a separate company whose stock is owned by the parent. This makes resource dependence work for us rather than against us, since our customers will be electric car users rather than gasoline car users. A separate BU also solves the problem of a small market not providing sufficient growth for big companies. Rather than fight with company management as to whether the business is viable, let customers decide."},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"The book is well researched and written to effectively educate on that information.

It has positively influenced more technology executives than any other book.The book does a wonderful job of explaining how traditions, bureaucracy, disbelief about the potential of new technologies, and misconceptions about the market hurt companies. Professor Christensen is a Boston Consulting Group alum, as am I, and that firm has been very interested in the question of why dominant firms lose out to new entrants featuring innovative technologies. Professor Christensen has written the best work on this subject that it has been my pleasure to read. Unlike most academics, he is rigorous without being dull or irrelevant to those who must operate businesses. I particularly found his exploration of the differences between a sustaining and a disruptive technology to be very useful. His insights into how accounting and financial concerns can &quot;stall&quot; organizational progress were also valuable.His cases (especially the hard disk ones) accurately capture many of the classic &quot;stalls&quot; that delay organizational progress. For example, tradition says that everyone focuses on serving the current customers. That's where the bread and butter are. Also, the overhead structure is established to serve those current needs.Both perspectives no longer serve when a disruptive technology is involved, and he persuasively argues that being first with disruptive technologies is usually very important.Bureaucracy comes into play because the authorization process requires a lot of confidence by those who will bet their careers that the market and financial projections will be achieved. The bureaucracy also increases the likelihood that an error will be made, or an unnecessary delay will occur.Disbelief comes from the tendency to misdefine who the customers will be and to underestimate the long-term potential of the technology. Professor Christensen puts in some nice technology development/time charts in to show how to better anticipate a new technology expanding from a lower need-defined market into the mainstream market.Misconception comes in because people misunderstand the danger of the disruptive technology, and how to manage it. THE INNOVATOR'S DILEMMA is very hepful here because it provides a model of best practices to cure the misconception stall here.Three other stalls are often important: Procrastination (delaying when delay is costly); Ugly Ducklings (avoiding what is unattractive, physically or financially); and Communications (not getting the message or not understanding the message). I suspect all 3 play a big role in the cases here, but I could not tell from the way the cases were written. I hope in his future work, Professor Christensen will also tie his thinking into the idea of innovation itself.I personally favor an 8 step process for improving innovation. One, measure everything you can in an area to understand how the measurements can help you improve. Two, apply the same approach to your most important activities. Be sure to consider how and why noncustomers do not find your offerings appealing. Three, seek out the best practices in other industries in these important activities, and estimate where these best practices will be in five years. Four, assemble a new combination of best practices from these cases that goes beyond what any one company will be doing in five years. Five, imagine the best that anyone will ever be able to do, ever, as the ideal best practice. In the case of disruptive technologies this would involve spotting them well in advance and being able to pursue them without pain to the rest of the organization, and pursuing very rapid adoption that leads to dominating the new marketplace. Six, find ways to approach the ideal best practice. Seventh, put the best people, resources, and incentives together to create great success in exceeding the future best practice and approaching the ideal best practice. Eight, repeat steps one through seven.Do buy, read, and apply the lessons of THE INNOVATOR'S DILEMMA. This is pure gold. Also, send Professor Christensen a friendly note to encourage him to do more studies like this one on innovation. He deserves our support.I also suggest that you set up some skunk works to advance potentially disruptive technologies, as a way to develop more experience in improving your innovative potential. You may also wish to study Cisco's attempt to be technology agnostics, to see what you can learn from their experience as well.Let innovation reign supreme!"},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"Dr. Christensen's book offered me a fresh perspective into looking at how large established business failed. As the author explained it, the standard process that governs sound management could be the same one that destroys the company. I found his use of graphics and quantities data sufficient as well as very useful in understand concepts such as the S-curve and the value networks. The detailed analysis shows that the author has done quite a bit of research into the topic and that makes the data more credible to me. His writing style is very easy to understand and organized. First few chapters go into how disruptive technology can destroy a company if not harnessed. His later chapters list guidelines on how to avoid the pitfalls. These guidelines are followed thoroughly by many case studies and quotes from industry leaders. While company's policies shouldn't be based on a few guidelines and the situations in a person's particular industry may find the guidelines hard to follow, the author's particular views are irrefutable and should at least be considered by the managers. It's really exciting to see him link the same principles to so many varying industries from high tech to low tech. The overarching principle of sustaining technology and disruptive technology and how a company should embrace it could be applied to any large established industry.People who are interested in the business world should read this book and should especially be read by top managers in large corporation because many of them are ultimately responsible for success or failure of implementing disruptive technology. However, this is not a perfect book. I am a bit skeptical as to whether these rules apply to medium sized companies or companies with low margins. Therefore, my opinion is that the guidelines listed here really only applies to large organization with a lot of resources to divide. Also, The author sometimes repeat his points more than he should. He tends to concentrate so much on the hard disk drive industry that he left less room to get into deeper analysis into other industries.Overall, I think this is a great read for anyone interested in business and wondered about how large companies such as Montgomery Wards could go belly-up or why Digital Corporation disappeared from our vocabulary."},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"When I read the Clayton Christensen theories originally, I found this book very thought provoking and well researched, but I posit that the author was essentially incorrect in ordering in the primary barriers. (He shows the symptoms as the inhibitors). I find that communication theory and attention density theory covers the innovation barriers better. Surveys and social research do back up the book, but not the theories based on neuroscience of leadership and innovation. Fear of failure is far less a barrier than the psychological effort of focusing attention in a busy environment. Fear is a symptom of the stress of change and the human tendency to want to reduce complexity.I disagree with the basic premise of fear, based on ...1) Signal to Noise and communication theory: Organizations that have high levels of noise (and churn) create \\"static\\" that cause most managers to raise barriers to innovation due to the background noise of ongoing activities. Innovations add another signal that must be discerned through the many emails, processes, phone calls and activity noises that managers must process. Innovators (rare enough) are more successful when the environment has lower noise. Small agile groups are more efficient because organizational noise is reduced. (Stallings, Shannon, Nyquist, et al on information theory).2) Attention Density and Cognitive Resources: Most persons can pay attention to 5 to 7 key items or issues. A disruptive innovation is often lost in the background noise of administering daily activities. Non-routine activities distract from the \\"job at hand\\" and the change becomes an issue. Most really don't fear failure, we fear innovation as another item to manage that adds change to our over busy world. This is normal, and understandable as a result of the complex world. Small organizations that focus on innovation have a routine of innovation. Small team tactics tend to be more effective. Research in attention density, cognitive resources and the neuroscience of leadership is more important than fear analysis. Innovative decision making is complex and detailed, often hard to follow as it describes a \\"what if\\" path of thought. Fear of failure is more often fear of management. See the Neuroascience of Leadership by David Rock and Jeffrey Schwarz (UCLA work of Naomi Eisenberger).I would posit the cause as change overload - a person rejects innovations or the solution, if the scope exceeds the attention they can budget.3) Big Organizations can't innovate is false (if they can segment). Note that small groups (like Six Sigma teams) can be created ad hoc as the developers of disruptive innovation. This isn't new, Ford's Tiger teams, focus groups, the Manhattan project and Thomas Edison's Menlo Park are very similar to the Six Sigma processes of Visualize (and model), Commit, Prioritize (and Focus), Characterize, Innovate on the Problem (focus), and Achieve.Like the book, don't concur with the conclusion.

Why this happens is the subject of Clayton Christensen's thoughtful Innovator's Dilemma. Although originally published in 1997, it's a highly relevant and useful read today.Christensen was interested in how the market leaders missed the disruptive innovations. At the time, most thought the corporate leaders were just too arrogant or too bureaucratic to see the disruption coming. Could there be more structural forces at play? Turns out, there are.The first half of the book follows the development of the disk drive and the hydraulic excavator to understand and make clear these forces. First, the author distinguishes between sustaining technologies and disruptive technologies. Market leaders, it turns out, are capable of innovation but those innovations typically occur as incremental evolutionary changes to existing products - sustaining innovations.Where they get tripped up is the development of disruptive technologies which fundamentally transform the existing product. In many cases the market leader also developed early forms of the disruptive technology or were at least aware of the development of the technology.Christensen, a professor at the Harvard Business School, makes the case that in ignoring the disruptive technology, the market leader was acting quite rationally. They were following their customers' and corporation's best interests.Christensen discovered that the disruptive technology yields a product that is inferior as measured by the traditional metrics for product quality. In the case of the disk drive it was price/unit storage. For the excavators, it was reach. For the disk drives, the disruption was the introduction of smaller and smaller drives. At each step of the way, these products were costlier than the existing larger drives in terms of price/unit storage. However, their advantages, in terms of other characteristics such as size, weight, and power consumption outweighed nominal improvement in the price/unit storage ratio provided by sustaining technologies. Eventually, price catches up and the disruptive products are better in both sets of characteristics.For the excavator (a big digger), the existing machines used cables to extend and control the basket. The overriding measure of performance was reach and capacity - how far out could the basket reach and grab a bucket of dirt. When hydraulic excavators appeared, their reach was very limited because of the physics of the hydraulic cylinders needed to control the baskets. Even today, a cable excavator will give you a longer reach. However, the hydraulic excavators had advantages of safety (no cable breaks) and had significantly lower maintenance costs. Eventually, as manufacturing of hydraulic excavators grew in practice, reach extended and for many uses such as building foundation excavation and utility pipe laying, as soon as the reach was sufficient for the task, the improvement in safety and the reduced maintenance costs made the hydraulic excavators superior.This book will change the way you think about innovation and the structures needed not only to spark the ideas, but get them built into new product lines."},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"I have not recieved my book as yet ,it is 3 days overdue i am not happy with the service"},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"This book is very much in the &quot;Emperor's New Clothes&quot; school.It reminds me of the university textbook written by the professor.

Why this happens and how can large organizations be made more capable of identifying and leveraging disruptive technologies are the two key challenges that the author, a research fellow from Harvard aims to address in part one and two of this book. Author uses insights from the detailed analysis of the hard disk drive industry, and also examples from the computers, retail, pharamaceutical and automobile industries.The key reason for the great company's inability to identify, develop and leverage disruptive technologies lies in its decision making mechanism. Managers in successful companies focus on achieving the organizational growth and profitability needs through working better on satisfying the needs of existing important customers through improvement in existing technologies, making more efficient use of resources and designing and fine-tuning processes to make them more suitable to address repetitive tasks in most cost effective manner. In such a scenario, managers would view every technology through the prism of its relevance to existing customer needs and its ability to satisfy organizational growth and profitability requirements. The disruptive technologies which may have strengths in functionalities not valued higher by the existing customers, or may have initially smaller profit margins and market size tend to get ignored or dismissed by the Managers of successful firms in a very rational financial decision making process. These disruptive technologies often get attention, focus and ownership from start-ups or smaller forms and with time grow enough to challenge the mainstream incumbent firms. Quite often, it becomes too late for the big firms to respond to the threat then.So, what is the way out? Here author proposes a framework for analyzing the capabilities of organization to work on any disruptive technology. Organization can be viewed as comprising Resources (people, technology, products, equipment etc.), Processes (mainly organizational processes of coordination, integration, communication and decision making) and values (criteria used to make selection among choices). Big firms are able to adopt and ;leverage sustaining technological developments more effectively than disruptive ones as the sustaining technologies exhibit greater for towards prevailing organizational RPV profile. Disruptive technologies would conflict with mainstream values (say profitability hurdle rate) and may not get necessary attention, support or resources.There are three options available with big firms, try create isolated inlands working on disruptive technologies within the existing firm(with limited chances of success), wait and watch and buy smaller firms as the disruptive technology start showing promise (at higher cost and may not be available as well) or create (spinout or acquire) smaller firm to work on opportunity. Author tends to support the last option.\\"When a threatening disruptive technology requires a different cost structure in order to be profitable and competitive, or when the current size of the opportunity is insignificant relative to the growth needs of the mainstream organization, then and only then is a spin out organization a required part of the solution\\". Match the size of the organization to the size of the market- so that everyone views the endeavor as crucial to the growth and profitability of the organization. Johnson and Johnson used this strategy very effectively to launch products if disruptive technologies (say disposable contact lens, endoscopic surgical equipment) through very small companies acquired for this purpose.Besides the RPV framework to help organization address disruptive technological opportunities, author also presents certain principles in dealing with disruptive innovations, such as \\"markets that don't exist can not be analyzed\\".This book is both thought provoking and resourceful. It not only sensitizes to the limitations of traditional decision making process in addressing disruptive technological interventions but also provides some preliminary guidelines/ framework on how to overcome these limitations."},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"Not quite as easy to read as I would have liked.

He also gives examples of companies who followed his advice and survived.The only question I was left with was how to determine if a new technology is disruptive or worthless?

The book discusses how larger companies rarely are successful in developing products for emerging or non-existent markets.The book provides some very relevant examples how larger companies--primarily in the technology sector, but not limited to them--often find themselves stuck trying to satisfy their current, and large, customers. This often precludes them from devoting resources to new technologies for emerging markets, due to the fact that those markets do not yet exist, and will not provide adequate revenues to maintain a required level of growth.The Innovators Dilemma is generally well written, but at times a bit verbose. I found that some sections were difficult to follow, due to the grammar that is used. I found the book interesting, although there are a lot of examples revolving around the disk drive industry, which personally I do not have a lot of interest in.This book is likely to be helpful for managers of companies that have or use some sort of technology that sets them apart from their competitors. In particular, this will be helpful for managers at the larger companies that need to have large revenue growth year over year. It could also be helpful for managers of smaller companies, especially those who are designing products that do not have a market yet, so they are able to understand what the competitive advantage that they will have over the large companies providing the existing technology.This book does intend to give managers ideas how to avoid the \\"dilemma,\\" however it is my impression that it would be very difficult for one, or even a group of, individual manager to change the companies' focus to the point necessary to avoid the trap. There are many changes that one must incur to avoid the problem of trying to satisfy current customers who are providing your revenue stream, including garnering support from upper management and other stakeholders, as well as altering the processes and values of the organization.Overall, I would recommend this book to mangers who have decision making authority or influence in companies that produce or use technology products. It provides an interesting viewpoint, although I feel that it is a bit too limited to be of use to a wider audience."},{"Title":"The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary National Bestseller That Changed The Way We Do Business","review":"I concur with the large majority of reviewers that this is an exceptional book that reveals and explains clearly some of tthe amjor factors forcing technological evolution.The author clearly points out that a primary factor for technological replacement is a mismatch between what a technology can deliver and what service values customers are willing to pay for. He demonstrates with case studies that technological capability evolution usually outpaces the increase in customer needs. This will usually result in a occurance where teh customer does not need and is unwilling to pay for a technology and so will replace by what was seen previously as an inferior choice.Technological replacement is the scenario presented by the author. However there is another alternative which he did not describe. Chrostensen sees technological replacement as a change to a different network of values that means a change to a different technology. However the case of the competition between Ethernet and ATM (asynchronous transfer mode)for primacy in the local area network environment shows that is not teh only case. Ethernet was the existing technology and was based primarily on low cost. Much technological invenstment was made to reduce the costs of Ethernet interfaces until tehy became cheap enough to be ubiquitous. Its value as a low cost solution was challenged by ATM which was able to be competitive with Ethernet in price due to semiconductor advances and promised much more in the way of quality of service for new applications such as multimedia and voice processing.ATM was the disruptive technology but it did not replace Ethernet. However its value network did dramatically alter the value network that Ethernet provided. Ethernet providers did not retreat into niche high performance markets as Christenesen illustrates that suppiers of other technologies did. Instead they adopted the value network of ATM and added it to their own. They also challenged ATM in its own value network by creating new values such as speed and ease of set up which directly challenged the fundamental ATM technology.As Christensen pointed out, a change to a value metwork brings about technological change. However in this case there was no technological replacement. The existing technology faced the challenge to its value network by coopting that of the disruptive technology and adding new values of its own. It was the disruptive technology of ATM which fled to niche high performance markets."},{"Title":"EVOLUTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS: THE ORIGINS OF THE WAY WE THINK","review":"I came across this book as I was searching for answers to the many questions concerning the consciousness of human beings and the enigmatic process of intelligent thinking. Subsequently, I was attracted to this book by the title and by the credentials of the author, who is a neuropsychiatric researcher and is the president of the Institute for the Study of Human Knowledge and a professor at the University of California Medical Center in San Francisco and at Stanford University. The author has done extensive research on the human brain and is the author of twenty books concerning the human brain. It wasn't difficult to realize that if anyone is to speak about the human consciousness, Dr. Ornstein is the one.The book begins by shocking the foundations of your knowledge of the human brain. The first thing the author tells you is that \\"The mind is a squadron of simpletons. It is not unified, it is not rational, it is not well designed - or designed at all.\\" And as you may have noticed by now, you must be a fan of the Evolution theory to even carry on after this sentence as the first third of the book discusses the steps that our ancestors had to evolve through for us to end up with the conscious mind. Dr. Ornstein discusses the most recent biological and paleontological findings that can help us reconstruct the history of the evolution of the human brain. Then, he takes a shot at answering one of the famous dilemmas of the human evolution theory that questions the reasons behind the evolution of the human brain. Why did a brain capable of landing humans on the moon, splitting the atom, painting the Mona Lisa, writing Hamlet, and composing Don Giovanni evolve at a time when human beings were barely working with stone tools? What brought about the ballooning of a Homo habilis' brain measuring 600-750 cubic centimeters to the Homo erectus' brain measuring 775-1,225 cc? The author extends a surprising but logical argument in this case.Dr. Ornstein proceeds to explain that the environment that shaped and influenced the evolution of our brains ceased to exist only very recently in evolutionary terms. Our brains are equipped to react to events and dynamics that are completely gone, and our brains were not given sufficient time to physically evolve to fit the environments that our own advancements brought about.The author carries on in his campaign to render more common notions erroneous by explaining that the conscious mind is much weaker than what is publicly thought to be. He demonstrates how the unconscious mind influences our supposedly rational and logical thinking and even our free will. He does that while describing the mechanics of thinking, dreaming, and memorization. I learned many astonishing facts about the way our minds work. I learned how our unconsciousness gets wired up throughout our earliest years and how it continues to affect us for the rest of our lives.After that, the author begins to define what is the \\"Self\\" and how it can be identified. This is a very exciting yet confusing part of the book as the author argues that there are many selves existing within us. He provides evidence proving that not one \\"I\\" exists within us, but many. Each \\"I\\" has its own priorities and skills and is brought into action by the subconscious when the situation is deemed to require that specific \\"I.\\" He explains how the working of those minds-in-one affect our lives and how they are being taken advantage of by advertising agencies and politicians to name a few.The last part of the book discusses the author's view of the future of humanity. He predicts a grim destiny based on the limitations of the human brain to think on a global scale when human activities began to have numerous global effects. The brain is equipped to work in a small environment and never had to deal with events and concerns that affect the world as a whole. He explains how our means of raising children and of education are enforcing these limitations upon our minds. But the author doesn't leave the picture at that. He suggests solutions as to how help the mind evolve consciously to fit our rapidly changing environment. He recommends methods to strengthen our conscious minds and to make us more aware of the workings of our unconscious minds. He concludes the book by saying that \\"Undertaking conscious evolution, with an understanding of the complexity of our myriad minds within, may be easier, closer at hand, and more liberating than we might normally think.\\"The book will definitely take you through a fascinating journey into the human brain and its origins. The author's writing style is very accessible to non-professional readers while maintaining a high level of sophistication. You can be assured that you will stumble across many new ideas that will raise your eyebrows in astonishment and amazement. The book contains many drawings to help explain (and sometimes to prove) the author's arguments, though I found some drawings to be too silly and too obvious to be included.However, you will come across many grammatical and spelling mistakes that might shake your faith a bit in the overall quality of the book as it did to mine.In summary, this books addresses many questions about what consciousness is, how it affects our lives, and how can we advance it even further. If you find this topic to be interesting then this book is a must read."},{"Title":"EVOLUTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS: THE ORIGINS OF THE WAY WE THINK","review":"Trying to do scientific reading on consciousness studies can often be as pleasant as pulling teeth, the stuff of nightmares for those who are not biology majors. For all those interested in the subject but yearn for an authoritative scientist who speaks layman's English, this book is for you. Dr. Ornstein was one of the groundbreaking researchers in hemispherical differences in brain functioning (right v. left), and here he treats the reader to an eminently enjoyable exploration of how--and why--human consciousness likely evolved, what its true properties are, and what these mean for understanding ourselves. The illustrations in the book are priceless and hilarious (much in the tradition of Macaulay's &quot;The Way Things Work), along with Ornstein's witty writing style and easily digestible prose to communicate complex ideas and concepts in a lucid, exciting manner.His euphemism &quot;a squadron of simpletons&quot; is a common and welcome refrain--he shows us a human brain equipped with more non-specialized neurons than it will ever need, adaptable to more habitats and social situations we can ever imagine. His tie-in of Freud to Darwin is ingenious, and proves his point that much greater: fundamentally the human brain, he argues (echoing colleagues like Gerald Edelman, etc.), is not a rational mechanism like a computer; it was never designed to be. Instead, it is adaptive: the ultimate gift of evolution to our species of the ultimate survival adaptation--evolution becoming conscious of itself. This book does indeed clear one's mind in a rather &quot;zen&quot;-like fashion, once you understand the transitory and fragmentary nature of ordinary consciousness and the revisionist nature of memory. In the end, Ornstein suggests, such an account of the evolution of consciousness can help our species adjust to its next, possibly final adaptation: conscious evolution, utilizing what we know about human consciousness to better inform our interactions with our species, and with the larger world."},{"Title":"EVOLUTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS: THE ORIGINS OF THE WAY WE THINK","review":"This is a great book for the person on a quest for the evolution of consciousness. Ornstein does a super job of writing about a very complex matter in terms everyone can understand.
