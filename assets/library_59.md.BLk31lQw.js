Weighing in 700+ pages for a typical printing, this work is not a quick and easy read by any stretch of the imagination. Many of Smith's great metaphors are found in the first quarter of the book, and I felt bored reading the latter parts. It is not that Smith was wrong, by any means, but rather that many of his arguments are now well-accepted and can be demonstrated in much more succinct manners. I feel that Smith's multitudes of examples are not particularly important to the average man.With that said, I reiterate that this is an important work that should be understood by everyone - but this does not necessarily mean reading all of it.

The Wealth of Nations is certainly one of these books.

(It wasn't on the syllabus). Definitely my loss. Is it an easy read? No, but this Kindle edition has modernized spelling and lost the random capitalization. The vocabulary is be a little challenging, but that's why your Kindle has a dictionary built in - and you may also need Google, as I did, for some of the more obscure usages. A little background in 17th-18th century British history also helps. I recommend making plenty of notes in your Kindle as you go.Smith compares/contrasts the economies of hunter-gatherer, nomadic and warrior civilizations, as well as feudal and mercantilist economies, and outlines a free-trade system which he would like to see, which we call \\"capitalism\\". Unfortunately, it seems to me that the mercantile system has prevailed in the long run, at least as far as international trade is concerned. He makes considerable use of historical examples as well as contemporary (to him) events, and he seems ambivalent about the prospects for the American colonies which were then in revolt.Wordy? A little repetitive? Yes, Smith could have used a good editor. But not to be missed.

All I can say is \\"genius.\\" It is of interest not only to the student of economics, but also of history and philosophy. I read this book because I was told that it is widely considered to be the foundation of modern economics. As I am starting a private study in this area, I felt this was a good place to start. If you are starting a study on economics START HERE! Adam Smith ties very abstract concepts to real-life examples that are understandable even today.I read somewhere that this book changed the world. Without knowing more about the period, I cannot say whether it did or not-but based on the magnificence and scope of this work, I believe it could be true. I can see the imprint of Adam Smith everywhere in modern economics-even in Karl Marx cites him! If you read my other reviews, you will see that I have never said this before-so understand, I do NOT say this lightly: This book has truly enriched my understanding of the world around me-and opened my eyes to things that I did not previously understand. Yes-this book changed my outlook on life!You know you are reading a work of timeless genius when you can apply directly what a man wrote in 1776 to the year 2010.If you are considering buying this book be aware of a few things:1) This book was published in 1776-and uses 1776 english. It's a little tough to follow at first, but you get used to it. If you've read America's founding fathers it really constitutes NO difficulty2) Despite the language, this book is VERY readable. His examples are understandable and the structure of the book makes it easy to follow him from point to point.3) This book is HUGE. This version (Bantam Classics) has 1208 pages.4) I wish Bantam would have given more room for notes in the margin.A few other observations about this book-* I was AMAZED by how different banking and financing were in the 1770s.* This book illustrates in SO many ways that people haven't changed AT ALL-very interesting - and amusing to see that illustrated over and over again.* Be prepared for an unrelating (and very convincing) argument for completely free trade.* Some of his digressions (especially the one on corn) were a little tough to get through.* He is SO honest in this book. In a day when pro-business talking heads will excuse any excess-Adam Smith has NO problem taking certain business practices to task. This book taught me, an Unrepentant Capitalist Pig that it is not only OK, but desirable to denounce bad business practices.* I feel a lot of the material in this book shows that a \\"gold standard\\" currency is not the magic bullet that many people today pretend it to be. (not that it's bad-but gold standard has it's own problems)* I feel the material in this book (specifically book 5) could be used to make a strong argument FOR the Fair tax (National Sales Tax)* The arguments he makes about the colonies in North America (us) are VERY surprising. I don't want to spoil it-but I had to re-read it a few times to make sure I understood what he said. - His argument makes sense, but I didn't see it coming.* Being a proud Pennsylvania resident, I was excited to see all the Pennsylvania references.* This book should be REQUIRED reading for any politician who will be assuming elected office.

It reproduces the Carman edition of 1904, a very thoroughly footnoted (or endnoted) version.

This is by far the most expensive Kindle edition of Adam Smith, and shouldn't have screwed up its notes -- the only reason for paying five extra dollars -- in this way.Let me add that the Amazon reviewing mechanism is, as usual, inadequate for reviewing Kindle editions; my review ends up one of over fifty reviews discussing the book in general, not the Kindle edition specifically."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"After some 6 months of buying Kindle books, I've found that the better-known publishers as often as not DON'T do a better job of formatting their titles for Kindle. The Modern Library's Kindle version of \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" is a case in point. The footnotes, which appear at the end of each chapter, are all run together in one big paragraph, without any numbers to show where each footnote begins. Moreover, while the footnote references in the text are linked, the links take you only to the start of the footnotes for that chapter, rather than to the pertinent footnote itself. A lesser problem is that the paragraphs in the text do not begin with indents; thus, the only way to tell when a new paragraph starts is if you come to a line that extends only halfway across the screen.On the plus side, this edition does include the explanatory call-outs of the original (in italics at the end of each section they pertain to) and the lengthy 1906 explanatory introduction by Edwin Cannan (though for some reason not the introduction by Robert Rubin to the recent Modern Library paperback).But it's a shame that Modern Library didn't do a better job with the formatting, especially since other Kindle publishers have made TWON available at a fraction of what Modern Library charges."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"This book is so widely cited and interpreted contrary to the author's original thought, that every economist should read it completely to avoid being misled by such incorrect interpretations.First, let us take the \\"invisible hand\\" metaphor. When I have studied economy in the University, I was taught that almost the entire book is devoted to the \\"invisible hand\\" which means \\"self-corrective markets\\", \\"liberalism\\", \\"Laissez-faire\\" and \\"state non-intervention\\". After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith did use the term \\"invisible hand\\" only once in the entire book, in the discussion of domestic versus foreign trade.To illustrate the point, let me quote the text where term \\"invisible hand\\" is used: \\"First, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry, provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not a great deal less than the ordinary profits of stock. Thus, upon equal, or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant naturally prefers the home trade to the foreign trade of consumption, and the foreign trade of consumption to the carrying trade. In the home trade, his capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of consumption. [...]Secondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of domestic industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that its produce may be of the greatest possible value. [...]As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.\\"After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith was influenced by French Physiocrats. The Physiocrats saw the true wealth of a nation as determined by the surplus of agricultural production over and above that needed to support agriculture (by feeding farm labourers and so forth). Other forms of economic activity, such as manufacturing, were viewed as taking this surplus agricultural production and transforming it into new products, by using the surplus agricultural production to feed the workers who produced the extra goods. While these manufacturers and other non agricultural workers may be useful, they were seen as 'sterile' in that their income derives ultimately not from their own work, but from the surplus production of the agricultural sector.I have found out that this book is not about \\"invisible hand\\" or \\"Laissez-faire\\". It is quite a complete study that covers almost every basic aspect of the economy, and remains an effective introduction to economics to this day.This book is so often mischaracterized and politicized that I suggest you to read it completely by yourself. This is a must read for every economist. You can get an audio version of this book to avoid lengthy read."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"Based on his previous writings on human behaviour, Adam Smith shows, systematically and consistently, how a market-based economic system promotes general welfare through the sole maximisation of individual outcomes.

The multitude of examples and depth of discussion could stop a Mack truck, but the lessons are critical. It teaches you about the true nature of money; where it comes from, what it means. That, in turn, as you reflect on your own life, will illustrate much about how you prioritize your own life.Along with Ayn Rand's \\"Atlas Shrugged,\\" this book will indisputably change your perception of the nature of money and a how person chooses to earn their living.The only drawback to the book is that it is brutally boring--but get a large cup of Java, sit back, and dig in.

And slavery like it or not is a part of economics. It's a way to get labor for very cheap (like food, water and shelter only). On page 744 he does however call it the unfortunate law of slavery. Slavery is abhorrent and prevents the whole from reaching their great potential for the benefit of a few (the wealthy who have slaves and the consumers who get products much cheaper because of it).On page 110-111 This really stands out \\"No Society can surely be flourishing and happy of which the far greater part of the members are poor and miserable\\"Adam Smith does however place too much emphasis on Corn being the commodity that everything is measured against. It's just as easy to switch to a different food source like Rice for instance. That if enough people switched to would cause the price of corn to drop or stop being planted.On page 986 He says there is no public institution for the education of women and he talks about not educating the women like the men. He says they are taught only what their parents or guardian judge it necessary or useful for them to learn and nothing else. This clealy isn't good either but I know he was just stating a fact of life at the time.I cry BRAVO!!! for Adam Smith's take on Religion. He got the true religion right! On page 998 it says \\"because in every religion except the true it is highly pernicious and it has a natural tendency to pervert the true, by infusing into it a strong mixture of superstition, folly and delusion. Each ghostly practitioner in order to render himself more precious and sacred in the eyes of his retainers will inspire them with the most violent abhorrences of all other sects. No regard will be paid to Truth, Morals or Decency.\\" The true religion extols Truth, Morals and Decency as Jesus taught us to keep the commandments. This is the whole duty of man. To speak the truth and walk uprightly. To not steal, Not Lie, Not commit adultery, etc. But today's organized religions are more interested in building bigger buildings to get more money collected for the most part than to do good works.On page 1067 Adam Smith says \\"the ground rents of uninhabited houses ought to pay no tax\\". I wholeheartedly disagree with thisstatement. This would allow the very wealthy to own so much land that the poorer people could never own their own piece of property. That's what property taxes are for to prevent this from happening. If the poor abandon all these houses that the very wealthy own then eventually the very wealthy will be unable to pay property tax and the government will take control of their property and put it back into circulation providing their workers places to live. That's why the proper way is the way the government of the the U.S. (or maybe Idaho) has implemented it. You get a tax break for your primary residence for your place to live but none from additional properties. Not to mention another country with a lot of cash could buy up all the property in your country and control too much without doing the labor needed to keep a country functioning properly.But overall it's a very good book.Sincerely,Jon Beckmon"},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"Adam Smith's \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" is truly one of the most influential books in world history. Published in 1776, it discussed many of the economic ideas of the thought system we refer to today as classical or nineteenth-century liberalism.First and foremost, it enumerated the capitalist doctrines that led to the awesome increase in living standards over the past two centuries--doctrines such as free trade, the importance of economic growth for a society, and the idea that the entire society benefits when the individual is encouraged to pursue his economic self-interest.Smith also examined the topics of paper money and commodity standards and provided examples from the past of when currencies were debased during hard times. Perhaps the most sobering part of the book from the point of view of today is the section that discussed how governments, when they have spent far too much and can no longer service their debt, must either repudiate the debt or incinerate it via severe inflation--we can only hope that the gross overspending in recent years on the part of both parties in Washington will not bring us to that point in the coming years.Some of the other topics on which Smith held forth include apprenticeships, colonies, agriculture, defense, taxes, the differences between public and private sector employment, and fascinating comparisons of wage rates between England and the then-colonies and between parts of Britain.The book is very readable despite the fact it was written in eighteenth-century English, and is definitely worth tackling if you have a serious interest in economics."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"Don't be taken in by the gushing praise of the 4-star and 5-star reviews. Adam Smith did not found economics, and The Wealth of Nations is not a must-read. It is not the first or best case for economic liberalism, or even the best case of its time.While Adam Smith's work was a much-needed rebuke to mercantilism, it was in many ways a step back from what had already been written on economics by the School of Salamanca in the 16th Century,Richard Cantillonin 1730, andAnne Robert Jacques Turgotin 1766. It was even a step back from his own previous work, including theLectures on JurisprudenceandThe Theory of Moral Sentiments. Smith's analysis contains many serious errors that would lay the foundation for Marxism, notably his crude labour theory of value (as opposed to marginal utility), his exaggeration of the importance of the division of labour (putting in the shade such critical factors as capital accumulation and the growth of technological knowledge), his identification of some innate \\"propensity to truck, barter and exchange\\" as the cause of the division of labour (rather than differences in ability), and his adoption of the dubious Physiocratic concept of \\"unproductive labour.\\"An economist won't benefit from reading Adam Smith any more than a physicist would benefit from reading Aristotle.

This book was first published in 1776, interestingly enough.Smith noted in the \\"Plan of Work\\" that prefaces the book that among the \\"savage nations of hunters,\\" the people are often \\"miserably poor\\"; while among civilized and thriving nations, \\"a workman, even of the lowest and poorest order... may enjoy a greater share of the necessities and conveniences of life than it is possible for any savage to acquire.\\" The First Book addresses the \\"causes of this improvement, in the productive powers of labour,\\" while the Second Book treats \\"of the nature of capital stock, or the manner in which it is gradually accumulated\\"; the Third Book deals with the circumstances regarding the establishment of towns, rather than of the country; and the Fourth Book deals with various theories of political economy.He begins the book with the observation that \\"The greatest improvement in the productive powers of labour... seem to have been the effects of the division of labour.\\" He cites the example of pin manufacturing, in which a single man could perhaps make one pin a day, \\"and certainly could not make twenty.\\" But by ten persons dividing the labor, they are able to make 48,000 pins in a single day. (Pg. 3-5)He frankly acknowledges that \\"masters\\" (i.e., employers) are \\"always and every where\\" in a sort of tacit, but constant and uniform combination, not to raise the wages of labour above their actual rate. \\"To violate this combination is every where a most unpopular action, and a sort of reproach to a master among his neighbors and equals.\\" (Pg. 66-67) Yet he also notes that the inhabitants of a town \\"can easily combine together,\\" so that by voluntary associations and agreements they prevent that free competition \\"which they cannot prohibit by bye-laws.\\" (Pg. 126) He observes that \\"People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.\\" (Pg. 128)Of course, the most lastingly influential idea in the book is his concept of the \\"invisible hand,\\" by which an individual who \\"intends only his own gain... (is) led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention... By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it.\\" He adds ironically, \\"I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good.\\" (Pg. 423)Ultimately, the private interests and passions of individuals naturally dispose them toward tasks which are most advantageous to society. \\"Without any intervention of law, therefore, the private interests and passions of men naturally lead them to divide and distribute the stock of every society ... as nearly as possible in the proportion which is most agreeable to the interest of the whole society.\\" (Pg. 594-595)One cannot adequately summarize a masterwork such as Smith's within the confines of an Amazon review, of course. But anyone even remotely interested in economics and politics should seriously study this compelling and influential work."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"This review is for the Harriman House hardcover edition of Adam Smith's \\"The Wealth of Nations\\". I was shopping specifically for a nice, inclusive, cloth edition of the classic text. The book is black cloth with a white and blue dust jacket and is between 9\\" and 10\\" tall. The text includes all five books of The Wealth of Nations, not splitting them up like some other editions do. Penguin splits it up into two physical books; the Bantam edition is only 7\\" tall and over 1200 pages long - not made to hold up to multiple reads. Not that I will be reading and re-reading the book right away, but a sturdy durable binding is well appreciated. Finally, Harriman House is a British publisher of business and financial titles; Americans will be unlikely to find this edition without special ordering through a venue like Amazon.

Having read it with great ignorance on the subject was able to learn a great deal about economic principles with more depth than \\"supply and demand dictate price\\". I found the ideas behind taxing to be simple but effective given their presentation as well as Smith's arguements for a free market economy. Reading this historical text has also helped placed into context his arguemnts against the mercantile system and the taxing of the American colonies because the depth that he goes into about said subjects is more than any history class that I have taken has allotted. For some the wording may seem dated or old or borring but for those who enjoy a more analytical style or writing, such as the style used in the translations of Roman philosophy texts, the writing style should not be a problem. The most intimidating aspect of this book is its size, an aspect which can easily be overcome if the reader finds the text engaging for the above reason. While I cannot say that it is a \\"must read\\" or a \\"required read\\" for an understanding of economics simply because of the ignorance which I still possess on the subject, I can say that it is an informative read that explains in depth, using cited examples, areas of economics that are easy to grasp if the reader enjoys the text.

To minimize repetition, the differences for this version: This massive book is complete and unabridged (all five books). There is a great added feature in the form of small summary notes in the margin that accompany each paragraph. Adam Smith was a masterful writer of prose and communicates some of the most important economic and philosophical ideas in the history of western civilization. Economic theory never read so beautifully.An interesting choice for an introduction is Robert Reich. He is one of the few intellectuals from the left, and while I disagree with him more often than not, I respect his thought process. He offers his interpretation of Smith and how the ideas found in TWoN fit neatly with his positions. Selective reasoning or not, Reich does offer a nice summary line: \\"In these times, as when Adam Smith wrote, it is important to remind ourselves of the revolutionary notion at the heart of Smith's opus-that the wealth of a nation is measured not by its accumulated riches, but by the productivity and living standards of all its people.\\" Nicely said and I agree. I just disagree with Reich and his ilk on how the \\"wealth\\" of the modern nation is achieved. Adam Smith offers the roadmap, but it is up to us to keep lawmakers in DC or [insert any central government here] from regulating and taxing us to death --relegating Smith's work to the dust bin."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"\\"The Wealth of Nations\\" is more readable than you probably think, and if you actually sit down to it you'll be repeatedly astounded by Smith's shrewdness.But parts of Smith's original can be tough going in many ways. Why don't publishers acknowledge this by coming out with something more helpful than just the raw text?Unfortunately, finding an edition that will be of great use to you is problematic. That's why I'm giving this book 1 star: not for the text itself, but rather for the paucity of well-done printings out there.Anyhow. I have three before me:1. The \\"Modern Library Classics\\" edition, the one you see on this page. This is complete and unabridged in a single volume, and has a handsome, sturdy feel to it. There is a 4-page introduction and a well-done index, but what irks about this edition is that while it has a plethora of footnotes, all the footnotes are of the \\"textual comparison\\" variety (e.g., \\"12 Car. II., C. 32\\"), rather than the kind that really help you understand antiquated terms and convoluted wordings. In other words, you'll get no help from the editors here.2. Then there is the barrenWealth of Nations (Great Minds Series). There is a 2-page introduction at the beginning and an index, but beyond that it's nothing more than the original text, complete with the original punctuation and spellings (neither of which has been made more merciful for the modern reader).3. The Penguin Classics edition, in two volumes:The Wealth of Nations: Books 1-3 (Penguin Classics)andThe Wealth of Nations, Books IV-V (Penguin Classics). This is probably the least worst edition I have seen, with a superb introduction (nearly 100 pages long), and a glossary, all done by Glasgow's Andrew Skinner. But the only footnotes in the text itself are apparently Smith's own. They appear directly on the bottom of the page in question.So good luck, whichever one you choose.In case you need to know, Smith's original consists of five long chapters, or \\"books.\\"If anybody has a more respectable edition at hand, please comment and I'll incorporate it into this review."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"To be an economist without having read \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" is like being a priest without having read the Bible. As is often the case with second hand accounts, textbooks have distorted and watered down Adam Smith. Going back to the original text is both refreshing and enlightening.The \\"Wealth of Nations\\" remains the most truthful defense of the economic science. But remember that Adam Smith also wrote \\"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\\"; for Smith, economics was a search to better people's life rather than simply a quest to optimize mathematical functions or estimate variables using econometric models.To simply associate Smith with expressions such as the \\"invisible hand,\\" does not do him justice. Take, for example, the opening chapter on the division of labor: first, Smith defends the division of labor as being efficient; then, he defends it as an essential component of the freedom to allocate one's labor to one's talents; finally, he links the division of labor to trade: without the freedom to exchange the fruits of one's labor, the division of labor is meaningless. The point is that Adam Smith defends the rationale for the market, rather than just explain its mechanics.Anyone studying economics in school would think that economics is all about efficiency; this preoccupation, inevitably, breeds economists who support the market simply because it works. But to read Adam Smith is to enter the realm of an economic science where the ultimate benchmark is not efficiency but human freedom and welfare. That is, probably, what Smith would remark if he were to sit in an economics class today, and why the \\"Wealth of Nations\\" is as revolutionary today as it was two centuries ago."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"Another reviewer is correct in that there are SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS of the book missing in the Great Minds Series (green and black cover). In one instance, I noted that 150 pages were converted into 14! Also, Book IV Chapter VII is missing parts 2 and 3 (also quite lengthy portions of the piece). Go with a complete version if you're going to bother to tackle this book, or especially if you are focussing on one particular idea (since that may be one that they cut out!)...Smith may be wordy, but to cut out such an enormous amount degrades the integrity of the work. Shameful to nowhere state that LARGE chunks of this classic are absent...at least be forthcoming!If you choose a more complete version you'll get to read a classic from a better economist than a writer, but still a fantastic piece of work. Smith does tend to try to overexplain things, but you get use to his style and can appreciate that he just wants to make sure that you get his point.AMMENDMENT:Upon discussion with my Economics professor, it is possible that this green book was one of the author's first versions (which he apparently edited and added to more than once). I still say that the publisher should be more clear about the version, and that if you want his most recent updates and complete work, to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"The Wealth of Nations handles a lot of economical phenomena in a concrete but sometimes complex way. On one hand the book is filled with ideas, some convincing, some out-dated, some fundamental to the current believe in free-markets. These ideas are combined with appealing (or appalling) examples of the injustice done to people by disturbing the free-market. On the other hand however, I find that certain sections of the book require a lot of concentration. The book is an interesting, but slow and at times difficult, read.Essentially, it is a treatise on the power of individuals to maximise their own wealth and therefor a support for the natural liberty of men and an argument for free-markets. Not as a perfect system in which there will be no misery, but as a system that gives individuals the greatest (and most just) opportunity to gain happiness and which will be the quickest to respond to changes in supply and demand (and therefor decrease the misery which is created when governments ignore gaps between supply and demand).It is not a book that believes in the pure goodness of companies (but explicitly states that companies have a interest which is directly opposite to that of society as a whole. I.e. the interest of companies is to create a supply shortage so they can ask prices above costprice), but says that the best way to break the power of these companies is the allow free competition. It also reveals that political decisions that at fist glance seems compassionate, might in fact be inhumane, cruel and the cause of much suffering (because on the long run they lead to a supply shortage). The examples given here, are still relevant to view the decisions made by politicians in today's so-called free market countries.Comment on review of Micheal Brady, june 13 2005:Brady remarks that Smith was the first opponent of globalization. The (strange) evidence he gives to support this statement is that Smith supports the use of counter tariffs, if (and only if) this might lead to the removal of the initial tariff. This statement clearly shows that Smith was against protectionist measures like tariffs and only condoned them if in the short run they would lead to less protectionism and therefor more globalization! Brady also supports his statement by mentioning that Smith opposed any offshoring if the purpose of such offshoring was to supply the home market. The keyword here again being \\"if\\". Smith was against a nation stimulating offshoring because he saw no national gain. This however doesn't mean that governments should restrict labor/capital mobility, because this would go against the natural liberty of men."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"Adam Smith's \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" is one those great Classics that almost everyone should read. But if you intend buying a copy, be very careful which version you buy. Why, you ask?It's out in the public domain and a plethora of reprints are available, a great many from Print on Demand Publishers and there are some truely awful reprints available. Amazon associates reviews of a book with many different versions of the same book from different publishers. Unfortunately for us customers, Amazon is seeing a growing plague of low-quality Print-On-Demand Publishers who are specialise in reprinting copyright-expired books. Such as \\"The Wealth of Nations.\\" Some of these publishers produce quite good quality books, some do not. What you do need to do is check the publisher carefully for all these older \\"copyright expired\\" books.An outstanding example of \\"not good quality\\" is the version of \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" published by General Books LLC. This version is scanned in using OCR technology (and using pretty poor quality OCR scanning equipment and software from the look of their books), is overall of very poor print quality, uses automated reproduction with no index, no illustrations and an excessive number of typos.Lest you doubt, here's some word for word quotes from the publisher's own web site:\\"We created your book using OCR software that includes an automated spell check. Our OCR software is 99 percent accurate if the book is in good condition. However, with up to 3,500 characters per page, even one percent can be an annoying number of typos....\\"\\"After we re-typeset and designed your book, the page numbers change so the old index and table of contents no longer work.

We would really like to manually scan and add the illustrations. But many of our books only sell a couple of copies....\\"\\"We created your book using a robot who turned and photographed each page. Our robot is 99 percent accurate. But sometimes two pages stick together. And sometimes a page may even be missing from our copy of the book.

Conversely, if any of these are missing, you're taking a chance on the quality. I've bought a few based on my selection criteria above and they've been good quality.

Cannan treats us to a lengthy (63 page) introduction which includes a feisty justification of why this edition is put together precisely the way it is, including an authoritative history of those first five editions, with comparisons and contrasts. Once the book itself starts, Canaan's input is non-invasive; I felt that he was sitting silently and attentively in the wings, like a stage director overseeing a play.* The original wording is preserved, augmented by explanatory conventional bottom-of-the-page footnotes. Cannan's edits (mostly to correct typos and make clarifications) are most welcome, and even the typographical errors are preserved verbatim in footnotes. An example of a clarification: the author's mention of a \\"fire-engine\\" had me thinking of a horse-drawn vehicle for putting out fires. Cannan's footnote: \\"I.e., steam engine.\\"* The English usage of two centuries ago is a novelty, and much easier to follow than I had expected.* The author's original footnotes are exactly where he placed them: in little insets around the page.As for the content itself, the prevalence of Smith's ideas in modern treatises such asBasic Economicsis startling! (I recommendBasic Economicsas a first book on Economics, by the way.) I got MANY insights into the beginnings of America and what was going on in the world at the time this was published. I now understand why towns formed along sea coasts and waterways: it was much more efficient to transport goods via water than by land. Forget Economics for a second: any general historian would be remiss without reading this."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"Alfred North Whitehead famously stated that all of Western philosophy was merely a footnote to Plato. It seems to me one could say the same thing about economics in regard to Adam Smith. There were certainly economists before Adam Smith (just as there were philosophers before Plato); and there are some, I am sure, who will claim that some of the economists writing before Adam Smith were actually superior to Adam Smith in some ways (just as there are philosophers who prefer the pre-Socratics to Plato).But Adam Smith, like Plato, was able in his work to define a relevant set of problems which to a large degree are the same problems that are still being dealt with, and debated, within economics today; and, like Plato, the work of Adam Smith has been the source for various strands, or schools of economic thought, each of which finds its ground in a different aspect of Adam Smith's work. Adam Smith's analysis of the division of labor (the productive forces of society), his adherence to a labor theory of value (at least in part) and his distinction between productive and unproductive labor have been sources for the tradition of economic thought following Ricardo and Marx; while Adam Smith's analysis of the benefits of laissez-faire economic policies, his analysis of exchange, and determination of price through supply and demand, have been sources for the Neo-classical, marginalist, and free-market strands of economic thought.Adam Smith sees the wealth of a nation as consisting in its annual produce (what we today would call GDP). This is the central idea behind the whole book and is Adam Smith's major innovation in regard to previous economic thought (as I understand it). Adam Smith will evaluate the harm or the benefit of various economic policies by attempting to determine the over-all effect each policy will have on the annual produce of society as a whole. If a policy increases this annual produce then it is beneficial to society as a whole. If a policy decreases this annual produce then it is harmful to society as a whole. This is still, to a large degree, the measure we use when evaluating the effects of a given economic policy, though we are perhaps beginning to see that the benefit or harm of a given policy cannot be reduced to its effect on annual produce or GDP (environmental effects, for instance, effect society as a whole and have to be measured against effects on GDP in determining the costs and benefits of any economic policy).With few exceptions Adam Smith believes that laissez-faire policies are the best policies for increasing the over-all wealth of a nation and he bases his argument on his notion of the \`invisible hand'. This is another one of Smith's important theoretical innovations; the notion that each individual, by pursuing their own interest, without any thought or conscious plan for society as a whole, does not lead to chaos but tends, as if guided by an invisible hand, towards a maximization of the yearly annual produce of a nation. It is not necessary for society to \`plan' for this outcome in a conscious way; in fact, no amount of conscious planning could improve on the outcome produced by simply allowing individuals to pursue their own interests unfettered by government. This has been one of the most influential ideas ever put forward by anyone since the beginning of human history, whether for good or ill.So there are a number of reasons why anyone who is interested in economics should study The Wealth of Nations. First, Adam Smith defines a common set of problems which to a large degree are problems that economists are still trying to solve to this day (in the same way that Plato determined a common set of problems that still occupy philosophers to this day). Second, some of Adam Smith's ideas have been extremely influential on all subsequent debate and are still used in policy debates to this day. People still use the notion of the invisible hand to argue for the benefits of free-trade for instance. It is important, therefore, to understand how the invisible hand is supposed to work and what the benefits of allowing it to work are supposed to be. And third, Adam Smith is one of the most accessible and readable economists who ever wrote. You do not have to be a trained economist (I am not) to benefit from reading this work.So I fully recommend this work to anyone interested in economics or social and political philosophy."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"\\"The Wealth of Nations\\" is a big book of economics, history, philosophy, and social criticism.

Unfortunately, the editorial apparatus is weak. The Comments are few in number and incredibly brief, and the short Preface fails to put the book into historical and intellectual context. Dickey does offer four appendices but these deal with specialized topics rather than the big picture.Bottom line: this edition is inexpensive but is probably not the best one for students."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"The Scottish Adam Smith is certainly the most important economists of all times and is the founder of modern economic thought, being &quot;The Wealth of the Nations&quot; his major work, where he introduces to the general public of his time - the book was first published in 1776 - new concepts and ideas as &quot;competitive advantage&quot;, &quot;divison of labour&quot;, &quot;the power of the invisible hand&quot;, and many others still powerfull today, even accounting for the changes happened in the world economy and politics. From this starting point, a crucial juncture in the world economy, that is, the beginning of the industrialisation in England, many renowed economists and social scientists construed their theories. To name a few? Karl Marx, David Ricardo, John Stuart Mill and many others acknowledge the importance of Adam Smith's work to their theories.

Enjoy it."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"This book is so widely cited and interpreted contrary to the author's original thought, that every economist should read it completely to avoid being misled by such incorrect interpretations.First, let us take the \\"invisible hand\\" metaphor. When I have studied economy in the University, I was taught that almost the entire book is devoted to the \\"invisible hand\\" which means \\"self-corrective markets\\", \\"liberalism\\", \\"Laissez-faire\\" and \\"state non-intervention\\". After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith did use the term \\"invisible hand\\" only once in the entire book, in the discussion of domestic versus foreign trade.To illustrate the point, let me quote the text where term \\"invisible hand\\" is used: \\"First, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry, provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not a great deal less than the ordinary profits of stock. Thus, upon equal, or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant naturally prefers the home trade to the foreign trade of consumption, and the foreign trade of consumption to the carrying trade. In the home trade, his capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of consumption. [...]Secondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of domestic industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that its produce may be of the greatest possible value. [...]As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.\\"After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith was influenced by French Physiocrats. The Physiocrats saw the true wealth of a nation as determined by the surplus of agricultural production over and above that needed to support agriculture (by feeding farm labourers and so forth). Other forms of economic activity, such as manufacturing, were viewed as taking this surplus agricultural production and transforming it into new products, by using the surplus agricultural production to feed the workers who produced the extra goods. While these manufacturers and other non agricultural workers may be useful, they were seen as 'sterile' in that their income derives ultimately not from their own work, but from the surplus production of the agricultural sector.I have found out that this book is not about \\"invisible hand\\" or \\"Laissez-faire\\". It is quite a complete study that covers almost every basic aspect of the economy, and remains an effective introduction to economics to this day.This book is so often mischaracterized and politicized that I suggest you to read it completely by yourself. This is a must read for every economist. You can get an audio version of this book to avoid lengthy read."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"Hello,I made the mistake of buying a differnt kindle version of this book.

Thank You.Joe"},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"The Wealth of Nations is one of the most important books ever written. In some respects the Wealth of Nations was a tract for the times. Smith penned a crippling critique of the mercantilist \`Policy of Europe'. Smith, along with David Hume and David Ricardo, refuted the mercantilist case for protectionism. Much of what we read in this book is still taught in modern economics classes. Modern day protectionists still have no answer to the principles of absolute and comparative advantage, and for the basic logic of Hume's specie flow mechanism.Smith was more than an ordinary economist. He was a visionary who saw some of the potential for progress through Globalization. Perhaps the most important concept of this book is the dynamics between division of labor, labor productivity, and the extent of markets. Smith conceived of Globalization as a process that would raise productivity as local markets expanded to national and then international scope. His example of division of labor in a pin factory is simple, but illustrative.The most widely known part of this book is that part of the \`invisible hand of markets'. Invisible hand reasoning still pervades modern economic theory, though there are some variations in how economists interpret this concept. Smith does differ from Modern economists on certain issues. Smith thought of competition as a process and of monopoly as a government grant of privilege. In these areas Smith was ahead of many modern economists. Smith also explained market prices in terms of labor content. Here is Smith's great error. Labor value theory set economics on the wrong course. Labor value theory served as the basis for Marxism. This, of course, indicates the great influence of The Wealth of Nations on world history. Without labor value theory the Marxist idea of exploitation falls apart. Smith therefore played a posthumous role in twentieth century history, especially from 1918 to 1991. Of course, we cannot blame Smith for the misuse of his ideas. Smith would have surely opposed Marxism, had he been alive to do so.What we have in this book is a tremendous effort at discovering the proper limits between private and public institutions. Better still, Smith thought about society and institutions in evolutionary terms. This is another reason why the Wealth of Nations is preferable to modern economics texts. Smith understood the dynamics of capitalism better than many modern economists- who focus on static math models. Smith also influenced Charles Darwin with his ideas of social evolution. There is much evidence indicating that Darwin got the idea for the evolution of species by reading The Wealth of Nations. Smith therefore had great influence on the biological sciences.Modern economists reject Smith labor value theory (ever since Menger refuted it in 1870). However, there is no denying the influence of The Wealth of Nations. All members of the educated public should read at least part of this book. The question then in which edition should you buy? The Liberty Classics edition is unabridged. The Modern Library Classics edition has margin notes that could be helpful. Given the affordability of these editions, you might consider have both on your bookshelf (I do). I would avoid the Great Mind Series altogether. The Wealth of Nations should be read because it is both a book of great historical importance and a good source for understanding modern Globalization. The labor value theory part precludes a five star rating, but anything less than four stars would be absurd."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"I have read WoN in three different editions and undoubtedly the best was the definitive version in the Glasgow edition of his Collected Works. This is cheaply and conveniently reporinted in the Liberty Fund edition which I recommend to anyone who is actually *studying* the text. It notes variations between different editions and has extremely useful notes which are helpful in understanding Smith's relations to his predecessors.It's an interesting book, over-quoted and under-read. Read it - all of it - and you will find a rather different argument and conclusions from that bestowed upon this classic by partisans of untrammeled free markets who trumpet some sound-bites from the book but reject Smith's underlying argument."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"Adam Smith's \\"An Inquiry Into The Nature And Causes Of The Wealth Of Nations\\" (often called simply \\"The Wealth Of Nations\\") is one of two great works from the Scottish economist and philosopher, the other being the lesser known \\"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\\". \\"The Wealth Of Nations\\" was published on March 9th, of 1776, but there were additional editions in 1778, 1784, 1786, and 1789. I read the free Kindle version of \\"The Wealth Of Nations\\", and while I do not recommend that version I do recommend the overall work.The issues with the Kindle version are that it is poorly formatted, and it is painful to attempt to read the numbers in the tables at the of Book I. You are much better off getting a hard copy so that you can more easily flip to the section of interest, and to read the information in a better format. As for the rest, the content is all there, once you get past the poor formatting.The work contains five books within. The first is \\"Of the Causes of Improvement in the productive Powers of Labour\\". In this book he discusses the benefits of the division of labor, the origin and benefits of using money, a section on the \\"real\\" price of commodities (i.e. how much toil it takes to produce them), a discussion of the natural and market prices of commodities (the forces of supply and demand), the effect of controlling a commodity can have on the price, the wages of labor (again a case of supply and demand with the commodity of labor), the profits of stock, a discussion of the ill effects of groups who use their influence to manipulate the government (this would include banking conglomerations, trade unions, etc.), and closes with a section on rent.The second book is \\"Of the Nature, Accumulation, and Employment of Stock\\" which deals with accumulating wealth which lasts a longer period of time. This book starts with how one divides their stock into what they need for personal use, and what they can dispose of in exchange for others available stock. He then moves into a discussion of money as a type of stock, and then how to use their excess money/stock to gain interest.The third book is \\"Of the different Progress of Opulence in different Nations\\", where he talks about the balance between the inhabitants of towns and those of the country areas and goes into how agriculture is discouraged over time, while cities and towns prosper.The fourth book is \\"Of Systems of political Economy\\" in which Smith discusses the commercial system, along with importation which contains a detailed look at the effects of restraints on importation/exportation. Smith also discusses commerce treaties, and the role of colonies. This book also has a brief section on the agricultural system, but here he is referring to a specific system where the produce of land is the sole source of the revenue of a nationThe fifth book is \\"Of the Revenue of the Sovereign or Commonwealth\\" in which Smith deals with taxation. This is an important area to read and understand, as it is the one which many ignore when using Smith to try to support other areas. There are hints here of the progressive tax, as well as a discussion of the expenses of the nation, an important acknowledgement that the poor spend the greater part of their income on the fundamentals, such as food, and so he suggests luxury taxes as not unreasonable. Smith then closes the final book with a discussion of the costs of war, both for the actual fighting, and in terms of the loss of trade."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"I appreciate that for most readers, Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations is going to be a deadly dull read, although I think this is a pity. With a little discipline, I think that the erudite reader will take away many enriching (yes, pun intended) lessons from Smith's ground breaking treatise. For me, as a business professional and business student (I have an MBA), the Wealth of Nations was a Damascus Road experience.I think there are several myths about economics that are exploded by a first hand reading of Wealth of Nations. Many supply side economists eagerly tout Smith's \\"invisible hand\\" metaphor in advocating deregulated markets, but in my view, Smith took a balanced and integrated approach in analyzing the supply and demand sides of national economy. In the first chapter Smith notes that national wealth is the production of labor. This has dual implications in that production is the creation of supply, but the labor force consumes that supply by trading the resulting wealth. These are two sides to the same coin, &amp; therefore indivisible. Also in the first chapter, Smith notes that increasingly sophisticated economies will employ a division of labor to increase production efficiency, which is another concept that necessarily integrates supply and demand, production and consumption.Smith devotes quite a bit of time lamenting governmental intrusion into economics by way of regulation. However, he does not condemn government regulation per se, but make very specific criticisms against those state regulatory polices that tend to create monopolies. None of his comments are strictly political in nature. Smith's analysis is purely based on economics &amp; the efficient allocation of capital. He views the enemy not as the King's ministers, but rather the monopolies that were so prevalent during the 18th century mercantile system.On a related note, I think it is clear that Smith would be horrified by the military centric nature of many post-industrial economies today. He notes that a standing army is a drain on national wealth. Essentially the state is paying workers not to work, but rather to stand ready to fight. I suspect that Smith would view large state defense budgets as being most closely akin to a transfer payment made by a welfare state. For those who will scream invective at me for saying this, please remember that the largest item on any defense budget by far, is payroll.Finally, as an amateur historian, I enjoyed the brief glimpse into what life was like in the 18th century Empire from an economist's perspective. Various parts of his book review social welfare systems of his day, as well as international banking, political economy, agrarian systems, and life in general."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"Its a bit difficult to make a comment on the writtings for validity of Adam Smith.

This is a review of the Modern Library hardcover edition, which I ordered here at Amazon.com.Let it be said right off the bat that the big thing Marx gets trashed for has roots right here in the 'W of N:' namely, the Labor Theory of Value. Both Volume One of 'Capital' and 'W of N' spend the first 100 pages or so going over it. Both refer back to it constantly in later pasages. And both must be taken off the table without it. The LTV boils down to this: all value is created by people working and producing goods and services that other people need and/or want. Furthermore, they must produce these goods and services at at least the average level of productivity and at the appropriate level of demand. Otherwise you're working either harder or more easily for your cut of the national pie than you otherwise would. The LTV is so straightforward and intuitive you'd think there wouldn't be much of an argument.The one thing Smith stresses throughout the book is the need for what he calls 'perfect liberty,' where everyone is allowed to buy and sell what they want from where ever they'd like. With this, resources would be diverted to where they needed to be as quickly as possible so people would stop wasting their time WORKING (see how the LTV operates here?) on things that should be made elsewhere.It's important to understand that neither the words 'capital' nor 'capitalist' ever occur in this work. This is very important because both words carry baggage Smith would break no bread with. In fact, the main bad guys in this work are the very people we would call 'capitalist' today. They subvert Parliament through bribery and intimidation, protect their own interests at the expense of everybody else in society, and raise unholy hell when workers try to form unions. All the while, of course, they form unions amongst themselves with the express purpose of stabbing the rest of us in the back.Sound familiar?Let me give you a modern example of how desperately we need American economists to actually pick up and read this book, as opposed to just talking about what a good boy Adam Smith was. Contrary to the propaganda we're getting out of our media, alternative sources of energy are now ready for prime time. There's nothing the internal combustion engine can do that hydrogen fuel cells can't do better. The price of solar cells has been dropping like a rock for years. And wind power is now the second cheapest source of energy after dirty coal. All we need to do is divert all that money we use to protect our oil resources into building up the economy of scale for these products (i.e. reducing the amount of WORK necessary to build each unit; this is the LTV lurking around again), and turn all these into cheap bulk commodities. We'll also need to use this money to build up the infrastructure necessary to safely deliver and store hydrogen. Then, after these (admittedly) high entry costs (i.e. expenditures of LABOR), we'll have access to unlimited, clean, and cheap sources of energy. The nonsense we have instead, which came to serious crises in 2001 in California with the impeachable collusion of the Bush administration, has nothing to do with Adam Smith's great work. I don't know about you, but I'm pretty tired of socializing the risk while privatizing the profits for this industry. Our current urge to go to war with Iraq precisely reflects the urge of 18th century statesmen to protect the interest of the mercantilist (capitalist!!) masters. This was a tragedy Smith covers quite extensively.As an added bonus he's a great read. After working so hard on Marx I was very happily surprised.Karl Marx brought the LTV to a fine polish, going beyond Adam Smith and showing how it translates into the average rate of profit, interest rates, standard of living, etc. He picked up where Smith left off. Also, using the weapon of dialectical materialism (i.e. the logic of motion and change -- the true heart of Marxism), Marx was able to show how capitalism, in fact, negates private property. It would have turned us all into slaves decades ago if not for the better angels or our nature."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"Look at the bottom of the Wikipedia page, there are links to the unabridged ebook for free in both kindle and the standard format (as the copyright is long expired)."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"This turned out to be exactly what I wanted, another thick book I'll never read all the way through, but a good book to have on hand for research.

Except that everybody, gives up searching for the answers to these questions and accepts the meaningless explanation: what we see happenning in human society, happens in this way because this is how it should happen. Or because of .. the raise of the prices on the market, for example. (Obviously prices are something like a natural natural phenomena - raise of the tempratures in the northern hemisphere , humidity in the air,...) After several \\"explanations\\" of this kind , one gives up - it is immpossible to find out what is going on in society because this is the purpose. The less people know, the better for ... for everyone who can take advantage out of this.For 90% (well this is my evaluation) of the people what is going on with money and prices is a mystery. At the same time they are forced to participate in this \\"game\\" and participate in some stupid manner. Then a game that is played in a stupid manner and played by players, unwilling to play it (at least for 90% of them this is just a burden) will come to a crush eventually. It seems it is inevitable that there will always be crises every 30-40 years.I do not know whether Adam Smith is correct in his explanations but I think he is absolutely correct that one must search the reason for the processes that take place in society."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"Adam Smith lived in Europe in the days of sailing ships before trains and airplanes.

It does not, and cannot care for the result or timing of its actions. Eventually a market will seek equilibrium, but that can be a few months, a few years, or generations.

It is not from benevolence of the butcher, the brewer or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves not to their humanity but to their self-love and never talk to them of our own necessities, but to their advantages. The real price of everything, what everything really costs to the man who wants to acquire it, is the trouble and toil of acquiring it. Smith contends that there are only 2 ways countries can become wealthy: (1). Their citizens being good savers and then invest these savings toward productive ends; and (2). By way of trade. National wealth grows when things and money are circulated and exchanged to the most remote corners of the globe. Finally, Adam Smith believes that nations will become rich only if natural liberty is promulgated for, society has a natural tendency to allocate resources in the best way. This is now widely known as the \\"invisible hand\\" theory."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"This book is huge!!!

When I have studied economy in the University, I was taught that almost the entire book is devoted to the \\"invisible hand\\" which means \\"self-corrective markets\\", \\"liberalism\\", \\"Laissez-faire\\" and \\"state non-intervention\\". After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith did use the term \\"invisible hand\\" only once in the entire book, in the discussion of domestic versus foreign trade.To illustrate the point, let me quote the text where term \\"invisible hand\\" is used: \\"First, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry, provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not a great deal less than the ordinary profits of stock. Thus, upon equal, or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant naturally prefers the home trade to the foreign trade of consumption, and the foreign trade of consumption to the carrying trade. In the home trade, his capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of consumption. [...]Secondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of domestic industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that its produce may be of the greatest possible value. [...]As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.\\"After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith was influenced by French Physiocrats. The Physiocrats saw the true wealth of a nation as determined by the surplus of agricultural production over and above that needed to support agriculture (by feeding farm labourers and so forth). Other forms of economic activity, such as manufacturing, were viewed as taking this surplus agricultural production and transforming it into new products, by using the surplus agricultural production to feed the workers who produced the extra goods. While these manufacturers and other non agricultural workers may be useful, they were seen as 'sterile' in that their income derives ultimately not from their own work, but from the surplus production of the agricultural sector.I have found out that this book is not about \\"invisible hand\\" or \\"Laissez-faire\\". It is quite a complete study that covers almost every basic aspect of the economy, and remains an effective introduction to economics to this day. Just don't start reading economic books from this book. It would be hard to understand. It assumes that you already have economics background, i.e. have studied economics for a few years.This book is so often mischaracterized and politicized that I suggest you to read it completely by yourself.

By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention.

The Physiocrats saw the true wealth of a nation as determined by the surplus of agricultural production over and above that needed to support agriculture (by feeding farm labourers and so forth).

While these manufacturers and other non agricultural workers may be useful, they were seen as 'sterile' in that their income derives ultimately not from their own work, but from the surplus production of the agricultural sector.I have found out that this book is not about \\"invisible hand\\" or \\"Laissez-faire\\".

Vital reading for those who promote or oppose the free-market. Read about capitalism from a temperate, intellectual proponent, rather than a right-wing extremist or left-wing radical.

Voter thinking 11/03/09 focused on jobs and the economy, and sent a clear message of dissatisfaction with economic progress to-date. Smith's recommendations have had a large role in creating that dissatisfaction. Private sector employment has dropped since 2000, home ownership and median family income are down since 1998 and the proportion living in poverty has risen. The topic's importance was re-emphasized 11/06/2009 with the release of data showing the unemployment rate continuing to climb - now 10.2% (not counting those who have given up looking, or are working only part-time). Adam Smith and Free Enterprise are not working; meanwhile, China's GDP is growing 8.5%.Reinvigorating Main Street America's employment picture, however, will not be easy. Problems have been building for years, long before the sub-prime crisis. Some believe automation is the major source of recent job losses. However, it is difficult to look at the constant parade of long trains carrying shipping containers inland, or the millions of illegals turning up all across America, and conclude that this is the case. Substantial improvement on Main Street will primarily require drastically limiting Smith's 'Free Trade.' Free Trade supporters repeatedly cite the imposition of Smoot-Hawley tariffs as substantially deepening and prolonging the Great Depression, and conclude that we must not turn protectionist. Reality, however, is that prior to Smoot-Hawley, the 1929 Trade Surplus was an insignificant 0.38% of our GDP, and could not possibly have had significant impact even if lost entirely. True, international trade plays a much bigger role than in 1930 - however, the fact that we've run large and increasing trade deficits for decades is prima-facie evidence that eg. no trade whatsoever would at least stop the bleeding.As for Adam Smith's famous Free Trade support, that occurred 200+ years ago - before across-the-board very large and low-cost competitors like China, India, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam, the Internet, jet planes, and massive cargo ships made a much large proportion of economies vulnerable to offshoring than ever before. We need to also remember that protectionism is what allowed the U.S. and its new Asian competitors to achieve their original economic strength. (Smith himself warned against taking Free Trade too far - such that a nation's security was endangered.)Free Trade defenders might assert that manufacturing and IT have borne the brunt of offshoring to date, and their future offshoring is not likely to increase. Recent trends and data, however, suggest service jobs will increasingly also become affected. American firms are already establishing R&D; facilities in China; Asian competitors not only have a cost advantage competing for engineering work, they also have the advantage of greater experience in production gained through producing our manufactures. Unfortunately, this also provides them with a natural lead-in to new areas - eg. offshored CRT-tube manufacturing experience helped Asians in new areas of plasma, LCD, photovoltaic, solar, and LED screen development and manufacturing, and this trend probably will extend into nanotubes as well. Data reported in Business Week's 11/09/2009 issue confirms the shift - over the past year, U.S. employment of scientists and engineers has fallen by 6.3%, while overall employment has fallen only 4.1%.Proposed U.S. economic remedies frequently suggest increasing the proportion of Americans receiving college degrees as a defense against offshoring. Alan Blinder, former Federal Reserve Vice-Chairman and current economics professor at Princeton, warns that the key distinction in whether a job is likely to be offshored or not will be in whether a particular service is delivered in person (haircuts, brain surgery) or not (computer programing) - not whether it is education intensive. (Elective brain surgery can also be offshored.) Thus, a college degree may no longer be a panacea. Blinder also believes it is quite likely that offshoring (unless changed) will depress the real wages of many U.S. workers who do not lose their jobs, the offshoring transition will continue for 2 - 3 decades and bring gross potential job losses in the range of 30- 40 million, and that American standards of living will decline. Proposals by still others to deal with offshoring job losses via more jobs in high-tech areas (eg. biotechnology) become ludicrous when viewed in the light of these numbers. Professor Blinder's suggestion makes much more sense - increased vocational education.Additionally, some Free Trade defenders contend that Chinese labor costs will soon become non-competitive. There are two problems with relying on this 'defense:' 1)Chinese productivity has also increased considerably. Economist Steven Roach (author of \\"The Next Asia\\") lives and works in China and reports that productivity in China's industrial sector surged nearly 20%/year from 2000-2004. Further, even after six years of double-digit increases, average hourly compensation for Chinese manufacturing workers was only 3% that of the U.S. average in 2004. (It's difficult to get reliable up-to-date information on China.) 2)By 2020 it is estimated that there will be 553 million non-agricultural workers in China - 100 million more than in all the developed world, according to Martin Jacques in \\"When China Rules the World.\\"Others contend that China cannot continue its rapid economic growth without Democracy, something it shows few signs of doing. Jacques, on the other hand, provides data showing that most Chinese believe the political climate has improved since 1989 (Tienanmen Square), and 72% of its population are satisfied with the condition of the country vs. only 39% in the U.S. (As for the widely reported large number of civil disturbances within China reported each year, Jacques contends most have nothing to do with the central government - eg. local land issues.)Finally, there is the large and growing problem of illegal immigrants taking jobs from American citizens. The U.S. already has enough problems finding work for its own citizens, and the problems are going to become much more severe via currently unfettered offshoring. It is numerically impossible for the U.S. to also provide jobs for the current number of illegal immigrants from Mexico, Central, and South America - we must sharply reduce the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in the U.S.Bottom Line: Main Street America cannot withstand continually losing jobs to Free Trade, illegal workers, and automation. Wall Street, on the other hand, has benefited immensely from these job losses and shows no signs of changing direction. The recent financial crisis clearly demonstrated that financial markets are not self-correcting, and that Adam Smith's 'invisible hand' is not infallible. Immediate government redirection is required."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"I bought this book because it seems like a must read for anyone interested in business and economics.

After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith did use the term \\"invisible hand\\" only once in the entire book, in the discussion of domestic versus foreign trade.To illustrate the point, let me quote the text where term \\"invisible hand\\" is used: \\"First, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry, provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not a great deal less than the ordinary profits of stock. Thus, upon equal, or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant naturally prefers the home trade to the foreign trade of consumption, and the foreign trade of consumption to the carrying trade. In the home trade, his capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of consumption.

Truly, &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot; is to economics what Newton's Principia is to physics. It is not perfect, but considering the time in which it was written it was an amazing accomplishment.The reader will find discussions on a great many topics, but what is especially fascinating is the insight into 1700's Britain that is provided. Remember, this book was published in 1776. Smith even discusses the &quot;recent troubles with the colonies&quot;--America.It is emminently readable, though it becomes less so in certain sections--the digression on silver, for example. However, if one takes it slowly, then one can easily digest this feast of intellectual achievement in a relatively short time. Afterwards, the works of Ricardo, Marx, Keynes--to name a few--should be tackled.Again, highly recommended."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"If you have any interest at all in Economics, you'll want to go to the source. This is the source. Adam Smith lays the groundwork for the study of Economics in this very readable treatise.Though he is discussing 18th century Britain, the topics he discusses have direct analogs in the modern American economy. Taxes, trade, money, monopoly, tarrifs, and international trade balance are all tackled with aplomb.He really lays into Mercantilism and blasts the protectionism it engenders. Never anything less than a champion of the common man, Smith decrys monopolies and other taxes on those most unable to afford them. Though he seems to be a total free marketeer, he takes great pains to examine the types of taxes which would be useful and prudent for a government to levy.Once or twice may be fine, but Smith uses this construction for almost every sentence in the book. It is just a stylistic gripe, but the length and complexity of each sentence make digesting the information quite a bit more difficult than it otherwise could have been. I would not be at all disappointed to see this book translated to a more modern style.Again, if you're interested in Economics at all, this book is the place to start. There is so much good information here to be absorbed and pondered. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"Nobody seriously involved in economics can do without this exhaustive work, originally published in five volumes as An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations. This classic is a pragmatic and accessible milestone in the history of economics. Its author, Adam Smith, is woven into every economics textbook. However, Smith's theories, which today often are recounted mostly in fragments, frequently incorrectly, reveal their entire social and economic innovative power only in context. Smith burst onto the scene at a time when absolutist national states monopolized the world's precious metal reserves and tried to increase their own wealth through stringent export policies. These states were motivated by an entirely new concept about national wealth: that it stemmed from the work of the country's people, not from gold. Based on that idea, economic markets should balance themselves as if guided by an \\"invisible hand,\\" impelled by each individual's self-interest. The state has to provide only an orderly framework and specific public goods and services. Even though Smith's image of idealized economic and social harmony may have developed a few cracks over the course of time, his ideas have inspired many well-known economists during the past 250 years, including David Ricardo, Vilfredo Pareto, Friedrich August von Hayek and Milton Friedman. We highly recommend this seminal work."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"Note that the complete edition of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations is usually published in two volumes. The only exception I'm aware of is the University of Chicago Press' edition, which specifically states that it is \\"two volumes in one;\\" note that this means double-numbering, as the page numbers restart for the second \\"volume\\". The reason that it usually comes in two volumes is that it is a very, very long work, totaling over 1000 pages, and abridgement is apparently so common that it isn't stated directly by publishers. So, if the edition you're considering buying has less than 1000 pages, it is either only one of the two volumes, or it is abridged. It doesn't help that Amazon often provides the \\"inside pages\\" of a different edition from the one you're viewing, so if you want to check the table of contents to see just what's in a particular edition, you may be misled. If what you want is the complete work look for something that indicates that it is \\"unabridged\\"."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"After hearing about socialism from too many people who do not know and admit to not knowing what the word means, it makes sense to return to the sources and read. Start with Adam Smith. To be clear, Adam Smith is writing about capitalism, but how many of us know what that word means? Adam Smith is a good place to start learning before you start opining.This is not a simple read. The style is not as dense as was typical in 1776 but it can be just as elliptical.Interesting, although tangential is that the book mentions the American Revolution but only as an incidental backdrop to the more import issue of how and why money is created and moves. How well Mr Smith understood the then nascent industrial revolution is a hypotheses for a more learned reviewer than myself.Over all there is a great deal of repetition, and repetition with slight variation , punctuated by a scattering of tables, none of which printed as readable in my e version. This being said, Mr. Smith writes with a power granted to those who first encode a new world view. His is the more powerful because most of this work consists of a logical argument laid out in simple words.While many of us were exposed to the basics, capital, land labor, lowest cost, investment seeking the highest return, taxes bad (although not always) and so forth, I was struck by some of the lessor taught observations.Written in a time when there was no functioning concept of labor union, Mr. Smith warns that labor will loose against owners. The law (then) tended prevent labor from organizing and owners frequently socialized together, had common interests and therefor could be expected to overpower the labor virtually at will.Perhaps the single most telling comment, and the one most significant to today is his comment that when business interests attempt to make or influence public policy it is best to assume that they are lying or seeking action at the expense of public interest. Mr. Smith gives no third possibility.This is a great classic in western thought. I am tempted to say it should be mandatory. E editions certainly make it affordable. But For all you Wall Street occupiers and big wigs, Greek protesters, and Tea Party literalists, Obama haters, and anyone with a loud opinion on economics, this is a good place to start educating yourself. It might be nice to hear the shouting from some one who has done some homework."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"For anyone coming to Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations the first surprise is how readable it is. Famous classic of economic theory though it may be, this is no dry academic tome to be read only by people with a scholarly interest in economic history. There are no detailed tables of statistics of the sort one might expect to find in a modern book on the subject, and no mathematical analysis, indeed not very much quantitative information at all. Instead there is a long series of examples to explain such ideas as why it is more efficient to divide work among several specialists rather than have a complete task fulfilled by one person, or why slave labour is ultimately more expensive than paying free workers, even workers in cities like Boston or New York, where wages were far higher in Smith's time than those in his native Scotland.To illustrate the principle of the division of labour Smith discusses the manufacture of nails. Even a blacksmith -- skilled in working with a hammer but with no special training in nail making -- could not make more than a few hundred nails in a day, and those of poor quality. A specialist nail maker could make more than two thousand, but much greater improvements, both in quality and quantity, come from recognizing that even a task as apparently simple as manufacturing a nail can be broken up into smaller tasks: maintaining the fire at the right temperature, hammering the nail into the right shape, using a different tool to form the head, and so on.A popular edition of Wealth of Nations is inevitably abridged, as one can hardly expect to buy a complete scholarly edition for a price not much more than that of a novel. Complete editions are available as well, but they are much more expensive. With sensible editing, however, an abridged version can include as much of Smith's writing as the ordinary reader is likely to want, together with notes to explain points that will be obscure to the modern reader. In the Oxford World's Classics edition Kathryn Sutherland has made an excellent job of this, with notes that fill around a fifth of the length of the book."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"This is one of the truly great books produced by the Western world. Although much has been written on economics since, it considerably broadened my perspective to read it in the original.I can't help feeling that those who pan Wealth of Nations as an apology for exploitation simply haven't read it. That&#65533;s simply not what the book is about. For if you really do care about the underpriveleged masses -- and it's imminently clear that he really does -- then you better consciously organize your state in such a manner that money will flow naturally where it's most needed.I'd been told before I read it by several people that AS was, for example, apologizing for the East India Trading Company? Does his apology for EIT include the lengthy chapter which discuss in full detail how and why the East India Trading Company was responsible for an wide array of abuses in the Far East, and why no similar company would be legal if a society were fully moral and knew its own best interest?Nor is it a blind apology for laissez faire economics, though it does recommend non-intervention by the government insofar as that is possible. Still he fully recognizes the need for social services, rightly understood and rightly executed.In fact, I can't see how anyone who reads it could view it as an apology at all -- it's simply a statement of fact. Adam Smith is not the one carrying an ideology around on his shoulder. You may not like it that the world works this way -- that's another matter. But that IS the way it works... you are made to see that for yourself. It is not imposed on you as dogma.And after reading AS, I'm left feeling very happy that that's the way the world works.I think the most fundamental idea I am left with after reading all those pages, is that wealth is a verb, not a noun. Land and labor (i.e. food and farming) are the bottom line of economics. Treat your farmers well. Unjust practices in trading will ultimately backfire.The dynamo which runs the machine that creates wealth lies within each individual - it is the individual&#65533;s will to better his or her condition.

It is worth reading, but for those with less time, I recommend \\"The Essential Adam Smith\\"The Essential Adam SmithContent Summary: The \\"Wealth of Nations\\" contains Adam Smith's classic defense of free trade, and his simultaneous attack on the mercantilist system of his day. Mercantilism was a policy favoring exports and discouraging imports, while trying to maximize the silver and gold coins brought into the nation. Smith points out that this policy was self-defeating, that trade barriers invite retaliatory trade barriers. Mercantilism actually discouraged greater economic growth. Smith further argues that free trade, with a focus upon producing commodities and commanding more productive labor, is actually the more prosperous alternative. Besides many other things he says, he was in favor of an inheritance tax for the wealthy, opposed to taxes on wages, for generally minimizing all taxes as much as feasible, and repeats the idea that the wealthy have some greater responsibility to give back to their country in proportion to their wealth. In fact, it is in their self-interest to do so, to assure a prosperous and secure nation that protects their own wealth. The \\"invisible hand\\", which people are so fond of quoting - appears only once in this book (and thrice in all Smith's writings). It does suggest that it is through pursuing their own free, self-interest, that men render a greater prosperity to society.Analytical Review: Smith's argument, that free trade renders a more prosperous economy, is probably a good one. Capitalism has been a vehicle for generating greater wealth, but not always generating greater equality. It must be pointed out of course, that there rarely if ever has been a completely free market. I believe Marx's Communist radical alternative has not and will not supplant capitalism. What Marx understood, however, was a greater sense of social justice. Marx's writing is loaded with justified sentiment for the oppression of the working poor, and his labor theory of value in \\"Capital\\" goes a long way to augment and correct (but not entirely substitute) Smith's omissions. Smith had absorbed the very hierarchical, class-based values of his time. In several passages on slavery, for example, Smith's strongest condemnation is to call it an \\"unfortunate\\" institution. What Smith understood better was that humans are self-interested and will prosper more generally through a free market. But Smith also opposed the power of monopolies, and believed some provision should be made for the poor, and that plays into Marx's thought. Marx had greater insight into the abusive dominance of monopoly capitalism, and its often cold-shouldered indifference to the inequities it produced. In a nutshell, Smith gave us the wisdom that the free market is better, but Marx has given us the corrective that a fair and just use of capital is a better (and yes - you might add even democratic of Christian) ideal. A free-market economy, with some corrective for social justice and common welfare, is my view of a compromise between them. My advice - we have much to learn from both Smith and Marx, if only critics would often read them before speaking too brashly."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"Out of necessity, whenever an original work is \\"abridged,\\" the abridger must make a value judgment regarding what in the original work is worthwhile (and will be preserved), and what is not of relevance, and will thus be discarded and placed beyond your view. So \\"abridging\\" really means \\"editing,\\" which means running the original work through the \\"value filters\\" of the editor/abridger. Unfortunately, much of the inspired and inspiring wisdom that Adam Smith toiled long to place in \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" has been edited out in this abridgment, to the point, at least in my opinion, where much of the real meat has been removed and much of what remains is merely milk, that is more appropriate for the simpler mind of a suckling child.Opting for an audio book, rather than taking the time to read the real thing, in and of itself is a significant compromise that forgoes the greater value of being able to pause and contemplate what you have read, and to then do whatever rereading is necessary in order to really evaluate and grasp what is being said.I realize that our lives are often so busy that we feel a legitimate need to make these kinds of compromises whenever we can. Although you can probably get away with a compromise like that with your recreational fiction, believe me, this is NOT the appropriate time or place to do that! If you are going to opt for the audio version out of necessity and convenience, then don't also opt for the cliff notes version that has already had much of the meat taken out of it by an editor/abridger that thinks he knows better what you need to learn from Adam Smith. If something is calling you to partake of the vast wisdom that is within \\"The Wealth of Nations,\\" then do it with a commitment to really benefit from the journey. Take a pass on an abridgment!

When I have studied economy in the University, I was taught that almost the entire book is devoted to the \\"invisible hand\\" which means \\"self-corrective markets\\", \\"liberalism\\", \\"Laissez-faire\\" and \\"state non-intervention\\". After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith did use the term \\"invisible hand\\" only once in the entire book, in the discussion of domestic versus foreign trade.To illustrate the point, let me quote the text where term \\"invisible hand\\" is used: \\"First, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry, provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not a great deal less than the ordinary profits of stock. Thus, upon equal, or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant naturally prefers the home trade to the foreign trade of consumption, and the foreign trade of consumption to the carrying trade. In the home trade, his capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of consumption. [...]Secondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of domestic industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that its produce may be of the greatest possible value. [...]As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.\\"After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith was influenced by French Physiocrats. The Physiocrats saw the true wealth of a nation as determined by the surplus of agricultural production over and above that needed to support agriculture (by feeding farm labourers and so forth). Other forms of economic activity, such as manufacturing, were viewed as taking this surplus agricultural production and transforming it into new products, by using the surplus agricultural production to feed the workers who produced the extra goods. While these manufacturers and other non agricultural workers may be useful, they were seen as 'sterile' in that their income derives ultimately not from their own work, but from the surplus production of the agricultural sector.I have found out that this book is not about \\"invisible hand\\" or \\"Laissez-faire\\". It is quite a complete study that covers almost every basic aspect of the economy, and remains an effective introduction to economics to this day. Just don't start reading economic books from this book. It would be hard to understand. It assumes that you already have economics background, i.e. have studied economics for a few years.This book is so often mischaracterized and politicized that I suggest you to read it completely by yourself.

First, it is truly \\"complete and unabridged.\\" So, you get the real deal, all thousand pages of it. Second, it includes Edwin Cannan's summaries in the margin that assist in reading this thick tome. Cannan also provides an enlarged index that serves as a quick reference. And third, the Introduction by Robert Reich and the Commentary at the end by R.H. Campbell and A.S. Skinner are very helpful in better understanding this work. You may get more out of those two sections than Smith's thousand pages of writing.This book was written before the field of economics theory existed. As a result, Smith's writings do not include such common words as: economics, recession, expansion, contraction, inflation, GDP, common stocks, and securities. Thus, his writings has no resemblance to modern economics commentary. Given that, it is challenging interpreting what he is saying in modern context.Smith could not be an economist since the latter profession did not exist he had to be something else: a moral philosopher. In the 18th century if you studied hard sciences you were a natural philosopher. And, if you studied anything else you were a moral philosopher. Such a broad base binomial taxonomy of all intellectual scientific fields had great advantages. This is because moral philosophy included all the fields that today are pretty separate such as: logic, rhetoric, psychology, sociology. On a more granular level moral philosophy as advanced by Smith included microeconomics, macroeconomics, international economics, behavioral finance, international economics, etc... Nowadays, all those fields are fairly demarcated.In view of the above, Smith's intellectual legacy is in part timeless. This is because he was concerned about the speculations that went inside individuals' minds just as he was concerned about the productivity of labor, small businesses, and the economy at large. His cogitations covered the entire fields of behavioral finance, macro and macroeconomics.Smith's thinking was far more complex and nuanced than the ones of his libertarian followers such as Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, and Alan Greenspan. They all missed more than half of Smith's message. That included Smith support for labor unions (at a time when labor abuse was rampant), government regulations including very tight regulation of banking. Smith also was opposed to the might of large corporation as he was suspicious of their collaborating to depress wages and their colluding on prices before laws banned such practices. Thus, Smith was far more the precursor of Keynes than Milton Friedman. Yet, this is not what the economic profession conveys to the outside world.Smith's posterity and prescience are second to none. Unfortunately, his writing in a contemporary setting is unreadable. For my part, I got a lot more about Smith's thoughts from reading digested modern interpretations from others than from reading Smith's own writing. In this regard, I recommend three books. James BuchanThe Authentic Adam Smith: His Life and Ideas (Enterprise)is excellent and solely focused on Adam Smith and his writings. Arthur HermanHow the Scots Invented the Modern World: The True Story of How Western Europe's Poorest Nation Created Our World & Everything in Itcovers the entire Scottish Enlightenment. And, John CassidyHow Markets Fail: The Logic of Economic Calamitiescriticizes the entire field of economics. Yet, he describes Adam Smith as a far more balanced and complex thinker than his modern followers."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"In his day monarchies, emerging democracies, business people and government employees were profoundly inept in the affairs of economics, trade and taxation. We have come a long way. Now governments are simply inept including the USA government. When you compare the errors in governmental affairs that he reviewed more than two hundred years ago to the mistakes and wrong governmental policies of today there is considerable reason for optimism.What a damning review of governmental affairs he wrote. This is the predominant reason for reading this book. Secondarily, to trace the development of economic thought. Adam Smith was one of the greatest pioneers in the science of economics. There are areas where we now know he was in error. Science content of modern economics is more profound than most observers are willing to admit. If you just want to learn about economics you would be well served to first read more current economists. In modern times, Milton Friedman has played a similar role. Again there is that radical urgency to place Friedman in the conservative pile before they decide the correctness of his thought. The legacy of critically reviewing the errors of democratic governments as well as repressive governments will hopefully be kept alive and well. Much is left to be done-- even in the USA. A very exciting question remains what happens when the repressive leaders of China realize that good economic policy and political freedom are so deeply intertwined that there repression is truly doomed. Will the end be destructive or positive. It is surely coming.Similarly in the USA and other developed nations, as more people learn economics on the path to greater involvement in business, investing and entrepreneurship one would expect increasing rebellion against the reckless of policies by politicians and the uninformed contentions of the media. There are many helpful books some I have recently reviewed that can broaden ones understanding of governmental failings in economic policy.While everybody would benefit from more knowledge about economics, the basic shortcomings of the media and politicians is of critical concern. It is no surprise that reviewers of economics related books have to rush to place any book either in the conservative pile or the liberal pile. Why or how one decides to place Adam Smith in the conservative pile, is surely the sickness of political views over logic.

An unlikely friendship occurs and the two help each other deal with their issues of abandonment when Free's mother leaves without her and when Siarra's dad becomes a \\"deadbeat.\\" The story shows how Free grows, physically, emotionally and spiritually to deal with her issues.Emerging...Free is a coming of age story. It shows how events, be they tragic or joyous, and how one deals with those events can have far reaching repercussions. Although I would definitely consider the target audience of this book to be teenagers/young adults, the story contains lessons that should be learned by all.The story is more character driven than plot driven. The author tells the story through the actions, words, and thoughts of the characters. This gave the book more depth. Bell also hinted at spirituality by sprinkling prayers and religious aspects into the story; however, I would not categorize this book as Christian fiction. I found that often times the thoughts and some of the prayers were written in a different font which in this reader's opinion was a distraction, because it was only done sporadically.I enjoyed Emerging...Free and would definitely recommend this novel to young adults who may have abandonment issues, are experiencing \\"growing pains,\\" or who are in the mood for a realistic and poignant work from a promising debut author.Reviewed by Latoya Carter-QawiyyAPOOO BookClub"},{"Title":"Emerging Free","review":"Adults, particularly parents, are at times so engrossed in finances, failed relationships, job stress, and so many other issues that they often forget that children have problems too.

I read this book when I was 14 years old. Most geometry books for people with very little prerequisite knowledge are boring. This one was fascinating to me when I read it, and still is now. The author's purpose is to show students with very little background how seductive the subject can be. He succeeds brilliantly.The chapters on harmonic division and inversive geometry are a sort of preview of conformal mapping and (although Ogilvy doesn't say so, as far as I recall) of the geometry of the complex projective line. The chapter on the golden section is comprehensible to people who know no more math than what is known to almost everyone who can solve a quadratic equation. It shows clearly in only 13 pages how geometry, number theory, algebra, and analysis can be intimately connected with each other, along the way discussing pentagrams, spirals, knots, self-similarity, the five Platonic polyhedra, and the Fibonacci numbers (and quadratic equation, of course). The chapter on projective geometry is just as elementary even while it discusses topics that engage the attention of expert geometers (albeit at a more abstract level).This is superb expository writing. Every 14-year-old who, as I did, has thoughts of becoming a mathematician, should read this book.Is the previous reviewer right to say that &quot;This book would only be reccomended to the top 2% of math students&quot;? Perhaps. I would put it this way: No one who cannot understand, do, and enjoy mathematical reasoning will appreciate this book. So certainly this limits the market; as the previous reviewer said, it's not for the general public.I am baffled by the previous reviewer's statement that this book tends to veer off course, or that the diagrams are not explained. Both statements are false and unjust."},{"Title":"Excursions in geometry","review":"In this slim little volume, Ogilvy sets the standard for the genre. His subject matter is gloriously organized and impeccably motivated; he proves every result thoroughly but without getting bogged down in the sort of tedious formalism that all too often cripples mathematics texts; and the results themselves are the very picture of geometric elegance. (In particular, the chapter on Soddy's Hexlet is a gem.)Ogilvy leads his readers on an excursion through geometric inversion, projective geometry, and the conic sections. Some of the subjects (most notably, conics, and that unexpected and magical projective invariant, the cross-ratio) appear again and again throughout the various chapters, and even the seasoned mathematician is almost guaranteed to find a new presentation of a familiar topic. Hence, I presume, one reviewer's assertion that the author has a tendency to veer off topic, which would be true if geometry were a disjoint collection of unrelated ideas. Ogilvy shows definitively that it's not; he's not changing the subject when he brings up the cross-ratio in a chapter on inversion - rather, he's unifying two (or more!) ostensibly disconnected subjects.This book is suitable for anyone with even the slightest interest in geometry. Everything is developed from scratch, and so the lapsed mathematics student shouldn't be intimidated. The bright high school student will be captivated by the elegance and accessibility of the results; and the graduate student or professor of mathematics will find this book to be a lesson in mathematics pedagogy - or just a perfect leisurely read."},{"Title":"Excursions in geometry","review":"The work describes many types of geometric challenges ineveryday life.

It deserves its five stars.The material was easy to follow and yet left plenty of gaps for the reader to fill in to consolidate their knowledge. Some traditional books on a subject like this simply assume too much knowledge and experience on the part of the reader and therefore quickly lose their appeal and remain largely unread outside of the Univerities. If more books like this were widely available I think they would spawn some very adept Geometers. Books like this hold one's interest, teaching the subject in a step by step unassuming fashion and indeed lead into more advanced work.Congratulations to the author."},{"Title":"Excursions in geometry","review":"Dover is to be commended for reprinting both of Ogilvy's books&quot;Excursions in Number Theory&quot; and &quot;Excursions in Geometry&quot;.

Much of it is well known, but some topics are shamefully neglected today, such as harmonic division and Apollonian circles, which is treated in the interesting chapter 2. Suppose there is a ship at A and a ship at B, and that the ship at A is k times faster. If the ships sail towards each other they will meet at C; if the B-ship tries to flee away from A, the A-ship will catch up with it at D. So we have AC/CB=AD/BD=k, and one says that the line segment AB has been \\"harmonically divided\\" by C and D. Now here is a theorem proved by Apollonius: the locus of points that the ships can reach at the same time, i.e. points P such that AP/BP=k, is a circle, the Apollonian circle. Proof: Consider such a point P. Bisect the angle APB, cutting AB at C. Extend AP and bisect the exterior angle, cutting the extended AB at D. One sees at once that CPD is a right angle. And by drawing the parallels to CP and PD through B and applying similar triangles twice we find that both AC/CB and AD/BD is equal to AP/BP=k, so C and D are the same C and D as above, and the points the ships can reach at the same time lie on the circle with diameter CD. A remarkable extension is the theorem that the diameter of a circle is divided harmonically by another circle if and only if the circles are orthogonal. So harmonic divisions of AB corresponding to different values of k come from a family of circles orthogonal to the circle with diameter AB, and for any one, cutting AB at C and D, say, we can draw the family of circles having their diameters harmonically divided by C and D. In this way we get a net of mutually orthogonal circles, illustrating a connection between the classical notion of harmonic division and the modern notion of harmonic function. There are also implications for naval pursuit. Suppose we are on a ship, hunting an enemy ship. Assuming that both we and the enemy are going in a straight line, the points that we could reach at the same time as the enemy lie on the Apollonian circle of points P such that AP/BP=ratio of velocities. If we are faster than the enemy, this circle will encircle him. Thus, if the enemy keeps a straight course (e.g., if we are a submarine), we should aim for the point where his course intersects the circle."},{"Title":"Excursions in geometry","review":"All the other reviews which rate this book highly are exactly correct. I am only going to add one thing: The discussion of the cross-ratio, in this book, is absolutely great.I have read a number of books on projective geometry. In those books the cross-ratio is defined and its invariance is proved in a very dry manner, without any explanation of why it is interesting at all. Yes, it is the key invariant of projective geometry, but it seems to come from nowhere - it is just a definition out of the blue.This book starts with a simple theorem on two chords of a circle, and then develops what it means to \\"divide a line harmonically\\", and then goes to the cross-ratio. This development, though simple, actually for the first time for me really motivated what the heck the cross-ratio was, and why anyone was initially interested in it. And then, chapter by chapter, the cross-ratio is used in interesting ways.First, it is used in coaxial families of Apollonian circles, a simple example. Then, inversive geometry is developed and it - inversive geometry, and thus the cross-ratio - become the means to explain and/or solve really interesting and fun problems like Peaucellier's linkage, the Apollonius problem of finding a circle tangent to three other circles, and truely amazing things like Steiner chains and Soddy's hexlet.Later in the book the discussion turns to projective geometry and there the cross-ratio reappears - and well it should as the cross-ratio is the key invariant in projective geometry. (I believe I already said that.) But the discussion here is so much better motivated than the discussion in the rigorous texts on projective geometry I've been studying.At last I feel I understand the cross-ratio!(By the way, if you like inversive geometry, look atGeometric Transformations IV: Circular Transformations (New Mathematical Library)- that's a really good text/problem book for it.)"},{"Title":"Excursions in geometry","review":"I'm a physics PhD candidate and am in the final stage of finishing my thesis. But when I began to read this book, I can't let it go until I read through. In my junior school years, inversion and projective geometry were not taught although I did some problems. I was always eager to know more of these two subjects. This book fulfils my dream.Also, I'll recommend Richard Courant's book, &quot;What is mathematics?&quot;"},{"Title":"Excursions in geometry","review":"This guide is ambiguous and provides very little information about obscure topics such as inversive geometry. The text is difficult to comprehend not because of its vocabulary, but because it tend to veer off course. Although the subject matter is interesting, it is very difficult to expose when confronted to diagrams that are basically not explained. This could not be used as a classroom guide because it tends to confound even gifted math students. An interesting remark was made, which was, &quot;I think he's going to start talking about his dog right now.&quot; This book would only be reccomended to the top 2% of math students, because it is not accesible to the general public. I should hope that someone who reads this book writes a revision of it."},{"Title":"Beginning C# Web Applications with Visual Studio .NET","review":"As a technical reviewer of this book I found it to have a good mix of technical content and explaination which is ideal for helping developers to get started with ASP.NET.The book explores various areas of key functionality within ASP.NET and supports it with a sample application.

The authors cleared much confusion I had about server controls, data binding and ADO.Net. Readers will appreciate the applications development approach in the book which goes beyond theory and shows you how to apply your skills in solving real-world problems. I recommend you write the code yourself line by line and read the book cover to cover. He leads you step by step.

Of course since there are a wide range of topics, one finds that some of them fail to go into great detail, but this is not even an issue as the author gives you enough information and examples to be able to figure it out for yourself, or at least to give you a solid foundation for solving the problem. The only downside is that, as far as I know, the code examples do not exist on Wrox's website. Perhaps I couldn't find them? It's not really a big issue because most of the code is easy to follow.

I just want to comment on \\"The Dirt Cheap Energy Converter\\", page 67, which is capable of generating 6 watts of electricity overunity. It appears that he developed something similiar to \\"Microtube Array\\" patent WO/2010/035035 in his energy converter. In effect, I believe that he doped his Barium Titanate to create Jahn-Teller distortion (see wiki) which results in a lower electrostatic repulsion within the atoms with maganese doping. This would allows doped atoms more freedom to oscillate and may contribute to fractoemission. The pours could be filled with material that creates the Casimir Effect. The book mentions that it was based upon Teslas Resonance Principle (page 67) with no explanation. I would like to add that it was based upon Teslas patent 685,957 and 685,958.

Oh how wrong I was. Jeane Manning gives us absolutely no reason to believe that zero-point energy can be tapped, yet assumes it can.In Chapter Eight, page 97, which is about cold fusion, Manning writes: \\"Cold-fusion proponents cannot prove that the reaction which follows the absorption is a nuclear reaction. Thus, most conventional scientists reject the whole idea of cold fusion\\". However, Manning gives no reason for believing that fusion is occuring and continues to simply assume that it is. That is not science, that is faith.Also, some of the support that zero-point energy exists is an argument that it is heating our planet, like in a microwave, which causes magma and so forth. This is completely false. The interior of the earth is molten because radioactive elements decay inside the earth and heat it up. A two minute search on Wikipedia found me that information, and Manning doesn't mention anything about it.If you want a real book on zero-point energy, look elsewhere because this is not it."},{"Title":"The Coming Energy Revolution: The Search for Free Energy","review":"Jeanne Manning is a freelance journalist who has also written books such asBreakthrough Power: How Quantum-leap New Energy Inventions Can Transform Our World,Angels Don't Play This HAARP (Advances in Telsa Technology), etc.She said in the Foreword that this 1996 book \\"describes the rapid progress in making available a source of energy that many of us in the scientific community believe will radically change the face of the earth---zero-point energy from quantum fluctuations in the vacuum of space.

So why would someone want to restore old windows instead of just replacing them?A) They're gorgeous, practical works of art...the eyes of the house. Our windows are \\"six-light prairie style, double hung\\" windows. They're one of the typical syles for bungalows in the Midwest, and are a big part of what make our house the thing we love.B) When restored properly, they will be weathertight as well as beautiful. (They are NOT maintenance free, however. If you are looking for maintenance free, restoration may not be for you.)C) It will cost us less to restore these windows than to replace them with a vinyl clad wood window. This is based on the number of windows we have and the shape that they are in.If those benefits are interesting to you, you need this book. Meany has written a fun book useful for the do-it-yourself'er as well as those wanting to learn about how window restoration works. With years of experience, Terence brings wisdom and humor (and some nice diagrams) to his writing. He gives beginners a realistic preview of what you're likely to encounter. Those with experience might find the book a bit basic but will appreciate the breadth of his experience and his recommendations on how to handle a few unusual challenges.This winter, we have toasty warm, restored and WORKING windows :)"},{"Title":"Working Windows: A Guide to the Repair and Restoration of Wood Windows","review":"Everyone who's owned an old house has gone through it - after being barraged by literature from window manufacturers, energy companies and design mags, you start thinking about putting in new replacement windows. It makes sense, right? Spend the money now, and reaps the dividends in energy savings with those smart, vinyl clad future-proof windows.Some of us continue to read past this, and we learn more beyond the hype. Those old double-hung sashes that have been keeping out the rain and wind for a century would be replaced with sashes that will last a few decades at most - replacements that often cannot be painted or even repaired when their exotic caulks inevitably fail. Replacments that nullify the architectural integrity of your older home. Replacements manufactured with materials that have a profound negative environmental impact.So, what to do? You're tired of the breezes through your home, the condensation and frost in the winter, the windows you can't even open, the money you can see wafting out of doors every time the heat or AC kicks in. Can you repair these ancient windows, make them work like new - maybe even work *better* than new?Working Windows is the answer to that last question, and answers with an emphatic \\"YES!\\". Aside from windows rotting clear off of their frames, this book will help you recover, restore and improve your existing windows. From fixing problems with rot and warping to sealing out the weather to pointing and glazing, this book covers everything. Want to make your own storm windows? It's got it. How about screens? Sure thing.The market for restoring older windows is a bit on the fringe, so finding the parts can be tricky, and in this revised version even that's taken care of: there are addresses and URLs for just about every tool and material mentioned. If you just want to open those painted-shut sashes for free, that's covered, but if you're looking for high end architecturally-sound storm windows, that's covered, too.My only complaint with the book is that some of the illustrations are cryptic. Perhaps in the third edition some full color, detailed images can help walk us through window restoration."},{"Title":"Working Windows: A Guide to the Repair and Restoration of Wood Windows","review":"I have recently purchased an older home that has a number of double-hung windows that need sash cords replaced and some minor repairs.

And yet the price is still the same! I've repaired lots of windows, so I'm hardly a novice, but I still picked up a lot of tips and tricks and things I didn't know. And it's lovely that someone still wants to write about how to repair one of the eminently repairable things in a world in which most things are no longer repairable but merely disposable. In a way it's a sad commentary on our society that everything is thrown away rather than repaired, though many modern products aren't even repairable (like the replacement windows so many people have been talked into- when their rather short lifespan is over, they'll just go to the landfill).The author's writing style is humorous, which I enjoyed, because I see no reason why providing information precludes it from being entertaining (if you prefer that, the National Park Service has a nice, dry, boring article on the repair of historic windows which is widely available).

(My house is 1929, and the windows matched his directions perfectly.) While my windows were straightforward, and this book gave me the courage to take them apart, I also enjoyed the discussions of more difficult cases and how to cope with them.I'm actually happy this book didn't spend time on other options for old windows - how to replace them is outside the scope of the book, though the author certainly says there are times it's appropriate. It's good to find a book which explains one set of things and explains it well instead of trying to explain every possibility - especially when window replacement is covered in seemingly infinite depth in every other book on this subject."},{"Title":"Working Windows: A Guide to the Repair and Restoration of Wood Windows","review":"This is one of my favorite books in my DIY collection, which is considerable. But it's not for everyone, as you might guess by reading the few negative reviews that people have posted. This is the book for an intelligent person who likes to fix things, but just hasn't had a previous opportunity to acquaint himself (or herself) with the facts of wood windows. It is densely packed with useful advice about every phase of window repair and restoration, including a lot of information about specific name-brand products (strippers, hardeners, fillers, glazing compound, thinners, paints), which is a big help on your visit to the shelves of the average DIY superstore. There are pages devoted to painting skills - the relative advantages of latex vs. oil-based paints, proper painting techniques and brush care. If you grew up around the trades you probably sucked in this stuff with your daddy's second-hand cigarette smoke, but if you are a self-taught DIYer, you are bound to discover a lot of things you've been doing wrong. As one detractor wrote in his review, this book is one man's opinion about window repair. That's absolutely true, but Terry Meany (who is this person \\"Jamie Shaw\\" that Amazon lists as the author?) is really up-front about these being his opinions and explains why he holds them. So it's easy to work from Meany's suggestions and your own experience to your own set of informed opinions. The book is also written in an engaging, articulate fashion. From this book I learned the word \\"solipsism,\\" how it applies to restoring woodwork, and the connections between divorce and paint removal. It's an unusual DIY book that can provide that sort of information. Armed with this book I was able to dismantle and restore a set of rotted leaded glass casement windows I would never have dreamed of tackling had Terry Meany not given me the courage.

None were working, all were painted shut inside and out AND to add insult to injury were also NAILED shut. WOW. I started working on them without any reference material and somewhat into the project discovered this book. It was a lifesaver. If you have an old house and want to keep the windows it came with, then this book is for you. If you want to know WHY you should keep your wooden windows instead of replacing them (which I think is a crime) with newer windows, read this book. If you want to know how all the several different types of these windows work and all the little tricks that will save you hours of work and days of indigestion as you start to work on them, read this book. It is also full of sources for antique replacement hardware which alone justifys the price since invariably these old windows are missing locks or other hardware or have a bad pulley or two. This book has helped me in a hundred ways in my project to rebuild these windows. I refer to it constantly. EVERYTHING is covered, even how to make screens for them. There were no questions I had about wooden windows that weren't answered in it. So get one and read it BEFORE you make any decision on rebulding or refurbishing your windows or replacing them, it is well written and humorous. You won't be sorry you did. Now for a couple of tips not in the book. First, very old window pane glazing assumes the consistency of concrete. Since I needed a way to remove the glass from the windows ( a must in rebuliding and refinishing the frames) without breaking it since it is the crinkly imperfect glass that is period to and a part of the windows and no longer available, I discovered that if you paint the glazing heavily with STRIP EZE and let it sit for 30 minutes it will softten the glazing and make it easy to remove. The mothods for removing glazing mentioned in the book do work but the risk of breaking a pane or two is higher. Second, infinite PATIENCE is required and will be rewarded when you work on these windows. Do not try to rush through the process. Do one window at a time, the book will tell you how to OPEN all the windows, but just take one at a time apart. Rushing will cause more problems than you are correcting. And lastly, when using DAP 33 glazing, follow the directions on the back of the can EXACTLY. You are creating big problems for later if you don't. I allow my reglazed windows to \\"cure\\" in the sun for two weeks before I begin painting and sealing them. Anyway, buy this book before you make any decisions on replacing or repairing your old windows. You won't be sorry you did and if you have the time, save the old windows, they are really are works of art and in the case of double hung windows, highly functional."},{"Title":"Working Windows: A Guide to the Repair and Restoration of Wood Windows","review":"Mr. Meaney combines straightforward, grounded explanations with the right amount of humor to keep this work from becoming just another &quot;how-to&quot; text.

Having read this book, I found the inspiration to learn more; as such I have enrolled in the MBA program where I already completed a masters in IT.My only issue with MBA in a Day is that I would have loved to have seen a chapter on Entrepreneurship-- which would be relevant to certain MBA-wannabes (like me), as well as the existing professionals (the main audience of the book) hoping to launch their own private practices.Neverthelesss, Dr. Stralser presents a wide variety of topics (including HR, Organizational Behaviour, Leadership, Ethics, Accounting/Finance, Economics, Marketing, Project Management, IS and Quality Management) in such an approachable way, making seemingly daunting subject matter easy to digest and appreciate.A definite buy, I am glad I picked up this book.... if you are thinking about doing your MBA, you should too."},{"Title":"MBA In A Day: What You Would Learn At Top-Tier Business Schools (If You Only Had The Time!)","review":"In my case the book was a great refresher having graduated over 3 years ago with a Business Adm.

I realized then that there must be some great substance in this book, since Jimmy had probably based several of his songs on the book. Being a good Parrothead, I read the book and now understand the substance. Twain's account of his steamboat voyage around the world is a classic.

Twain's story-telling is laced with subtle humor recounting his meandering journey (as in no great hurry to get to a particular destination) around the world. I suggest you read this book in small doses, kind of like a daily conversation with a [really interesting] neighbor where stories are exchanged. I often read stories from this book to my children (ages 8 &amp; 6) at bedtime. Clearly written in another era, Twain's sense of humor cracks me up, but some comments would today be considered politically incorrect so I make some real-time &quot;adjustments&quot; when reading it to the kids.I credit Jimmy Buffett with pointing me to this book through a reference on a CD although I don't share the opinion that Buffett's book is in the same league.

Great book."},{"Title":"Following the equator: A journey around the world (The writings of Mark Twain)","review":"Any reader who loves a good book will relish the vicarious experience of traveling with Twain, his wife, Livy, and Clara, one of their three daughters as they tour the world on the lecture circuit. It's important to understand the necessity of the trip: Twain was 60, facing bankruptcy, and signed on for the lecture tour in order to pay off his debt. The grueling schedule and unpredictable travel accommodations take no toll on his writing, however. Prepare to laugh - hard and often. Was it hot in India? \\"I believe that in India 'cold weather' is merely a conventional phrase and has come into use through the necessity of having some way to distinguish between weather which will melt a brass door-knob and weather which will only make it mushy.\\" Teachers - do not pass on the opportunity to laugh and learn and share the world with your students. Geography, history, culture, language, climate, language arts (oh, his choice of words and phrases!), politics, time zones, botany, geology, biology, religion - all are explored and described and relevant today. Jimmy Buffett's \\"Remittance Man,\\" \\"That's What Living is to Me,\\" and \\"Take Another Road\\" all spring from this book (especially the remittance man, a character you'll meet early in the book). There is also an \\"unfinished story\\" with which you can challenge your students. I worked with nineteen 4th and 5th grade gifted students one summer, and they spent two weeks reading, scripting, and animating a 70 minute video of this book. They loved it, and so will your students if you plan accordingly. A good accompanying video is \\"On the Trail of Mark Twain\\" with Peter Ustinov, but only as a companion - NOT as a replacement! Go for it... where else will you get the opportunity to travel from Vancouver to Hawaii to Fiji to Australia to New Zealand to Ceylon to India to South Africa? The book chronicles their travels in such a way that you can pick it up and focus on one region without losing anything. But don't let that stop you from reading the whole book. See the Southern Cross and the Blue Mountains. Get rousted out of your comfortable train berth to change cars in Australia because the gauge of the tracks changes from wide to narrow. Meet the dingo and the Aboriginals, eavesdrop on Twain's conversation with \\"Satan\\" and \\"God\\" in India, explore the diamond mines of South Africa near the Trappist Monastery, and steer clear of the sharks in the Great Barrier Reef. There is more adventure in this one book than a whole year's subscription to National Geographic. My favorite part? Twain's vivid description of \\"that bird of birds - the Indian crow.\\" No, wait, it's the hand-car ride down the Himalayas. No, wait... ah, who can pick? Read it yourself, and find out why.

I'm only short \\"The American Claimant\\" and a speech or essay or two. I'll deal with those shortly but, in the meantime, I'll savor the last of the truly noteworthing writings of America's greatest author. Towards the end of the journey \\"The Guilded Age\\" was a struggle and \\"The Prince and the Pauper\\" was good but not if the measuring stick was the works of Mark Twain. I wasn't sure what to expect of \\"Following the Equator\\" because I had heard so little about it. In addition, I had found \\"The Innocents Abroad\\" and \\"A Tramp Abroad\\" to have been tedious at times. Of the four travel books, this one ranks above the two aforementioned books and below \\"Roughing It\\". (I do not count \\"Life on the Mississippi\\" as belonging in this class). I rate this book with only 4 Stars because there are works of Twain well beyond this level. Too bad he doesn't have his own weights and measures rather than being compared to mere humans.\\"Following the Equator\\" made me laugh out loud as well as ponder in silence; qualities that are my yardstick when measuring Twain. The laughs come early and fast but every lengthy voyage by sea involves some doldrums and they appear in here as well. Most of those ocur when Twain is in his lecturing mode. He gets excited about a lot of history, geography, zoology, and anthropology along the way. Unfortunately he is often more excited than we are. Adding to the effects of these literary speed bumps are periodic lengthy quotations to relate the history he wants us to know. Twain should have known that he could summerize better that most (if not all) of the first-hand accounts we suffered through. We emerge from these stagnate waters back into the rapids of that unique humor of his.I read \\"Following the Equator\\" over a longer period that it took Twain to complete his voyage. That's because I had the book at work to read during 1/2 hour lunch breaks 2 days a week. Sometime I missed a month or two but I alway knew where the ship was docked when it was time to get on board again. Once the ship left the subcontinent of India, I was a full-time passenger which may be why I enjoyed South Africa the best. I was suprized that the journey from Cape Town to Southhampton only took the last three pages of the book. \\"Following the Equator\\" really should have ended with the previous chapter. In a tribute to Cecil Rhodes that only Twain could write, he ended that chapter with the following; \\"I admire him, I frankly confess it; and when his time comes I shall buy a piece of the rope for a keepsake.\\""},{"Title":"Following the equator: A journey around the world (The writings of Mark Twain)","review":"&quot;Following the Equator&quot; is not the typical Mark Twain story. This is a travelogue written as he is traveling by boat through Hawaii, Fiji, New Zealand, Australia, India, and South Africa.In each location, Twain gives you his unique perspective and interpretation of each countries customs, population, and history. He even talks about life on the boat. Throughout the book is also illustrations and pictures to give the reader some background and/or enjoyment.This is not a book I would pick up to read unless you were familiar with Mark Twain's writing. I found his commentary and tales to be very funny.

So I don't want to turn anyone off from this book, just be in the move for something a little different than most Twain material."},{"Title":"The Chief Inspector's Daughter","review":"Alison Quantrill has returned home to Suffolk after a failed relationship in London. She has a lucky break and gets a job as secretary to Jasmine Woods, a well-known romantic novelist who lives in the area. But the job doesn't last for long because Jasmine is murdered a couple of months later. After Alison finds the body she finds the police questioning traumatic and disappears one night. Douglas Quantrill and his wife, Molly find her disappearance brings them closer together.Chief Inspector Quantrill has to concentrate on his murder investigation and leave other people to search for his daughter though his personal feelings mean he is torn two ways. I enjoyed this complex murder mystery and liked the way the series characters are developing - Quantrill himself, his wife Molly and his Sergeant Martin Tait. The relationship between Tait and Quantrill is gradually turning into friendship and they are starting to respect each other and work well together.This interesting series, set in Suffolk, makes a refreshing change from many modern crime novels which contain, in my opinion, too much graphic violence and bad language. There is plenty of psychological depth to the characters and their personal problems are interesting as are their motivations. Life in a small community is well drawn and Quantrill is likeable and all too human. I recommend this series to anyone who likes their crime novels cast in the conventional mould."},{"Title":"The Chief Inspector's Daughter","review":"Some the storyline is pretty typical - but that doesn't make it bad. I enjoyed the mystery and the characters."},{"Title":"Kentucky's Domain of Power, Greed and Corruption","review":"Ms. Ellison's book is an interesting one, from the sheer fact that it tries to tackle head-on Kentucky's past, exposing the scandals, corruption and deceit which has occurred during the course of more than 100 years. It is true that quite a few of the issues and information Boles brings up have not generally been reported in the [relatively vast] literature which has been published on the most successful college basketball program in history. It also no doubt took courage for Ellison to examine more recent events and to force the powers that be to divulge this information.However, despite the courage and despite the years she spent researching and writing the book, it doesn't make it an extremely reliable one, nor one which should be considered objective. Ellison's tone and assumptions about distant people and their motivations strain any credibility the book might otherwise deserve. According to her, anyone and everyone who was ever associated with UK athletics automatically joins the \\"good old boys,\\" a undefined and apparently timeless network of morally corrupt people she refers to throughout the text who, according to her, do nothing but drink, gamble, swear and spend their time trying to cheat and swindle money from the University, break amateur regulations and otherwise undermine academic progress at the University.One example is her characterization of John J. Tigert, who was a distinguished graduate of Vanderbilt, a Rhodes Scholar, chair of Philosophy at UK, Commissioner of Education for the Harding and Coolidge administrations, President of the University of Florida where he played the key role in expanding the university while strengthening the academics and research and also helped plan India's system of higher education. Despite these seemingly impressive academic credentials, Ellison lumps him in as just another of the \\"good old boys.\\" Tigert assumed athletic director and coaching responsibilities in the teens for the UK men's basketball team (and later women's basketball team) when the head coach abruptly quit.This type of characterization of those associated with UK athletics is repeated time and again in the book. In lieu of facts, she often intersperses her own personal commentary and assumptions. Items such as \\"I suspect ...\\" or \\"I've always felt...\\" are randomly interspersed throughout the text. That's not to say that the criticism Ellison dishes out isn't on-target or deserved, I'm sure a lot of it is, however Ellison is apparently not objective enough to discern either way and unwilling to back up her assertions with hard facts. Her penchant for casting everything related to those associated with UK in a negative manner makes it virtually impossible for the reader to determine what is valid and what is not, and ultimately to take much of it seriously.Her broad characterizations don't just pertain to individuals, but is used to broadly sweep events also. Her characterization of the development of Kentucky sporting life up until the late 1800's is \\"With no Indians to be chased, Kentuckians looked for another avenue of action and a way to settle their arguments.\\" Ellison also fails to put the athletics program into proper perspective. While today it is a multi-million dollar enterprise, that was certainly not always the case. More often than not, the early sports teams played to a handful of spectators, little to no media coverage, a shoe-string budget and no scholarships. I would liken it to \\"club\\" status at Universities today. Yet Ellison's portrayal of people associated with UK athletics as being in some sort of grand scheme to become outrageously wealthy and powerful through UK athletics, whether it appears realistic for the time or not. Whether she's discussing the 1990's or the 1890's, it's of little consequence in Ellison's portrayal of sports at Kentucky as a powerful negative force.In terms of accuracy and knowledge of the subject, Ellison often misses in a lot of places and exposes her own shaky knowledge of the topics at hand. For example, she claims Central University was in Richmond in 1913, when the university had moved to Danville the decade previous. She boldly claims that UK's all-time record is incorrect, because she 'discovered' that UK had an exhibition game which wasn't counted. Any casual fan knows that exhibition games aren't counted in all-time results. She apparently didn't realize that Helms titles prior to the early 1940's were awarded retroactively etc.Her characterization of the 1913 Arson Scandal is a complete mess. In typical fashion, she paints the situation in the worst possible light, glossing over many key details and freely interspersing her own prejudices into the motivations and habits of the main characters, all of whom are long since deceased. Instead of trying to understand why people may have acted the way they did given the circumstances, Ellison assumes the worst about people she couldn't possibly have known and then moves on to throw mud on the next person.Perhaps more revealing is that much of what Ellison discusses in the early part of her book was covered much more thoroughly and more objectively by Gregory Kent Stanley, who received a PhD in history from UK (the very same program Ellison was in) and published \\"Before Big Blue\\" many years before Ellison's book came out. Only with the aid of Stanley's book can much of Ellison's casual, slanted and spotty portrayal of early events make any sense. Amazingly, Stanley's book isn't mentioned once in Ellison's extensive references or bibliography.Given the poor job Ellison did concerning the early years of UK, one has to wonder how valid her portrayal of later years are. Which is a shame, since as mentioned, a lot of the more recent information and situations detailed in the book are simply not found anywhere else to date."},{"Title":"Kentucky's Domain of Power, Greed and Corruption","review":"The first time I read this book it was called Bluegrass Conspiracy, with good sources. This piece of trash is from someone who has little to no first hand knowlege of the University of Kentucky. She claims to be behind the scenes. What scenes, she had no real connection to the program. She seems to be mean spirited and bitter towards people who she has never met or had any meaningful contact with. Maybe it's the fact that she was forced to go to the west coast to get this rag published, or the fact that the only place in Lexington that carries this book is the airport. The shock value of the book makes it entertaining reading, but the national enquirer is a lot cheaper (and more accurate)."},{"Title":"Kentucky's Domain of Power, Greed and Corruption","review":"I believe Jim Murray is doing a tongue in cheek- he actually gives the book a high rating so I think his comments are teasers to get the readers in Ky to think and read the book no matter if it lowers the opinions of the Big Blue Zealots etc Honesty is never out of style-Truth can always bear being examined-Ky has had glorious times in sports but it has also had its dark ages and pages-the fans cannot just claim the good and disclaim the bad- it is all of one cloth- Ellison merely tells it like it was found in her research and definitely allows the reader to see when she has her own interpretation and leaves the reader to make their own judgements -honoring their own intellect integrity and dignity"},{"Title":"Kentucky's Domain of Power, Greed and Corruption","review":"Thanks to Ms. Ellison, our friends in Lexington have another opportunity to correct their ways. One of the most penalized schools in NCAA history, the University of Kentucky has not changed much since the basketball team had to cancel two seasons in the 1950s because of player involvement in gambling scandals. Back in the early 90's, a new athletic director was hired, pledging to clean things up. And things did appear to have changed on the surface. However, within less than a decade, the football team has been cited for more than 35 violations of NCAA rules, including some major violations.One of the problems UK inherently faces is the expectations of many fans in the state whose entire lives seem to revolve around the program.

While on the surface it purports to be an introduction to a particular research methodology--presumably for the benefit of social science PhD students--appealing to common sense, at the same time it is also a philosophical tour de force, engaging with metaphysical and ontological issues of the highest order.It is quite possible to read it in a few days, as it is written in a colourful style peppered with amusing metaphors and examples, but it is more likely that a number of reads are required to fully experience what this book has to offer (unless you are an ANT enthusiast already). In the end it is a thought experiment and it will either work for you or it won't. You will either come away hating actor-network-theory for the rest of your life or you will have a conversion experience and you will never be able to look at baboons and the map of the London Underground quite the same way again.In many ways this book reminds me of Heidegger's Being and Time, but the differences might be more important than the similarities. For one Latour completes the book as promised in the introduction, in contrast to Heidegger. But also Latour is a lot more specific and optimistic about the outcomes of his \`deconstruction' of traditional sociology, as opposed to Heidegger's pessimistic and rather vague conclusions stemming from his destruction of traditional metaphysics.In this sense Latour's Reassembling the Social is not so much an introduction to a theory as a guide or handbook to practical living. However the practical or empirical metaphysics he proposes for (re)assembling a better world is far from being a quick-fix solution: it asks for a tireless, on-going effort to collect and rearrange the world, morsel by morsel, just like an ant."},{"Title":"Reassembling the Social: An Introduction to Actor-Network-Theory (Clarendon Lectures in Management Studies)","review":"Perhaps it has a lot to do with the book being written in English (or at least it appears to have been, there is no translator listed), but this is by far the most lucid thing I've read by Latour. In a way it's a radical break, he finally embraces his troubled intellectual child Actor Network Theory, stops expecting its meaning to magically emerge from the context and sets forth exploring what it actually is and how it can work."},{"Title":"Reassembling the Social: An Introduction to Actor-Network-Theory (Clarendon Lectures in Management Studies)","review":"This is a book which deserves a wide reading in the social sciences for its brazen and determined effort to deeply problematize the notion of the \\"social.\\"At the same time, as I read the first few chapters, I had a sense of deja vu. The program Latour is putting forth--at least initially-- appears not so different from that of Fredrik Barth -- not Barth's early transactionalist stuff, but his later work on the anthropology of knowledge. Specifically,Barth, F.1992 Towards greater naturalism in conceptualizing societies. In Conceptualizing Society. Kuper, A., eds. Pp. 17--33. : Routledge.andBarth, F.1993 Balinese worlds.

Latour's prose seems effortlessly easy here; the concepts are accessible, the insights stark, and the organization lucid. In its first section you will find the presentation of the case which motivates the use of ANT so compelling that you may begin to wonder how, and why, other approaches can properly be called sociology. There is a charming, funny, and helpful middle section in which Latour writes in dialog. A testament to the degree with which one can engage this work: not a single one of its 262 pages in my text avoided some highlighting, underlining, or maringal notes. Since many readers will be familiar with \\"We Have Never Been Modern\\" it is important to note that \\"Reassembling the Social\\" is altogether more focused. Its target is smaller, so this is no mystery. But here you find a concrete and practical account of how to treat objects and actors in an appropriately relative way, so as to render them both full participants in stabilizing the social. Put short, a masterwork."},{"Title":"Reassembling the Social: An Introduction to Actor-Network-Theory (Clarendon Lectures in Management Studies)","review":"Given our experiences in late-modernity outrun our pre-developed concepts especially in innovation Latour claims that sociologists should themselves be part of innovation experiences. He portrays a new type of sociology (the one including objects) by which one can describe rather than prescribe. Latour initiates the difference between ANT and Sociology of Social(SOS), claiming that the latter chooses its tools from repertoire of agreed-upon criteria (pre-developed concepts) while in ANT we must follow the traces left by the actors. What is left we shall name as a society of actors and works. ANT analyst must himself participate and experinece the phenomena in a \\"here-and-now\\" perceptual sense and then conceptualize what he has experienced. In Latour's argument all things including human and non-human are mediators by which action is not merely transfered but also transformed to a new state. Both the actor and its associated action undergo a metamorphosis process in each mode of action. Consequently we have Five sources of Uncertainty:1.Groups may form and depart for tyrrany of distance and proximity is removed2.Action may be done by others and we can not fully anticipate in advance the nature of agencies and the outcome3. Things have agency no matter how much man has the power to control4. In the realm of things matter of fact prevails whereas in the combination of \\"things and human\\" matter of fact trasforms to matter of concern. In other words in the new relam i.e. \\"socio-technical realm\\" matter of scientific facts combines with the matter of cognitive concern.5. Writing down experienced accountsHence, It's a call of Heraclitus aphorism i.e. \\"you can not step in the same river twice\\" along with Existentialism philosophy. Both you and the river change during the course of action. But you must expereince this change to percieve it. It could not be described completely by merely using pre-developed concepts. Your experience precedes your pre-developed concepts about the river and your reflection when crossing the river. Latour sometimes complicate his arguments by using difficult expressions, terminologies and long Gallic statements, but his words are very insightful, and his message is invaluable after-the-fact.One issue which I didn't find in this book was responsibility and \\"responsible reflection\\". In other words Latour doesn't open the question about self-responsibility of actors that ANT analyst should follow. ANT analyst is not permitted to give advice to actors. He can only observe and expereince. This is ironically a matter of concern not a matter of fact that might be considered in his future arguments, given that Engineers and Scientists, for example, from ANT perspective are actors which should only watched not advised responsibly. To sum up ANT is to follow the \\"Dislocation of Action\\" and \\"opening eyes to see who is acting within any site; where the consequence of this action may travel; where are the likely sources that provoke action and actors\\"; \\"how sequence and consequence of sites change the nature of action\\" and the like. The Network we could envisage through resolving questions as such shall be mapping out and named as Society. Hence, late modernity is an entity that must be reassembled through ANT lens."},{"Title":"Reassembling the Social: An Introduction to Actor-Network-Theory (Clarendon Lectures in Management Studies)","review":"A very good tutorial given by Latour. Not difficult to follow even for readers with no background in sociology."},{"Title":"Beyond Geography: The Western Spirit Against the Wilderness","review":"Here Frederick Turner advances a spiritual and religious thesis for the destruction of nature by Western civilization. What sets the West apart from almost everyone else in the world is a lack of connection with nature, which has lead to vast environmental destruction and the extermination of entire peoples. With great historical insight Turner traces this tendency way back to the very earliest cultures of the Near East such as Sumer and Mesopotamia, which were besieged by hostile nomads who resisted their attempts at the settled life. This influence continued into the Roman Empire which was constantly on the verge of collapse from barbarians at the gates, and Western culture developed an innate fear of unstructured and unknown nature. Meanwhile, as Christianity became the world's most bureaucratic religion, God was removed from the world and confined to the church, and stifling dogma prevented followers from attaining new revelations and awareness. In turn the outside natural world became the realm of Satan and had to be conquered and controlled. Turner extends these dire trends into the eras of exploration and expansion into the new world, with the stipulation that the inherent Western disconnection from nature led that culture to destroy it out of hatred and repressed desires.This is a very strong thesis and Turner's research and insights are sound, especially for the time he wrote the book (1980), though he does tend to do a lot of stretching. An example is the implication that Westerners were so likely to slaughter other peoples because Christianity did not allow ritual sacrifices. Another problem is the inconsistent writing in this book, as Turner's distinct history and anthropology often drift into sentimentality and repetitive complaining about the West's evil deeds. Early in the book he condemns the doctrine of the \\"noble savage\\" as a patronizing effect of hypocritical Western culture (which it is), but in the final two chapters Turner is dangerously close to this attitude himself. Despite some inconsistencies, Turner has delivered a very insightful look into the culture that destroyed much of the natural world and the deep historical influences that prevented remorse and guilt, except in the subconscious of every nature-deprived Western person."},{"Title":"Vineyard Harvest: A Year of Good Food on Martha's Vineyard","review":"Vineyard Harvest:A Year of Good Food onMartha's VineyardBy Tina Miller with Christie MathewsonPhotography by Alison ShawThis cookbook concentrates on the simple and pure.

I read some works by Jung on dreams and people who claimed they saw flying saucers. These so much impressed me that I also formed a high opinion of Jung. I then read Jung's &quot;Answer to Job&quot; when I researched a book I wrote about &quot;Revelation and the Fall of Judea.&quot; I had read commentaries by many authors to make sure I understood what others had said. &quot;Answer to Job&quot; touched on the same topic. What an eye opener! This man, so highly revered as an expert on human thinking, doesn't himself understand who God is and what God has done, even with Job.Jung claims that God once was in a state of unconsciousness and was prodded by Lucifer, who was inclined to make use of God's omniscience, into acting unfairly with Job. Job proved himself morally superior to God. God then became the human being, Jesus Christ, so he could suffer the way Job was made to suffer. Jung's position surprised me because God was never in a state of unconsciousness. God is unchanging. Jung mentions Lucifer. I'm surprised that Jung didn't believe the biblical text that it was Lucifer who brought suffering onto Job. Lucifer did it to demonstrate before God that Job would blaspheme God if Job experienced misfortune. God gave Lucifer permission to harass Job but set limits on what Lucifer could do. Job actually proved himself morally superior to Lucifer because, even when suffering misfortune, Job would not rebel against God, whereas, Lucifer, without any suffering, rebelled through pride.Job had three friends who tried to convince him that he offended God somehow, and that is why misfortune came. Their opinions were not true. Scripture has it that Lucifer brought misfortune to goad Job into rebellion. God permitted this because God had already informed Lucifer how faithful Job is. Now, under fire, Job's faithfulness is tried and proven. Spiritual growth came out of Job's suffering. That's why God permitted it. When the book of Job ends, God told Job to pray for his three friends because their untrue advice had offended God. I'm surprised Jung didn't pick up on that. God's asking Job to pray for his friends is one of the keys to understanding the book of Job."},{"Title":"Answer to Job (Meridian books)","review":"A much better take on the book of Job and the problem of suffering is Ren&eacute; Girard's book, &quot;Job: The Victim of His People&quot;.

But this book should be seen as mearly Jung's perception of the book, and as a reaction to a religion of Law, and not of Grace. He bases his interpretations on misquotations of the Bible and the apocrypha. I guess every power figure, even God, gets his words misrepresented in print."},{"Title":"Answer to Job (Meridian books)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I won't be able to say enough good things about it! I will be re-reading this several more times and devoting time to carefully study it. It isn't very long, only a little over 100 pages, but it is densely packed with imporant ideas anyone interested in religious and spiritual matters should consider. This is especially true of those familiar with the Christian religion given Jung is discussing Job throughout the text. Not however for the faint of heart! If questions such as, Is God evil? bother you, or you find that question itself to be Evil, then I suggest you don't read this book. But if you consider this to be a fair question, especially considering the treatment of Job, you may be ready for Jung's ideas.

Whever I hear someone cry out in anguish, demanding to know why if God exists, He lets good people suffer, I think of these tales.Jung also poses these questions, and reminds us that if God created the Universe and all that is in it, that Satan is also one of God's creations and is one of His most favored children. Jung reminds us that God listened to Satan before torturing Job.As Jung questions God and ponders his cruelty and also his kindness, he reminds us that Yahweh is not a human being. He is both a persecutor and a helper in one, and the one aspect is as real as the other. Yahweh is not split but is an antimony--a totality of inner opposites--and this is the indispensable condition for his tremendous dynamism, his omniscience and omnipotence.The difference between good and evil is not one of kind, but of degree, like the difference between light and darkness. The same thing can appear as good and evil under different circumstancesI like this book. Jung makes perfect sense to me.Kim BurdickStanton, DE"},{"Title":"Answer to Job (Meridian books)","review":"This is just a review of the 2010 edition of this particular work by Jung.

The typeset pages of the actual Jung text appear to be taken directly from a past printing, and are just right for reading -- no new, modern, gaudy liberties are taken with the font or layout of the body of the text, the headings, or the footnotes -- it looks like something printed in the 50s, as I think it should. The original one-page bibliography and Jung's extensive index are here as well. The paragraphs of the original text are numbered 553-758, in line with the collected works.

I like this book because Jung is expressing his feelings whilst using his immense experience and accumulated knowledge. Although many references are made to other sources, I do not feel as if I need to know very much more than the average person brought up in a mild Christian society, to gain substantial benefit from the book. What seems intense to me is the underlying issues of how we (as humans) relate to our sense of reality and justice. For me, this is not so much an answer to Job as a comprehension of the inherent correctness of the dilemma that Job is faced with. I gave this book a rating of 4 on a scale of 5 because I still do not feel that I understand fully what Jung is saying. But I am not sure that he is sure either. It certainly elucidates, for me, the very real dynamics between the conscious and the subconscious. I gives me insight into the difference between children's immediacy which can be without sympathy for the effect of their actions on the outside world, and the same immediacy that adults can attain with complete responsibility for the effect of their actions. Immensely supportive book and an important aid to self improvement, which is our inherent right as human beings. Don't expect to get all the benefits of this book for months or even years after reading it."},{"Title":"Answer to Job (Meridian books)","review":"This short book took me a while to read it because the subject matter is fairly dense. He directly addresses the paradox between the wrathful Jehovah and loving Christ. It treats the subject more literally than I expected - I couldn't tell whether he was talking about an inner dynamic or literal historical events. This might turn some readers off.I come from a Christian background and it addressed some questions I still had from my childhood about the split personality between the Jehovah of the Old Testament and the New Testament Christ."},{"Title":"Answer to Job (Meridian books)","review":"Jung's life journey was an investigation into who and what we are as human. Like it or not, in discovering who we are, he had to confront God as part of that discovery process. I can understand why Answer to Job caused so much controversy. Don't shake the status quo after it has found an easy to accommodate understanding of God. Many have shaken that tree and were martyred. Or in one case, crucified.If you truly want to find out who and what you are, read this book.

After seeing that Job never stopped loving God, no matter what horrors God heaped on him, God realized that humans had something going that God did not. Plus, He realized He'd trivially made a bet on a man's soul. God needed to experience humanity first hand to find out why, and so became human in the form of Jesus.This explanation caused Christianity to make sense to me. Although it is certainly no part of any church I have ever heard of, it is the one idea that could make me part of a church, if such a one existed."},{"Title":"Answer to Job (Meridian books)","review":"Doctor Jung expresses concern in his Introduction that readers will misinterpret the ideas contained in this book. Jung presents examples of the unconscious, capricious behavior of Yahweh (GOD) who self-righteously proclaims his moral superiority over humankind and enforces a strict adherence to his sense of justice. This self-delusion reaches culmination in the collusion of Yahweh and his 'shadow son' Satan in the undeserved sadistic persecution of a righteous man, Job, in a cosmic wager. Job's principled response to this persecution demonstrates humankind exhibiting a higher morality than shown by Yahweh. Yahweh, reaching a higher level of consciousness, realizes that he must atone to humankind for the wrong he has done. His attempt to make this atonement through incarnation as Jesus Christ is only partially successful. The later appearance of the Holy Ghost is Yahweh's attempt to perfect himself further through a personal incarnation into humankind in general. Jung moves on to a psychological analysis of the Book of Revelation, where the shadow side of the author, the Apostle John, is evident in the torments predicted to befall humankind.Jung's theological ideas are radical and open to misinterpretation. His thinking on the 'problem of evil' and the evolving relationship of God to humankind is the attempt of a wise, old man to make sense of the conflicting images present in the mythology of the Bible."},{"Title":"Answer to Job (Meridian books)","review":"Jung's \\"Answer to Job\\" was recommended to me by friends, and after some procrastination, I finally decided to give it a read. My only regret is that I waited so long to get around to it. I was surprised by both the candor and the comprehensive sweep of the book.It should be understood that this book is not a book on pure theology, though theological issues inevitably arise. Jung himself emphasises that he is a \\"layman\\" in this area. He also makes plain that the book is a subjective response to Job. Jung also works from an orthodox premise, taking as given that the Father of Jesus Christ and Yahweh are the same being. With these born in mind, Jung's book is informative, interesting and very thought-provoking.Jung's book has three main sections to it, as far as I could tell. First, he discusses the Book of Job, and the situation surround Job's life, trials and the drama played out with Satan. This section is darkly humorous, often eliciting a chuckle at Jung's descriptions of Yahweh. This aspect truly surprised me immensely, though pleasantly so. Jung treats Yahweh honestly, and is not shy of pointing out Yahweh's faults, which are many and abundant. Yahweh's apparent willingness and readiness to take Satan's bait, Yahweh's readiness to violate his own laws and so on are all mentioned and raised.As the book progresses, Jung starts to address the pyschological processes within Yahweh, as he sees them. The book also gets more serious, losing that dark humour. Some aspects were a bit difficult understand the workings of, like the failure of Yahweh \\"to consult his omniscience\\" in dealing with Job. It seemed to me that there was a separation between Yahweh and some part of his being, which I could not grasp very well. That said, this is the first book of psychology that I have read, so those more familiar may have a better understanding of it than I.Thirdly, Jung enters into a discussion on the psychological processes of people who have become \\"incarnations of the spirit\\", (Jung's words, paraphrased a bit). In this section, Jung discusses the Book of Revelation in detail, tackling some of the issues that book raises, especially in the contrast between the Jesus of the Gospels and the Jesus of Revelation.Overall, the entire book is definitely interesting, and gives one a lot of food for thought. Jung takes an honest and very open look at the problems raised by Yahweh's dealings with Job, and uses that as a spring board for a broader discussion on psychology from Jung's perspective.Despite my own problems of understanding parts in detail, I still enjoyed the book immensely, and have a lot of new ideas to think about. The book was well written, and certainly has a lot crammed into the 108 pages of text, (not including other stuff).However, nowhere does Jung go so far as the Gnostics to say that Yahweh is an inferior and ignorant demiurge. While criticising Yahweh, Jung offers a pyschological explanation as to why Yahweh seemed to be an absolute cretin to a man who was blameless in his sight; as good an explanation as I have ever read or heard.For such a topic, it is pretty rare to find a book that gives so much to ruminate on in such a small space. An excellent buy, and certainly one that will occupy your mind for some time after the last page."},{"Title":"Answer to Job (Meridian books)","review":"--and brother, does the Big Guy have problems! Read any biography of Stalin side-by-side with the Old Testament and you don't see much difference between the dictator and the Almighty. Paranoid, jealous, vain, ruthless, and vengeful, they demand unquestioning, unthinking obedience and they will crush you with unlimited violence if they don't get it. Gulag, Hell, it's all the same, except you can't escape Hell even in death.God, as Jung points out, isn't quite right in the head. As Exhibit A, Jung uses the biblical story of Job--the faithful servant tortured to within an inch of his life by the God he loves--to deal with that age-old question: why do horrendous things happen to good people, or, if God is so powerful, so good, so infallible, why are there concentration camps, cancers, pederastic serial killers, tsunamis, terrorists--so many Evil-doers in the world? And, even worse, why are there so many innocent victims of all this evil? It's a problem inherent in monotheism. If there's only one God, then why shouldn't he be held responsible for all of it...good and bad?There's got to be a better answer than the one God gives Job in the Bible, which is, basically, \\"I'm bigger than you, I'm stronger than you, this is my world, I made it, and if you don't shut yer yap I'm gonna rip you a new one, you worm!\\"Job gets the point: might makes right--and he does obeisance and keeps quiet as any sensible person would confronted by an armed and pumped up lunatic in full-blown \`roid rage. But there's got to be a better answer to Job's very valid question than that, doesn't there?With wit, passion, and probing analytic insight, Jung finally provides Job with the answer God Himself should have given Job--if only the Almighty could have articulated it. For the truth is, as Jung rather stunningly tells it, God is actually unconscious of a large part of Himself and not unlike a lot of his creatures, He's in the process of \\"discovering\\" Himself as an individual. Perhaps even more stunning is Jung's assertion that God has a lot of catching up to do with his creatures since men like Job, who've looked deeply into themselves, actually occupy higher moral ground than He does. That, according to Jung, is the reason that God had to become man, and why he is still trying to become man: to come to awareness about Himself.God, in other words, would be better if only he realized what a lot of pain and misery He's been causing! It's truly a case of His Right Hand not knowing what His Left Hand was doing.*Answer to Job* is a simply brilliant interpretation of this classic Biblical story and its subsequent influence on the development of New Testament theology from the point of view of Jungian psychoanalysis. The translation is crystal-clear, largely free of technical or scholarly jargon, and livened by Jung's often irreverent sense of humor. You really do get the sense, as Jung says in his preface, that he's writing as a man for whom Job's pained and passionately urgent questioning of God doubles for his own: Why so much suffering? Why so much evil? How can there possibly be a God?As Jung makes clear, these are questions that are evolving over time, along with their answers. And while in presuming to answer for God, Jung's may not be the final word, but it's sure a lot more satisfying than the answer God Himself gave."},{"Title":"Answer to Job (Meridian books)","review":"...and daring in its conjecture that the God-image (NOT God) could only evolve out of its amoral unconsciousness through an encounter with a man of unbending integrity. Highly recommended, especially for open-minded theologians outgrowing the need to idealize images of the deity."},{"Title":"Answer to Job (Meridian books)","review":"I write this review as a caution to others who might consider taking up this book as a commentary on the Biblical Book of Job. This text is a fine example of Jungian psychology, from the pen of the man himself, and as such it deserves respect and a proper evaluation on psychological rather than theological grounds. However, this book is not and was never intended to be a work of theology of any sort, much less a piece if Biblical interpretation. Jung uses the contest between God and Satan for the soul of Job as a metaphor for his own theories about the processes of the unconscious and the innate structure of the human psyche. Those theories, in themselves, may be correct, but that is a highly dubious interpretation on the Scriptural work itself. Jung, to his credit, admits up front that he is not engaging in theology per se; alas, many of his readers don't seem to comprehend that. In short, if you are interested in Jungianism, this is a central work, but if you are looking for theology in general or a commentary on Job in particular, you should go elsewhere."},{"Title":"Answer to Job (Meridian books)","review":"C.G. Jung was literally unique in both knowledge and wisdom. \\"Answer to Job\\" is by his own attestation one of his most important books of so many excellent contributions to understanding the human psyche. It is most essential for human survival that people understand how the lack of integrating the self in what Jung calls individuation allows the unconscious to compel us perpetually towards attitudes and actions of mutual destructiveness. (See also his essay \\"The Development of Personality\\". ) \\"Answer to Job\\" delineates precisely how humans have projected onto their image of god the unresolved conflicts of a deeply conflicted shadow self. It should be read with Edward F. Edinger's \\"Transformation of the God-Image\\" and Murray Stein's \\"Jung's Map of the Soul\\". Dr. Jung (medical doctor, analyst, scholar and author extraordinary) remains one of the great SEERS of the modern world, and as such offers us a special CURE FOR THE SOUL of humanity in our perilous condition."},{"Title":"Answer to Job (Meridian books)","review":"Answer to Job is Jung's attempt to make sense of certain Christian teachings in the Bible (and the 1950's Papal dogmatisation of Assumption of the Virgin Mary) that might be inexplicable to a rational mind and traditionally being believed on faith. Jung's method is analytic psychoanalysis with particular focus on God's communication to man through Archetype or Collective Unconscious. In essence it is a psycho-analysis of God, justifiable conceptually by the postulation that the Collective Unconscious is both autonomous and has to be comprehended by human consciousness for its existence as psyche fact. Needless to say, that rested upon Jung having established (else where) that the Collective Unconscious itself is empirical rather metaphysical (i.e. with scholastic respectability).The first puzzle is God's (Yahweh's) \\"unfair\\" treatment of one pious Job. The omniscient God is therefore interpreted as one-sided, unconscious and amoral. Both disturbing to Job (exemplified all pious humans then) and to God - the created had been elevated to a higher moral platform than the creator, since by definition morality presupposes consciousness. The decision of God to become conscious (i.e. become Man) is an understandable development. And according to Jung's analysis, this is the real reason of the Incarnation. To avoid contamination by Satan (God's first son), the help of wisdom/Sophia/Virgin Mary is needed. Thus, Jesus represented the best/positive side of God. Here, Jung differed from Christian dogma that says the sacrifice of God's Son is for the purpose of Man's redemption. Both views however seem (to me) to be on agreement that the Incarnation brought HOPE to Man.As explained by Jung, Jesus taught us, without Jesus, Man has to use his own consciousness (and wisdom) to differentiate the Holy Ghost from Satan. John's revelation of a more revengeful God-Christ-image certainly signified rougher seas, and a new child image, as interpreted by Jung, signified God's wish to become Man himself, this time to ordinary man, total with God's amoral capacity as demonstrated towards Job. Based on this line of thought, Man certainly needs a helper or mediator on his side. It was therefore, timely, according to Jung for the Pope to introduce the Dogma of Assumption of the Virgin Mary (in addition to the need to address the becoming importance of the female sex in our society).Despite its complexity, this book is a breathtaking study on religion and humanity that deserves a reader's every effort to comprehend and appreciate. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Answer to Job (Meridian books)","review":"For me this book is a wonderful example of how Jung was able to work with archetypes and myths when dealing with his own relationships. One familiar with the letters between Freud and Jung will find in the description of Yahweh and Jung's complaints against this punishing, abandoning, and at times unself-aware image of God the very real feelings he experienced with Freud.I believe Jung did in this book what he could not do in his real life experience with Freud. That is reconcile parts of the relationship that hurt him deeply while finding a way to understand the limitations of both Freud and the PsychoAnalytic community which he felt abandoned him after the break with Freud.He did this by attributing to God the containment of all things of the paradoxial nature of being both light and darkness/ evil and good."},{"Title":"Answer to Job (Meridian books)","review":"The Book of Job has remained a mystery to me regardless having readthe biblical texts several times, studied several sermons and evengone through a group study with several fellow christians - they allsay more or less the same thing. Repeatedly hearing the same thingbrings about a distinct curiosity for a deeper and broader understanding.\\"Answer to Job\\" is a gift from Jung to christians in such sense.As enlightening as scientists come to explain the physicalbiblical wonders, so is Jung's insights to the psyche'sdevelopement(both God's and human's) since creation and where dohuman beings fit in the process, providing a unique perspectivethat fits right in. Another reason I like the book is due toJung's humble and objective attitude in observing, perceivingand interpreting, albeit how passionate he felt about the subject,I could sense his integrity as a scholar. This book is a valuablepersonal sharing from a man to his fellow human beings whom hecared about dearly."},{"Title":"Answer to Job (Meridian books)","review":"Freud was merely a rational atheist. Jung not only believes in God but in 'Answer to Job' he has the temerity to psychoanalise Him. . .The reuslts are provocative.Jung reasons that God was a schmuck towards Job (and by extension to all innocents who suffer from 'acts of God') due to His not being fully conscious. A strange theory since, it would seem that by definiton God is Omniscient.However God, in Jung's model, contains all opposites and paradoxes--including choosing not to consult Himself. Had He done so, He could have seen that Job would have been faithfull to the end and not needed to take Satan's &quot;bet&quot;.The devil is still able to waltz into heaven in the book of Job and complain about how rotten mankind is.Unconsciousness accounts why God allows evil, why He breaks His own covenant and commandments, and why throughout The Old Testament accounts in His dealings with Israel He often resembles a petulant child given to fits of rage towards his pet hamster.In short, why the Jews were right to &quot;fear&quot; Him, big time.In the end of, God pulls out all the stops and counters Job's anguished pleadings for an answer to his misery with a 'might makes right' speech; while all poor Job can do is declare that he knows that his 'Advocate' lives, and then shut up.Job is the moral winner while the seed of doubt is implanted in God that He's not exactly playing cricket, and His desire to Know culminates in the 'tour the force' (Jung's words) of The Incarnation.Jesus (the Advocate) now had to be born so that God could experience how we poor slobs muddle through down here.Christ's mission therefore is not only to save humanity, but also God from His worse half.On the cross, when God shouts to God: 'Why have you forsaken me?' He's finally made the grade.The union of God and Man.Four stars only due to Jung's heavy prose and his peppering his paragraphs with untranslated Greek--At first the book seems like a joke (perhaps it is but is it a joke or a Joke?) but going from syllogism to syllogism Jung does builds a powerful if disturbing thesis.Despite his protestations that this is a work of psychology, inevitably 'Answer to Job' becomes a fascinating and bizarre work of theology."},{"Title":"Burst of Flavor: The Fine Art of Cooking With Spices (Latitude 20 Books)","review":"Chef Cooray could have taught me a few things when I was cooking at the White House and Camp David!

The idea was to use Java and Oracle 8i's object-relational features, specifically to take advantage of performance improvements and generally to get the advantages of object oriented design. I had reached the point of implementing Oracle's CustomDatum interface when I got this book. I was initially disappointed when I opened the book and found it discussed on the last eleven pages of the section on Object-Relational SQL. But then I read the Introduction, the first chapter, and on and on....It's immediately obvious Mr. Bales is familiar with actual process of developing real applications. He has presented this complex and complicated subject in a direct and pleasant manner for advanced programmers. Relatively new to Java but very familiar with Oracle, I found his organization of the material very helpful - and the sections on Relational SQL and Object-Relational SQL based on sound knowledge and experience. Mr. Bales includes a final Section on Essentials where he discusses transactions and locking, performance and trouble shooting - all very practical and extremely useful if you are developing serious applications. And yes, those last eleven pages were very helpful.I have not found a book that addresses using Oracle JDBC in application development directly, and have found few books that address database application development very well - but this book does both. One small thing I thought was missing were guidelines for using weakly typed object SQL vice strongly typed - in other areas good advice was offered.Before I bought this book, I used Oracle's documentation at otn.oracle.com. This required a file of bookmarks, several large block diagrams, lots of notes and much patience. It's much better to start with this book - and get a well-organized and coherent view along with practical advice and examples, before wading into Oracle's extensive documentation.Larry JohnsonKeepItSimpleEngineering,Inc. (...)"},{"Title":"Java Programming with Oracle JDBC","review":"An excellent coverage of Oracle's implementation of JDBC, this book beats your expectationsMeet the middle ground where the strengths of Java and Oracle work in synergy - the JDBC. Whether making simple database connections or using the Oracle 8i's sophisticated object-relational features, the authors peel the onion very well with detailed information and cleverly written examples. After a brief overview of JDBC, several different types of database clients are discussed in detail - the applets, the Servlets, the Server side internal drivers and those managed by J2EE using JNDI and connection pooling.A whole section is dedicated to modes of interaction between Java programs and the JDBC API such as using cursors, submitting prepared statements and ResultSet manipulation. A great deal of good advice is offered to help you choose between the options. The chapter on Object-Relational SQL covers broad ground on both Weakly Typed Object SQL and Strongly Typed Object SQL.Enterprise essentials such as Security, locking, transaction management supports for data encryption and SSL issues, performance tuning and testing strategies - are addressed in detail. This book is treasure trove if newer feats of Oracle are of Interest to you. I found immediate application for features such as creating object tables and column objects based on user-defined data types, support for really big streaming data types such as BFILEs and LONG RAW and batch processing for my project.Overall, this book has everything you need to learn, know and master in order to leverage the essential two great technologies - JDBC and Oracle.

However, the book is fairly out of date, and much of the performance tuning suggestions he makes don't really apply as much when using the latest Oracle JDBC drivers and Oracle9 database. This book covers Oracle 8.1.6, and a lot of changes have been made between that release and 8.1.7 and Oracle9.I recommend the newer &quot;Oracle 9i JDBC Programming&quot; book by Jason Price for much more current coverage of this topic."},{"Title":"Java Programming with Oracle JDBC","review":"In general, I liked this book. It is what you would expect from O'Reilly. Detailed enough, but not wordy. Very practical, yet not simplistic. The book addresses most of the issues that real-life developers face every day.It covers establishing database connection in sufficient details, all basic SQL commands and the best practices on using them. Highlights the differences between Statement, PreparedStatement, and CallableStatement and zooms in on Oracle way of implementing them.Shows quite a few little &quot;cotchas&quot; that are not easy to spot on your own.I didn't find chapters on object-relational SQL very useful, but I guess that the book should have had that for completeness of coverage.Also, I'd like to argue with author's performance tests. The author used INSERT statement for tests, but it is SELECT statement that incurres additional overhead of metadata passing. If the author used SELECT statements when comparing performance of Statement vs. PreparedStatement, he would probably found PreparedStatement perform better. Also his tests assume single user database connection. If there are many (like hundreds) of open database connections, PreparedStatement will scale better because of database-side caching. Especially if you can use Oracle MTS.But this is really not that important, the book is not about JDBC performance tuning.I also totally agree with the statement that the author keeps repeating throughout the book: &quot;Use the set-oriented nature of SQL to its fullest&quot;. That's the best single pefrormance improvement that one can do to JDBC-related code.I highly recommend this book to everyone who is working with Oracle JDBC.

Choosing a specific database allows a lot more detail. Other JDBC books may skip database-dependent parts of the API; this book even gives code examples for the hard stuff. It is slow to read end-to-end, but &quot;dipping&quot; works well - there's almost always a helpful code example nearby.There are problems, though. The author is obviously very familiar with Oracle, but lacks the experience to make comparisons with other products, this book won't help you choose when to use Oracle or whan another system might be more appropriate. Also I noticed other signs of lack of research - he sometimes gets abbreviations wrong, and the Java code is not particularly well-written.The big problem for me is that the book assumes you only ever use Oracle. There is no consideration of code portability, it offers no wisdom about avoiding or encapsulating proprietary Oracle-specific extensions. The techniques in this book could easily lock your product into Oracle, worse, they might even lock your product into a specific version of Oracle.The book has minor discussion of extra features in Oracle8i and Oracle9i, but nothing about JDBC 3. It's less helpful if you are using a version older than 8.1.6, too.If you (or your management) have already sold your soul to Oracle, get this book. If you might need to use other databases, get a more generic book, but keep this one for those times when only a specific Oracle feature will do the trick."},{"Title":"Java Programming with Oracle JDBC","review":"Finally a book that spoon feeds me JDBC!!

It's obvious the author thought these through and tested them.The only drawback (and it's covered by the author in the preface) is that examples and pathing presume a Windows platform -- in spite of his preference for Unix.

This book is a part of the reinstatement of women's place in art history, as well as fiber/needle arts.I say it is fascinating because I am very interested in how people lived and created art, throughout time. And it is of interest because it tells what happened to a beautiful art form and how it became devalued by a mostly male-controlled art world, except in certain settings.There are other books to read about the subject, that will round out the appreciation of needle arts, including \\"Embroidered Textiles\\" by Sheila Paine.

There is not enough information about each major town in terms of how to find hotels, or restaurants of various prices. Also, there is far too little information on the Western Sahara, if you are planning to visit there (not that I know of a guide book yet that IS sufficient in this regard).

My favorite stories were the title story, &quot;Mr. Irony&quot; and &quot;Wayne's Fate,&quot; but the story &quot;Texas&quot; actually inspired me to write something of my own along the lines he set out. A must-read for any fiction writer as well as any reader who appreciates formal and linguistic play."},{"Title":"Typical: Short Stories","review":"I bought this book because I heard The Winnowing of Mrs. Schuping on Selected Shorts and loved it... the other stories are funny and witty... however Mrs Shuping is a true delight."},{"Title":"Typical: Short Stories","review":"In every cheesy horror or sci-fi movie involving aliens or demons or pod people, there's the almost-obligatory scene where the hero(ine), having successfully slain the last(?) of the evil critters, falls into the arms of his or her sidekick/romantic interest/significant other, only to come to the sickening realization that the person they are embracing has been taken over by the forces of darkness. The music crescendos in ominous cacophony; the camera zooms in as the horrifying realization dawns across the protagonist's face ....As I read this collection of stories, the third book by Padgett Powell, I experienced that exact same sinking feeling. Here's an author whose first novel, \\"Edisto\\", was one of the most enchanting books I had read in 1984, the year it was published. So when I came across this collection in the second-hand book store, buying it seemed like a no-brainer. Caveat lector! As it says in those indigestible mutual fund prospectuses that clog my mailbox daily, \\"past success is no guarantee of future performance\\".In this case, the warning signals were loud and clear. Had I just taken the time to do a little skimming in the store, I would have surely seen the warning signs. \\"Stories\\" with titles like \\"Mr. Irony Renounces Irony\\", \\"Dr. Ordinary\\", \\"General Rancidity\\", \\"Mr. Nefarious\\", \\"Miss Resignation\\". These sound like homework assignments from a graduate writing workshop in hell, and that's pretty much the way they read as well. Mr. Powell apparently thinks this kind of thing may be passed off as writing:\\"Dr. Ordinary found solace in nothing. He found his shoes untied during surgery. He found his mother once, when she was in her sixties, naked in the bathtub calling for a fresh martini. He found bluebirds too far south. He found pies too sweet to eat. He found God with no difficulty, but locating his belief another matter. \\"And so on, for a total of three wretched pages, and sixty repetitions of the phrase \\"He found..\\". If this kind of thing strikes you as insufferable, you are unlikely to find \\"General Rancidity\\", which is just more of the same with the verb \`run' instead of the verb \`find', any better.It gets worse. Four of the \`stories' are named for states: Kansas, Texas, South Carolina and Florida. Here is the first 30% or so of \`Texas':\\"I fell off the lightning rod. I entered the sweepstakes. I lost control. I became beautiful. I charmed a queen. I defied gravity. I moved mountains. I bowled. I wept, mourned, moped, and sped about town in a convertible, progressively irascing the gendarme until I was charged with exhibitionist speed.\\"Progressively irascing the gendarme? What a crock!My feelings about this toxic insult to the intelligence may be summed up as follows:Dr. Giltinan found this book to be worthless dreck.Or, if you prefer:I wanted my money back."},{"Title":"The Aquarian Conspiracy: Personal and Social Transformation in the 1980's","review":"Originally published in 1980, this tome is a celebration of new ways of thinking about vocation, spirituality, and society in general. It is similar to Roszak's &quot;Making of a Counter- Culture&quot; in that it takes a broadly-defined movement and claims to present its principles and possibilities. Not fluff, and full of quotes and examples, but not too dry to be interesting.Ferguson's idea was that the children of the '60's would introduce new ways of relating to different issues, challenging the old heirarchies of work, church, and home life. This would come about as the result of a kind of accidental conspiracy - different people in different walks of life individually pursuing the same philosophies. The result would be a new age defined by 'Transpersonal philosophy' and 'holism'.While there have indeed been many social changes in the past 20 years none of them are historically revolutionary, and the old heirarchies remain, together with some new ones! I'd also say there's been an aggressive counter - counter-cultural movement! Not a work of prophecy, maybe, but a book with its finger on the pulse of something that is still alive."},{"Title":"The Aquarian Conspiracy: Personal and Social Transformation in the 1980's","review":"A quick word about the effects of the title to this fine book before the review. As can be seen by a few negative reviews amongst the mostly glowing ones, the title is misleading and there is no \\"conspiracy\\" within the pages of this most uplifting and informing book.For those folks preoccupied with discovering where the devil lurks instead of seeking knowledge of God and truth, you will be disappointed because the devil ain't here. You would be well informed to ignore the title and dive in to the content.If your concern for life is such that you seek answers to some of the most confounding problems facing humanity, however, you will be delighted. No offense to Ms Ferguson or her publisher, but the title was poorly chosen and does not fit the beautiful content, but that's water under the bridge now. The assessment of the human condition along with the positive answers for unification of the human family with the rest of life is inspiring!That said, this beautiful book exploded on the scene in 1980 and described where humanity was at in it's perception of reality, social structure, economics, politics and environment. It also clearly delineated where we should be headed for a more inclusive, rewarding and healthy future and almost every chapter concludes with a comparison list to show where a \\"Paradigm Shift\\" or change, is needed in our collective perception of reality on a broad range of topics.The information and resources are as relevant today as when the book was first published- only more urgent because a good number of the changes needed then have not occurred and time marches on waiting for no one. Written as a \\"Why\\" and \\"How-to\\" guide for personal and societal transformation, it has an appendix full of network groups that offer guidance for change- all that list needs now is e-mail and website updates not available in 1980.To point out the relevancy of this work in today's world, we can take a look at a subject heading: \\"The Way Of Avoidance\\" (p 74). Consider all of the big ticket issues that are intentionally being swept aside and ignored by society and government alike such as global warming, population pressure, pollution, disparity of wealth, etc., and we have:\\"At the level of ordinary consciousness, we deny pain and paradox. We doctor them with Valium, dull them with alcohol, or distract them with television. Denial is a way of life. More accurately, it is a way of diminishing life, of making it seem more manageable. Denial is the alternative to transformation.\\"\\"Personal denial, mutual denial, collective denial. Denial of facts and feelings. Denial of experience, a deliberate forgetting what we see and hear. Denial of our capacities. Politicians deny problems, parents deny their vulnerability, teachers deny their biases, children deny their intentions. Most of all, we deny what we know in our bones.\\"\\"We are caught between two different evolutionary mechanisms: denial and transformation.\\" And this is the essence of this fine book: to point out the current states of denial and to offer realistic, immediate alternatives for a positive transformation to an existence that we would rather have and can obtain with a little effort.This book is a predecessor and now a fine companion to Duane Elgin's books, \\"Awakening Earth\\" \\"Voluntary Simplicity\\" and \\"Promise Ahead\\" where the need for \\"Paradigm Shifts\\" in thinking and relating to our world are expertly and thoroughly expounded upon. I also recommend Theodore Roszak's, \\"The Voice of the Earth\\". These are potent books with immediate, practical answers to uplift humanity."},{"Title":"The Aquarian Conspiracy: Personal and Social Transformation in the 1980's","review":"This isn't a real review, I just wanted to respond to those zany reviews below which claim the symbol on the cover is a disguised 666. Actually, if you look up an introduction to the mathematical field of \\"knot theory\\" (a branch of topology) online, you'll find that it's a picture of the simplest non-trivial knot, known as the \\"trefoil knot\\" (the only simpler knot is the trivial case of the 'unknot', which is just an unknotted loop). Do an internet search using the terms \\"trefoil knot\\" and you'll see what I'm talking about (but maybe topologists are in league with Satan too, just like evolutionary biologists, geologists, astrophysicists, and other no-goods). The mathematically-inclined artist M.C. Escher drew a nicely rendered picture of three trefoil knots in 1965, titled \\"Knots\\" (the original Dutch title was 'Knopen'); the one on the cover of Aquarian Conspiracy looks a bit like a ripoff of Escher's version (which you can see at britton.disted.camosun.bc.ca/escher/knots.jpg ).Oh yeah, and don't listen to anything Ferguson says on the subject of science, it's pretty much all nonsense.

I recommend it highly to anyone just starting their search."},{"Title":"The Aquarian Conspiracy: Personal and Social Transformation in the 1980's","review":"The Aquarian Conspiracy is an excellent read! Why didn't I give it 5 stars?! Well, because I was disconcerted by the mention of LSD trips in this book. Other than that, this book is excellent learning material and a great way to expand your consciousness. I appreciate this book because it focuses on the idea of paradigm shifts and not on cults or large humanitarian movements. The Aquarian Conspiracy emphasizes that people need to shift their essential train of thought before any large social movement can be successful. In other words, if a society embarks on any given worldwide humanitarian movement but still works into the plan its old prejudices, then the movement will surely fail and the people that were supposed to be helped become the victims of that given movement.The Aquarian Conspiracy exemplifies how a paradigm shift can be used to ease the tension that is inherent in several of our societies main institutions such as education, health care, politics, religion, careers, and marriage. The reader is warned several times that a personal paradigm shift will likely disrupt their lives. This shift may result in a major career change and a divorce. But the book also encourages the reader to move past this personal loss and realize that this pain is necessary for achieving self-actualization or better yet, SELF-LOVE!"},{"Title":"The Aquarian Conspiracy: Personal and Social Transformation in the 1980's","review":"I purchased this book as a gift for a retired college professor friend.

It is comprehensive, well-written, and full of fascinating real-life details and stories. I wish it had contained more biographical information about its author, Marilyn Feguson, however.

It claimed that there was a grass roots movement that was going to change society in what I would call a very new agey liberal type way but on the other hand a few times in this book it hails \\"captains of industry and finance, foundation officials and university programmers, tv producers and scions of old American wealth\\" as being a driving force behind this \\"grass roots\\" movement. Sounds like social engineering from the highest levels of society to me.These types that adopt many of these ideas are what the Communists called \\"useful idiots\\" The type of people that would champion this book and the ideas in it are the types that love (from their armchair or as a detached fashionable accessory of course) globalism, Obama, pseudo environmentalism, new age religions and ideas, they love the idea of multi-culturalism and the global village, but yet they are the most isolated of white people.

The condiction of the book was good. The price was right"},{"Title":"The Aquarian Conspiracy: Personal and Social Transformation in the 1980's","review":"What can be said about this books that hasn't been said in the many already existing reviews?This book succeeds in explaining a 'third path' in the human evolution. Not the path of organized religion, nor the path of objective science; Both have proven worthless through the course of history. Instead what Fergurson suggests is the path of integrating Eastern philosophy with the discovery of quantum physics. The parallel of Eastern philosophy, more accurately Vedanta, to quantum mechanics is not necessarily a new discovery, but Fergurson manages to put words and meaning behind the connection that for so long has been nothing more than a novel notion.What personally struck me as rewarding with the book was the description of the stages an individual goes through when being transformed according to quantum spirituality (my choice of denominator). Having studied, in detail, accounts of such transformation, Fergurson manages to put the levels or stages of transformation into a handy check-list.What more, a chapter dealing with the research into memory is especially enlightening. And as the aforementioned issues, Fergurson manages to make a valid and strong argument for an holistic approach, to medicine, economy, vocation and philosophy. What I had always seen as a mere notion or intuition, is now grounded with words and empiric evidence. Also, it should be said, Fergurson claims, quite fairly, that that very feeling, intuition, should play a much more vital role in our \\"transformation\\". Why do we ignore our own true understanding and wait for science to explain reality to us, when we have all the tools necessary to get All the answers.One small drawback should be noted: Fergurson is a little bit cocksure in her description of this massive transformation; There really isn't any evidence for this transformation happening any time soon. Fergurson talks as if capitalism is close to being dismantled and corporate businesses are voluntarily marching out of the workplace... This is not the case. There are severe stumbling blocks to this transformation, and it could have enriched the book to hold back on the optimism, and instead face reality; We are not there, and incredible changes must be faced if we are to ever get close to this transformation in consciousness.Other than that, this book really is a must have. I can't believe I didn't read it until 2011. I have already ordered the other books by Fergurson, and am awaiting them with anticipation."},{"Title":"The Aquarian Conspiracy: Personal and Social Transformation in the 1980's","review":"Most either love it or hate it. It has been hailed as the handbook of the New Age. Most New Agers have a well thumbed copy on their shelf. Fundies decry it as the Devil's work. It is still selling in the \\"crystal dolphin\\" bookshops.There are many laudable sentiments and good intentions in this book. There are reasonable positions passionately argued for. There is even a lot of truth. However, it does suffer from a typical New Age problem. In her optimism, the author paints a very rosy picture. Although she may not say it, the impression one is left with is that one can gain enlightenment on a weekend workshop, or on an acid trip.Countless conspirators have ended up either becoming disillusioned with the pervasive New Age charlatanry, or have gone \\"off with the fairies\\" after too many unguided excursions into \\"alternative realities\\".The book is intellectually either dishonest or naive. It promotes the philosophical relativism that makes the most absurd delusions merely different \\"realities\\". It really provides the popular culture in which the Post-Modernist lunatic fringe can be given some credence. In short, it is a recipe for escapism. One need only spend some time in New Age circles to see how far they are from the superior beings they tend to believe they are.The constant invocation of Kuhn's magical mantra \\"paradigm shift\\", lulls the reader into thinking that there is something scientific about the alchemical transformation implied. She further abuses science by claiming that there are two kinds of science, old & new, linear & non-linear. She uses science to give credence to her ideas, while at the same time discrediting science as a vision of a dead mechanistic universe. Her treatment of science, apart from being hypocritical, paints a very inaccurate picture of what science is actually about.As compelling and well written as this book is, it is seriously flawed. It does point out things that we could do better, but it has helped spawn an industry of self delusion. For anyone really interested in self development or spiritual exploration, I would strongly recommend Chogyam Trungpa's \\"Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism\\" as an antidote to the less healthy aspects of the Aquarian Conspiracy.SweynThe Rune Primer"},{"Title":"The Aquarian Conspiracy: Personal and Social Transformation in the 1980's","review":"I'm only half way through this book, but I'm so excited to share it with my friends and family that I just bought some copies to give out so they don't have to wait until I'm finished.I was astounded to see that this book has 3.5 stars - then I saw the reason, the poor souls who have created a terrifying reality filled with satanic conspirators have been sharing their delusions. I think they unwittingly prove a major tenet of the Aquarians: we don't see the world as it is, we see the world as we are.Ferguson's insight into the power of networks three decades ago is particularly impressive - Twitter's role in the Iranian uprising is a clear example of this potential being used to transform the world.The title's reference to the 1980s is a lesson in itself - this is a process with no beginning and no end, and change always take longer than we want it to. That being said, we have come a long way in past three decades. Obama is our leader! He sees that in order to create a future with less violence and more love (which, BTW, is what Jesus would do) we have to be less violent and more compassionate. As Ferguson says, the Aquarians realize that there are only means, no ends. Secret prisons in which human beings are tortured are inconsistent with the ideals of our forefathers (who were certainly early Aquarians) that all men are endowed by their creator with the rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. When we act inconsistently with this ideal we are doing more to destroy our country than any terrorist ever could.If I could give this book more stars, I would - read it!"},{"Title":"The Aquarian Conspiracy: Personal and Social Transformation in the 1980's","review":"The New Age Movement and Service to the Plan organized by the Rockefeller's and the Club of Rome.The connection between Jewish Kabala /the Zohar and the religion practiced in ancient Babylon is the worship of the Baphomet.This is also the religion of the Masons i e skull and bones.The New World Order as envisioned by the Elite is hardly a recent undertaking.

Lots of white collar professionals were booted out of superfluous jobs so managemt and leadership has been shoved downward further and further.

It deifies the self while uprooting it from its proper mooring in the personal Creator and Redeemer of the universe. It is relativistic morally and unable to provide objective standards for human conduct. It denies the darkner side of human nature and opts for a utopianism of post-dated checks.The New Age has become mainstrain in many ways today. Now we have Deepak Chopra, James Redfield, and others.

Widmaier explains the basics of physiology in a practical context so that it is fairly easy to understand. This is one of the better non-fiction reads you will find, as it truly is interesting. I feel that this is a great tool for any biology student or anyone who is just curious about the way things work in an animal's body.While explaining how things work in the human body and how they could be better, plentiful examples are provided to both amuse and teach the reader. The book addresses everything from how we become obese to the relative rates of metabolism in different species to the circulatory system and stress induced hormones. Widmaier even provides notes to elaborate on things he addresses in his book and provided some bibliographical information on important scientists and their contributions to physiology without making me fall asleep or daydream, which is no small feat.After reading this book I can appreciate the work of physiologists, especially after reading the epilogue. I also learned many facts about the animal kingdom that would really make me seem smart in school and help clarify different concepts. From this book I learned that small animals such as shrews need to eat more than their body weight everyday because they have such a high metabolism, and that our ancestors developed a defense mechanism against starvation so that when they ate less their metabolism slowed, meaning that dieting can cause us to loose weight more slowly. I also read that fish cough to remove the gung that collects in their gills as it flows through the gills to provide them with oxygen. This book also showed that humans have far inferior senses that many animals because of our forebrain which is currently only found in humans and gives us the smarts to evade predators and get food among other things.Overall, this book is perfect for someone who is looking for an interesting and intellectual read.

I wish I would have had it to help me in my first nurse management role.In addition to including a review of basic management concepts and theory, the authors share their practical advice, pearls of wisdom and real-world tips learned from the School of Experience. It is as good as having a mentor. The concise, tight format makes it easy reading in short intervals, and you can readily focus in on one specific area as needed.I was impressed by the breath and depth of the topics, from age-old problems to the new emerging issues. The budgeting, staffing, legal, negotiation, and employment chapters provided essential basic tools and ideas that I could use. Chapters on the office, time, meetings, and motivating employees offered valuable new insights. I appreciated the information in areas often not covered in other management books, such as Generation X, managed care, impaired nurses, unions and overseeing renovation projects. This is the most useful nursing management book I have come across."},{"Title":"Nursing Management Secrets, 1e","review":"I love how compact this book is. It's a great Q and A book and answers many questions a new manager would have. One of the seasoned directors I worked with recommended this book and I'm glad she did!"},{"Title":"Searching for Mary: An Exploration of Marian Apparitions Across the U.S.","review":"This book is wonderful is you wish to disparage and ridicule marian apparitions; indeed, Mr. Garvey takes you on a tour of all the bogus, sad, uninspired and demented \\"appartion\\" sites in America. What he fails to do is show Church-approved, or even Church-approvable apparition sites. True, he is working in the American apparition milieu where Church-approved apparition sites are few and far between; but reading this book, one might come away with the impression that Marian Apparitions are laughable, at best. For a more counterbalanced look at the phenomena read about Fatima, a fully Church approved apparition. For the truly skeptical, I recommend \\"Encountering Mary\\" by Sandra L. Zimdars-Swartz, a remarkable book which both believers and skeptics can appreciate. However, the book in question delivers nothing but snide commentary at a phenomena which has brought countless millions to a life of greater holiness."},{"Title":"Searching for Mary: An Exploration of Marian Apparitions Across the U.S.","review":"Mark Garvey writes with real generosity of spirit about a phenomenon that is appealing yet ultimately hard to believe. He understands what people compels so many to search for Mary in late 20th-century America. His reporting is mostly even-handed and sympathetic toward those he observes--although he clearly likes some visionaries and seekers better than others. A very worthwhile read for anyone interested in the interaction of spirituality and popular culture."},{"Title":"Searching for Mary: An Exploration of Marian Apparitions Across the U.S.","review":"I give Mark Garvey credit for actually personally going to these various sites in the U.S. and observing what went on, with in some cases personal interviews with the seers themselves. Yet he saved his biggest punch for last in the last chapter when he visited Necedah, Wisconsin. I was moved by his descriptions of the torment that Mary Ann Van Hoof experienced. Otherwise, Mark Garvey is really funny and he had me laughing out loud at some of his comments. I take my hat off to this man for venturing into this field of inquiry. He has done religious people of the U.S. a service in writing this book."},{"Title":"Searching for Mary: An Exploration of Marian Apparitions Across the U.S.","review":"In elegant yet simple prose Garvey gives us a glimpse into the colorful and sometimes tragicomic world of Marian apparitions. If John Kennedy Toole had written a piece of journalistic non-fiction, it would have resembled this. A brilliant piece of Americana."},{"Title":"Searching for Mary: An Exploration of Marian Apparitions Across the U.S.","review":"This straightforward investigation into Marian sightings around the U.S. is beautifully written, offering not only a journalist's unbiased view of those who seek spirituality in this unique manner, but also a glimpse into the author's soul. Written with grace and balance, this is a great read."},{"Title":"Searching for Mary: An Exploration of Marian Apparitions Across the U.S.","review":"Garvey's book was very enjoyable and provided a vivid glimpse of a very interesting religious subculture. For the most part, I got a kick out of Garvey's humorous observations regarding his interactions with the individuals who flock to these apparition sites; however, sometimes his comments were inappropriately demeaning in my opinion. Nonetheless, I gained much from reading this book and would recommend it to others."},{"Title":"Searching for Mary: An Exploration of Marian Apparitions Across the U.S.","review":"For those curious about the explosion of reported apparitions of Mary in the U.S., this is the best introduction on the market. Author Garvey takes an honest and objective, but insightful and not unspiritual, look at the claims of visionaries and locutionists in some of the most popular (crowd-drawing) sites. A perfect template for any excursion into the ephemeral, written with conscience and style. Well worth the investment."},{"Title":"Searching for Mary: An Exploration of Marian Apparitions Across the U.S.","review":"This is more than just an account of several Marian apparition sites in the United States. It's the story of a reporter searching for his own faith in the hopes and beliefs of others. The writing is excellent, often very funny, wistful at times, but never sarcastic or small-minded. I was riveted from start to finish.Would love to read the same author's impressions of the major, \\"Church-approved\\" apparition sites at Guadalupe, Lourdes, Fatima, La Salette, etc."},{"Title":"QUEST OF QUI","review":"As a fan of Doc Savage, I consider myself fortunate to have collected all of the Bantam Paperback reprints of the original 181 Doc Savage Magazines. Written by Lester Dent, under the pen name of Kenneth Robeson, the pulp magazine was published as a monthly beginning in 1933 to 1949. (For the last few years it was a quarterly.) In 1964, Bantam began their series of paperbacks, which ran for 26 years. As time allows, I will give brief descriptions/reviews of the entire series. \\"Quest of Qui,\\" number 12 in the series, is one of the very best Doc Savage adventures. From the moment it begins with the discovery of a Viking ship off the coast of Long Island, until the last 11 paragraphs of this book, there is nothing but rip-roaring adventure and action. Because there are so many plot twists, mysteries, and surprises, much additional detail would be described as \\"spoilers.\\" Suffice it to say that this high-tension tale takes our heroes from Manhattan to the frozen wasteland of Labrador. One by one, each of the Savage crew is waylaid and put into dire straights of death. (Each except \\"Long Tom,\\" who is not along for this adventure.) In between the bullets, the spears, the knife-play, author Robeson/Dent manages to insert a political statement at this time of 1935 when the United States was considering a separatist movement as winds of war and mighty change were brewing in Europe: \\"The small chaps concluded they would be better off if they kept to themselves and did not let the outer world know they were here. That, you know, is not an uncommon attitude around primitive people.\\" There's mystery a-plenty, all rationally explained, in this high-speed tale. If you're looking for pure escapist literature, yes literature, you will find it here."},{"Title":"The Mind within the Net: Models of Learning, Thinking, and Acting","review":"This exceptionally clear and lucid books describes with masterful clarity the recent advances in the area of theoretical modeling of the human brain using artificial neural networks. It not only introduces a subject which normally requires a considerable amount of mathematics very clearly, but also explores the consequences on such modeling on our everyday's life with great clarity. Other books with less mathematics and more \\"philosophy\\" are also not so easy to read, but this one stands out for its clarity. Admittedly the level is introductory, as fine details are not covered, but it makes you feel that you must immediately start to go deeper on these subjects, as it is written in a very engaging style. Reading this book is a great intellectual pleasure."},{"Title":"The Mind within the Net: Models of Learning, Thinking, and Acting","review":"Even though I'm not a neuroscientist or neural computing expert, I found this book to be an excellent discussion of neural networks and how they seem to at least provide models for (and may actually be the primary mechanism of) brain function.In the book's three sections (&quot;Basics&quot;, &quot;Principles&quot;, and &quot;Applications&quot;), Spitzer's lucid writing describes neural networks, current concepts in learning, how cortical organization relates to networks, and many specific examples which describe how research is illuminating the challenging topic of how the mind works.His illustrations complement the text perfectly, he cites references as needed, he provides a glossary of the terms he uses, and his index provides quick access for review.This book has been a pleasure to read, and I hope the author updates it as research progresses."},{"Title":"The Mind within the Net: Models of Learning, Thinking, and Acting","review":"Nearly every publication that touches computational neuroscience is saturated with mathematics. Spitzer accurately depicts the defining characteristics of neurons, and presents abstract network models with very little emphasis on the mathematical theory that other authors believe is necessary to describe neural networks.It's refreshing to experience a book that describes complex, technical issues, but reads more like an entertaining story."},{"Title":"The Mind within the Net: Models of Learning, Thinking, and Acting","review":"Besides grammatical mistakes and obvious errors in translation, the book doesn't delve deep into the places it promises, and concentrates on analogies that play to the lay-est of laymen rather than focusing on the actual data and theories of neural networks. Chapters on neuroplasticity and feedback are worthwhile, but the book quickly derails onto a scene of neuroscientific generalism, which seems to be the popular fad among most brain books today, which seem to pass around the same cache of information on L-Dopa, homunculi, and Aplysia to take up a good 25% of 75% of the books in print. Good for an introduction to neural nets and semantic networks, but not a valuable reference."},{"Title":"The Mind within the Net: Models of Learning, Thinking, and Acting","review":"As a psychiatrist who is concerned about reconciling psychoanalytic and neurophysiologic perspectives, this book provides a substantial foundation to this endeavor. I find the book notably helpful in teaching analytic and psychodynamic approaches to new psychiatrists. It begins to suggest a new discourse through which clinical practice may be described. I am thankful that we have this book and look forward to more work by Manfred Spitzer."},{"Title":"The Mind within the Net: Models of Learning, Thinking, and Acting","review":"I cannot recall a book that succeeds quite as well as this one in accomplishing what the author set out to do. Manfred Spitzer manages to combine a lucid treatment of the workings of neural nets and of the brain. What emerges is a remarkable story that provides an extradorinary perspective on learning and acting. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The Mind within the Net: Models of Learning, Thinking, and Acting","review":"This is one of those precious books I love for their clarity and density of real information. The author is a psychiatrist and a neuromimetic model enthusiast who tries to communicate his enthusiasm to the reader. There is no mistake when it is about things I know well (I am more into statistical learning than biology), even when the author simplifies the topic to make it understandable to the non-specialist. The figures also are neat and clear. A great book."},{"Title":"New Braunfels, Comal County, Texas: A Pictorial History","review":"Rosemary Gregory, Myra Lee Goff &amp; Roger Nuhn have given the citizens of New Braunfels (&amp; Comal County) a gift that will last through the years. It is a chronicle of a German settlement and the people who have lived here in earlier times. Lushly illustrated with over 275 photographs, illustrations, maps, and artifacts, it is an beautiful tome that invites the reader to connect with and feel part of this community. Everyone in who grew up in or lives in Comal County should have a copy."},{"Title":"The Bernard Berenson treasury;: A selection from the works, unpublished writings, letters, diaries, and journals of the most celebrated humanist and art historian of our times, 1887-1958","review":"Bernard Berenson is hardly mentioned any more but he was once very famous as an art historian and art critic. He was a Jew who converted to Roman Catholicism, not unlike Alice B. Toklas, and they knew each other as well as Gertrude Stein. He specialized in Italian Renaissance art.This book is a selection from his writings, both professional and casual, from notes, diaries and letters as well as from books and their prefaces written by him. I think the book is considered a \\"treasury\\" in that it amounts to what the editors feel are Bernard Berenson's words of wisdom. These selections come in the form of adages or pithy sayings while other merely but succinctly summarize a certain perception or feeling. The treasury of wisdom extends from 1887 to 1958. Bernard Berenson never wanted to \\"petrify\\" as he got older. He wanted to keep learning as he matured and got older. \\"To be forever learning, never to petrify -- that is what I yearn for,\\" he wrote to Mary Costelloe, his bride, in 1890. By 1958, he had done just that -- he kept on reading, writing and learning up to his last breath.\\"If you want to retain the illusion that you have something to say that has never been said before,\\" Mr. Berenson wrote on February 20, 1959, \\"don't read what others through the ages have said.\\"In 1956, he writes, \\"Nearly all (if not all) feeling and reflection is seasonal. Seasonal in the sense that it is our ages that so deeply influence and guide our reactions, our prejudices, our assumptions, the things we take for granted without discussion, and our discontent and rebellion. We all think 'young' when we feel young; we think 'sensibly' (that is to say conventionally) when middle-aged; and disapprovingly, even despairingly, as our age increases. . . .\\"Can anyone disagree?The book contains a brief 6-page introduction by John Walker and eight sepia-toned illustrations from photographs of Bernard Berenson during different stages of his life. There is also a three-page Preface written by Nicky Mariano.\\"The music of language, the feeling for its words, its phrases are almost as confined to those grown up with it as the cookery of a region to those whose childhood and youth it has nourished. Seldom can the outsider feel either, and perhaps it is not worth while that he should as the native does.\\" (undated) page 184."},{"Title":"Reelin' and Rockin': The Golden Age of American Rock 'N Roll 1956-1959 (Rock & Roll Reference Series)","review":"This is a giant of a book, in terms of information. But, more importantly, it really gives you a feeling of being there when these seminal events in the history of rock &amp; roll were unfolding. You won't go wrong getting this book; it's great! You can tell the binding, paper, etc is quality, too."},{"Title":"Heart of the Hunter","review":"HEART OF THE HUNTER is the first book of the Hunter brothers saga. Here we meet the youngest and most serious of the four brothers, Reid Hunter whose on a mission to protect a beautiful doctor from a bioterrorist organization named Black Dawn. This story is an action-packed race against time. You'll love Reid and what's even better is that it doesn't end here. In HUNTER'S WOMAN, we meet Ty Hunter, the trickster. In HUNTER'S PRIDE, we meet Devon Hunter, the ladies' man. And in the soon to be released UNTAMED HUNTER, we meet the eldest and the most deadly of the Hunter brothers, Shep Hunter.Each book takes us further into the world of Morgan's (MORGAN'S WIFE, MORGAN'S SON, MORGAN'S RESCUE) mercenaries. This is a fantastic saga that will entice you and keep you begging for more.

There were so many mistakes in this book it was ridiculous. I enjoyed the story enough to continue reading, but it really was annoying and disappointing. Someone should pull the current copies off the shelves and do another revision."},{"Title":"Raphael (The Great masters of drawing)","review":"I bought this marvellous book through Amazon nearly 8 years ago and in all that time not one review! What's gone wrong? Surely ART is still taught in schools and there's still interest in beauty - especially feminine beauty? If this is so it's inevitable students will eventually discover the highest standards of Art, Architecture and Portraiture were established in a 100 year period in one small town ( Florence) and this era was called \\"The Renaissance\\".From there on it's a matter of deciding which of the Big 3 artists was the greatest natural born genius. After getting all excited about the size of the Sistine ceiling and finding Leonardo only created about 10 paintings it doesn't take long to discover Raphael wins by a street. From the beginning to the very early end of his life everything that flowed from his paintbrush has an unbelievable level of perfection. Too perfect it seems for those looking for angst and naked emotion speaking to them from a canvas. (In every large art gallery the largest crowd is always gathered around a Van Gogh)Raphael's images on the other hand look so simple and uncomplicated. The reverse is true - what you see is the Art of disguising Art. Until much later in his career it never occured to him to create tortuous compositions using extreme movement and dramatic lighting. Just one continuous series of beautiful life-affirming renditions of the kind of subject matter his patrons commissioned. The lucky part being Madonnas were in such great demand he needed to find endless variations of the \\"Madonna and Child\\" theme. In the first part of this book you get just about all of them perfectly reproduced in a large format. And what makes this Raphael book better than any other is wherever possible the Italian author inserts all Raphael's preparatory sketches.It's here the truth about what makes an artist GREAT emerges. The Florentines were all fantastic draftsmen. If the end product looks easy it's because all the hard work was done earlier - trying out every alternative solution until the final image is established. As Raphael's fame spread demand for his genius came from all sides and it was never in doubt he'd end up in the Vatican where his rivalry with Michaelangelo came to the surface. Very few art experts disagree that by sticking by his own convictions harmony was prefable to discord his contibution to the \\"Stanza della Segnatura\\" is one of the great landmarks in humanist art. Again this book reproduces every panel at large scale together with all the drawing Raphael considered necessary to make this room his masterpeice.The rest, as they say is history. This book contains over 300 large very accurate illustrations nearly all in colour. You'll never find a better monograph devoted to the Prince of all Painters."},{"Title":"Falsely Accused","review":"Having eagerly devoured the previous Butch Karp/Marlene Ciampi novels, I was disappointed with the last one, Corruption of Blood, which dealt with the Kennedy assassination. But luckily Falsely Accused is right back on track, with our heroes in New York again. Although Butch is working for a firm of civil lawyers and Marlene is striking out on a new and different career, their cases lead them to dealings with the DA's department and the infamous DA himself, Sandy Bloom. Will Karp get revenge at last for Bloom's treatment of himself and Marlene?The plot develops satisfyingly, with Karp's and Marlene's separate cases meshing, as they so often do, to enable a joint (if not wholly plausible) resolution. But hey, who's counting!It's not just the plotting which I find so enchanting about these books. The characterisation is fine, with the good guys being reassuringly flawed - even the rather goody-goody Butch is rounding out as the series develops. Lucy is perhaps less well-drawn, being by turns baby-ish for a 7-year old and then stunningly precocious.Most of all, I enjoy the style, the quality of the writing itself. Tanenbaum has a great ear for dialogue, for the way people switch topics in mid-conversation; his characters talk like real people, only more amusingly. Altogether, he has a delightful way with words, being at times wry, whimsical and ironic. I find myself jotting down some of his wittier phrases to use, er, spontaneously myself in conversation... Sincerest form of flattery, and all that!I'm glad I've read the series in order, and if someone was thinking of starting with this book I'd recommend them to go back to the beginning. Maybe skip out Corruption of Blood unless you're really keen to read more Kennedy assassination theories - and enjoy Falsely Accused, which finds Tanenbaum once more at the height of his powers."},{"Title":"Falsely Accused","review":"This book has EVERYTHING for the mystery lover - interwoven plots, snappy dialogue, narrative flow, memorable characters and a great ending, consistent with the story lines. I had never read Tanenbaum, but found the book at a rummage sale. He moved me right into his fictional world with the first page."},{"Title":"Falsely Accused","review":"The first half of this book is kind of slow going until the three separate story lines start coming together. The second half zips along pretty good. I agree with one of the other reviewers...I was surprised and a little dismayed in the part that seven year old Lucy played in the end. Leaves a person with a lot to think about."},{"Title":"Falsely Accused","review":"Kirkus Reviews: &quot;blistering novel electrifying page turner&quot;Butch Karp has left the Manhattan D.A's office, but not the legal hot-seat, as this blistering novel of endless Big Apple corruption and coverups makes abundantly clear.Butch's client - a client he takes on over the howls of his firm's colleagues, who prefer to hold their star litigator over the heads of their own handpicked enemies - is ex-Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Murray Selig, tossed out of office on trumped-up charges so risible that the Mayor and D.A. Sanford Bloom have to have somehting else in mid - something pretty dire. While Karp is gathering the ammunition to destroy the D.A.'s defense witnesses, his wife, Marlene Ciampi, also on the lam from the D.A.'s office, is fighting off her pushy friend, high-flying reporter Ariadne Shipenagel - busy working on a story of the shakedown of three New York cabbies who fortuitiously died in police custody - long enough to set up her own agency serving women who need help enforcing protective legal orders against strangers or sadists or former lovewrs who are stalking them. Ciampi's highly effective vigilante tactics - heaven help the stalker she gets her teeth into - give Tanebaum's a shot of welcome humor to counterbalance Ciampi's involvement with Isabelle and Hector, a pair of wary regugee kids somebody has dumped at tough Mattie Dusan's Women's Shelter. Amazingly, Tanenbaum manages to pull all four cases together - Selig's civil suit against the Mayor and the D.A., Stupenagel's investigation of the police shaekdown, Ciampi's anti-stalking campaign and the sorry tale of Isabella an Hector - and even finds a surprising new role for Karp and Ciampi's precocious seven-year old daugther Lucy.After tossing Karp into the treacherous deeps of the Kennedy assassination (CORRUPTION OF BLOOD, 1995) Tanenbaum proves that his meticulous homework on questions of legal procedure and the best Chinese restaurant for an off-the-record conversation can turn the most preposterous conspiracy of his own into an electrifying page-turner."},{"Title":"Falsely Accused","review":"Well! I found his story telling excellent and his use of language the same. I had no trouble with the ending, although I knew immediately whom not to trust - and it wasn't one of the children. My confusion lies in having looked up the author on the good ol' internet and finding he has a ghost writer, his cousin. I have no way to prove or disprove that allegation and was hoping someone on this forum could add some intelligence.TIA"},{"Title":"Falsely Accused","review":"This is one of the best books in the Kaep/Ciampi series. The writer stays with two major scenarios and is able to skillfully intertwine numerous others that add to a well told story. The book has the tedency to drag slightly, although thses instances are few and far between. Perhaps the greatest area of weakness comes in the inability of the writer to develop characters that are realistic. Although he draws upon his legal knowledge to create a Karp who is believable, the same cannot be said about Ciampi who appears to be a cardboard cutoutof a character. In spite of these flaws, the book moves along at agood pace with some twists that are of interest, even if they are somewhat predictable."},{"Title":"Falsely Accused","review":"Followers of Tanenbaum's intelligent 1970/80's-set series (Corruption of Blood etc.) featuring married lawyers, Butch Karp and Marlene Ciampi will find that the author's punchy style perfectly suits his latest three-ring crime spectacle. Tanenbaum's talent is large, and so are his characters. These assets, along with a shot of genuine compassion for the troubles of children, enable him to just pull this one off. If readers won't quite believe the shockingly unconventional resulution, they'll still be affected by it, leaving them eager to know where this heroic family of crimefighters goes from here"},{"Title":"Falsely Accused","review":"Robert Tanenbaum writes another great read.

Tanenbaum is just a great author! This guy wants to meet him in person!"},{"Title":"Falsely Accused","review":"We have had Tanenbaum on our \\"to read\\" list for several years, and finally glommed onto \\"Falsely Accused\\", number 8 in his Butch Karp (and wife Marlene Ciampi) series which approaches nearly 24 books now. Both protagonists are ex-assistant DA's (indeed, the author's own real \\"day job\\") with a lot of legal experience. Marlene is mostly a stay at home mom now, raising 7-year-old Lucy, with another \\"in the oven\\"; and Butch is now the only trial lawyer in a high flying private law firm at which he makes boatloads of money.Karp picks up a case involving a famous Chief Medical Examiner who has been obviously wrongfully discharged and defamed in the process. The question becomes \\"why\\", which is about the only interesting part of this section of the novel. Meanwhile, Marlene decides to open a detective agency with an ex-cop to help women who have been battered by the men in their lives and who need further help, including, apparently, legal or illegal assistance in resolving their cases. While this sets up some interesting dialogue between our married couple re the ethics of such causes, it did little to endear that part of the plot to us either. The novel eventually gets suspenseful when (as often happens when two stories rotate throughout a book) the couple's cases start to merge, but the getting there is slow and the ending fairly predictable.We found the author's writing fine enough, but had trouble getting excited about the plot or the two main characters. Much of the book was boring, and our sticking to it was only rewarded late in the proceedings. While the author must have a huge following to have a two-dozen book bibliography, we were probably not sufficiently motivated to try another.

We found we were waiting for the suspense as the title would suggest. We found it rambling on at times and hard to pick up. Maybe we have to read the previous Karp/Ciampi series and it would let us to get to know the characters better instead of just jumping in like the middle of a movie and try to guess who is who. The title and brief summary captured our attention then we felt let down by the end."},{"Title":"Staying at Daisy's","review":"Staying at Daisy's, by Jill Mansell, is an enjoyable and fun piece of fiction. Like many of Mansell's other books, Staying at Daisy's pulls readers right into an idyllic piece of English country life. Daisy may have the same problems of the heart as most other heroines in this type of book, but she likes her job, running a hotel, and is very good at it. Even if there is an impossibly handsome and wealthy man--former rugby player Dev--as the object of Daisy's affection, the rest of the book manages to avoid clich&eacute; by including many refreshing nods to reality--like how frustrating it is when repairmen don't repair things.One thing I especially liked about this book was the way it alternated between so many characters' points of view. The book has subplots galore, so in some ways reading it is like watching a (good) soap opera: there's a lot going on and it's never boring. While Daisy gets the slight majority of the narrative, it's fun to get in the heads of other characters like Tara, the best friend, and Maggie, Tara's aunt. Tara is a bit of a mess, but that may make readers sympathize with her romantic problems all the more. Maggie is somewhat older than the typical romantic heroine, but that doesn't mean that she shouldn't have a happy ending as well. Her escapades, which involve a broken washing machine, are highlights of the book. There's also a sweet love story about a young man named Barney, who has a mysterious connection to Daisy.In addition, it's nice to read about characters who can be friends with benefits and don't suffer any ill consequences. While nearly every character wants to find love, the book makes it plain that doing so is far from the easiest thing to do. Unless, that is, love has been right under their noses all along. Staying at Daisy's doesn't place any judgment on characters who settle for sex when they can't find love; instead, most of the characters have a moment of self-realization where they discover they have fallen in love, in spite of themselves."},{"Title":"Staying at Daisy's","review":"In her latest novel, Staying at Daisy's, Jill Mansell delivers another hilarious and fast-paced romantic comedy. Her combination of endearing and sympathetic lead characters placed in humorous situations wins out again.This time round, Mansell takes on marital infidelity from the point of view of Daisy MacLean, an unsuspecting wife who invariably receives an unwelcome shock. And from the point of view of Tara who is faced with an ex-boyfriend who professes undying love hours before his wedding. Mansell throws into the mix an old boyfriend from university, a gorgeous sports hero, a popular children's author, and other fun and memorable characters.Fans of British chicklit are sure to find Staying at Daisy's a delightful and engrossing read!ISBN-10: 1402243847 - PaperbackPublisher: Sourcebooks Landmark; Reprint edition (March 1, 2011), 512 pages.Review copy provided by the publisher."},{"Title":"Staying at Daisy's","review":"This is one of my favorite Mansell books. I think they are brilliant. I do have to say I think Mel is a hoochie. The only thing nice she does for anyone is say thank you.

Because Daisy is wonderful."},{"Title":"Staying at Daisy's","review":"Jill Mansell is the international bestselling women's fiction author of such titles as: Taking a Chance on Me, Miranda's Big Mistake, Perfect Timing, Rumor Has It, An Offer You Can't Refuse, Millie's Fling, Falling for You, Open House, Mixed Doubles, and Thinking of You. When she's not plotting her next book, Jill enjoys gumdrops, TV, and watching the rugby players train in the field behind her house. She writes full time and resides in Bristol with her partner and children.\\"Life is easy, it's men she'll never figure out.\\" Daisy MacLean has had a rough year. Her husband died in a car accident, and Daisy discovered he was not only a liar, but cheated on her as well. Finally at a stage where she could move past the betrayal, she focuses on her job-- managing a popular hotel owned by her quirky and eccentric father. And the guests are just as crazy. But when cocky sports hero Dev Tyzack books a reservation, Daisy's inner alarm goes off to steer clear. Dev may be as sexy as they come, but he's also arrogant, sarcastic, and seems to get his jollies on poking fun at her. Except some people aren't always who they seem to be, and Dev is the one guest that Daisy can't bear to see leave.Though a very recognizable name, this is my first book by this author, but it won't be the last. It's been awhile since I read a book by a British author, so it took me a bit to acclimate to the jargon, but oh-- how I missed that dry, sarcastic humor! The other notable and lovable attribute to British authors is the reader is not only in the main character's head, but every secondary character as well. It really makes for a full and enjoyable experience. The only fault I had for the book was after the first chapter, two and three seemed a tad slow-paced, but did not give me the desire to put it down.This book had a lot going on. I don't want to issue a spoiler alert, so I'll just say that Daisy's husband's unexpected death left way more than her discovering he was a liar and cheat. The ramifications left ripples in the storyline that carried throughout the plot and into several secondary characters. It was interesting watching how decisions and actions can affect so many people. And speaking of secondary characters-- Daisy's father, Hector, and ex-boyfriend, Josh, were downright hilarious. If ever one wished for a character to be real, this was the instance. This book was not without it's heart-breaking moments, nor it's share of humor. Recommended!Kelly MoranAuthor and ReviewerBookpleasures"},{"Title":"Staying at Daisy's","review":"My thoughts:There is a lot going on in this book, not that it becomes messy, but just that more than one person will find love at the end of this sweet book.First there is Daisy who runs the hotel her father owns. She used to be married to an ass and does not want anything to do with men like that anymore. She is smart, nice, but also wounded. Then there is Dev, the best man at the wedding being held there, he is all those things she does not want, but the attraction is there. Sure he is a bit of an idiot sometimes, but then you do stand up for your friends. I have to like that about him, and later on he is truly sweet.Ok the main couple out of the way. Then there is Tara, the chambermaid who is unlucky in love, and whose ex is getting married at the hotel. I did want love for her, and I truly enjoyed her HEA. Her aunt who is doing something she should not be doing. Daisy's fun dad Hector, and last Barney, a new employee who falls in love with a girl with secrets. And these all find love, one way or another.I would call this more of a drama chick-lit, there are no haha moments, instead real people try to find love, they mess up, they do stupid things, and they feel hurt. They believe lies and life goes on. It was a great cast of characters and they were all different, and I am glad how things turned out for everyone.But there was one person I did not like, a certain mistress who believed all the lies the man told her. She just annoyed me, sure she was in love, but to believe lies like that, and even after the wife tells the truth. I kind of did not want a happy ending for her, but then cheaters are manipulating bastards so who can blame her. I will not say who it is, some things you have to find out for yourself.Conclusion:The book was sweet, and very easy to read. It was long but the pages seemed to fly by. There is drama and romance, and the thing I like the most, reality."},{"Title":"Staying at Daisy's","review":"Not Normal Chick Lit because it was a little variation on boy meets girl but the characters were wonderful. You could relate to them. It was a good Read. Good for vacations, plane rides, or when you want sweet read."},{"Title":"Staying at Daisy's","review":"I was looking for something a cut above the terrible dime store romance novels I read as a teenager. There are some things I really like about the book: good dialog, multiple subplots interesting characters. But then something happened that completely ruined it for me. The main protagonist is set up to be a responsible together grounded person who has learned from the stupid mistakes she made in her past. She meets a guy and they dislike each other and engage in witty repartee. I'm totally with the program. What a fun book I thought. Then two days after they meet the guy shows up at her place of work. He tells her he needs her help on her day off with \\"something\\" but won't tell her what it is but it isn't a date. At first she says she won't go unless he tells her what it is but then as he is walking out the door calling her bluff she gives in and agrees to go off with him in his car for this unknown favor. What kind of sniveling idiot agrees to go off with someone she barely knows and doesn't really like because he shows up at your workplace and demands you do him a favor? A favor he refuses to tell one about in advance?This is exactly the kind of controlling behavior the protagonists of dime store romance novels always put up with. Would the author want her teenage daughter reading about a together woman who puts up with controlling behavior as if it were perfectly normal?"},{"Title":"Staying at Daisy's","review":"So, what I've noticed about Jill Mansell after reading several of her books is that she becomes quite predictable after the first two books - as is the case with all romance writers. Her storylines and characters are more or less the same (with different names and titles). There's always the cheating bastard, and the flimsy (usually also cheating) best friend, with a splash of flamboyancy, and an obnoxious, hard to crack hero, and the sweet, insecure heroine. Add to that a few extras - these may take the shape of a dog, or a daughter, or a sister, or a porter, or a father-in-law - and you get yourself a Mansell.This specific book reminded me so much of \\"To the Moon and Back\\". Surprisingly, and although this was written before, I enjoyed \\"To the Moon and Back\\" a lot more than this. That could be because it was actually the first book I ever read for her, and so nothing about it seemed predictable, and I found it hilarious, sweet and witty. But let's lay out the similarities shall we?We have the: dead husband (albeit one a jerk, and the other a nice guy), a year gap after his death, and heroine still can't seem to let anyone in, enter dark brooding hero, flimsy best friend who has an affair with a married man, an elderly romance involving father (or father-in-law), and the male companion who the heroine goes out with because they seem to get along, only for it to not be right, and have him fall for the above mentioned flimsy best friend.Uncanny right?All of that being said, I did enjoy the book. I just did not enjoy it as much, because it was like reading the same book twice with slight amendments and a change of scenery. Also, I may be wrong, but I feel like Mansell doesn't really know how to create \\"I love you\\" moments. She has a habit of dumping all the \\"I love yous\\" in the last few chapters in a rushed manner, making them seem almost insincere.To be fair though, this book was about having a good laugh, and enjoying a light read about a bunch of odd characters. I also think Mansell intentionally tries to be shocking and bizarre in her characterisation and order of events. I mean, I could sit here and say, I don't like Tara, I hate people who cheat, I cannot believe her spinster-ly aunt prostituted herself to the man she loves (who does that?!) Hector was a jerk for offering Maggie money, Dominic was such an ass, and Tara was a twenty-seven year old idiot for not seeing it and being so immature, etc.etc. But what would I gain out of doing that? This book is exactly about all those series of unfortunate events!And for that, I think Mansell managed to pull it off. I had a few good laughs, I liked Daisy's character, and I enjoyed the overall storyline."},{"Title":"Staying at Daisy's","review":"This book wasn't for me.I loved it at the start, but then she added at least the stories of three other characters and that confused me so darn much! I didn't feel the connection between Dev and Daisy as I did with other books. Another problem I have is that she has a lot of plot ideas that just fade out, and that really frustrated me.Dont get me wrong, some secondary character storylines can be good, but they have to be woven well together, where as this one seemed a bit random .I wouldn't recommend this to someone who was looking for a simple, heart-thudding, tummy turning romance. It was quite plain in my opinion."},{"Title":"Staying at Daisy's","review":"I like some of Jill Mansell's novels: Brit Chick Lit, usually upbeat with interesting quirky characters.Staying at Daisy's was just so-so. It took so long to get anywhere.Daisy's father owns a posh country hotel and Daisy acts as the manager. She's beautiful and sexy and nice, but not especially interesting. Her friends are beautiful and sexy and not especially nice or interesting.Are you as bored as I am at this point? Thought so."},{"Title":"Staying at Daisy's","review":"This book is one of my favourites of all time. Ok so its not the great literary masterpiece of the 20th century but its such easy reading and its so well done. It reads like a movie, a really good romantic comedy. Its laugh out loud funny and is an escape from the realities of life for a few hours. I always read this when i'm in a bad mood. It never fails to cheer me up and make me laugh.

In essence this is good stuff."},{"Title":"Staying at Daisy's","review":"I happened to pick this book up in Portugal while there on vacation. I used to be an avid reader but like everything else, I lost time to endulge in this pleasure!The book was laying amongst a lot of other dicarded books and the cover caught my eye.From the first page on, I was hooked. It is funny, lots of characters to follow without being difficult, lots of laughs! I liked it so much I brought it back to Canada with me and now I am on the hunt for the rest of Jill Mansell's books.I would reccommend her books to anyone who likes a good, funny and romantic story. There is nothing in this book that is offending and no violence!Thank you Ms Mansell for giving me back the ability to MAKE TIME TO READ.Janet BritoVancouverCanada"},{"Title":"Staying at Daisy's","review":"Daisy, after a failed marriage, finds herself back at home. Home, in this case, is her father's hotel, and Daisy is managing it. Managing a hotel is easy; managing relationships are not. She thought her marriage to Steven was a dream come true, but his infidelity put an end to their love. Before they divorced, Steven was killed in a car accident. Now Daisy isn't sure she can trust any man, although there are several around. Dev is a famous national sports star, and he seems interested, or is he? Josh is a former boyfriend who has popped back up and into her life.As tough as love is for Daisy, she is not alone. There is Barney, who comes to the hotel to thank Daisy for donating her husband's kidney to him and finds exactly what he has been looking for his whole life. The problem is that what he has found is the woman who was involved with Steven. Then there is Tara, Daisy's best friend, who can't seem to catch a break with men, and always gets taken for granted. Even Daisy's father has a mystery love affair that may or may not work out.Reading a Jill Mansell book is like settling on the back porch with a glass of ice tea, while the flowers bloom and the wind whispers. Her characters are recognizable, and written with charm and wit. Humor and a refusal to let life defeat them is a mainstay, and this is a wonderful change from the tragic books that abound in the marketplace. Readers will laugh out loud, and cheer for the characters who manage to resolve their life issues. This book is recommended for readers ready for a light-hearted book that carries a powerful message."},{"Title":"Staying at Daisy's","review":"Daisy runs the swanky hotel owned by her father, Hector. Daisy is married to Stephen and find out that he is cheating on her when Stephen and his girlfriend are in a serious car accident. Stephen ends up dying and Daisy decides to not fall in love with a player again. Daisy meets Dev at a wedding held at the hotel; he is everything she has sworn off. Of course she is immediately drawn to him. The two go to pick out a dog for Dev and Daisy picks Clarissa, a little hot dog with personality to spare. Besides Daisy and Dev, there are other romantic storylines going on--Hector and Maggie, Tara and Dominic, Barney and Mel. All of these characters are ones that readers will care about and invest in.This is my second book by Mansell and I really enjoy her writing style. This book is great British chick lit. Mansell writes great characters, good romances and does not just make it fluffy. I also like how an animal is incorporated into her books in a decent supporting role.I received this book from Sourcebooks to review.[...]"},{"Title":"Staying at Daisy's","review":"Why I Read this Book: Once in a blue moon, I like to read a good chick-lit novel. Way back when (after I had read the Harry Potter series and I was trying to find my reading groove), I dabbled in a bit of click-lit. I'm not a huge fan of the genre so a book really has to grab my attention in order for me to read it. In fact, I have about 10 chick-lit books on my shelf, that have been on my shelf for over 3 years, that are waiting for me to read. When I get in the mood.What I Liked: The book's length seems daunting - it's 500 pages long!! But don't let that get to you. I felt a bit overwhelmed by the size of the book but once I started reading it, I hardly noticed how long the novel was because I got sucked into the story.I was also overwhelmed by the blurb. There seemed to be a lot going on (there is) and I was worried that I would get lost in the multiple story arcs. But that wasn't the case. Staying at Daisy's is a soap opera; there are many characters to keep track of and a lot of different storylines going on. The different storylines interconnect in ways you wouldn't have guessed. But the author does a great job at mastering this soap opera. It's not confusing or overwhelming. It is funny and at times, crazy.What I Didn't Like: When I had this book in my hands, the pages just whizzed by. But when I put the book down, I wasn't so anxious to pick it back up. It wasn't a gripping novel; it's a great night time read to keep on your nightstand.Overall Impression: Staying at Daisy's interesting characters with drama-filled lives and intertwining storylines will be a perfect read for soap opera fans and chick-lit fans. This is the first book by Jill Mansell that I've read so far and I'm looking forward to more from this author. And I'm not even a huge fan of chick-lit! This book is funny, it's touching and it's a novel you won't want to miss."},{"Title":"Staying at Daisy's","review":"I finally started reading this book on Kindle and find it difficult to put down. It is very easy reading and light.

The beginning of the novel sets up the strange relationship between Daisy and the character Barney, and I thought this was a very creative and interesting way to build a relationship. Watching the love develop between the main characters and the supporting characters was really interesting, and I liked that the novel did not solely focus on Daisy. I also thought the banter between all of the characters was funny, and I caught myself laughing out loud multiple times. I am itching to read more by this author, and I would recommend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"Staying at Daisy's","review":"Well worth the time! Great read with good but not unrealistic turns in the story line; definitely a refreshing read!"},{"Title":"Staying at Daisy's","review":"Not a bad read, but a bit too drawn out. Most of the secondary stories made me skip ahead because I really just wanted to follow the main story."},{"Title":"Staying at Daisy's","review":"When I want something light, easy and fun to read, Jill Mansell is always a sure bet. Staying at Daisy's was a winner.Daisy MacLean manages a small hotel owned by her father Hector is a village in England. The hotel is the setting for a wedding that seems to touch off events for the friends, family and employees of Daisy's hotel.Daisy has been burned before in love and has no interest in best man Dev - mind you he is awfully handsome... And Daisy's best friend and chambermaid Tara just happens to have dated the groom before....and Hector - well, he's never met a guest he couldn't charm ...but he's got a secret...and so does Tara's Aunt Maggie...and the new porter at the hotel....and who is his mystery girlfriend...and...Well, you get the idea. Lots of madcap situations, miscommunications and missed signals make for a amusing, light hearted read. Staying at Daisy's is populated with the kind of characters Mansell is known for - warm, funny and unique personas. They're all a little bit quirky and you can't help but be charmed. Daisy is the kind of person you'd love to know and have as a friend. The supporting characters are all clearly drawn roles, filling out the roster. Hector is the one individual who struck a sour note with me - I didn't think he deserved his happy ending. And of course, there are happy endings for all involved. And that's the fun of Mansell's books - the journey there is delightfully entertaining. Staying at Daisy's is a bit longer than previous books. About 50 pages too much in my opinion - one too many missed opportunities with Daisy and Dev stretched out the ending.A lovely diversionary read, perfect for fans of the chick lit genre."},{"Title":"Staying at Daisy's","review":"This is a great way to waste an afternoon or two, I love jill Mansell! All of her stories are unique and fun transporting you into small towns and big lives in England. Staying at Daisy's was s quick fun romantic and cheeky story."},{"Title":"Staying at Daisy's","review":"Jill Mansell is new to me, but, from evidence in her writing skills, is definitely NOT new to the world of writing. Her quirky characters, her witty plot line, and her all around fantastic skills, kept me hooked and smiling until the very end.This chick-lit novel takes us to England, among the fabulous accents and friendly natives. I felt right at home from the start at Daisy's hotel. I laughed out loud through this fast but fun read. Daisy is a widow, but her marriage seemed to have been over long before the death. Yep. Dear hubby was a two timer! He apparently wanted his cake and to eat it, too. Daisy vowed then to stay away from any players. That is until she meets Dev. Man, was she in for a surprise with him! The two made for great laughs!Out of all the characters, Hector, Daisy's dad was my favorite. From page one, his words, antics and obvious love for life just hooked me. He's a character that should be in ALL books everywhere!I am forever a Jill Mansell fan. She combines hysterical fun, British charm and entertaining characters, tosses them up and throws her fans an unforgettably hilarious, 4 star chick lit novel. I am highly recommending this to everyone who loves a good laugh now and again.

I have read many of her books. I must admit that while I do enjoy them for the light-heartedness, the last couple of books were just ok. Staying with Daisy's renewed my faith in Ms. Mansell. There were so many hilarious moments that I can not pick just one. I thought that Daisy and Dev were fun together. Dev helped Daisy to open up and let loose. Daisy needed a guy like Dev after her last relationship. What I loved the most about this book was all the kooky, hilarious characters. Each one just added to the story.

I would recommend this one to my friends because it was a fun and comfy read. Nothing earth shattering happens but it was a solid story with great characters that made me want to check into Daisy's hotel if and when I ever get to England before I die!!"},{"Title":"Staying at Daisy's","review":"I really love reading Jill Mansell's books. They are British Chick-lit as it's very best!Daisy realized her husband was two-timing her when he was in a serious car accident with the floozy. Unfortunately for him, it took his life. But she decided then and now, she wouldn't settle for a player again. So, she manages her father's hotel and spends some time with her friends and is getting by.On one of her busier nights at the hotel, a reception and a wedding, she meets Dev Tycazk, a former rugby player who just rubs her the wrong way. He may be part of the wedding party and he may be attractive, but she's been happy playing the singles scene.But Dev comes back a few days later requesting a favor of Daisy. Before you know it, the attraction is too powerful to deny. But not only is love in the air for Daisy and Dev, but there's also Daisy's friend Tara, the maid. Daisy's father Hector, Tara's aunt Maggie and the lovable porter Barney. All of their stories are secondary to Daisy and Dev's but play out beautifully until you come to a very satisfactory ending.Great dialogue, extremely likeable characters all mesh together into a romantic romp that will keep you entertained from cover to cover. There are a few surprises but I won't tell you about them so you'll be surprised too! Especially who Barney has been seeing!!! Another winner for Ms. Mansell -- I can't wait to see what she writes next!!"},{"Title":"Staying at Daisy's","review":"I really enjoyed Staying at Daisy's. It was a quick read, the characters were painted in broad strokes but I still found them engaging.I especially like the depiction of Clarissa, one of the many heartthrob's dog.I'm spoiled, in the days of free Kindle books. If I am not able to find other books by this author for free, I'll probably end up buying some! It was sexy enough to keep me interested and yet, I'd probably let my mother read it LOL!"},{"Title":"Staying at Daisy's","review":"In Staying At Daisy's, we meet Daisy MacLean at her father's hotel where she is the manager. It's a busy day as a wedding and reception is scheduled for the afternoon but Daisy is worried that her friend and employee, Tara, will fall apart as the groom, Dominick, is Tara's ex-boyfriend. Tara assures Daisy she couldn't care less but Tara finds herself in a sticky situation when she tries to explain just who was hitting on whom after being found in a compromising position by the bride's sister.Hector, Daisy's father, is quite the jovial character - one of those people some would call larger than life. He shares a love life with one of the locals but little does he know it's not the no-strings attachment that he pretends to himself that it is. I loved it when realization hit!Then there's Barney, the hotel's new porter, who harbors a romantic secret himself. The old adage about it's a small world certainly fits Barney's situation. Daisy is dumbstruck when she finds out who Barney is seeing. Barney is one of those characters who is almost too good to be true but I found myself really rooting for him to get everything he wanted.Let's not forget Maggie, Tara's aunt who has her own romantic adventures going on. I love Maggie as a character; she has a lot of spunk and a great sense of humor. When the appliance company fails to fix her washing machine, Maggie comes up with a way to get the company's attention and it is one laugh after another.Full circle back to Daisy; she's pretty much sworn off men since her late husband's cheating behavior devastated her trust in men. However, Dev, the best man in Dominick's wedding is a well known sports figure with quite the reputation. Totally hot! He seems to turn up at the hotel frequently and as much as Daisy tries to ignore him, she finds herself thinking of him more than she would like.A lot of trial and error in the love department and a few mismatches but Mansell manages to tie the ends up neatly in a satifying conclusion.

I really liked it a lot!"},{"Title":"Staying at Daisy's","review":"STAYING AT DAISY'S by Jill Mansell is an interesting chicklit/contemporary romance set in present day.This is an reprint from 2002.

Jill Mansell delivers a comic parody of what life is like in the wacky world of soap opera chicklit. It is so nice to have a break from heavier reading with adorable fiction like this.Daisy is just so full of bad luck that she wonders what it would be like just to be normal. She's married to the man she loves. Whoops......hold that thought for a minute as we see that there has been an accident with dear hubby and OMG, who's that with him? Eek!Well, life does go on and other characters more quirky come into play to make this such a delightful treat.You have Daisy's bestest friend Tara who just can't help being in love with a married man. Tara's aunt is giving favors to a man who wants a discreet liaison and almost gets caught numerous times by Tara. Whew.......these are really close calls.Next is a man that shows up in Daisy's life to thank her for giving him a rare gift that saves his life. Well it doesn't take him long to find love at first sight with a young lady he chances upon as she's trying to get her baby and its carriage out of a doorway. Little does he know that this young woman and child have a tie to Daisy that will really shock the pants off of her.We have a man from Daisy's past that shows up just in time to save her from making a fool of herself with a handsome rake who could charm grandma out of her false teeth with a dazzling grin.Oh and this dazzling rake, I'd love to get a go at him. He doesn't give up easy and I think there is love in the air.

A year later we meet up with Daisy again as she's managing her father's hotel. her faith in men ruined, she'e spent the past year concentrating on her job. And she's been perfectly one day, but that can change as a potential new man enters her life that she becomes increasingly attracted to. Falling in love can be dangerous and have the chance to break her heart yet again so does she decide to let down her guard and let it happen or will she try to keep up walls around her heart for her protection.There are several romances in bloom over the course of this book. The most touching for me happens between Barney who gets a job at the Manor and ends up in a romance with Mel, who ends up having been the mistress of Daisy's late husband. I really got sucked into their story and ended up really rooting for them. In fact over the course of the book there were many characters to like.The whole book is quite funny but what was funniest for me in the book was the poor character who was just trying to get her washing machine fixed. Repair man after repair man is sent in and she gets fed up with the manufacturer of said washing machine. Finally she takes matters into her own hands and I was practically rolling on the floor laughing at how she finally took matters into her own hands.After being able to read this one and Millie's Fling for free I've since bought several other of her books as well.

I liked the plot complications and the setting of the hotel. All of the characters were well developed, and I think my only complaint would be that there was a little too much going on with too many different characters. The book changed perspective from one character to another (in first person) quite frequently from chapter to chapter, and I'm not used to this. But it did provide more depth and in the end I think it worked for this story. The way the characters' lives intertwined with one another while remaining their own separate stories was refreshing. I'd recommend this book if you enjoy chick lit."},{"Title":"Staying at Daisy's","review":"I love Jill Mansell. Love. Her. This book wasn't my absolute favorite of her, I just found the romance between the various couples to be less compelling and to have less chemistry than usual. That said, it was a fun, thoroughly entertaining read. Mansell's trademark humor shines through, and the ending is sweet and satisfying."},{"Title":"Staying at Daisy's","review":"This is the fourth book by Jill Mansell that I have read and she is quickly becoming one of my favorites. Her books are fun and light-hearted romances, sprinkled with quirky characters and happily-ever-after endings. This book is no exception. I love the British humor...it has a Love Acutally/Notting Hill kind of feel. Also, the sexual content is a tastefully suggestive \\"fade-to-black.\\"Having said that, my one criticism is that, though Mansell typically has several storylines woven together in each book, this one had a bit too many for my taste. It made parts of the book seem slow simply because the POV was constantly changing.The best thing about reading this book (and all of Mansell's books that I have read so far) is the constant smile on my face throughout. At times I actually realized that I was grinning while reading and laughed out loud. That's why we read, right? To feel good and be entertained. The \\"big grin\\" factor is what will keep me reading Mansell's books."},{"Title":"Staying at Daisy's","review":"I have been laid off for six months and do not think I'd have maintained my sanity if I did not have my Kindle. I tend to read very serious memoirs or novels about, oh, the Holocaust for example. And when I'm totally wrung out from reading that type of book I will go to Jill Mansell for relief! I love her books. Everything always works out in the end, people are always where they should be and with whom they should be. The characters are so quirky and lovable...the perfect antidote for some of the horrible realities of life. A perfect escape!! Staying at Daisy's was just such a book. Even Clarissa made me laugh (you have to read the book to find out who Clarissa is!) Thank you Jill!"},{"Title":"Staying at Daisy's","review":"First reading this...i was wondering if indeed i had picked the wrong book off the library shelf. Mansell builds her characters till you will be up @ 2 in the morning with a glass of wine reminding yourself that you need to go to work the next day. The book has lovable characters that you will think kindly on way after reading the last page. An embarassing dad, a marriage full of secrets that come back to bite, a full of herself actress, a one customer prostitue. This book will keep you entertained. Ordering myself another Mansell book off amazon right now.... Enjoy! Happy reading :)"},{"Title":"Staying at Daisy's","review":"Jill Mansell has been a lighthearted, fun author.

This is her 3rd that I have read and I was not disappointed."},{"Title":"Staying at Daisy's","review":"This is the second Jill Mansell book I've read and I thought it was so cute! As usual, it's a long book with a full mad cast of characters. It's told in third person and there are several different story lines all happening at the same time, yet it's easy to follow and each separate story somehow manages to intertwine with all the others. Each chapter is short so it makes a perfect book for a day at the beach. Read a chapter, get up and take a dip in the water. Read another chapters, get up and take another dip, etc. etc. If you like chick lit, more specifically, British chick lit, you have got to try Jill Mansell!"},{"Title":"Staying at Daisy's","review":"I did enjoy this book, so easy to read, a real chick book. Very light hearted and funny.A Good read."},{"Title":"Staying at Daisy's","review":"This is not my favorite Jill Mansell book. I liked the characters, the premise, the location...but it was just over all bland. I think there was a lot of potential, but not enough interaction between the main couple.

I am new to Jill Mansell, but I really like the two books I've read so far. And am loving the one I'm reading now. If you like Sophie Kinsella this is right up your alley. Though just a tad more serious, Jill Mansell's books go down like candy."},{"Title":"Staying at Daisy's","review":"Staying at Daisy's by Jill Mansell was such a fun romp with a pile of funny and eccentric characters! Jill Mansell is fast becoming a favorite author of mine and reading her books is always a delight! This is one romantic comedy that will have you flipping those pages to see what comes next - it's funny and yet has that little bit of a serious tinge to it as well!Daisy is the manager of a beautiful country hotel called Colworth Manor which is owned by her father Hector. Since losing her husband Steven in a car accident with non other than his mistress Daisy has sworn off men, especially the good looking ones who can charm your pants off. They are never anything but trouble.So, when at a wedding being hosted at her hotel, she happens to meet the more than obnoxious Dev while defending her best friend Tara, she is more than determined to steer clear of him - he is much too handsome and sexy for his own good and hers. Even worse he is sticking up for his lousy mate Dominic who is getting married there and who just happened to make a play for chambermaid Tara. Now Tara does know him though, he used to be an ex-boyfriend of hers. Still when she's caught with Dominic by the bride's sister, she's deeply offended that she's being blamed for the whole sodden mess!Dev doesn't give up so easily though and keeps showing up and getting on Daisy's nerves. Yet when he takes her to help him buy a dog, she can't help but see another side to him. She picks out Clarissa for him even though he specifically said he wanted a big and burly dog much like himself. Yet, he does end up going home with Clarissa and of course falls in love with her. Later he shows up again at Daisy's hotel booking in for a few weeks while his place is being renovated because of a water leak. While Daisy is currently seeing her ex-boyfriend Josh, she still can't help but feel butterflies whenever Dev is around. Well, she'll just have to make more of an effort to avoid him, won't she? It's just that maybe that isn't really what she wants or is it?Staying at Daisy's is full of quirky characters. I've barely skimmed the surface. While Daisy and the dog Clarissa were my favorite characters, Tara was hilarious. She's so unlucky in love and every step she takes in any direction just seems to end in more laughs. Daisy's father Hector is someone who is larger than life and thrives on it - he's also having an affair with a village local while pretending to himself that it means nothing. There is also Tara's aunt Maggie who was fantastic - when she has problems with her washing machine, she takes her anger to a whole new level. Then there's Barney who has to be the world's last sweetest guy - you just want to give him a big ole hug!Nothing really earth shattering happens in this novel yet you will never find a boring moment. It's all about people finding love and living their lives and you will find yourself completely captivated by the cast of characters and the beautiful country manor and area. I felt like I knew all of these people and cared about them before I was even a quarter of a way into the novel and I've found that with all of Jill Mansell's books that I've read. She has a knack for making you feel a part of her character's lives as well as letting you sit back and imagine that you're enjoying yourself in the English countryside. As the story evolves Daisy is faced with the biggest surprise of all and yet it is this that gives her the push to finally take the biggest risk of all and open herself up to love again.If you're in the mood for a fun and fabulous read, then I'd say Staying at Daisy's would be a great pick as would most of Jill Mansell's books. If you enjoy British authors as I do and all their funny and quirky sayings, then you'll love this reading this story."},{"Title":"Staying at Daisy's","review":"Reading this book is a great way to spend an afternoon. It keeps you completely enthralled for hours and you never want to leave this small village. I love how everyone in this book is somehow connected with each other. Call me a bit slow but I didn't realize some of the obvious connections and was delighted when I discovered them halfway through the book (even though I'm sure everyone else realized it right from the get go). I loved all the main characters in the book. Everyone has their own bit of charm and Mansell writes in such as way that even though there are several characters to keep track off, you never lose interest or get lost.Daisy's story is a whirlwind. Her former husband was a total prick and I felt so bad for her. The feelings that she had must have been so horrible. The ending is a bit obvious but it's still fun getting there and seeing who she ends up with. Normally I would have been annoyed with Tara's character but I could relate to her. The guy that keeps pulling you back even though you KNOW he's bad for you and it's not a good situation to be in. Her whole situation was sad and funny all at the same time. Sad because I'm sure many have found themselves in that same situation but funny at the end result. Barney's story was my favorite. I was expecting something sinister when we first meet him but he's just a really sweet guy. The only story I didn't really connect with involved Tara's aunt. It was just a weird situation all around but the story of the washing machine was absolutely hilarious.I absolutely adore Jill Mansell's books and this one is no exception. It's a light fun read that will keep you hooked for hours. This book is over 500 pages but I swear it reads so fast that you will wish it was longer. If you know me then you know how much I enjoy chick lit and her books are a perfect example at what a chick lit book should be like. Likable characters make this is huge plus in my book and the fun storyline adds to the appeal. Plus it's British! A great read and I cannot wait until her next book releases!"},{"Title":"Staying at Daisy's","review":"Daisy MacLean has just learned that her husband has been in a car accident...and his girlfriend was in the car with him. She also learns that he doesn't have cancer like he told her he did, and agrees to donate his organs for transplant.A year later, Daisy's still managing her father's hotel, working a wedding. A guest catches the groom in a compromising position with Daisy's friend and employee, Tara. Tara says she didn't do anything, the groom came on to her. The best main blames Tara, but Daisy defends her.Now Daisy's gotten a letter from the recipient of her ex husband's kidney, a young man named Barney, and he's come for a visit. While he's at the hotel, he sees an ad for a porter position and applies for the job.Daisy keeps running into the best man, who also happens to be a famous former football star. Tara gets a call from the groom, miserable in his marriage and wanting to see her. Barney gets settled in, meets a nice girl, and they start dating. Tara's sister, Maggie, is secretly seeing someone in the village, and he's paying her for sex!My thoughts: This book was fantastic. Staying at Daisy's is the second book I've read by Ms. Mansell, and I plan to glom her backlist soon, I really enjoy her writing.From my brief summary, it sounds like there's a lot going on - there is - but Ms. Mansell is a master at working the storylines until she neatly ties them together in a nice big bow. I really liked Daisy, she was a sympathetic character who'd had her heart trampled by her ex-husband and was reluctant to open herself to love again. Her father was a great character, absolutely adorable. Her friend Tara was a bit abrasive and I didn't like her very much; I had a hard time believing that after what she'd seen Daisy go through with a cheating husband that she would head down that path herself. Tara's sister Maggie turned out to be quite a surprising character :)Dev is the hero of the story, and I didn't feel like we saw very much of him, but I liked him nevertheless. He was a bit of a playboy, which is why Daisy couldn't or wouldn't allow herself to fall for him. Lucky for her, Dev is persistent and patient.I enjoyed the entire book, but here's what really struck me about this story - the organ donation storyline. Full disclosure: I worked for about 12 years as a secretary in a pediatric kidney transplant department, so I have some intense feelings on the subject of organ donation. I loved, loved, loved that Staying at Daisy's does a marvelous job of highlighting it in a positive way. I am a firm believer in organ donation, and Ms. Mansell wove the subject into a wonderful storyline. I'm not going to give out any spoilers, so to see why it was especially significant you'll have to read the book, lol."},{"Title":"Staying at Daisy's","review":"I was not sure how many stars to give this novel. The first chapters are just plain boring and although it gets pretty entertaining as the story goes on, the love story of the main characters is the least interesting of all the subplots of the book. They are madly in love, but you never see it happening, they barely interact with each other! There are more interesting chick lit novels out there, pass on this one."},{"Title":"The Fabulous Sinkhole and Other Stories","review":"I'm a teacher of Language Arts and this collection of Trevino's short stories was a hit with my at-risk readers. The first story (&quot;The Fabulous Sinkhole&quot;) was witty and lighthearted, yet exposed the hidden realities of being in this world via the objects in and the subjects surrounding the sinkhole. The characters' voices sound as if they could live on your street; the dialogue is natural and lively. The rest of the stories in this collection follow the same formula as above but just get weirder and funnier. A great book for any young adult who doesn't like to read fiction, yet loves horror movies, comic books and stories about low-rider zombies returned from the dead to slash and burn cultural stereotypes."},{"Title":"Songbirds, Truffles, and Wolves: An American Naturalist in Italy","review":"As a naturalist, Nabhan has a keen eye. He can assess landscapes, crops and architecture with some skill. However, he runs into trouble when he persists in judging his fellow human beings. He is highly critical of others, not at all of himself. For example, a chapter on use of corn in peasants' diet blames the consequent rise in pellagra on their failure to wash the corn in lime,as Indians did, providing calcium. The huge majority of Italiansliving in remote country areas would never have heard of this remedy, and so their failure to use it could not reasonably be blamed on ethnocentrism. It's also common for Nabham to blame the Umbrian society in which he travels for not being wild enough, remote enough. He seems to have little understanding of the desperate poverty in which isolated Umbrian communities existed in the past. He even finds fault that truffle-hunters now use dogs rather than pigs in the hunt. The explanation, a simple one, is that hunters find it easier to extract a truffle from a dog's mouth rather than wrestle it away from a 200-pound tusked boar who's determined to eat it.Although Nabham's whole journey is supposedly focused on a pilgrimage to Assisi, when he actually gets there he is (unsurprisingly, given his character) disappointed. He even finds cause to be disgusted when a well-meaning fellow pilgrim points out the fact that there is no animal shelter of any kind in Assisi, that suffering animals are without help or protection, and that this should be remedied. Nabham's theory is that the animals should remain \\"wild,\\" and he fears that they will be \\"tamed\\" if they're helped. He seems ignorant of the extent to which St. Frances, and other villagers, helped and fed the Wolf of Gubbio.Throughout the book, Nabham refers to a painful divorce he has gone through and the extent of his suffering. By the end of the book, so self-satisfied and unreflective does he appear that the reader is firmly on the unseen ex-wife's side."},{"Title":"Songbirds, Truffles, and Wolves: An American Naturalist in Italy","review":"If, one week ago, someone told me that I'd be reading &amp; loving a book subtitled &quot;An American Naturalist in Italy,&quot; I'd have laughed.This is a witty and charming book (a very quick read) which will get to you even if you are NOT a naturalist---even if, like I, you hardly know what a naturalist is or does!Nabhan, with a friend, hiked through the Tuscan and Umbrian countryside, interviewing natives and chronicling his discoveries and stories: an old farmer shares wine and his knowledge of how to find truffles simply because Nabhan was walking to Assisi and the farmer was named after Saint Francis; an elderly couple waltzes in a town square and becomes, in Nabhan's words, &quot;the dance, itself;&quot; another man explains to the author why grapes need to be trellised &amp; how beautiful they are when alternated with maples; a woman explains how a she-wolf was tamed and fed by town residents. The tales are all about the land and the people who have lived there for centuries. And they are all fascinating.....simple, true stories that will help one believe, again, in the human race.This book is a perfect companion to that other fine book of Italian (i.e. human) discovery: &quot;Under The Tuscan Sun&quot; by Frances Mayes."},{"Title":"Songbirds, Truffles, and Wolves: An American Naturalist in Italy","review":"This story is said to chronicle the way and the places trod by St. Francis of Assisi, in Umbria. However, the author can't drag himself out of the way of the story. Time after time (about every 10 pages), he returns to mope about his recent divorce until, in the last quarter of the book, we hear that he has misplaced a ring given him by his girlfriend.I'd hoped to learn a little something about Umbria in the book, but there was little, and precious little that was fresh.The author and companion did not reach Umbria until one quarter of the story has been told. The reader is diverted by side stories of Columbus, the tale of the lost ring, animal rights, and even a foray to Rome to help friends make wine. One does not feel a part of the trek because the author refers to experts or characters who might bring the story to life, but none is woven into a cogent tale. I had the feeling that the 200 mile walk was worth about 10 pages of observations and the rest was filler. Sorry, but this shed little light on the nature of the countryside in Umbria, Italy."},{"Title":"Songbirds, Truffles, and Wolves: An American Naturalist in Italy","review":"I'm ordering several copies to give as gifts!This book touched my heart."},{"Title":"Songbirds, Truffles, and Wolves: An American Naturalist in Italy","review":"Mr Nabhan took us on an extrardinary journey through St Francis county. Entertaining and educating on each page. Then the big let down in the epilogue, as he rejects everything St Francis stood for.

He loved all animals as an extension of his love for Jesus, nothing more, nothing less. Mr Nabhan totally misread St Francis."},{"Title":"The Arabs As Master Slavers","review":"This important book discusses the oft overlooked subject of Africans depopulated and shipped to Arab countries as slaves. This work docuents not just the history of the massive slave trade to Arab lands, that numbered in the millions stretching back to the 7t century but more importantly this book documents modern day slavery in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in the middle east and north africa. Here we are given an insight into many parts of the Islamic slave trade, a fascinating topic. The final chapter is an interesting discussion of the role of women in Islamic societies and documents many sad and cruel rituals that women undergoe in rural soceity throughout the middle east. These rituals involve such barbaric practices as bleeding the women to make sure she is a virgin during the marriage ceremony. An important quick read.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"Philosophies of India (Bollingen series, XXVI)","review":"The book, of course, is a classic.Heinrich Zimmer intended this book, and fortunately Joseph Campbell proved the midwife for what would otherwise have been an intellectual stillborn child, due to the former's untimely passing. My copy was a first edition hardcover - a lovely book to hold and touch.To my thinking, this book is THE first (and perhaps final) reference for those interested in beginning to explore the depths and subtleties of the Hindu tradition. I have never found a more accessible and enjoyable introduction to the broad topic of Indian Spirituality.The history of Hindu religious development, and the import of its symbols, are nicely embellished throughout with the relevant Sanskrit terminology, which adds a considerable pleasure in the course of the read - especially when Zimmer describes the rich philosophical texture of these terms. One is immediately reminded of the difficult translational passage on leaving the psychologically rich Greek language for our practical, utilitarian English. Zimmer nicely bridges this gap. Further, the reader is never at a loss to follow the scholarly exposition of ideas.The presentation nicely dovetails with Campbell's own work in comparative religion and mythology, and for anyone that appreciates his clarity and articulate manner of presentation, or has unhappily fallen back from unsuccessful attempts to appreciate the broad outlines and import of the philosophies of India, this book is simply a gem. My only proviso is that the book does become mildly tedious toward the middle, as historical minutiae begin to proliferate. Nevertheless, if this topic interests you, be sure to consult Philosophies of India first; it is most certainly an excellent primer."},{"Title":"Philosophies of India (Bollingen series, XXVI)","review":"Professor Zimmer composed most of this book during the last years of his life. He died in 1943 while teaching at Columbia University. Joseph Campbell, who was one of his students, took up the task of editing and completing the work some years later. This 687-page volume is the result, published by Pantheon Books as part of the distinguished Bollingen Series in 1951.Zimmer goes beyond the six orthodox systems of Indian philosophy to include Buddhism, Tantra, and various minor philosophies which are identified as philosophies of e.g., \\"success,\\" \\"pleasure,\\" and \\"duty.\\" These are practical philosophies in the Indian constellation aimed at advising kings and princes on how to maintain power and govern (much in the manner of Machiavelli's Prince, by the way), and laypersons on how to live within the caste system and conduct one's daily life. In the Arthasastra (the science of wealth) and the voluminous Mahabharata, for example, one learns how to approach a neighbor--that is, a neighboring tribe--safely and profitably. The seven ways are (1) saman, conciliation or negotiation; (2) danda, attack, assault; (3) dana, with presents; (4) bheda, divide and confuse; (5) maya, trick, deceive; (6) upeksa, pretending not to notice; and (7) indrajala, trickery in war, such as using a Trojan horse. What Zimmer has achieved here is something beyond the usual presentation of the ideas and tenets of the Indian philosophies. We are given a rich source of material for understanding the Indian mind and how it differs from the Western.Unlike Western philosophy, Indian philosophy is intricately interwoven with religious ideas and practices. Unlike Western philosophy, Indian philosophy does not attempt a rigorous logical expression. Rather ideas are asserted and truths acknowledged symbolically and metaphorically. Analogy is a frequent device. Zimmer explains why this is so on pages 312-313:\\"...[T]he ultimate and real task of philosophy, according to Indian thought, and to such classical Occidental philosophers as Plato, transcends the power and the task of reason. Access to truth demands a passage beyond the compass of ordered thought. And by the same token: the teaching of transcendent truth cannot be by logic, but only by pregnant paradox and by symbol and image.\\"Western readers of an analytical philosophic mind should not be put off by the Indian style (as I once was), but instead might profit from an open-minded approach that accepts things on a symbolic level and does not get bogged down in the quicksand of apparent contradiction, because there will be contradictions aplenty! It is useful, I think, to see, for example, how the ideas of Brahmanism and the Sankhya philosophy were incorporated into the Buddhist teachings, how the Upanishads anticipated the Bhagavad Gita, and how rite and ritual evolved into something close to rationalism. Also interesting is how the unquestioned authority of the Vedas on matters of belief have been maintained in the \\"orthodox\\" philosophies of modern Indian and how they have been augmented or transplanted by the \\"heterodox\\" systems such as Buddhism and Tantra.In the final analysis, the Indian mind sees reality as paradox. \\"Indian philosophy insists that the sphere of logical thought is far exceeded by that of the mind's possible experiences of reality. To express and communicate knowledge gained in moments of grammar-transcending insight [compare Zen \\"enlightenments\\"] metaphors must be used, similes and allegories.\\" Zimmer calls these \\"the very vehicles of meaning.\\" He adds, \\"Indian philosophy, therefore, frankly avails itself of the symbols and images of myth, and is not finally at variance with the patterns and sense of mythological belief.\\" (p. 25)Zimmer's style is relatively easy to read and is without obvious cant or prejudice. He writes as a historian with the emphasis on what was and why, rather than as a critical philosopher who would critique and criticize--although he is not above guiding the reader's sensibilities. Campbell's editing is substantial of course, as it must be with an uncompleted work of this size, compiled some years after the fact of composition; but his famous voice is subdued in favor of his distinguished mentor.There is both a general and a Sanskrit index, both substantial, and a bibliography by philosophic category (Jainism, Buddhism, etc.). An appendix on \\"The Six Systems,\\" Sankhya, Yoga, Mimamsa, Vedanta, Vaisesika, and Nyaya, which Zimmer regards as \\"points of view\\" and \\"aspects of a single orthodox tradition\\" is given and there is a time line juxtaposing events in India with those in the West.There is a reason this book is still in print, and that reason is simple: Zimmer's work is one of the best on Indian philosophy ever written and is a storehouse of insight into the mind set of India. It would make a fine addition to almost anyone's library."},{"Title":"Philosophies of India (Bollingen series, XXVI)","review":"After reading both JN Mohanty's Classical Indian Philosophy and Zimmer's Philosophies of India, I definitely favor the later. He exposes the philosophy of India mainly through religion and history, which makes this massive book much more readable than one would expect... that he takes the questionable liberty of associating sankya/yoga, jainism, and buddhism as having a common pre-aryan origin, but it is not made without support, and ultimately has little effect on the quality of the work.

Zimmer makes reference to this cataclysmic state of affairs which gives special emphasis to the pessimistic world-view that predominated during the feudal days in India and was underscored in the \\"Arthasastra\\" by Kautilya, a compendium on the law of the fishes - how to survive in a world where the big fish eat the little fish. In a world of hopelessness, where the philosophies of time are full of brutal and evanescent elements, the philosophies of eternity grew into prominence. Zimmer traces the major lines of thought in India, and shows that the philosophies of eternity have not only led to renunciation but affirmation of life as well.It is interesting to compare philosophy in India after the Indo-Aryan invasions with the philosophy of the Greeks, who experienced related invasions. In both localities nomadic tribesman with a very similar pantheon of masculine gods overran or invaded an indigenous, settled populace. Comparisons between the two illuminate how the East took a different philosophical pathway from that of the West. At the time of Thales and the Ionian philosophers and extending through Plato and Aristotle, the Greeks dispensed with their gods in their study of science and philosophy and used analytical methods. In India, by contrast, there never was \\"a Twilight of the Gods\\"; that is, mythology continued to play an important role in metaphysics. These were two very different pathways. In addition, another telling difference becomes clear: the Greeks revered the human personality and its attributes, and this reverence for personality was extended throughout the Western world, certainly no less exemplified than in the resurrection of the body of Christ. In India, however, personality was understood as merely a mask, as the temporal trappings of an individual role that would be completely shed at the end of a lifetime.Zimmer asserts that the world-view of the Indo-Aryans evident in the Vedas (particularly in the Rig-Veda) was absorbed and changed by indigenous influences. The Holy Power of the Vedas, which was focused on conquest and mastery of the outside world, became internalized over time and evolved into the Self (Atman) of Brahmanism and the Vedanta. What is more, Zimmer believed that the ascetic traditions of Jainism and Yoga were developed separately from Indo-Aryan influences and had aboriginal Dravidian sources. Archeological evidence does not tell us much at all in this regard, but the author makes his points by way of the surviving literature.According to Zimmer, pre-Aryan or pre-Vedic heterodoxy can be traced back to Jainism, which represented a dualist system of spirit (jiva) and matter (a-jiva), in which the practitioner could not allow contamination by the impurities of the material world. In the same vein, Sankhya held to the dualism between spirit (parusa) and matter (prakrti), but a giant step was taken: ignorance was now recognized as the cause of bondage to the material world, and the concern shifted to knowledge and intent. But as much of an advance as Sankhya was, it was still a dualistic system that pointed the way to a total renunciation of this world. Brahmanism and the Vedanta - the orthodox line of thought according to the author - was less dualistic in its approach but still world-renouncing. Hinayana Buddhism was not that much different, but Mahayana Buddhism, especially in the concept of the Bodhisattva, or saviour, represented a direction away from renouncing the world.The last part of the book is incomplete, as Campbell tells us, and Tantra is not discussed in much detail. The practice of Tantra does not avoid or shun nature, as the ancient ascetic traditions in India endeavor to do. Tantra views Maya not simply as the world illusion but as the divine manifestation of energy. The beliefs and practices do not take the objective, analytical route that western science takes, but make use of mythology to describe the world metaphorically, in terms of masks. Zimmer asserts that Tantra recalls the worship of the Goddess in pre-Aryan times."},{"Title":"Philosophies of India (Bollingen series, XXVI)","review":"Zimmer was a scholar with a great deal of first-hand knowledge of Indian philosophy and art history. Unfortunately, his interpretations were often marred by his romantic tendencies, tendencies inherited from a lineage that included Schopenhauer, Deussen, and Jung. The book was originally a series of lectures at Columbia University, and it suffers further from being edited by Joseph Campbell. One of Zimmer's most problematic claims in the book is that the renunciatory strain in Indian Philosophy, identified with Jainism and Samkhya, can be traced conclusively to the pre-Aryan Indians. This assertion, besides being completely unprovable, is simply an inversion of the kind of racialist theories that allowed earlier German indologists to champion the greatness of the Aryan race. (Zimmer was married to a Jewish woman, and because of this was forced to emigrate to the United States from Germany.) Avoid the introductory chapters, which presume to make generalizations about the character of the Indian people, and instead focus on his attention to textual and art-historical detail in the middle chapters.

(Jessie & John Danz Lectures)","review":"John Blacking was an ethnomusicologist who spent two years living with, and studying the Venda, a tribe in South Africa. As opposed to Western classical music where the few (professional concert musicians) are revered by the many, and only a handful are regarded as \\"talented\\" while most believe they have no \\"talent,\\" with the Venda, everyone is expected to be able to perform; no one is excluded. Music is their religion.In the first chapter of his small yet very powerful book, Blacking writes that when he began to live with and study the Venda, he believed that music began and ended with Western classical music, but, that after two years of living and studying the Venda and their music, he no longer understood Western music. Put differently, his experience living with and studying the Venda forced him to question all prior beliefs he had both about Western music and assumptions underlying them. The Venda taught him that all people have talent or musical ability. It is only Western values or myths that create hierarchies of talent and ability. And that these underlying Western values and myths subjugate countless people, causing them to dismiss key aspects of their inherent human potential, because of widespread belief that it is pointless to pursue musical ambitions only a fortunate few possess, but most do not.Blacking's book is important not only as an ethnomusicological study, but has, I think, universal application because its underlying theses directly question Western assumptions and myths that adversely affect people regardless of musical preference. The book forces one to think, to challenge values one might previously have taken for granted.I have recommended John Blacking's How Musical is Man? to friends who thought themselves totally bereft of any musical ability or talent, who were highly reluctant to attempt anything musical.Though the book has musical examples, it can be read and appreciated by those with absolutely no ability to read or play music.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"How Musical Is Man? (Jessie & John Danz Lectures)","review":"This slim volume may be the be best single introduction to ethnomusicology we have. It is based on Blacking's fieldwork among the Venda, an agricultural people living in the African Transvaal. Blacking provides extensive musical examples and photographs covering children's music, ritual, spiritual possession, the musical calendar, etc. Unlike Westerners, who believe that only a few people are musical, the Venda believe that all people are musical and so all members of their culture actively make music."},{"Title":"How Musical Is Man?

Pick up an inexpensive copy today!"},{"Title":"How Musical Is Man? (Jessie & John Danz Lectures)","review":"Western Michigan University Professor John Blacking (1928-1990) prefaces his intended answer to the titular question, How Musical is Man?, with the qualification that this work - originally printed in 1973 - is \\"not a scholarly study, so much as an attempt to reconcile my experiences.\\" With this in mind, the reader should not be surprised to find a self-indulgent speculative which walks a fine line between narrowly focused ethnomusicologic comparative (Western society versus the Venda tribe of South Africa) and a loosely organized philosophical reflection. Ultimately, Blacking presents an indictment of Western culture with relatively rare bibliographic references. The absence of an index or collective bibliography, combined with the restricted assessment, limits the text's use as a convenient or scholarly reference. Nevertheless, it retains value as a time capsule of perspective from a pioneering ethnomusicological researcher.Blacking divides his discussion into four sections: I. Humanly Organized Sound; II. Music and Society and Culture; III. Culture and Society in Music; IV. Soundly Organized Humanity. Throughout, he raises further questions crucial to answering the overriding inquiry. He describes the first three chapters as an attempt to show how research in ethnomusicology may resolve myriad related questions. In the final chapter he endeavors to address why answering the question is essential. Somehow he never quite answers the question satisfactorily.After an enigmatic opening with what appears to be a feeble attempt at numerologic humor (\\"Ethnomusicology ... It's seven syllables do not give it any advantage over the pentasyllabic \`musicology.'\\"), Blacking's first chapter positions music as a species-specific sonic phenomenon we are compelled to organize and argues the need to look for patterns and relationships between musical and cultural behaviors. Blacking turns constantly, if monoptically, to his own experiences with the Venda tribe.Blacking goes on to insist the question of man's musicality cannot be answered without first understanding the processes of cause and effect, such as the issue of who performs, sings and listens to music and why. Here he also aptly suggests the social setting may at times even supersede the music in a culture's perception and that it is essential to listen with the appropriate cultural ears. Again he turns largely to the Venda tribe for examples and even provides an illustrated calendar of Venda musical practice and an complicated diagram of musical and social relationships in the Venda society.Ironically, while stepping on and off his societal soapbox, Blacking manages to critique the presumptive arrogance of narrowly focused Western musicologists and condemn the practice of apartheid, but he inherently accepts the Venda tribe's mutilation of women in their annual season of female circumcision. Contradictions abound.The book contains several confusing segues into self-indulgent recollections and intermittent non sequiturs, such as in the ultimate paragraph: \\"Even falling in love may be more significant as a cognitive activity in which learned categories are realigned, than as an exertion of the sex organs or a hormonal reaction.\\"For a scholarly tome suitable for extended practical shelf life from this author, one might do well to forgo his philosophical prattling for his actual research originally printed in 1967, Venda Children's Songs: A Study in Ethnomusicological Analysis (Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 1995)G. Galv&aacute;n"},{"Title":"How Musical Is Man? (Jessie & John Danz Lectures)","review":"I think all the people should read this book if not for anything else then to learn how to appreciate different musical styles and cultures. Every ethnomusicologists must."},{"Title":"How Musical Is Man? (Jessie & John Danz Lectures)","review":"This book is an amalgam of flaws and flawed thinking. For starters, the title is a complete misnomer: only two musical traditions are extensively analyzed while hundreds of musical traditions -Native American, South American, Aborigine, Middle Eastern, Tibetan, Asian, etc. are ignored. Not to mention the fact that the animal world -bees, whales, birds- is skipped entirely. Most of the book is spent bashing European music and society with the music and social arrangements of the Venda tribe in Africa. More exasperating, Blacking's method of proving a point is often simply to state it: \\"it is reasonable to suppose that music ... is a species specific trait of man.\\" What seemed like a very interesting thesis is, for the most part, finished with this statement!We are treated to page after page of Venda music, and told such earth-shattering truths as when analyzing music, we have to take into consideration the society that produced it. Maybe this book can be forgiven for expecting this to be a momentous insight because it was written in 1974 before cross cultural studies were common. Reading this in 2002, Blacking is simply a preaching to a bewildered crowd of the converted.Blacking also fails to make any distinction between songs composed for dance, for opera, for solo or choral performance, for ritual, for symphonies or any for any other type of music. He doesn't take into consideration that the inspiration for, say, blues, rock, and jazz, for classical and atonal Gregorian chanting may be quite different, that their functions may make for poor comparison. I lost the last of my tolerance for this book when, in the conclusion, Blacing decided to prove that purely musical considerations, such as \\"the logic of the melodic pattern\\" and tonal relationships, are not sufficient to analyze a song the Venda used to teach their children to count. Well, why should they be? This is the Venda version of Sesame Street ditties in which \\"on each half-note beat, a finger is grapsed and counted ... from the left little finger to the thumb ...\\" Who in the world would expect purely musical considerations to explain everything in such a pragmatic piece of work? Blacking utterly fails to take into account that virtually all of the Venda's music is of this sort-it serves a social or pragmatic function-whereas Western music has long since moved away from that into the realm of aesthetic expression.Even the section of the book in which Blacking tried to decide whether there might be universal aspects to music was an abysmal disappointment because he fails in any way to expound on his idle musing that music may have universal elements.By the time he gets to the conclusion, he will say a half dozen things about music that are either contradictory or simply hang there without any discussion, including the \\"hard task is to love, and music is a skill that prepares man for this most difficult task.\\" He states this on page 103 (of 116) without any previous mention of love in the context of music. Nor will he go on to prove his point, instead he will briefly and tangentially discuss this before moving on to how music \\"may represent the human mind working without interference and therefore observation of musical structures may reveal some of the sturctual pinciples on which all human life is based.\\" Indeed a revelation if only it weren't dropped on page 115 like paratrooper who finds himself utterly alone after the drone of the plane has faded into silence on the very next page. Perhaps the most absurd thing Blacking asserts in his conclusion is that \\"In order to create new Venda music, you must BE a Venda, sharing Venda social and cultural life from early childhood.\\" It's no more absurd than the claiming that for an author to portray a believable male character, she must be a man.\\"The chief function\\" -yet another chief function-\\"of music is to involve people in shared experiences within the framework of their cultural experience.\\" Once again, he states this as if it were a self-evident truth and makes no attempt to sway anyone who might be skeptical. What about those of us who lean more toward the belief that music can be, if not a universal language, at least more mutually intellgible than, say, Turkish and German? In other words, the belief that a German musician can convey much much more with a musical composition than he or she can with a lecture given to a Turkish-speaking audience? Transcending culture, seems as much an element of music as perpetuating it. What a shame such a fascinating topic was given such unforgivably narrow treatment.You are far better off reading what Mahler had to say about music (his are the most interesting quotes in this book) or, Igor Stravinsky's wonderfully concise and presented \\"The Poetics of Music.\\""},{"Title":"How Musical Is Man?

Pete Peterson and his motley crew of maybe-Chetniks maybe-Partisans cross Italy and Yugoslavia to deliver a message and unmask a double agent. The characters are MacLean classics: beautiful patrician women, evil assassins, stalwart companions, and a glib and brilliant hero. The plot meanders through the confusion of Yugoslavia's three-way civil war while under Italian and German occupation. A fun adventure, a light read, a real Alistair MacLean classic."},{"Title":"Partisans (Ulverscroft Large Print Series: Adventure, Suspense)","review":"\\"Partisans\\" is one of those disappointing adventure novels that build up a nice head of steam before crashing into a wall.During World War II, a Yugoslavian agent under apparent German command takes a team of compatriots deep into his native country, where Italian, German, and their Cetnik \\"allies\\" watch each other as suspiciously as they do their Partisans foes. The agent, Petersen, has a message to deliver, though what that message is and who he has to deliver it to is a mystery.What makes \\"Partisans\\" enjoyable is the leisurely way it begins, with much circuitous banter and some dark doings on darkened city streets and aboard an Italian torpedo boat. You know Petersen can't be working for the Nazis, but what about those with him? Who can he trust? Who can we trust? One settles in expecting a variant of the commando tales MacLean famously presented in such books as \\"The Guns Of Navarone\\" and \\"Where Eagles Dare,\\" though laced with a welcome sardonic edge courtesy of Petersen.Agreeing an attempted assassination against them was committed by amateurs, Petersen adds: \\"But the effect of an amateur bullet can be just as permanent as a professional one.\\"Or take his impression of an Italian officer he meets: \\"He's reasonable, personable, smiling, open-faced, has a firm handshake and looks you straight in the eye - anyone can tell at once that he's a member of the criminal classes.\\"As the novel goes on, you begin to realize it isn't going anywhere, that the banter is all you will get. The plot advances only because Petersen and his group keep getting captured by various forces who then leave them unharmed, which Petersen explains is part of his mysterious plan. A rotund pal drinks alcohol by the quart, while another keeps a strange, surly silence. A couple of women along for the trip call Petersen a \\"monster,\\" then break into tears over such things as having to ride a pony over a mountain.More annoyingly, one never is able to work out what Petersen is up to until the end of the novel, at which point he explains it all to you and his comrades in such a roundabout way none of it makes much sense.Maybe he was having a poke at the au currant thrillers of the time. When \\"Partisans\\" was published in 1983, MacLean was struggling with a form of novel he helped popularize but which had been picked up by more sophisticated writers like Frederick Forsyth and Ken Follett, who jammed labyrinthine storylines into books twice as large as MacLean's. Of course, MacLean's simpler stories could be quite wonderful, too, but here we are handed a plot so convoluted no one could understand it. Even the flap jacket for the original hardcover describes a story with little resemblance to what's in the book.That's a shame, because \\"Partisans\\" has the makings of a good tale, with interesting characters and a charged background of multiple, conflicting loyalties running riot in an exotic locale. MacLean throws a lot of plates in the air, and you wonder how he is going to get them all down. Then he surprises you by letting them crash to the floor."},{"Title":"Partisans (Ulverscroft Large Print Series: Adventure, Suspense)","review":"This is the weakest book of his I have read, and that is about thirty MacLean novels. I understand that he passed away prior to this book being published and that is was compiled posthumously. While admittedly not all of his books are great, I don't feel this is up to snuff with any of the others. Don't make this your first MacLean book and unless you feel the desire to read every one of his books like I choose to, take a pass on it. I am unwilling to touch any of the Alistair MacNeill books written using MacLeans notecards because I feel those are apt to be pretty weak too, and no one ever seems to duplicate the originals. If you are going to give a couple of MacLean novels a try, go for &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot;, &quot;Puppet on a Chain&quot;, &quot;Bear Island&quot;, &amp; &quot;Ice Station Zebra&quot;."},{"Title":"Partisans (Ulverscroft Large Print Series: Adventure, Suspense)","review":"While not quite plumbing the depths of the awful 'Goodbye California' or the boring 'Santorini', it's fair to say that 'Partisans' is one of Maclean's weakest books, and yet another example of his late-career decline. Despite returning to WW2, where some of his classic works were set, Maclean just cannot capture the magic this time around. Unlike his taut, fast-paced early thrillers, this a very loose, lightweight book that goes nowhere. It's the sort of book that's instantly forgettable; it's easy enough to read, but leaves no impression whatsoever once you've finished it. Years on, I still vividly remember the heart-pounding climaxes to 'The Satan Bug', or 'Fear Is The Key', or 'Puppet On A Chain'. But almost nothing sticks in my mind from 'Partisans', apart from an interesting torture scene involving a lethal injection, and the fact that everybody changes sides at least twice.All the usual late-career Maclean flaws are here. The impossibly brave and capable hero Peter Petersen, the \\"heroines\\" who are actually utterly clueless damsels in distress, the clumsily handled \\"no-one is really who they seem\\" plot twists. Despite being set in wartime Yugoslavia, the book is very talky and slow moving, with almost no action at all. In fact, very little of interest happens at all throughout the book, it's mostly the characters trading one-liners and complaining about being left in the dark by Petersen. There's certainly no sense of the bigger picture of the fate of Yugoslavia and the progress of the war itself.'Partisans' is not a \\"bad\\" book in the way 'Goodbye California' was, and it's readable enough. But it's nowhere near what Maclean was capable of, and will be a huge disappointment to fans of his early work. Newcomers should stick to his 50's and 60's stuff, and leave this one alone."},{"Title":"Partisans (Ulverscroft Large Print Series: Adventure, Suspense)","review":"Major Peter Petersen is sent to deliver a message in Alistair MacLean's PARTISANS, but suspicion is the vital element that insures survival in the deadly game of espionage during any war.

Yes, I am a Christian, but he surpasses my favorite Christian novelists Frank Peretti and Randy Singer. I will say Singer has the potential of surpassing MacLean; at present, I've only read one of his. But for an enjoyable reading that I feel will be of minimal offense to me, nobody can beat MacLean, even with his weaker material.When I read the blurb on the back of this novel, I was very interested; the novel did not resemble that blurb, but seemed more like a run of the mill MacLean novel (particularly one of his later stories).This story is one of those where he introduces you to a group of interesting characters, and then you find out who they really are at the end. \\"Where Eagles Dare\\" and \\"Breakheart Pass\\" do an excellent job at this, and even the novel immediately proceeding this one, \\"River Of Death\\", does a better job. The wrap up of this one is disappointing, though I like the closing better than some of MacLean's.This novel is, like many of MacLean's other (and better) novels, is based during World War II. This one is unique in its focus on Yugoslavia. I found it interesting that MacLean had written Cold War novels, where Communism is the bad guy, but this one actually looks at Communist Tito as a hero.In reading the reviews of MacLean's \\"River Of Death\\", there is a mention of MacLean's battle with alcoholism, which I never knew before. However, in noticing how some of his protagonists drink a lot without any negative consequences, such as the Professor in this novel, I'm not surprised.If you want to read MacLean at his best, I would recommend \\"Where Eagles Dare\\", \\"The Guns Of Navarone\\", \\"Breakheart Pass\\", and \\"Circus\\". However, if you enjoy MacLean, even in his \\"frozen dinner\\" years (which is how Stephen King describes his latter novels in \\"Danse Macrabe\\"), then you will enjoy this as well."},{"Title":"Partisans (Ulverscroft Large Print Series: Adventure, Suspense)","review":"You wouldn't think an action novel about Yugoslavia's brutal World War II occupation could sound like a drawing room comedy, but that's exactly what this is.Nazis and Italians occupy while the Communist Partisans, the Serb royalist Chetniks and the Croatian fascist Ustashe fight among each other, jockeying for postwar position as they try to wipe each other out. The Allies wonder which resistance horse to back. Everyone's loyalties are uncertain.Despite all this potential for action, three enigmatic Serbs escorting a mysterious crew into Yugoslavia on a nebulous mission do little but talk and talk and talk. They fence around their trust of one another as they make their interminable way into the frozen mountains.The Yugoslavs come off way too tweedy for folks who should be smashing glasses into a fireplace or reciting fatalistic Slav poetry. Maclean pays endless attention to their meals and sleeping arrangements and it's all so civilized. Doesn't he know there's a war on?He tries to build tension over the two ladies' regarding mission chief Peter Petersen as Not A Nice Man, with the readers presumably wondering same. It's all rather ludicrous. Petersen's subtle inferences about the others come off sounding too much like Agatha Christie for a World War II commando leader.Maclean pays lip service to the war's actual brutality. In his genteel war, people are tied up and gagged. Clever threats break hardened operatives in minutes without torture. Action consists mostly of, uh, fisticuffs, and hardly anyone gets hurt. Would that World War II had actually been like this, but verisimilitude, it ain't.Maclean doesn't plot it badly, ultimately addressing the complexity of this multi-sided war. He doesn't, however, introduce it soon enough, not until the last few chapters and even as it's being resolved. Before that, the book seems like a literary journey to nowhere."},{"Title":"Partisans (Ulverscroft Large Print Series: Adventure, Suspense)","review":"I wrote in recent reviews of Mankell and Leon mysteries that, after reading Sherlock Holmes and Helen McInnes, I had avoided mysteries altogether for many years, too boring.

I did read a few of his stories, and liked them, but I didn't read the famous ones and have forgotten exactly which stories I had liked (it was in the seventies, at latest). \\"Puppet on a Chain\\" sounds familiar.I picked up the Norwegian translation (\\"Partisaner\\") of \\"Partisans\\" cheaply in Trondheim in 1985 because I thought it might be easy, but my vocabulary at that time was inadequate for a novel, so I strained over the first 15 pages and then gave up. I read the first few pages again last night, and was amazed that I had marked a few sentences: in response to why the Scandinavian name \\"Petersen\\" (the name of the hero) is found in Jugoslavia, Petersen responds to the German officer in Rome that that can't be regarded as unusual, that there is, e.g., a village in the Italian Alps where the rest of a Scottish regiment landed in the Middle Ages, and where every second name starts with \\"Mac\\". What's funny is that I forgot that I had read this, but in 1/1988, with my then German girlfriend, we visited that village! It's named Gurro, lies in Val Canobino above Cannobio on Lago Maggiorre. They have a Scottish museum, and many of the men have red hair and faces. I didn't ask about surnames, though, although we returned to the village (an extremely stately mountain village half in ruin in 1988) and hiked in the region in 1995. Much more interesting is that this is a region where the old women still wear local costumes and use the kraxe (a wooden back-rack) for transport in daily life.

The last two characteristics make the book a little frustrating to read: Smith will not name names or criticize his former players or coaches, though if you are fan of Carolina basketball you will know the names to fill into the anecdotes and incidents he describes (e.g. J.R. Reid's suspension from the 1989 ACC tournament semifinal for missing curfew.) Nevertheless, it is far better than most other sports memoirs (i.e. he actually had a life off the court)and should broadly appeal to people not especially interested in basketball in general or Carolina in particular."},{"Title":"A Coach's Life: My Forty Years in College Basketball","review":"You don't have to be a UNC fan to appreciate this autobiography. All you need to be is appreciative of college hoops and about a coach and school that did things the right way for over 33 years. In the days of boosters, offering anything under the sun, and players leaping from high school or after their freshamn year to the NBA, it is refreshing to read about a coach whose players would do anyhting for their beloved coach and a coach who would still do anything for his former players."},{"Title":"A Coach's Life: My Forty Years in College Basketball","review":"college basketball's greatest coach chronicles his life and details the philosophy and principles which governed his life and his approach to basketball. after reading the book you will understand why many consider him not only the greatest college basketball coach,but an even greater man."},{"Title":"A Coach's Life: My Forty Years in College Basketball","review":"This book is wonderful. I respected Coach Smith as a basketball legend. After reading this book, I respect him more as a great human being."},{"Title":"A Coach's Life: My Forty Years in College Basketball","review":"&quot;A Coach's Life&quot; details the interesting facts of Dean Smith's story - from his childhood memories to his first coaching job to reaching the pinnacle of his career (winning the NCAA titles in 1982 and 1993). Along the way, you meet many people who enriched Dean's life and who, in turn, were enriched by him...there's Michael Jordan, of course, but Dean also reveals details of his relationships with a number of his players, associates and opponents, including John Thompson, James Worthy, and Frank McGuire, to name a few.To his credit, he avoids speaking negatively about others. It seems that he was operating under the axiom, &quot;if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything.&quot; This would explain the virtual omission of Duke head coach Mike Krzyzewski - glaring by its absence. So be warned - those looking for a mud-slinging expose' will be disappointed.But that's OK - Dean showed that he didn't have to write a &quot;tell-all&quot; in order to write a good book. It's just a story of a simple Kansas boy who found a way to make a difference in people's lives. And what's wrong with that?Rating: 4 stars."},{"Title":"A Coach's Life: My Forty Years in College Basketball","review":"This is the best book that I have ever read! I am a huge Tarheel fan and I totally loved this book! This is a must read! Anyone who likes Carolina will love this book!"},{"Title":"A Coach's Life: My Forty Years in College Basketball","review":"The book \\"A Coach's Life\\" written by Dean Smith, is a life story of one the best coaches to have ever stepped on the hardwood. This book starts off talking about Dean's childhood. He tells stories of himself as an athlete, playing football, baseball and basketball.As a senior, Dean coached the incoming freshman football players the plays. Dean Smith was then offered a head coaching position at Air Force. After the years at Air Force, Dean Smith was offered an assistant coaching position under Frank McGuire. It wasn't long until Dean Smith became coach in 1960-1961.From then on Dean went on to become one of the greatest coaches to ever coach in college basketball. Dean Smith won 879 wins, has gone to 11 Final Fours, and has won two national championships. Dean Smith went on to coach some of the best players who have played the game of basketball.The book is structured very well. It starts off by talking about where he comes from, his schooling, his athletic background, then his coaching career and then his overall thoughts on the game and his life.My overall evaluation is that this is a decent book. I loved the book, but keeping interest in the book would be difficult if you are not interested in basketball or coaching basketball. I have been involved with basketball for almost my entire life, so that it why I enjoyed the book so much. North Carolina has been my favorite college basketball team for as long as I remember."},{"Title":"A Coach's Life: My Forty Years in College Basketball","review":"Dean Smith is now known as one of the greatest college basketball coaches of all time. I choose to read this memoir because I have a love for sports. Also, I have a deep passion for college sports because of the atmosphere at every college game I go to. Dean Smith coached one of my favorite colleges in the nation The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.Dean Smith was just a regular boy that grew up in Topeka, Kansas. His father, Alfred Smith, was a teacher at Emporia High and also the coach of the basketball, football, and track and field teams. His mother, Vesta Edwards, taught all levels, from elementary to college students. She was also the church organist. Life was hard for Dean he lived in a two-bedroom house with one bathroom. He lived with his parents and his sister Joan. They also cared for his Grandmother Edwards who moved in with them when she was seventy-two.Dean went to college at The University of Kansas. He spent his first year playing freshman football and basketball and selling football programs at the home football games. Nowadays if you are a freshman in basketball and/or football you weren't able to play until you became a sophomore. He played basketball under the legendary Forrest C. \\"Phog\\" Allen. He had the utmost respect for him \\"It was impossible to play for those men and not learn something. (pg. 24)\\"Dean Smith would start coaching University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Tar Heels in 1961. Dean has created some of the best known coaching strategies of all time; he started the idea of huddling up at the foul line before every foul shot and the \\"tired signal\\" that his players would use to tell him when they needed a rest. He used the tired signal because he thought they best knew how long they could stay in for. Smith coached 36 teams at North Carolina and made it to eleven final four's and won two NCAA National Championships. He coached some of the greatest basketball players of all time such as, Michael Jordan (now known as the greatest basketball player of all-time), James Worthy and Vince Carter.This is one of my favorite books of all-time that I have read. North Carolina is one of my favorite colleges already and Dean Smith is a very famous person from UNC so it basically was perfect for me. Plus to add on to that I have a deep passion for sports and college basketball is one of my favorites. Dean throughout his career has learned a lot from some very smart people but the thing that I think he has learned the most is that if you put your mind to it you can accomplish anything."},{"Title":"A Coach's Life: My Forty Years in College Basketball","review":"The book was mostly appealling to me because of my love for Carolina basketball. However, the novel would be interesting to any basketball lover in that of the genius behind Dean's coaching strategies. He also sets a great standard for morals that a person should have in life. The book DOES travel into other sectors of life rather than just basketball. Dean Smith provides an excellent role model as his character is nothing less than the fine aspects of discipline, church, and honesty."},{"Title":"A Coach's Life: My Forty Years in College Basketball","review":"A true book by the greatest coach of all time.

I'll take Bobby Knight throwing chairs and tantrums anyday. However, if you're from Carolina or a UNC alum, ignore this review and buy the book right away. You'll never notice the shortcomings. Now, how about a bio of Dean's predecessor and mentor, Frank McGuire.(He first hired Dean as an assistant). That would be a story."},{"Title":"A Coach's Life: My Forty Years in College Basketball","review":"This book is boring and Dean fancies himself a martyr.

His \\"frontier thesis\\" was a brilliant innovative insight. Turner believed that a distinct American form of democracy evolved from the constant tension between the settlers on the frontier and the interaction with native populations. Democracy among white males was advanced because people needed to come up with ways to maintain order and establish institutions on the border of civilization and barbarism.Turner has been criticized by revisionist historians of the modern age. They argue that the definition of indiginous culutres as barbarous is a racist model. \\"Progress\\" should not be defined as one culture advancing while another one diminishes. Turner's model is held in contempt by many observers.I believe that the criticism of Turner is anachronistic. He was a product of the Jacksonian mentality of Manifest Destiny. He looked at progress in terms of more autonomy for white settlers to create their own institutions and to run representative bodies free of an entrenched aristocracy. Turner's work was revolutionary for the time. It is right to question whether his assertions are all correct. However, he should be rightly recognized as one of the few groundbreaking individuals that had a lasting impact on American historiography. His work reveals the mindset of a previous era. He should not be expected to relay the sentiments of a twenty-first century model of diversity."},{"Title":"The Frontier in American History","review":"This book provides a reasonable perspective of the attitudes regarding the frontier in an expanding United States. Vestiges of these attitudes can be seen today with regard to areas of scientific exploration. The prose is a little dry, but the research done by the author seems solid."},{"Title":"The Frontier in American History","review":"The idea that the frontier is crucial to the development of American civilization has been one of the major themes of American history. It has also led to endless speculations as to what the closing of the frontier has meant. And it too has led to speculations about the search for new frontiers including the one in space. We went as far as we could to the West and then we went up.I cannot evaluate the accuracy of the Turner thesis. I remember however that his idea that it is precisely the settled people of the East, the veterans who head out for the West gave me the idea of Americans as a people in constant motion away from their old and hopefully toward their new and better self."},{"Title":"The Frontier in American History","review":"Mr. Turner ingeniously express's who we are and the reasons why. This work produced last century harbors a number of ideas on what made this country the greatest nation in the world. Mr. Turner correctly weaves his thesis on the frontier in a very short span.By reading this work you will realize what separates the United States from every other land. All other works on the history of this special place we call home are details and footnotes on the events that have taken place over our brief span of time."},{"Title":"The Frontier in American History","review":"It took me a couple of days to notice, but why is Frontier misspelled in the title of this book? And who published it and where are they located?"},{"Title":"The Frontier in American History","review":"Although this book is now considered by some to be politically incorrect and by others to have been superceded by later research, it is an important introdction to the ways in which the frontier experience has shaped American culture. From the time of the first European settlements on the East Coast until the 1890s, when Jackson and others first recognized that the American frontier had disappeared, the possibility of farming/mining/foresting new lands had always be a possibility for Americans and an attractant for European immigrants. This was a basis for Americans and other to think of the U.S. as a land of opportunity. An excellent read and a good introduction to a fascinating subject."},{"Title":"The Frontier in American History","review":"Current US international policy shows just how brilliant and enduring Frederick Turner's Frontier Thesis really is.The basic idea is that after the initial explorations by Spain, England, etc., the real colonisation of America was a flight from conditions in Europe (including Ireland and Britain) which led to a European-style culture and settlement of the East Coast.This led to a second flight from European-like influences into the interior - which simply pulled European-style culture further west. And so it continued until Europe finally reached the West Coast.There are numerous ramifications of the thesis, including the &quot;force majeur&quot; (might=right) attitude of the settlers towards the Native Americans - with its ominous overtones on the eve of war in the Middle-East.As far as I understand it, for all the &quot;warts&quot;, Turner was looking to UNDERSTAND the American mentality/culture, as shaped by by historical experience, and the Frontier Thesis is a critique, NOT a criticism.Read this book and gain a whole new, or at least greatly expanded, view of what it means to be an &quot;American&quot;."},{"Title":"The Frontier in American History","review":"The other reviewers offered boilerplate accounts of THE essay that changed American History without mentioning the reasons of its true significance. Frederick Jackson Turner explained how the Frontier purified Democracy as settlers crafted governmental institutions to meet their needs. From the West came suffrage for women, coeducational colleges, direct election of senators, and Social Welfare, as the vastness of the West taught citizens to act collectively when solving problems beyond the capabilities of individual settlers. Rugged individualism remained the ideal, while in practice, government became the agent of change. These purifying affects emerged as prime motivations for Americans to expand Anglo-American civilization beyond the shores of North America after the Frontier closed. Shortly after Turner's address to the American Historical Association in 1893, the Frontier Thesis justified the intellectual argument for American colonization of the Pacific and Caribbean Basins prior to the Spanish American War in 1898. The Frontier Thesis and Turner's following essays influenced U.S. presidents and foreign policy from that time forward including the current \\"informal empire\\" that spans the globe. Turner's essays will be a historical Rosetta Stone for young historians deciphering the twists and turns of American foreign policy throughout the twentieth century and beyond."},{"Title":"The Frontier in American History","review":"This is an interesting book. Well written, although at times painfully, soddenly dated (and I do not criticize the historic tone of voice nor the apparent biases of this emminent historian--prejudice, in itself, is an important contribution to the understanding of American history as it is learned--), The Frontier in American History develops an original idea of American expansion into empire.Portions of this book are very relevent to the present, showing Turner to be an ambitious and far-reaching historian of the past. His chapters on the general influence on American government of the midwest are fascinating, especially in the light of present day hindsight. The shift in moral vision of people founding early regions of the American colonies and post-revolutionary national expansion, in a great sense, explores both the influence and subsequent dismissal of east coast religious Puritanism and the 'witch-hunting' mentality of the people. Of course, subsequent to this volume, (and even during its publication), that very religious notion shifted to the fear-mongering operation of federal government and explains something more of the fearful consistancy of American character. This book shows the manner in which religious and political interests have been and continue to be polarized based on the presumption of self-interest and regional safeguarding.An important book well worth yet another reconsideration in the light of current international events."},{"Title":"The Frontier in American History","review":"This is one of those oldies that people should read for the same reason they should read Tocqueville and folks like that: Much of what's in here is still more or less true, and the bits that aren't provide important fodder for understanding how where we've been explains where we've got to. A bit of a slog in spots, but worth it."},{"Title":"The Frontier in American History","review":"The title says it all. It's a basic history book covering the population of the American Frontier.

By far very disappointing read."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Calls to mind \\"The Brain Hunters\\", the great 1940 novel about eugenics, racial stereotyping, global geopolitics and the influence of the Third Reich on the Fourth.The chapter on pets got me very emotional, and made me think differently of my own dog, Peter.I don't know where to start! This novel is a pager turner of an incredible story with an abyss of emotional depth that will leave the reader spent, shaken out of his or her wooden workaday existence. The descriptions of the dust-bowl and the Depression (the period following the stock market crash of 1929) made me weep more than once. The cast of characters calls to mind Dickens, and the presence of artificial limbs is outright Melvillian. Features also the excellent use of a fey man as the embodiment of a wooden, post-columbian textual figure. A must for teachers, students and parents who care about the rainforest.I just bought three of these to give out as birthday presents this year. And plan to buy more for Christmas. This is definitely a heartbreaking work of incredible genius."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I only read the first 50 or 60 pages of this book, but in that brief space I saw several things the reviewer below me talks about. I gave the anglo/new england/southern slang mix-ups a pass -- at one point Smith notes that the son is purposely affecting his Brooklyn accent. Also, these are characters who have lived in a lot of different places, so I can imagine that their language would pick up a bit from here, a bit from there.The reviewer below me is spot on about the facile characterizations, tho. Uptight, white, male academic; earthy, forgiving, sarong-draped black wife; earthy, forgiving, black wife of other academic. The characters didn't move beyond these types for me. And then we meet the celebrated & somewhat intimidating (to KiKi -- earthy wife #1) poet who says in her first speech in the book, \\"The sun is a lemon today, it is. It's like a huge lemon-drop.\\" Yup, our hip, sophisticated poet says that. Maybe later in the book we find out that she's the Thomas Kincaid of poetry but I couldn't be bothered to find out. If Smith can't take the time to put something a little more interesting, or heck, even a little less embarassing, in that character's mouth, then I can't be bothered to read her book."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"\\"On Beauty\\" is my first Zadie Smith book. And I have to say that I am better man havinig read it. The book is divided into three parts. Part I: an introduction to the Belsey-Kipps rivalry. Part II: development of the Belsey household. Part III: the \\"explosion.\\" I term part III the \\"explosion\\" because I have never busted through 100 pages faster in my life. Everything falls together. You have to be patient in this novel. Often, in the first two parts, you're asking yourself what's the point. But part III is where everything takes off. My only complaint about this book is that Smith leaves the reader wanting more, resembling the disingenuous approach of Howard, one of her characters."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"If I could, I would have given this book a \\"O\\" I didn't write a review of it a few months ago, when I tried to read it, as I was too busy- but I have read many of the posted reviews and found them to be much more accurate than the reviews in the mag/papers. I love E.M. Forester(sic) and Howard's End is one of my favorite books in the world- after Proust. I bought the book in hardcover shortly after its publication. I could not believe how bad it was. Having paid close to 30.00 for it, I was determined to finish it. I couldn't. It was painful. At least with Danielle Steele you get what you expect. I agree with the reviewer from England who says more or less, \\"The worst part of this is that Smith has received such acolades (sic) for it- i.e. a finalist for the Booker. Its enough to make one believe that \\"multi-culturalism\\" and \\"political correctness\\" has ruined literature and criticism. When Frank Rich, an intelligent man, though admittedly not a literary critic waxes eloquent about this book, then I know that I, my husband, (a distinguished Professor of American Literature) and a very small handful of people, must be the only persons in America that can still recognize a good from a bad book. Good: Charming Billy (Alice McDermot) (sic) Bad: Gilhead by \\"I'm trying to forget\\" I saw a piece about her(Smith) in Vogue- that exactly where she belongs- and even then, since I enjoy V.'s as a pastiche of American pretensions."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"In Zadie Smith's third book, On Beauty, she returns to the woderful storytelling that she showed in White Teeth. This time she brings the story to America, to the fictional Wellington College, in Massachussetts. Howard Belsey is an Art History professor there, specializing in 17th century art. He is an Englishman, married to a woman from the Carribbean, Kiki. Their marriage is based upon that in E.M. Forster's Howard's End (a book that I strongly suggest reading, or re-reading, after or before you have read this one). However, instead of a mixed-class marriage, theirs is a mixed-race marriage.Kiki and Howard have three children: Jerome, who remains firmly fixed in the white world of their father; Levy, who maintains a black identity; and Zora, a brilliant student at Wellington, who is stuck in the middle between black and white. How their try to reconcile the difference is at the heart of this wonderful novel.Their peace is shattered when Monty Kipps comes for a short stay to teach at the college. He is a professor of Black Studies, and married to a white woman. Monty and Howard are professionally at odd ends, and they bring their rivalry to the front during faculty meetings.This is a wonderful story, with mixed and hidden messages. Reading Howard's End will help to partially solve some of the mysteries that this book contains."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I had the unfortunate obligation of reading this novel for a class. The characters feel like caricatures fumbling around each other with never the right words for the situation they find themselves in. Most of the book is composed of awkward dialogue, with the characters either being too polite or too aggressive. Yes, Smith is trying to convey how different people of different backgrounds clash yet still try to get along, but for the reader's sake, it would have been nice to have a little more flow to the book. The book should have been titled _On Social Anxiety: When People Who Are Different Interact_, because that is its major theme. The thing is, we don't need a reminder of how different we all are. We're living that every day. We don't need to read a novel to realize that.Lastly, I don't know what all those positive newspaper reviews were reading, but this book was not funny -- at all. I didn't laugh a single time."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I was reading this book for a book club but really could not get interested in the the first section. I am glad I kept reading as the last 2 sections were very interesting. A good book for a book club discussion."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Well, this novel by Zadie Smith was selected for our book club. After reading the first chapter, I realized that this had a similar plot as E.M. Forrester's Howards End. Although I had a good idea where this was leading towards, it came to some disappointment about the character development in the book. Also, I found myself predicting the scenes ahead of time and finding a slightly interesting twist in the plot. Smith seems to have a strange depiction about kids growing up in today's society. We see how Smith tries to transport the Edwardian time into the present time with a upper middle-class black family. Things fall apart when another family with higher status moves into the neighborhood. If you are not familar with Howards End, then I feel that you may enjoy the plot more than me. But, you probably will feel a slight indifference with this modern family since they are all equally bad except for the wife and perhaps the son who was rejected by the daughter of the other family. This is just my own opinion but there are bad sides to people but characters are just as diverse as us. Plus, I am old-fashioned critic and it would be more constructive with a clear protagonist and antagonist. There has been plenty of praise for this book and I guess doing something over again with your own style should be recognized. I just feel that if you are going to do it again then keep some aspects of the book that is true to the characters. I just believe that there is some good in everyone."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I loved this book. As the daughter of a professor and an adjunct professor, I found humor and truth in the book."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I enjoyed this book a lot. Zadie Smith is a young,sophisticated voice in the otherwise plain landscape of new writers. This book is not exceptional, but it is outstanding in the subtelty the author employs when discussing the complex realities of race and academia. I don't think this will be the author's best (I personally found White Teeth to be an even more rewarding reading), but it is definitely book worthy of a reader's time."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I know that White Teeth was one of those polarizing books...either people loved it or they didn't.I loved it.Saying that, I found On Beauty equally funny, and well written.Summary, no spoilers:In a nutshell, this is the story of the Belsey family. The father, Howard, is a white man married to a black woman named Kiki. Howard is an oddball professor at what is supposed to be, a liberal arts Ivy League school.Kiki is a large woman, in many ways. She is full of life, and love, and has also put on a lot of weight since giving birth to their three kids. She is the anchor of the Belsey family, but she must deal with betrayal when she finds out that Howard has been unfaithful.The other family in this book are the Kipps. The father is a well-known black conservative named Monty Kipps. He is very religious, and conservative, and against affirmative action. Exactly the opposite of the Belseys...Needless to say, the Belsey's and Kipp's clash. The book features the interplay between the Belsey's and their children, with those of the Kipps, involving not the least, sex, love, and true friendship.I don't think anyone does dialogue better than Zadie Smith. And she is able to get in the minds of middle age white men, as seemingly easy as she does teenage black rappers.Zadie Smith has become one of my favorite writers. She is one of those authors who's new book I will run out and get in hardcover....and read immediately.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I read \\"On Beauty\\" based on its favorable reviews and my fondness for \\"White Teeth.\\" However, I was disappointed to find \\"On Beauty\\" a shallow and immature book with underdeveloped characters. Equally bothering to me is the cultural context, which does not ring true. I have lived in the Boston area most of my life and am an academic. Smith's knowledge of Boston is slight and removed, while her perception of academia is that of a student. In addition, she has a weak grasp of American English. These problems combined to destroy this reader's \\"willing suspension of disbelief.\\""},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Zadie Smith's latest novel, ON BEAUTY offers fans of WHITE TEETH a new story with new characters rendered in that same exquisitely touching and genuinely funny voice. Despite some unfortunate reviews, ON BEAUTY is a predominantly successful modern twist on E.M. Forster's marvelous HOWARDS END. I will not bother rehashing the details of the plot (others before me have done an exemplary job on that front) except to say that Smith moves Forster's novel of elitism in 19th century London to a 21st century Boston suburb adding in the elements of race, gender, religion, politics and a modern perspective of sexuality. In Smith's hands academia becomes the perfect setting for this novel of personal and political passions and her fictional college, Wellington, succeeds as an obliquely disguised Harvard.Sadie Smith has a rare gift for rendering each character perfectly within a well-populated novel. No character lacks for development. Each member of the Belsey family, including the extraordinarily endearing (Kiki), her aging, defeated, unfaithful husband (Howard), their brilliant but socially inept daughter (Zora), their oldest son and the Christian rebel of a secular-liberal family (Jerome), and especially the troubled, passionate youngest (Levi), has their chance to shine in near-perfect prose. Even the minor characters get their moments of well-delineated glory. In short, Smith is able to create novel in which a large number of characters is a blessing rather than a distraction.Many reviewers have commented upon Smith's use of language and perceived a lack of ability to master American dialect. But I failed to find this either offensive or distracting. (I also must note after having lived in Boston, that her New England Caribbeans speak rather authentically.) That aside, language is an essential element of this book and virtually all the characters come from linguistically mixed backgrounds. Levi's inept use of \\"street\\" language seems quite intentional and emphasizes the truth about his background: he's the child of a professor who has spent his life near colleges and universities, yet wishes to be authentically \\"African American\\" in his manner. And he is not supposed to be able to pull that off very well! The same may be true of Kiki: raised in south Florida, well-educated and married into academia, she is caught between many worlds and obviously fails to fit authentically into any of them. As you read this wonderful novel, please keep in mind that language is fluid. It develops and changes under the influences such as family, friends, the media and the environment that surrounds the speaker. Rather than disparage the characters for the way they speak, simply allow yourself to follow the rhythm and substance of their language. That is the heart of the novel. The dialect may not adhere perfectly to your conceptions of how a person a particular station or socio-economic status might speak, but I believe that THAT, for Smith, that is the very point. Elitism and conformity are but contrived conceptions. Beauty, both physical and perceived, is what is real."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"My vantage point allowed me to enjoy On Beauty and I've already picked up a copy of White Teeth. I can understand the negative comments about lack of character development and the lack of maturity on the part of the young author whose own beauty, race, and cultural background apparently made her a prize of mass media, but since I live outside the US and haven't been asaulted by media hype, and because I'm not a jealous-wannabe-writer, I can't sympathize with the viciousness of the reviewers who give On Beauty one star. On Beauty entertained me; it did not enlighten me, but I did not expect this of a simple novel. I enjoyed the verbal interplay of the characters but felt disatisfied with the ending. The structure of the novel is the flow of life of a couple of families. We step into the flow at the beginning of the book and step out at the end. There is no Beginning, Development, Denouement. By the time I reached the end, I had imagined several possible endings which could have been better than the real one, so I did feel a bit let down."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I am tired of books about writers. I'm more tired of books about academics and universities. I give a free pass to Nabokov and that's it. This is purported to have such a great ear for language and move so seamlessly between these different races and classes and I didn't buy a bit of it. It lost me for good at the scene at the spoken word/poetry jam. Ultimately this could turn out to actually represent reality but I certainly hope I would never know about it. Goofy. The snarky Haitian guy, what? Maybe literature is becoming so narrowly focused that it's just writers writing for writers and reviewers (being writers) getting all fired up but it's getting lost on me."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I found this book lengthy, depressing, and the characters incredibly unlikeable. Smith infused White Teeth with humor and characters, that although flawed were always relateable. On Beauty is just not another White Teeth, and I did not like it at all nor did anyone else I know who enjoyed her debut novel."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Irritating, interesting and sometimes hilarious book with a cast of multifaceted characters. However, some of them float in and out of the book as an afterthought (e.g. Jerome). Some of the characters were a bit forced and unrealistic (e.g. Levi, Vee) and turn out to be quite annoying. There is also a LOT of crying in this book . . . EVERYONE cries, the men, the women ...I mainly kept reading to find out what would happen as the tension kept rising. Some of the discoveries are scandalous, others not quite so, but it was strange to see how some of the issues that came out were not dealt with upfront. There was always an air of not speaking about it out loud, which I think just added to the frustrating side of this book.There were times, as this book takes place in the US and in the UK, you were not sure where they were at times. It got a bit confusing that way and had to take a step back to see that no, Wellington is in fact in the US.Likes: Howard, even though he was a bit of an arse; the humor; Monty, so pompous, hehehe.Dislikes: over and irrelevant use of tough, wannabe African-American talk (note: pimps, gangsta, sista, brother . . . too much), near maniacal obsession with the plight of Haitians."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"This is a tribute to EM Forster's Howard's End. It shows the conflict between two families based on class, culture, literary values and moral sensibilities. This was there in the beginning of the 20th century England and is portrayed in Boston in on of the old colleges there. It is full of petty feuds, academic and professional stepping toes, silly pride, but completely cut off from the outside world that is full of poverty, crime and fear. They live in an academic bubble. There is also race and nationality in this mess, which was not present in Howards End. This is due to the fact that a lot of the literature has in part been affected in the recent years by these factors. It is independent of the status of the person, no one is immune to it in the present day world.The story is about Howard Besley, a Rembrant scholar, who has no knowledge of the outside world. He has an academic rival, Sir Montague Kipps, a conservative who is against affirmative action and a racist. His wife develops a relationship with Kipps' invalid wife. She bequeaths her an immensely valuable piece of Haitian art, a legacy the Kipps family tries to block (just as Ruth Wilcox leaves Howards End to Margaret Schlegel). It shows the relationship between the two families, its diversities and all the pettiness. The novel shows great refinement in language between the different people, and is very funny. Due to the number of types of people, she shows diversity in language and mixing it with great brilliance. It is her best novel since White Teeth. This is a wonderful novel and confirms Zadie Smith as one of special novelist of this generation with an understanding of the mind and the heart and how to mix them."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"What a waste of talent! Feeling like a rising star, Zadie Smith obviously wanted to score high points fast. That she is an aspirant for glory is the lesser sin, though. Those who short-listed her book for the 2005 Booker prize are the true sinners. A book so short of cultural depth and so devoid of structure, not to mention of full-fledged characters, cannot--and should not--be elevated to a standard for good literature.There is no doubt that Zadie Smith has a very talented pen. But at her early age, there also is no doubt that she lacks life experience and a mature concept of the literature's mission: to educate emotions, to reflect on sublimity and tragedy, to explore the human condition in its evolving dimensions. A book should be judged relative to its author's aspirations. Smith's ambitious project, with its 443 pages, leaves no ambiguity as to her desire to match the great novels of the past.The classic elements are there: family saga (not one but two families), generational conflict, class opposition, love and betrayal, etc. But all this is amorphous, without a solid composition, logorrheic, and, at the end of the day, meaningless. It even smacks of snobbery. People like me who are life-long insiders in academia can only have a jovial laughter at the tasteless treatment of professors and students offered by this writer. Her characters are entangled in sex--and adultery, of course!, old-fashioned sholarly leftism, teenage rebellion, and confusion about the value of art. I even cannot say what Smith thinks about family values. All her characters, except perhaps Kiki, are flawed without awareness of the roots of their flaws. Their lives suck without us knowing why. Maybe because their creator wanted them to look stupid and ridiculous?So, is this book a condemnation of academia? Or a laudation of artistic freedom incompatible with academia? Or maybe it is a statement about dealing with racism on both sides of the Atlantic? No message, if there is any, of this book, is clear but that this author, brought up in the conflicting values of today's Anglo world, is unable to outdo her own limitations."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"This is the story of two families, the Belseys and the Kipps. One based in London, the other in the States. One conservative and Christian and the other liberal and 'god-aversive'. The patriachs of each family are academics and take opposing views on artworks of Rembrant resulting in an 'academic fight' that encroaches on other areas of college life and is further intensified when their families become entwined through relationships between their children and wives.The story is not only about the obvious clashes in viewpoint but a close examination of academia - the high morals, competitiveness, a critique of sorts of the meritocracy and the strange closeted environment of colleges.Initially I found the story slow and was wondering what was the point, but the story really hits a home run in the last quarter."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I waited for this book to come out in paperback and pre-ordered. I am a fan of WHITE TEETH, and, although AUTOGRAPH MAN was boring, I had high hopes for ON BEAUTY. Sadly, this writer should stick to what she knows -- a visiting professorship doesn't make her an authority on campus life in U.S., New England, or what American kids say and do. The assumptions and voices given to her characters are distracting in their outsiderish author's depiction, and I found this to really get in the way of her stoytelling--especially her stabs at Boston and southern accents. Her British characters (especially Howard and V) are well drawn and speak naturally--reminiscent of WHITE TEETH. They are believable. Her Americans are laughably off-base and seem like charicatures of how an arrogant Brit might imagine them, especially Levi and Carl. The character Zora (modeled on the precocious author herself?) is not likeable at all. The story of Jerome and his pursuit of religion is choppy and not well developed. He slides in and out of the story. The Furthermore, her story line about campus politics is lackluster. Another reviewer references Kingsley Amis's LUCKY JIM. I recommend Richard Russo's excellent STRAIGHT MAN for anyone interested in the liberal arts dept / tenure / backstabbing /cheating plots."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"In ON BEAUTY, nominated for a Booker Prize, Zadie Smith writes about two families in academia. Howard Belsey is a Caucasian British liberal transplant, teaching at a fictional university in Massachusetts, living with his non-academic African American hospital administrator wife Kiki; and their children, Zora, Jerome and Levi. The Belseys are pitted against-- well, at least Howard is-- the Kipps family composed of Trinidadian conservative scholar Monty; his wife, Carlene; and their two children, Michael and Victoria. These two families intertwine themselves in more ways than a crazy quilt. While Howard and Monty carry on a very public feud at Wellington University, Kiki and Carlene become friends-- sort of-- and the beautiful Victoria mixes it up with just about everybody.Ms. Smith spins an entertaining story that lopes right along; but she also raises questions about art, religion, race, class, family relationships, friendship, fidelity in marriage, etc. She makes insightful observations about the human animal and can be so good with words: \\"Each couple is its own vaudeville act.\\" Kiki at one point says about her son Jerome that \\"You don't have favorites among your children, but you do have allies.\\" While that statement probably isn't true, it's certainly a good way to say it and Kiki probably actually believes it. (Hemingway expressed it better, saying that he didn't love an older child more than a younger one, but that he had loved the older son longer.) The character Carl folds \\"his arms across his narrow filleted chest, every rib as visible as it is upon a cat's belly.\\" And surely everyone of us can swear by this statement: \\"It is an unnatural law of. . . parties that the person whose position on the guest list was originally the least secure is always the first to arrive.\\" (And I should add, often he is the last to leave.)The least interesting parts of the novel are Howard's analyses of Rembrandt's paintings. His pedantic ramblings didn't convince me that he knew what he was talking about; on the other hand, I find a great deal of art criticism decadent. Sometimes Levi gets a little tiresome with his rapper talk; but perhaps if I were 18 and trying to find my way amidst a often deliciously dysfunctional familiy, I might have a different opinion about him. The men-- Monty and Howard, that is-- both behave badly, and for all their differences, ultimately are more alike than either one of them would admit.Ms. Smith's attributing her husband's poem \\"On Beauty\\" to the poet Claire (although she acknowledges his authorship in her ending notes) is an example of chutzpah unadorned. Surely a writer as skilled as Ms. Smith could have written a poem of her own. (The things we do for love.) This rambling, ambitious novel nonetheless is certainly well worth reading and runs over with an enthusiasm that can only come from a young writer."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I am not sure at all why this book became as hyped as it did, but I can't agree with the over-assessment of it. There is much talent here, and an energetic cast of characters but it strikes me as false, and lacks alot of depth. Perhaps I am wrong, but I just couldn't understand why it was lauded. Smith seems to stay on the surface and this is always interesting and lively, but it isn't a work of literary brilliance, though highly entertaining (which is alot in itself). I wouldn't have minded if it had just been noted as such."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I was so bored by this book that I was unable to finish it. I know that it isn't really fair to write a review of a book I couldn't finish, but then I realized that the fact that I was unable to finish it (and I am an avid reader, and not too hard to entertain!) really said a lot.I was expecting something pretty good, since there is a lot of hype around this book. I have not gotten around to reading White Teeth (and now may not even bother) and probably I should have read that first. But I found this book to be a rather pretentious, dull, and even stilted rip-off of the great books about class and manners. HOWEVER, in contrast to those great books, there was not one character in this book who could hold my interest. I really agree with one of the other reviewers who said that the characters were not really humanized at all. I just could not relate to them or empathize with any of them, which really surprised me. Furthermore, the writing style - which I suppose was attempting some sort of idea of refinement and breeziness - literally put me to sleep. Literally. I fell asleep twice while reading this. I had to read it for a book club, and I am not one to shirk on reading, but I just could not muster up the ability to get through this one. Highly overrated, in my opinion. At least wait for the paperback - I felt like this was a waste of 25 bucks."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"After reading White Teeth I was expecting this novel to be of the same calibre, sadly it is not. The plot is very jerky and the characters are under developed. The idea for the novel is good but it does not hang together well. White Teeth's weakness was it's ending and I think this novel has the same weakness or more so, a novel that seems to go nowhere, shame as it had so much potential."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"This is not a great book. Certainly don't rush to buy it on hard cover. The plot is somewhat disheveled, although some of the characters are well drawn. The most annoying thing about it is that Smith fails to understand and hence accurately render the African-American adolescents she depicts. Their language sounds constructed and forced. The prose also gets profuse at times. I don't recommend it. Buy Ishiguro's book, _Never Let Me Go_ instead."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I really struggled with whether to give this book two stars or three. Zadie Smith's writing is so superb that for a time I tilted toward the higher rating.But I opted for two because of so many glaring weaknesses: missing are plot, storyline, character development, tension and a realistic understanding about race in America.Mostly I found that I didn't care about anyone in the book. I wasn't curious to know them better or, really cared what would happen.And I also think she really should stick to writing what she knows--and that is NOT race in America. It's not even race and immigrants in America. She hits so many false notes that they ruined the beautiful music of her writing.For example, when I ask myself what distinguishes Kiki as \\"black\\" my only answer is her stereotypical obesity. (And yes, statistically, most African American women are obese). She looks like a mammy. Otherwise, for most of the book, she is strangely devoid of culture, beliefs, history, family, friends, politics--you name it.But no mother of black sons, whether she lives in a city or a suburb, can afford to act as if color does not matter--not in America. We have a violence here that permeates everything. Often it is black on black violence. But nonetheless our violence devours young black men. Mothers here (and father's too) are vigilant about the minutiae of their son's lives--the size, style and color of things like t-shirts, baseball caps and blue jeans.And the mother of a black boy who doesn't come home at night doesn't talk like Kiki does in this book--like a white mother--about how she's not his \\"jailer\\" and oh well, she just doesn't know what to do. No, the mother of a black boy wonders if he's dead.And were Howard a recent immigrant I would understand his ignorance, but no one who has lived here for any length of time would fail to understand and be terrified for their sons. Were this a deeper book, that fear could have been used as one of the more obvious reasons Howard has a fling with a white woman--it could be an expression of his wish to escape, if briefly, the tremendous difficulties that come with having to worry incessantly about blackness--something that was probably foreign to him for much of his life."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"\\"On Beauty\\" was chosen by my book club, and soon after I heard a lovely interview with the author on the Diane Rehm show. I was really excited to read this book, so imagine my disappointment when I found a book in which characters were undeveloped and uninteresting, not to mention unfathomable, and in which there were no discernible themes. There was nothing beautiful about the book, and honestly I found the highly sexualized content of her writing offensive because it added nothing to the story or to my understanding of the characters. All in all, a depressing read, all the more so because Smith is clearly a gifted writer. Perhaps as the author matures she'll have more success at developing characters and themes that actually mean something. We agreed at book group that this is a sophomoric effort, and all wondered how in the world it got published. I had bought \\"White Teeth\\" at the same time, but couldn't bring myself to read it after finishing \\"On Beauty\\". The photo of the author on the back is the only thing beautiful about this book."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I rushed out to buy this book based upon the terrific reviews it received, especially from the New York Times (both Sunday and daily editions). And I loved White Teeth. But this book absolutely made me cringe. I must admit I was unable to get past the first 150 pages. To get that far required a major amount of willpower... I kept waiting for it to get better, which it didn't.The portraits are so self-conscious and false. Not a single character rang even halfway true to me. And the dialogue...so phony that the author's not especially skilled hand, was evident everywhere. If the author thinks she understands the United States, even New England...she is wrong. One year at the Radcliffe Institute does not, obviously, an expert make.An homage to Forster's Howard End...I think not."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Based on all the rave reviews that this book received, I should have loved it. Instead, I had to force myself to complete this pretentious, plodding bore, since I truly hate to give up on any bookI found the characters to not be at all well defined. Just when I though I might get some deeper insight into one of them, the author moved on to another character. The book starts out with e-mails from Jerome to Howard. Very interesting. However, Jerome essentially disappears from the rest of the book. Claire, Carl, and Levi - I was waiting to find out a great deal more about these characters, but instead I had to read the boring and incredibly predictable scene in which Victoria and Howard have sex (honestly, who was surprised by this?) What is the hot, sexy college student Victoria's motivation for wanting to have sex with the 50ish year old Howard? This is never explained. And in the end, when Howard spurns her further advancements, do we find out anything more about her? No. We do however find out that Howard simply likes her. Why? What's to like?I also found the story to be incredibly disjointed. Various story lines were started and then dropped. Howard's visit with his father, the developing friendship between Kiki and Carlene, The painting that Carlene \\"willed\\" to Kiki, Jerome's Christianity and many others. None of these things were explored to their fullest.The author must have been paid by the word. There are numerous page long plus paragraphs that say absolutely nothing. This book needed a better editor since it could have been shortened by about 100 pages and we wouldn't have missed a thing.Another reviewer recommended Richard Russo's STRAIGHT MAN and I couldn't agree more. It is a wonderful book about academia. Better characters, better story. Give that one a try instead."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Yes, this book is about two families, PC, Academia, Rembrant etc but really it is about how ZS gets some of the characters from the inside. Howard Beasley, Zora, Isaac, and from the outside: Jerome and most of the family of the rivals.To me what was wonderful was when two characters we know from within are sitting or talking together or, with Ziki and Howard, making love.The richness of this book is in that psychological intimacy, more imo than the ideas, which surround the characters as they do us readers, more or less. But what's really earth-shaking and great fiction is how ZS does let us in and once in, we can become that character, flawed and all. I think that is her gift independent of the various subjects that are really no more pronounced in our lives than in theirs: The PC College or the black/white stuff is all around us as well, but what is formost is our ways of knowing ourselves and each other, what Zadie Smith can do, and can avoid. So for me, what is genuninely wonderful about this book, is how when she enters Nora, we are inside too, and when she doesn't enter Monty he is seen only thru others. I can't be perfectly clear here and so will try again later. But for now, I noticed mainly how she can slip into one or many characters so that it's not plot-driven as much as a psychological study, and we become the characters. Very special writer."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Just don't bother.It's seldom I quit reading a book I've started, but I wish I had quit trying on this one.Cartoon characters, no depth. Plot? Are you joking?Don't bother, really."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"This was my favorite book of '05. I haven't enjoyed a novel so completely since Middlesex or The Corrections. It's a rich comic novel, not gimmicky, well-developed charcters, great style."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"As others have pointed out, the book has obvious flaws, but it may well have strengths that are less obvious.Smith is not accurate at social description, as for instance in her faulty understanding of the American vernacular. Nor does she seem to have mastered that particular brand of Standard English that is employed in elite American universities, where, to give an example, a scholar would not say, as she has her Howard say, that he would be \\"happy to drop everybody [with his car] where they need to go.\\" In elite American English, that would be \\"where he needs to go.\\" And she is not accurate, either, in the details of academic politics. A non-tenured professor would not be asked to chair a major university-wide committee. And the timetable of tenure decisions is not as she says.All this suggests that Smith has not done the careful research about American academia that was done, for example, by Ian McEwan about a medical specialty in his \\"Saturday.\\" But this question of a novelist's research also raises the issue of just how much a novelist can indeed learn by spending a few months, or whatever, in an environment in which he had been previously unacquainted. Can he, or she, find a satisfactory shortcut to the deep understanding that comes from many years of immersion in a social milieu ? When a writer like Simenon, say, writes about the streets of Paris (where he was not born, actually), he writes with an authority that is immediately apparent, and this without the \\"research\\" of more with-it writers.In any case, the inaccuracies in Smith's book are often more than made up for by her right-on skewering, in the manner more of a cartoonist than a reporter, of the inanities of academic windbags. She has both \\"liberal\\" and \\"conservative\\" academics hold forth with humbug that is exactly, though not literally, accurate.After Pablo Picasso made a sketch of a \\"peace dove\\" to support the Communist-inspired peace movement back in 1949, Joseph Stalin, then still more-or-less alive, complained that \\"Comrade Picasso is a great fighter for peace, but he is, alas, a lousy artist.\\" Well, Comrade Stalin was looking for a photographic accuracy in the details of the dove, and when he didn't find it, he thought that the art, or non-art in his eyes, was \\"lousy.\\" The lines, the form, the inspiration that others drew from Picasso were all lost on him, no doubt because they were not obvious to a General Secretary of the Communist Party."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I just finished this novel a couple of days ago. I envy Zadie Smith. She is a superior writer and novelist. The intricacies of her stories astound me.I especially enjoy the way she can switch between different characters voices as narrators' so effortlessly. Her prose is amazing.I want to share one favorite quotes from the novel.\\"This is why Kiki had dreaded having girls: she knew she wouldn't be able to protect them from self-disgust. To that end she had tried banning television in the early years, and never had lipstick or a woman's magazine crossed the threshold of the Belsey home to Kiki's knowledge, but these and other precautionary measures had made no difference. It was in the air, or so it seemed to Kiki, this hatred of women and their bodies - it seeped with every draught in the house; people brought it home on their shoes, they breathed it in off their newspapers. There was no way to control it.\\"I love Zadie Smith's writing. Absolutely love it. She is my new favorite. But I recognize the fact that her novels are not as accessible in terms of content to a lot of people. She makes reference to tons of authors, artists, and other \\"bourgie, frou-frou\\" culture that your every day run of the mill average joe might not be familiar with--and I can see how that might turn some people off onto reading her. Also, her novels are a bit difficult to grasp in their entirety--very intricate, detailed, multi-layered. However, I love her references to popular culture juxtaposed against the supposed \\"high-end' culture that she also writes about. This trend is even more evident in On Beauty than her previous novel White Teeth (which I also love).A substantial portion of the theme and content and characterizations of On Beauty deal with the idea of academia versus such things as Hip Hop Culture. Or upper-middle \\"white\\" class versus working \\"ghetto/immigrant\\" class. She weaves these themes throughout the novel in ways not always directly evident but often just implied, glanced at, thought about quickly--that is the beauty of Zadie Smith's writing. She can make references to Rembrandt and Tupac. To Karl Marx, Mozart and \\"the fattest man in rap. . . a 400-pound, Bronx-born Hispanic genius\\" who \\"only 25 years old...died of coronary (I assume this to be Big Pun ).This novel is the struggle of a mixed race family with forming an identity, of mixed economic and home country origins and mixed career and life goals. Are they \\"street\\" in touch with black/african/african american culturel like Levi wishes so vehemently to be, Florida-country super woman like Kiki, astutely academic minded like Howard and Zora or religously enlightened like Jerome.They are actually, as a family, very far from any of these characterizations, and yet, each one has an extreme influence on who they are as a whole--they would not be the same without each one. With a family full of such polar personalities you would think it was a wonder that they still manage to love through the very rough times they encounter throughout the course of the novel. But Smith makes it very simple to see that love does exist, not always, maybe not fully, but underneath it all where it matters the most.Please read this novel sometime in your life. AND read White Teeth as well. :) Zadie Smith my new hero.p.s. I love the hip-hop savy, savaant, character named Carl who blows the academic folks away--at least in my mind."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"On Beauty made me remember why I loved Zadie Smith so much.On Beauty begins with an introduction to Howard Belsey, a middle-aged Englishman living in a wealth suburb of Boston. Howard teaches Art History at a college that reminded me of &lt;a href = \\"http://www.wellesley.edu\\">Wellesley&lt;/a>, with the exceptions that Wellesley is not co-ed and Wellington, the fictional equivalent is. Howard is introduced to us at a time in his life when most people would consider him struggling - he is a Rembrandt scholar that does not have tenure, cannot finish his book and has recently been caught in an adulterous affair with he and his wife, Kiki's, best friend.Kiki and Howard have three children - Jerome, Levi and Zora. The three children have their own issues to overcome. Jerome is completely disgusted by his father's behavior and becomes a devout Christian in order to come to terms with that behavior. Zora, a sophomore at Wellington, is a feminist who is trying to set herself apart from the legacy or lack of it that her father has at Wellington. Levi becomes enmeshed with urban, hip-hop and Haitian culture in an effort to distance himself from his family's upscale lifestyle.These players are pitted against the Kipps family, their opposites in every way, shape and form.I loved how Ms. Smith deftly intertwined all of the characters in this novel and developed them. From start to finish, you could see how the characters morphed and changed and learned. It was amazing. At the same time, she raises issues of economic class, race and gender as well as family relationships, marriage and friendship. There were some parts that I skimmed and could do without. I did not like Levi a lot of the time - I thought that he whined a lot and it got old after a while. There were also some parts of the novel that dealt with analysis of art that I did not enjoy in part because I did not know the piece that was being discussed and had no frame of reference.

My loss.I clicked on 'add to cart' for one reason only -- I was looking for a very long audiobook to occupy some long walks, and 'On Beauty' -- at 20+ hours -- fit that requirement perfectly. In the beginning, I admit feeling as though I'd come in late -- I couldn't quite figure out who these people were, or why I should care. That didn't last long -- about a half-hour in, I was hooked.This may not be the greatest book of the year -- I did love some of Smith's throw-away observations (eg,the least-wanted party guest always shows up first) which matched my vision of reality perfectly. I don't quibble over Kiki's down-home talk, even though she's a professional -- she's talking to her family, for crying out loud. Don't we all speak differently at home, than we do in professional settings?I also appreciate the fact -- the very rare fact -- that Smith is at least fair to the religious and conservative visiting professor. Most authors, sadly, would have trashed him for his ideas alone. Instead Smith created a very real character -- he has his faults, like everyone else, but she doesn't ridicule his philosophy. If anything, she gives him a fair chance to present his views. That's unusual, among the left-leaning literati who seem to dominate the scene.The narrator is great, by the way. So good, you forget you're listening to just one man reading the whole thing. The characters come alive through his narration, each speaking with perfect definition.In all honesty, I probably wouldn't take the time to read this book, but as an audiobook, it's great entertainment. I found myself looking forward to the walking errands, so I'd have a chance to listen again."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"After the excellence of white teeth, this is a poor effort. First I don't think the author should try to write a book based on life in America because she clearly does not understand it. I don't know the basis of her research and I don't want to paint with a broad brush BUT, the children of academics and most middle-upper middle class black and well read people do not speak \\"ebonics\\". Most cannot even relate to the characters she miserably attempts to portray. I did not buy into the story or any of the characters. After a few chapters, I found myself annoyed by the baseless story, lame dialogue between the family members. I hope the author goes back to what she knows and does best - stories of characters based in England. Glad I didn't pay for this one!!!"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"The book has nice prose passages, especially when the siblings are interacting. Other than that ...I'm impressed by Smith's knowledgeable treatment of Rembrandt, although the relation between art and reality as illustrated by the lives of the two families is a bit obscure and feels forced at the end.Now that I've dispensed with the book itself, I have a plea to everyone who has been mis-using the Forster quote \\"Only connect\\". Read the quote --it is not about communication, but self-integration. \\"Only connect! That was the whole of her sermon. Only connect the prose and the passion, and both will be exalted, and human love will be seen at its height. Live in fragments no longer. Only connect, and the beast and the monk, robbed of the isolation that is life to either, will die.\\"Sorry to be nitpicky, but it is one of the great quotes of all time and it makes me sad that so few people understand it."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"\\"On Beauty\\" is Zadie Smith's glorious third novel. Howard Belsey is having a difficult time. He is still in the doghouse after a one-night stand. Then he learns that his academic adversary, Monty Kipps, is joining the staff at Wellington, the Bostonian university at which Howard teaches (which seems to be based on the Harvard Zadie Smith knew as a Radcliffe fellow). Howard, whose unfinished magnum opus is entitled \\"Against Rembrandt: Interrogating a Master\\", ironically casts Monty as an iconoclast: although Monty's targets are political, rather than artistic. It is Howard who is the direct opposite of a Simon Schama or a Harold Bloom. Howard and his liberal colleagues fear that the conservative Monty will argue against Affirmative Action and the unqualified discretionaries that they allow on their courses. It doesn't help that Howard's son, Jerome, has previously engaged in a brief connection with Victoria, Monty Kipps' exceedingly beautiful daughter. Howard's daughter Zora (whom Zadie Smith has named after literary heroine Zora Neale Hurston) jealously regards Victoria as a vacuous beauty. However, not all of the Belseys' are at war against the Kipps': Kiki, Howard's wife, finds a common shelter with Carlene, Monty's friendly but sometimes distant wife. Meanwhile, Levi, the other Belsey child, embarks on a quest to assert his black identity, and falls in with a crowd of deprived Haitian immigrants. Along the way, they encounter Carl Thomas, a young black poet with conscious hip-hop lyrics, who strives to make something better of himself.Carl is the Leonard Bast, Carlene is Ruth Wilcox, and Kiki is Margaret Schlegel, in Zadie Smith's reworking of E. M. Forster's \\"Howard's End\\". In this, Zadie Smith seems to be taking her cue from Elaine Scarry's essay, \\"On Beauty and Being Just\\" (which Zadie does acknowledge to be one inspiration for the title of this novel). Scarry's thesis starts out with the observation that Beauty leads to replication - the artist sees a beautiful bird, which leads artist to paint the beautiful bird beautifully. Thus does Zadie Smith embark on a seemingly perilous voyage to reproduce a book she loves. It would appear that it's okay for a beautiful boy band to reproduce the millionth version of \\"Unchained Melody\\", because we don't expect much of the poor darlings: it is not okay for a respected literary novelist to do the same, because we expect so much more from them. That, at least, is the initial perception. But if one thinks of the origins of storytelling - bard on rock embellishing the already fantastic tales of his predecessors - then what Zadie Smith is attempting to do here does not seem so strange. However, it just seems more acceptable nowadays for the oral culture (boy bands) to do it, rather than the set-in-stone literary culture. At times though, it does seem as though Smith is following E. M. Forster's line too far - the aborted rail trip to Amherst reads uncomfortably due to this - Carlene's terminal spontaneity could have been revealed in a more original way. Yet, the final analysis must be that she uses her source material very intelligently and subtly. Although Zadie Smith seems to regard Roland Barthes as being very dry (no doubt due to the utility of his prose), \\"On Beauty\\" could be seen in some ways as indicative of \\"The Birth of the Reader\\", with the reader going so far as to create their own version of the text (although I prefer to see the relationship between author and reader as a dialogue, which is a whole lot less dramatic than this birthing and dying and circle of life kind of thing). For instance, Leonard Bast pursued Beauty in \\"Howards End\\" through books and impromptu midnight walks. Although \\"On Beauty\\" is in some ways a love letter to \\"Howards End\\", in its wit and vitality, the love goes both ways, resulting in a novel that is very much Zadie Smith's own. On a mundane level, there are scenes set in Zadie's homeland, Willesden, just like \\"White Teeth\\". On a more sublime level, Zadie Smith's voice in this novel seems liberated, exuberant, and confident: she is a novelist who is in full command of her literary powers. \\"On Beauty\\" is very much her book, full of her character, her twists and turns, rather than E. M. Forster's. To paraphrase a popular film of the 70s, it's she who is the master now.There is another more practical reason for Zadie Smith's employment of \\"Howard's End\\", other than her love for the novel. Current day America is analogous with Great Britain at the end of the Victorian era. Zadie Smith does know that there are many Leonard Basts out there in America: in pursuit of beauty, but angry and resentful because they have been deprived of it, or because it has been literally robbed from them. Just as the liberal women debate how to save the Leonard Basts of this world from their fate in \\"Howards End\\", so too do Howard and his liberal colleagues battle to save the discretionaries. Can Beauty ever be reached in an inherently unjust society? Zadie Smith has produced a very timely novel, as the truth in her novel has been made self-evident by the ugly catastrophe of Katrina.It would also be a pleasing irony if a Great American Novel, (as \\"On Beauty\\" is), were to win the Man Booker Prize. Zadie Smith should walk off with the prize in my view, because this outstanding novel deserves nothing less.I have created a comprehensive reading guide for \\"On Beauty\\" on the internet - interested readers can contact me for the hyperlink."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"It is not totally impossible that Zadie Smith named the main character in \\"On Beauty\\" Howard, so that reviewers could say that this book is about Howard's end and \\"Howards End\\". Puns aside, this magnificent novel has a lot to do with E. m. Forster's masterpiece -- so much so that that she even states in her early acknowledgements that her fiction is indebted to him and she wanted to make a homage.Any good reader can say that it is a hell of homage. \\"On Beauty\\" begins virtually like \\"Howards End\\", but instead of letters, here we have e-mails -- this is the XXI Century after all. Most of the important events in Forster's novel are here in a way or another. The main narrative follow two families, whose both patriarchs are British, but one of them lives in United States and the other in England. But it doesn't take too long for an incident that will join -- in spite of separating, at first -- these two families.Howard's family, the Belseys, live in Wellington, a college town in New England. He is married to an African-American woman and they have three children. He is a professor and has been working on a book about Rembrandt. After he has an affair with a colleague, his oldest son moves to England to the Kippses' house. Monty Kipp is Howard's nemesis. To his disappointment his son falls for Victoria Kipps and he goes to the old continent to sort things out. This is just the beginning of the mess that will be brought to the two households.Smith follows, most of the time, Forster's novel, updating the conflicts and characters. Nevertheless, the most important thing is, she has her own voice, therefore her \\"On Beauty\\" reads like a homage, like a re-read of classic and not plagiarism. \\"Howards End\\" is only an \`excuse' to her novel -- actually it is more than this, but this is a way of putting the connections.Since her first novel, \\"White Teeth\\" Smith has been interested in Forster narrative, his speech and the way he tackled English society of his time. In that book she dealt with a multicultural London where many ethnicities were \`forced' to share the same space and time. The results were mostly hilarious and heart-breaking. At the same time, she was criticizing the globalization and the search and lost of one's cultural and social identity. Her prose was light and fast -- some sentences were as quick as a heartbeat. She tried to capture slices of lives from one cover to another -- and she succeeded most of the time.With \\"On Beauty\\" she hasn't changed her interests. However she sure is a more mature writer. Dealing with less characters and plots, Smith is able to go deeper both in the people and situation she created. Most of the folks here suffer an arc from the beginning to the end, their lives are dramatically changed and we follow a very believable process. In the end, one can notice that the Belseys and the Kippses aren't the only ones who a different. And sensitive person who reads this book will also feel that something unusual happened to his/her feelings and senses. And Smith assures the place of one of the best novelists of our times, of her generation, of contemporary Britain, of...whatever category she can be placed. Period."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"What could be more beautiful than a family? Why, the debacles of two of course! Awarded the Orange Prize for Fiction, On Beauty follows the Belsey and the Kipps families through 443 pages of shenanigans that only family can forgive.The Belsey family is made up of Howard and Kiki who are the parents of Levi, Zora and Jerome. Howard is a white Englishman and Kiki is a voluptuous African American. They've been married thirty years and have lived the last ten years in a Boston University community where Howard has been an art history professor. Kiki, once an activist, works at the local hospital.The Kipps, an all black family from London, includes Monty and Carlene as the heads and their children Michael and Victoria. Monty is also an art history master and Howard's arch nemesis and vice versa. Circumstances lead the Kippses to the same town and same university as the Belseys where frictions arise between the men and the siblings.The ongoing racial and art war going on between Howard and Monty is what drives a wedge between these two families. Howard is for affirmative action and Monty is not. Their battle has been in the newspapers, on the radio, in interviews and in books. Now it's on Howard's home turf; except he hasn't been given tenure yet. Only Carlene and Kiki are willing to put past differences aside and co-exist amicably.The characters don't stop with these two families. There's the antiquated university staff, knowledge hungry students, angry Haitian street vendors, melodramatic Hip Hop writers and both talented and untalented poets. All these relationships show a definite balance of wants and needs; and haves and have nots.Zadie's character development made me want to follow these two families through their day to day lives and interactions. Now that it is over I still want more. There are a lot of characters, main and supporting but all have a purpose, even a young child prot&eacute;g&eacute; who's only mentioned in a page and a half. Her perspective, given by the narrator, lends to Howard's personality.On Beauty is rich with the emotional turmoil of love, hate, deception, redemption, politics, art, racism, acceptance and of course the draw beauty has on us.My favourite character in the book is Kiki. I love her name, I love her body and I love her personality. Kiki is resentful for having been isolated from other black people. \\"Everywhere we go, I'm alone in this... this sea of white.\\" She made me laugh, she made me cry, she made me proud. She is a large beautiful woman who carries herself well despite her husband cheating on her. She uses this heartache to locate the woman she once was and to build on the woman she has become. Her self-acceptance is inspiring and she is the character who has grown the most by the end.I've probably made this sound like quite a serious book but it was really quite light hearted and amusing. The humour of every day life and how silly people (young and old) can be is around every corner. The storyline is intense enough to peak your sense. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Reviewed by M. E. Wood."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I cannot believe this book was nominated for a prize. I had to leave this book after giving it a few chances - it was just babbling and pointless."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"There were too many weak males to call it a good book. Certainly makes for an interesting book club discussion, but not a book I'm anxious to share with friends."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"A story about a very liberal mixed race family living in a Cambridge-like college town, how they live, and how they nearly implode. The story centers on the Belsey family, and more so on Howard Belsey, the British-born art history professor hoping and waiting for tenure at Wellington, a fictional stand-in for Harvard or some other small, elite, ivy-walled university.I found Howard hard to like. He makes a marriage-threatening mistake, and just when it seems the relationship might heal, he makes a similar, ickier mistake. But beyond that, he is self-centered, cornering conversations, even with his college-age children who might have something to say. He doesn't permit the family to celebrate even a secular version of Christmas because it assaults his atheist and non-commercial views, he only allows abstract art to be displayed in the house despite what his wife loves, he doesn't support his eldest son, Jerome, after a heartache because the girl comes from a religious family (and is the daughter of his academic foe), and he doesn't take Jerome's growing Christianity seriously. So he's a pretty rigid, my-way-or-the-highway liberal.But even though he's not likable as a &#34;person,&#34; complicated characters like Howard are awfully fun to come across in a book, and Smith gives us many such characters. Howard's wife, Kiki, is an African American nursing administrator, a stout-hearted woman from the south and an earthy foil to Howard. She can turn on the southern sass, but never becomes a caricature. During a long period of marital crisis, she strikes up a lovely friendship with an unlikely newcomer in the neighborhood. Jerome is the quiet, spurned, Christian boy getting his education at Brown, so therefore away from the action for most of the story. Daughter Zora is the ambitious, entitled middle child, a student at Wellington who takes a forceful, activist role that blows back in her face. Levi, still in high school, has adopted a more urban, &#34;street&#34; persona that runs counter to his upbringing but represents for him a more authentic way of being black.Beyond interesting characters, Smith gives us much to consider about race, religion, art, politics, liberal, conservatives - all the big stuff, and she does it in a natural way, as these themes arise in the course the normal goings-on within an academic community. Heck, I'm pretty left-leaning myself, yet got a better sense of a religious, conservative view of homosexuality from a speech made by Monty Kipps, an art history professor new to Wellington, an Howard's more celebrated rival.So yes, a great book, and one that will send me to the library looking for more of her titles."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"This book was an easy read, but it definitely had me bored more times than once. It's mainly about the complexity of a multiracial family, but it kind of just glazes on the surface of this topic. I kept wanting Smith to go deeper, and her characters were too under-developed. It was funny at times, and had me laugh out loud on numerous occasions. I don't like how she didn't really include any dialogue between Kiki and Howard after his affairs with other women became common knowledge. I wanted to see that play out, instead of just reading about their independent thoughts and feelings about it. I really liked her writing style..just not so much the content, which is probably a bit more important."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"This is coming from a person who reads mostly nonfiction and is looking for something different. There's a great plot, memorable characters, quality writing, there's some suspense, but it doesn't feel like characters are machines set up to drive the plot to the last page. Some loose ends are needed to make a story more lifelike, and that is here in just the right amount in this book."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"This novel is a slice of several cultures I have little experience with: East Coast black urbanites, Ivy League university life, mixed-race families, London, art history and beat poetry. Many have criticized the story for its inauthentic dialogue and slow pacing. I can't speak for the dialogue except the words sound true to me though I do understand why others had problems with it. The apparent slower pacing worked well, I thought, because the prose was much more introspective. This book allows you to immerse yourself in each scene and each exchange of dialogue, and the added commentary is more like our own loose reflections on daily life, which give it a realism that others might find slow or irrelevant."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Considering the awards it won, this should be a great book, but I found it very unengaging. The author sets up any number of interesting subplots (son of H is about to wed daughter of M, his arch enemy; K gets cheated out of inheriting a valuable painting by her deceased friend's family) but all these conflicts somehow just evaporate. Considering that the first 200 pages of the book are the setup, and the second 200 are one expectation after another thwarted on the part of the reader, this makes for very disappointing reading. Add to that that every character manages to lose our sympathy the second they gain it (K and C seem to become friends, even though every single recorded conversation contains snubs and misunderstandings) and I had the hardest figuring why I should care about any of them."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"This is an engaging novel of large scope, and with well-defined, vivid yet believable distinct characters. The writing is deft and mordant, without tipping into hilarity. A tale of tensions between and within two academic families, it revolves around Kiki, the wife and earth-mother figure of the Belsey family. Her feckless husband Howard betrays her and their children in myriad ways yet remains likable in a pathetic way, an object finally of pity as much as censure. I \\"read\\" this as an audiobook, ably narrated by Peter Francis James, whose deft handling of the many voices resolves the criticisms of reviewers as to Smith's treatment of dialects."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Zadie Smith brought me back around to being a fan of her writing with this book. I loved White Teeth, but was disappointed with The Autograph Man in all kinds of ways (though her writing ability is evident in anything she writes). On Beauty is a return to the insightful, panoramic vision of White Teeth. A large cast of characters handled deftly, and each one of them intimately rendered. I wouldn't say this novel has a plot so much as many incidents that eventually arrive at an amazing conclusion. Smith is a very English author (the novel is a spin off of an E.M. Forster novel), and it comes through in this book, even though she takes on American characters as well as English characters in this book, and spends a lot of time in American settings. Because of this, she's able to create American characters that feel almost more authentic than many American writers have rendered. Looking from the outside in has provided her with a fresh perspective. Recommended for readers who like a side of characters with their characters."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"This was the first book I read by Zadie Smith. The hype around this young author and the mixed feelings reflected and expressed by most reviewers triggered my curiosity. So I started reading it with a sense of anticipation, however I was disappointed almost immediately.I think the story and all the characters in it are poorly developed. I always finish a book that I've started, even when I don't like it much, but I must admit that this was the first time ever that I really struggled to get to the end, it was so boring it often became soporific. It was a relief to turn the last page.On a more positive note, I do believe that the prose was very good and the style original. That's the only reason why I gave it 1 star. And that's also the reason why I'm going to give this author a second chance and shall read White Teeth soon."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Great book, and very humorous too. Well developed characters and plot line. The writer manages to convey the idea that we are all humans, after all, and thus falible and lovable. Still, actions have consequences - and on this ground, what surprise was the end! I went from hating-this-character to liking-this-character and then found myself wondering why, since no character in the book is completely likable. It was nice reading about the faades and the beauty of human nature... and how its consequences can be at the same time terrible, funny and long-lasting. Would suggest it for a book club, if I had one!"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Don't let the title mislead you... The book is indeed about beauty, but also about contradictions, love, cheating, family. Two completely different men, one liberal the other conservative. Their families. But are they really so different? A book not boring at all and that, in the end, really is 'on beauty'."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"The title suggests an essay. And it _is_ an essay with persons of flesh and blood. Each of the persons in the family, their friends and their foes, pursues their own idea of beauty. In doing so, they contradict themselves, get into conflict with each other, they develop, they question their own and other peoples' beliefs, as real persons do. And no, &#34;beauty&#34; is not just arts (they get their fair share, though), it is also the beauty of your fat wife after 30 years of marriage, the beauty of watching a football match with strangers in an English pub. And no, Zadie Smith does not take sides. She lets all her persons collide in the next-to-final showdown - all raise their axes in judgement, and lets them sink again seeing the other's axe hover over their head. The book ends in ... a painting, the two main characters seeing the painting, and we, the readers, watching the two.I recommend every reader to look up the art works named in the book. They are part of the book, characters in their own right."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I had decided that Zadie Smith was not an author that I would like to read (Smith being an author that a pretentious friend \\"LOVED!\\") Luckily it was a book I took the time to know so that I could judge it - and it turned out that I really enjoyed it. The theme of infidelity infected my mind and made me think about real-life relationships."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Zadie Smith's 'On Beauty' is beautifully written with a compelling plot. She once again tackles the portrayal of an intercultural family, as in White Teeth, however this time the action is largely situated in Boston, though occasionally drifts back to London. The novel confronts everything that White Teeth attempted to do (underwrites the importance and normative value of intercultural/racial families in our society, confronts racist tendencies in our communities and selves and wrestles with the qualifiers of identity) without the overwhelmingly broad set of characters and plot points. This time around, Smith narrows down her focus which enables her to reinforce the plot in an articulate and convincing way.Loved it!"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"However one feels about Zadie Smith, this clearly is her best book. The parallels between this and EM Forster's Howard's End are very much worth exploring throughout and make for fun conversation while Smith's ending might be one of the most beautiful in contemporary fiction."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"The characters felt fake and forced. I think the author harped too much on ethnicity. It didnt seem to be a major them, but he just kept going about it. Also it really failed to keep my attention. There was really no point to it."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Once I started this book I could not put it down. There was no mercy on this family.

While it is well-written, I couldn't help wondering why it was written."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I read this book 2 years ago, and I must say, the more I reflect on it, it's really an excellent book. While I was reading, for some reason, I was resistant to it's charms... I wanted to put it down, but never did. And now 2 years later, here I am looking for something good to read, and came here to follow the \\"People who bought this, bought that\\" link in hopes of discovering something equally terrific."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"The Belsey family is about as screwed up as a family can get. The teenage/young adult children speak to their parents irreverently, the parents seem disconnected from each other, but yet, somehow, the love that they all have for each other is obvious from the start. Howard Belsey, the patriarch of the family, however, has no love for Monty Kipps, a rival college professor and someone whom he has challenged professionally for years. But Howard's son, Jerome, is interning for Monty and has fallen in love with Monty's daughter Veronica. This is only the beginning of a story that has the Belsey family intertwined with the Kipps family at every twist and turn.The Belsey family struggles in many ways - Kiki attempting to overcome Howard's infidelity, Levi, ony 16, trying to find his way in an adult world, Jerome struggling with finding his own identity in the shadow of his parents, and Zora trying to choose between being sensual female and a true intellectual feminist. Each of the characters interacts with a whole host of other characters that bring this book alive.Set in a conservative college town in the suburbs of Boston, the actual story line of On Beauty is not that original in and of itself. It involves professional rivalries, love won, love lost, and friendship. It deals with standard coming of age difficulties. But what makes this novel fantastic is the excellent character development. The characters simply come alive and the writing makes you feel as though these are actual people you know in a town that you have visited. The author reveals the plot in a seductive way - only a little bit at a time - letting the story cleverly unfold to keep the reader interested. But when she reveals the next piece it is without fanfare - as though you were aware that that particular piece of the puzzle was there the entire time.A truly enjoyable character driven novel. Zadie Smith continues to craft enjoyable reads that you can really sink your teeth into."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"It was a little slow to pick up, but once it did, I had a hard time putting this book down. I even got sunburned today trying to finish it at the beach. Smith tackles a lot here: race relations, infidelity, religion, hypocrisy, and inter-generational misunderstandings. With some exceptions, I think she is largely successful. I found each of the characters interesting and sympathetic (or just plain pathetic) in their own ways, but I was rooting for them regardless. Some aspects of the story were a little far-fetched, but Smith is able to get the reader to buy-in enough, that it doesn't matter. This would make a really interesting movie, done right of course. In the meantime, a great summer read, with substance. Pick it up!"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"On Beauty starts out so promising, but quickly loses its way. A drama about two men (Howard Belsey, a liberal, non-religious English man, and Monty Kipps, a conservative right-wing Christian) who teach at a fictitious university outside Boston and their families has the makings of a great story.Unfortunately, while it may impress intellectual critics, it fails to draw in the average reader. The initial few pages set the stage with Jerome Belsey sending e-mails to his father while living and working with the conservative Kipps family. After those few e-mails, the story never connects the dots. There is no lack of characters: Howard Belsey, Kiki Belsey, Jerome Belsey. Zora Belsey, Levi Belsey, Monty Kipps, Catherine Kipps, Michael Kipps, Victoria Kipps, faculty from the fictitious university, a group of street vendors and the people who make up the fringes of the school; however, we learn very little about any one character and On Beauty jumps from story to story with no actual beginning and no conclusion.I finished the book only because I hoped to grasp a \\"greater\\" purpose this cast of characters would reveal but, if there was one, it escaped me."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Zadie Smith is a good writer, although a somewhat sloppy writer. She makes mistakes (\\"obverse directions\\" should read \\"opposite directions\\"), and sometimes she shows signs of haste or of a tin ear (\\"slanted sails blowing about on perforated seas,\\" referring to textual oddities). She can also be very funny (describing a theory of \\"women's punctuation\\" for example, or using the phrase, \\"Umbrellas, like dead birds after a shooting party, pile up in the far corner\\"), and can be both funny and accurate (\\"Howard could not piss next to people he knew\\").In this novel she tells a fine story, or rather a series of stories, and to my mind has captured the dilemma of mixed race families perfectly. She can bring the reader's emotions up in her description of a death of a friend, or a character's gut reaction to hearing music sung, or the tenuous, anguished life on a non-tenured professor. And she does a real number on Ivy League colleges. Where I lose her is in the area of \\"Beauty.\\" What is it and who can describe it? There is much discussion of Rembrandt and of the depth of his vision, but Rembrandt also created some obscene etchings that were lodged almost out of sight high on the walls of the Norton Simon Museum when I first saw them.My enjoyment of the book was enhanced by Smith's occasional ear-perfect perceptions, like this one: \\"[People] continuing with these banal little English catchphrases that never failed to drive Howard up the bleeding wall. His childhood had been shot through with this meaningless noise, just so many substitutes for real conversation. Brass monkeys out there. Don't mind if I do. I don't fancy yours much. And on.

Ignore the fuss and read something else."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"The story is weak and the characters meaningless. I never reached a point where I could relate to or sympathize with any of the characters. The story never really developed, it just seemed to wander without direction.

And now you've been hearing about \\"On Beauty.\\" Some say it's brilliant, some say it's boring, and you're not sure if you really have the time or the faith to give Zadie a third go.All I can say is, for those of you who have been wading through Zadie Smith novels, admiring her cleverness, her zippy characters, and her fabulous ear, but wondering where the real soul is - you'll be rewarded for your patience in this book. \\"On Beauty\\" contains multitudes - the state of academia, the state of the family, the state of countries and marriages and young women who hate themselves, the random nature of loveliness in our lives, and the crazy things we will do to grab hold of or destroy it. And while Zadie pulls in threads of everything from art history to hiphop to Haitian politics to poetry, she never veers off course, masterfully keeping her imagined world tightly drawn and alive.One more note: I happened to own both the audio and the book and after some switching back and forth, ended up listening to the audio, simply because it was so enjoyable. I highly recommend it - the reader does a fantastic job with the varied accents, and this is a perfect story to be told."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Zadie Smith builds interesting, complicated characters in this book. Set in an east coast college town and in London, it paints an intriguing picture of faculty life, politics and the raising of families with different ideals. It is a good book for a book club discussion as it touches on the subjects of ethics, morals, family values, world and local politics, career choices and more. Most of the characters ring very true with one or two exceptions. All in all, a good read."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"i am very disappointed in this book. after all the rave reviews i read i was expecting much more. its just rather dull. the language is stilted so it sometimes hard to figure out what they are talking about. the characters are rather flat and the \\"plot\\" is just not intereting. i loved white teeth but could not get through her 2nd novel. i am barely making it through this and going to the book often feels like a chore that needs to be completed. she is clearly a gifted and intelligent person but with regard to this book ... \\"there is just no there, there\\""},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I liked this book very much. The author has an ear for dialogue that rings true in the American family and for the particular characters. There is great laughter at the beginning, a keen eye for interior reflection that is honest and insightful about cultural identity, and a movement toward the ultimate sweet sadness of their situation. I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"this is an amazing book, maybe my favorite of zadies.received quickly, good shipping price, book was in good condition."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Not only did this book come faster than I thought, but it was in perfect condition and it turned out to be a wonderful read. I recommend it all!"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"This novel condenses a variety of philosophies (and warnings) about how our culture values beauty, and considers what we are willing to trade to be close to it. I really enjoyed this novel -- the characters are complicated and interesting, and it was easy to be sympathetic too, yet disappointed in the characters. I thought the writing was impressive, as well."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I enjoyed White Teeth and had heard reviews that On Beauty didn't live up to it. However, I enjoyed it thoroughly!"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"This author's main asset is in her descriptions and nuances. Many of them were simply terrific.I did also detect some humour, which was pleasing. The start of the novel with Jerome's emails to his father, although not a big attention grabber, is unique.However, for me the story was much too slow moving.There was too much detail and what I consider filler throughout the novel. Even in the midst of a very good fight between Kiki and Howard (204), the author sidetracks with the elastic of Kiki's underwear and Howard placing his hands on the sideboard,thus losing the momentum.I disliked the clumsy way the reader is told to jump nine months forward and back across the Atlantic (42).That weird poem \\"On Beauty\\"...what did it say? (153).Not bad but would I recommend it? Sorry...."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Overall the book is well written, but its clinical and not emotionally or intellectually satisfying. Many other reviews give you details on the book but I'll just focus on reasons why it didn't work for me. This story, these characters had so much potential. I was enthralled after the first few pages and then it turns out, that was the best part of the book. I kept waiting for that feeling to return and it never did. The stage is set, the characters in play, but the story just doesn't ever pull you in. I think perhaps she tried to have too many mini-stories within the story. I'd rather just had the focus and development of a few key characters and storylines. For example, Jerome (the eldest son) of the Belsey family is dispensable after the first chapter. There's no satisfying conclusion at the end...which I can live with if I've been fulfilled throughout the rest of the book. This book just left me still feeling like an outsider vs. feeling emersed in the characters, their lives, the story. Maybe I'm expecting too much, but I think not."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Yes, this book is about two families, PC, Academia, Rembrant etc but really it is about how ZS gets some of the characters from the inside. Howard Beasley, Zora, Isaac, and from the outside: Jerome and most of the family of the rivals.To me what was wonderful was when two characters we know from within are sitting or talking together or, with Ziki and Howard, making love.The richness of this book is in that psychological intimacy, more imo than the ideas, which surround the characters as they do us readers, more or less. But what's really earth-shaking and great fiction is how ZS does let us in and once in, we can become that character, flawed and all. I think that is her gift independent of the various subjects that are really no more pronounced in our lives than in theirs: The PC College or the black/white stuff is all around us as well, but what is formost is our ways of knowing ourselves and each other, what Zadie Smith can do, and can avoid. So for me, what is genuninely wonderful about this book, is how when she enters Nora, we are inside too, and when she doesn't enter Monty he is seen only thru others. I can't be perfectly clear here and so will try again later. But for now, I noticed mainly how she can slip into one or many characters so that it's not plot-driven as much as a psychological study, and we become the characters. Very special writer."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Zadie Smith shone in \\"White Teeth,\\" missed the mark a tad in \\"Autograph Man,\\" but shines once again in \\"On Beauty.\\" Her grasp of racial issues, family relations, and academia are right on. Smith is also able to accurately write for a wide-range of characters. And, none of the different story lines were any less interesting, thus leaving a reader to skim certain sections.This book has definitely lived up to is hype."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I picked the audio copy of On Beauty on the suggestion of some wonderful Twitter buddies who answered my call for multi-cultural books with themes similar to Jonathon Franzen's Freedom (which I'll be starting in January). I've not read Zadie Smith before, which made this novel even more perfect to compare against Freedom. I'm a Franzen virgin as well. When I've finished them both, I'll be writing a more in depth comparison of them both. I will still be reviewing them separately. The comparison has more to do with my #readingfreude than it does the novels themselves.On Beauty, although primarily about the racially mixed Belsey family, is the tale of two black, educated, university families. The Belsey family is made up of white Englishman Howard, African American Kiki, and their three children, Jerome, Zora, and Levi. The Kipps family is made up of Monty, Carlene, and their children, Michael and Victoria. While the Belseys are politically and culturally very liberal and irreligious, the Kipps family are politically, culturally and religiously conservative. Both Howard and Monty teach and write about art. Even in the world of art they are diametrically opposed. In fact, Howard sees Monty as his arch nemesis. Despite every one's intentions, it proved impossible to keep the families apart, even when they were separated by the Atlantic.This is a difficult novel to pin down in just a few paragraphs. It's dense and cerebral. I've spent months trying to write this review in my head and I've not been very successful. Instead of covering everything, I've decided to focus on the role of the wife in this novel. While outsiders might think Kiki's lot in life was more free and appealing, she was locked down just as much as Carlene appeared to be in Monty's home. The truth is that the women had more in common than anyone would have suspected. Carlene may outwardly hold up Monty's ideals, her mind is her own. She doesn't keep herself tied to an ideology at all costs. In the same way, Kiki finds that life is never as simple as black and white. The adult lives her son Jerome and daughter Zora start living mirrors how complex her own life has become. While the men in their lives fail to appreciate how their lives and view points can compliment each other, their wives are drawn to each other. They alone know how much their husbands are really alike.Of all the characters, I related to and loved Kike the most. Kiki roared \\"I am woman!\\" in all her glory. She believed in herself and her culture when she was young and when she is middle aged, when she was fine and when she was fat. She grew more than any character in the book, finding that change does not equate to losing your essence. Her son, Levi, while less confident in who he was, was most like her. They both never tried to forget the importance of living in the here and now.Since the demise of Guiding Light in September of 2009, it's not very often any longer that I can say, ''He/She is/was on my show!\\" On Beauty gave me such an opportunity. It's narrator, Peter Francis James, took a turn on Guiding Light. I recognized his voice before I did his picture. I found him to be a good narrator. I think he captured the attitude and tone of Howard and Monty especially well.Final ThoughtsOn Beauty was probably the most tiring book I read in 2011. It took a great deal of thought and concentration. It's one of those books I'm glad to have read but can't say that I enjoyed the process. I had to fight the urge to give it up because it was so stuffy. That stuffiness is essential to the story. Good Lord, it was so stifling there that things were bound to explode. The explosion was more internal and introspective than spectacular. It also required a good deal more of me as a reader. I'll be interested in seeing how it compares to Freedom."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"This is my first Zadie Smith read, one of my book club picks. It's very different from the books I usually enjoy, but I found myself drawn into the story. If it had a better ending I would have rated it a five star. All in all, however. it is well worth the time and I recommend it wholeheartedly."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I loved it! The book was in wonderful shape (as described) and it turned out to be an amazing read. The price was reasonable even with the shipping charge. It appeared to have barely been touched let alone read! The only complaint that I have is that it took way too long to receive. I would say I didn't get the book until a week and a half after I placed my order. I wish it would have cone fasterm though I suppose I should try a different mailing option other than 'standard' so that was probably my fault, athough the book was supposed to be sent out within two business days after the order was placed and it certainly was not shipped until I would say four or five days.Otherwise I was completely thrilled. I am happy that i went through this seller- they are very competent. I would gladly wait a week to get a book in such great condition as this instead of one that is all torn up. I am overall very pleased and will probably order from this seller again."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Like many other posters, it took me awhile to fully grasp On Beauty. I read White Teeth right before Beauty to get a grasp of the writer. In my opinion, Smith is much more focused on character development-where as the plot can sometimes become slow or irrelevant. She takes her time to develop each character with their flaws and curious qualities. I guess that it why it took me so long to understand or even care when Howard was discussed as a character. However, take the time to keep reading and you will see how he develops along with his family and colleaguesEven though the book can be \\"adjective heavy\\" with the plot, I still found it enjoyable and related to my college experiences with all types of students. Read On Beauty for what Smith does best---become invested with the characters."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I really can't understand all these negative reviews. I just loved it. Smith's writing is superb...she is not only like Forster, she is like Dickens in her scope and humor. One of the best books I've read this year."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I was really disappointed in this book. I had heard such rave reviews but it definitely was a book I struggled through and only finished since I bought it new and kept thinking I would find something redeeming in it."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Who are these people saying bad things about this book!?Zadie Smith's \\"ON BEAUTY\\" is hands down the best book I have read this year! It is phenomenal! I can't believe nobody is getting the intricate beauty of the truths being \\"touched on\\" here--rather than shoved in our faces. Excellent.And I'm quite shocked that someone else mentioned Kola Boof in their book review! I thought I was the only person who'd heard of her work! But you're right. Kola Boof's novels are like poetic tablets from another planet. She's just AWESOME. I don't think the literary world is ready for a writer that soulful and original yet. But it's wrong to compare her to Zadie Smith. They're too totally different writers. They're not cut from the same cloth.Zadie is BETTER.People who don't like \\"ON BEAUTY\\" are crazy. Go Zadie!"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I can't believe this book got any good reviews. It is just plain awful. It looks like something that went from first draft to publishing with no editorial review in between. Her characterization of Americans and American speech patterns is ridiculous and quite annoying. Her American characters are caricatures -- for example why is Kiki obese? Oh, because women of color just get obese when they get older, no reason, no explanation, no delving into her character to understand why a sexy, happily-married woman would just balloon up to an unhealthy fatness. I really loved White Teeth. Ms. Smith should stick to writing about English people and their ways, and leave us alone.Finally, many of the newspaper reviewers talked about Howard's End and how it's such a reflection on it, etc. I didn't read Howards' End, so sorry, if that is what it takes to appreciate the book, than there should be something on the cover that says, \\"make sure you read Howard's End first.\\""},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"This claptrap would have never been published had the author not been black and female."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"If you read Howard's End perhaps you will find this book particularly interesting, as you may compare the two worlds.

It is provocative and deals with relationships and behavior of familty members and interracial relationships."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Truly, I wanted to read this book. I tend toward more non-fiction and had asked my manager at work for a recommendation - she passed along this book. I found it difficult to get into - though I did like some of the characterizations (ie, fall leaving and slamming the door on the way out) - it just overall seemed like her writing wasn't very well integrated - in terms of the style(s) of writing in the book and the uneven development of characters.I found the way the characters spoke to be distractingly unnatural - and found found the oblique physical descriptions of people (explicit for some characters, almost soft porn - and very vague for others) difficult to hook into. The drama and the sub plots - just not all worked out very well and in the end - not that interesting. I forced myself to finish it in the hopes it would improve - not sure I would bother with another of her books."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"For me, this falls between 'White Teeth' and 'The Autograph Man'. I really liked it. END REVIEW.Just kidding.Smith retains her witty, charming prose style. Moreover, she maintains an interest in racial issues and popular culture, but it these themes are never what the book is really about. Smith's novels are, so far, like Woody Allen's or Wes Anderson's films-- works by wonderful stylists that you can kind of know going into watching if you'll like it, whatever the strength of script. Smith's prose is wonderful as ever. I love it. Yet the respective structures and pacing of her three novels are variously strong. The characters, too, are variously compelling. This is her most America-centric novel thus far, too, which makes sense now that she splits her time between the US and UK.Ultimately, 'On Beauty' is a morality play (of sorts). Not to reveal too much, but protagonist and antagonist alike behave in similarly a/im/moral ways despite their espoused views. Indeed, they hold their views in-spite of their backgrounds: the white British liberal contra West Indian-British conservative. Perhaps to add more cultural contrast (or maybe more shades of grey is a better way of describing it?), the multiracial children of the white British liberal and his black Floridian wife struggle to make themselves fit into New England settings with the various white, African American, and Haitian communities. Once again, these backgrounds are just all backdrop to the morality play, not major driving factors its plot.So! If you like Smith's writing style, buy this book, I doubt you'll be disappointed. If you're so-so on her style, it's a good story and you may still like it on its own merits-- it is loosely based on 'Howard's End', so if you liked that book you might like this 21st century interpretation."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"The plot and structure reminded me of a daytime soap opera like All My Children (with profanity), two families always bumping into each other whether in Massachusetts or England.The writer Zadie Smith, covers a lot of ground through these families. University life, art history, adultery, death, crime, sex, hip-hop, Christianity, right-wing/left-wing politics, affirmative-action, class, Haiti, beauty, you name it, it's there.I would've enjoyed the storytelling more if there was at least one main character who had some good morals to cheer for. The only character that did, died midway through the book which left a lot of moronic behavior and made everyone seem rather ridiculous.Despite this, the characters do come off extremely real and the dialogue is very spot-on most of the time. Credit that to the great writing skills of Ms Zadie Smith.I enjoyed the audio book read by Peter Francis James who did a great job weaving in all the diverse characters. (I kept imagining the role of Howard Belsey being played by Tim Gunn of \\"Project Runway\\") I'm not sure if I could've read it manually. It seemed overly long."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"It was interesting; as I read through this book a single quote kept going through my head.Oh what a tangled web we weave, When first we practise to deceive! - Sir Walter ScottThis wasn't a story I was expecting. I'd read that Zadie Smith is witty and funny and I think part of me expected this to be a hilarious, fun book. It's not that - but don't get me wrong. I laughed out loud more than a few times for various reasons.I think what struck me most and why this book really hit hard is not only the exceptional quality of writing (which really amazed me) but also the depth of the characters. Zadie Smith managed to take characters that could almost be stereotypical and put enough of a twist on them that I didn't know exactly what to expect from them as the story progresses. And above everything else.. these were real characters. There was no preference toward the more liberal or conservative arguments made in the book by the characters, everything was just laid out, unashamed, bold and without mercy for the reader to absorb.Most of all I felt as if these are people that I could know. I don't know how else to express it and wish I had the same talent with words. My best advice would be for you to experience this story and figure out what I'm talking about that way - but prepare yourself.. there are parts of this book that are brutal. There is language, unforgiving sexual encounters and this is not a \\"feel good\\" story. But it's one that made me think and slow down and absorb what I was reading.There is one quote I'd like to talk about, because it's something that I've been thinking about a lot recently, especially as one of my sisters has had a recent birthday and is now approaching 30. Zadie Smith speaks on the relationship between Jerome, Zora and Levi.. three siblings that feature prominently in the book.People talk about the happy quiet that can exist between two lovers, but this too was great; sitting between his sister and his brother, saying nothing, eating. Before the world existed, before it was populated, and before there were wars and jobs and colleges and movies and clothes and opinions and foreign travel - before all of these things there had been only one person, Zora, and only one place: a tent in the living room made from chairs and bed-sheets. After a few years, Levi arrived; space was made for him; it was as if he had always been. Looking at them both now, Jerome found himself in their finger joints and neat conch ears, in their long legs and wild curls. He heard himself in their partial lisps caused by puffy tongues vibrating against slightly noticeable buckteeth. He did not consider if or how or why he loved them. They were just love; they were the first evidence he ever had of love and they would be the last confirmation of love when everything else fell away.Isn't that a beautiful piece of writing? That is something I've felt while sitting in that peaceful quiet between siblings, while listening to them talk to one another, while laying beside them on the floor sharing a loud bout of laughter.Ultimately, this is a book that is about relationships. The relationships between the right wing and left wing, the husband and wife, brothers and sisters, boyfriends and girlfriends, wealthy and poor. It is a pretty fantastic read."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Zadie Smith's third novel has the multi-cultural and multi-racial themes of her earlier novels. But this time she doesn't showcase them; she uses them to paint a bigger picture. As the title suggests, this book is about the nature of beauty. The protagonist is Howard Belsey, a college professor at a Harvard-like college in Boston called Wellington. His family is about as \`mixed' as one can get. A white British man, he's married to a black American woman named Kiki. To further mix it up, Kiki is an office worker and, though she tries, isn't much of an intellectual. Howard is somewhat of a failure at his work. He teaches a class that questions what we view as beautiful in art. Not many students attend more than the first class, probably because it's difficult. (We are briefly introduced to a student, Katie Armstrong, who is a successful student but struggles mightily to understand Howard's lectures.) Further, he is writing a critical book about Rembrandt that he can never seem to finish.From Howard's perspective, everyone is an antagonist, (even Rembrandt) his wife, his three kids, his students. But set up as his official foil is Monty Kips, a Trinidadian British scholar. He is Howard's opposite in every way: black, conservative, and successful. His book on Rembrandt- a glowingly positive one- has come out and sits atop the best seller list. As the story begins, Howard's eldest son Jerome, a born-again Christian to boot, is in London working and staying with the Kipps'. He has a short-lived and disappointing sexual dalliance with the Kipps' beautiful daughter Victoria.Next the story moves ahead nine months, the Kipps' have moved to Boston because Monty has gotten a position at Wellington, disturbing both Howard and Jerome, who is trying to get over Victoria. Howard has committed an infidelity, though how significant that is remains to be seen. A young poet from the ghetto is introduced to the delight of Howard's college-aged daughter Zora and teenaged son Levi. And Kiki meets Monty's eccentric wife Carlene. With that, the pot is stirred until Howard is transformed by the most unlikely of people. But perhaps too late.Smith is fantastic writer. This was apparent from the first page of her first novel, White Teeth. But she has been an underachiever of sorts, because for its great start, White Teeth sinks at its end, and her second novel, Autograph Man, was a mess from the get-go. On Beauty makes amends for both those failures. It is a mature novel that addresses the biggest questions of them all (life, happiness, how we go our own direction while maintaining a relationship with someone going in the opposite direction) with her own unique style. Yes, there are slow parts. Yes, she changes POV a lot, sometimes to the point of distraction. Yes, some of her characters are shallow, not fully baked, and sometimes stereotypically overblown. Yes, the story can be depressing, especially where some of our characters end up. But the work gels. The resolution at the very end is beautiful, and worth the effort of reading this beautiful book."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Zadie Smith, a London writer, first came to fame with her debut novel, \`White Teeth'. While slightly over hyped, White Teeth was a great novel. It was basically about modern London life, seen through three very different families. It was a great mess of a novel that worked like an early Dickens' novel in its ambition to take a bite of modern London life; full of memorable caricatures, great story lines, hysterical dialogue and a lyrical and hilarious prose.Her third novel is \`On beauty.' The novel takes place in a Massachusetts college town. The story is about two families: the Kipps and Belseys; but mostly about the Belseys. First up is Howard, a liberal art history professor. Then, there is his wife, Kiki. She is a nurse, and proudly not an intellectual, in the worst sense of the word. In her early years she was very beautiful, but has ballooned up to 250 lbs. Then the kids: Zora, a college student and ultimate daddy's little girl, Jerome, a conservative virginal (to Howard's despair) college student, Levi a home boy from the burbs, down with all things hip-hop.As the novel opens Jerome is living in London for the summer in the house of Monty Kipps, a conservative professor, and Howard's enemy. Back at home Howard is at the dog house for having cheated on Kiki. After a short tumultuous sexual encounter between Jerome and Victoria, one of the Kipps's daughter, Monty Kipps accepts a job in the college where Howard teaches and moves down the street from the Belseys.The plot is of course \`borrowed' from Forster's \\"Howards End.' Ms. Smith says this is a tribute to the author whom she says, \`all my fiction is indebted.' This is the novels first problem. From the opening line, \`One may as well begin with Jerome's e-mail to his father,' to a lengthy description and history to the Belsey's residence, to the structure of the story, Ms. Smith tries to echo Mr. Forster's novel. The first problem with these attempts is the plot, which at various point Ms. Smith has to yank into the narrow structure she has set for self. As a result the plot is a mess, without any of the \`White Teeth' ambitions. Another problem is the characters. Most of them are here standing in for the characters from the original story, as a result they are lifeless caricature and are pushed aside almost immediately after Ms. Smith has nodded at the original story.The second problem with the novel is the setting. She wrote the novel after her short stay in Cambridge. It shows. She has trouble with small everyday costumes: Kiki sends her nineteen years old son to buy alcohol; and most noticeably with the dialogues. Levi, whom she attempts to portrays as a suburb kid speaking in a hip hop lingo , sounds like a lovely English lady trying to speak in a hip hop lingo: \`You know ... I just thought I'd pay you a call'Yet, in some ways this is also the best novel Zadie Smith has written. Her prose is a lot more controlled than in her previous novels, but still lyrical and funny. More importantly she has created Kiki Belsey. Kiki Belsey is by far her most complex and detailed character. She is perhaps the only character without any intellectual ambition, and is perhaps (coincidentally?) the most normal. She is a mother worried about her kids, a woman dealing with aging and a failed marriage. In a way she is a simple character, that holds all the characters together. Towards the end of the novel she cleaning out the basement and observes, \`The greatest lie ever told about love is that it sets you free.'I finished this novel with a mixed felling. Here is a flawed novel, from a tremendous talent, who has still to write her GREAT NOVEL."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I don't always like books that are an homage to an earlier work, as On Beauty is to Howard's End. The Hours comes to mind as a completely over-hyped, forced replica of Mrs. Dalloway. But while some of the ties to Howard's End in On Beauty are, indeed, forced a bit, I was nevertheless sucked in to the characters and Zadie Smith's writing style. Smith is a truly gifted prosaist and I look forward to reading more of her works. In spite of some other minor flaws, don't believe the reviews that say this book was \\"dull\\" or uninteresting - it is anything but!"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Any writing about Academia tends to bring out the hype. Smith's pyrotechnical language and sharp eye for (some) details can be deceptive. This is a rather mean-spirited, insider's book about some aspects of college (Ivy) culture, with a lot of \\"social relevance\\" and hot-button themes thrown in for cover. With the exception of Kiki (who we might feel sorry for) there's no one to like or admire in this book. The fools are unfunny and the villains lack that special something to raise them from the realm of merely unpleasant.So it's terribly confusing when in the midst of all this hip, soulless dialogue and mannered prose we get some laugh-out-loud comedy, brillant characterizations, and odd tidbits of wisdom. Like a sociopath with high IQ and sharp social skills, Smith romps over the reader and dulls the bludgeoning with an occasional reward.If that's your cup of tea, you're probably a 20-something college student playing with nihilism. You have second-hand, well-thumbed (but unread) David Foster Wallace on your crate-and-barrel bookcase. But the grownups are weary, weary of this.For a more fun romp through collegiate politics, try Moo."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"The author creates believable characters and explores the relationships between family members. However, although believable and three-dimensional, the plot and characters are not that interesting, and I wouldn't really recommend it."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I don't think I can add much to the excellent assessment of this book in the editorial reviews printed at the top of this page, but I do want to register disagreement with the general tenor of Amazon readers' comments, which tend to find the book disappointing. I find this to be a stunning achievement, more so even than the author's debut bookWHITE TEETH. While that fell clearly into the category of Immigrant Novel, this one is simply Novel; this still-young writer has begun to mature.True, ON BEAUTY also deals with race and culture, especially among younger people, but you soon stop thinking about them as special cases. For the most part these are comfortable middle-class folks, people who have made it in white society, where the challenges to their identity are more subtle but no less real. The principal setting is Wellington, an elite American university, whose atmosphere and characters Smith captures very well; her gentle mockery of academic fads is buttressed by a sure sense of what makes good teaching and helpful criticism. This is certainly a novel of ideas, but it is also about the people who advance the ideas, and on that level Smith's powers are extraordinary, on a par with books such as Ian McEwan's SATURDAY. The story centers on two academic rivals, Howard Belsey (a white British art historian married to an African American) and Sir Monty Kipps (a Trinidadian living in London), and their families. Ultimately both men are shown to be seriously flawed, but the women in the families especially reveal enormous reserves of strength that is a real joy.One Amazon reader mentioned David Lodge (e.g.CHANGING PLACES), and the territory is certainly similar, but I feel that Smith writes with more depth and less obvious comedy. Indeed, I cannot understand the insistence on the back of the paperback edition that this is a \\"hilarious send-up\\" or \\"rollicking satire.\\" It is comic, yes, in the sense that people are seen as they are, warts and all, but Smith's character-painting is as sad as it is funny, and often deeply affecting. It is comic in that you have to accept its structural premises, such as its sequestered environment, convenient coincidences, or the idea that Sir Monty as a visiting professor could immediately wield the sort of influence on campus politics that normally takes decades to achieve. But it is what Zadie Smith pours into the structure that makes her novel so wonderful. I find it a treasure trove, rich in ideas and filled with characters whose lives matter, even when they are making such a mess of them."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Zadie Smith has talent, but this book is lacking as a novel and would not have been published if the same work was delivered by an unknown author. The lack of a story is pathetic. The character development is rather good, but there's literally no story, beyond reading about a sad family going through a hard time. Do not waste your time."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I'm surprised that nobody has excoriated this underedited, impossibly self-indulgent and above all boring book yet. I've actually found the amazingly generous online reviews of this novel more readable than the book itself. Its uneven tone (now comic! now serious! now bathetic!) is matched by a clunky, thudding exposition, exemplified by the overdescriptive narration of Jerome's affair with Victoria Kipps through emails that sound nothing like those a 19 year old boy would write. Of course, dull Jerome and ravishing Victoria (who I kept getting the hideous suspicion was supposed to be - yikes - an author surrogate) are unconvincing characters anyway - or caricatures really. I know this is supposed to be a \\"comic\\" novel, despite being extremely thin on laughs, but the characters are infuriatingly one-dimensional and stereotypical. Smith has admitted to blatantly ripping off Howards End, stripmining its themes and structure, to create this dreary tome - as if acknowleding her debt openly in any way compensates for her own failure of imagination. Save your money and buy the novel it steals from instead."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Since others have synopsized the plot at great length, I won't echo their reviews. Zadie Smith has flashes of brilliance and insights into human nature which are remarkable for her age, especially when dealing with the relationship between Kiki and Carlene. Sadly, the remaining family dynamics felt implausible, contrived, and strained. Howard and Monty come off as caricatures of academecians, most painfully in their inability to control their respective libidos among nubile young coeds. Their offspring, Jerome, Zora, Levi and Victoria, are simply unbelievable, as are their choices of friends and paramours. As a Boston native, I also found Smith's fabrication of a fictitious college town somewhat off-key. Wellington? Wellesley? Across the river? Cambridge? This was a distraction, as were the myriad typos that seem to be rampant now that spellchecker has replaced the human touch. The word \\"nothing\\" instead of \\"noting\\" completely changes the meaning of a sentence."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"On the first page of Franz Kafka's great unfinished novel Amerika, the Statue of Liberty guards New York Harbor holding upright a large sword. San Francisco is a nearby East Coast city. Kafka had never been to America, and given his difficult life, and lack of access to the internet, such errors are easily forgiven.Zadie Smith supposedly wrote this novel while at Harvard, and there's no literary or practical reason for the sloppy writing and research. This novel just does not capture American language or culture.Supposed Americans speak in British vernacular or in some mid-Atlantic way that corresponds to a language that is spoken nowhere. An American character asks \\"What will you do at [for] Christmas?\\" Other Americans refer to the water board [water company] and an extractor fan [exhaust fan]. Graduate students are repeatedly referred to as \\"graduates.\\"Culturally, the book gets the details wrong too, making the simplistic assumption that liberal and conservative mean the same things in the US and UK. (They don't; look how well Bush and Blair got along.) For a campus novel, the details of the American university system are awfully wrong. A sixteen year old considers going straight to medical school or law school without getting an undergraduate degree first. A senior academic with thirty years experience is first going up for tenure. Neither would happen in the US system.Best of all, in Zadie Smith's Amerika, Thanksgiving is on a Friday!"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I so wanted to enjoy this book, but I just didn't. I first read Autograph Man and fell in love with Zadie Smith. I also enjoyed White Teeth and was really anticipating this book, but it's been weeks and I'm still trying to drag my way through it. I found the characters generally unlikable and I really, really want Zadie to ask an American to read her writing before she attempts any more American dialogue (or descriptions for that matter). Should Levi really say, 'So what am I meant to do?' or SHOULD he say, 'So, NOW what am I supposed to do?' We never say 'I have done.', we say 'I have.' I could go on and on. Basically, it's an 'American' book told in a British voice when each part should be told in the voice of its narrator. The constant shift between under-developed characters makes for a confusing and interrupted read. Something would finally start to happen with one character, when boom - now you're back with some character you haven't heard from in chapters who never really did anything anyway.I'm hoping that this one is a learning experience for Ms. Smith and I'm still awaiting her next novel. Based solely on her first two, I would read anything that she puts out there (no matter how long it may take)."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I choose this book on the basis of its recommendation by the NY Times; I was deeply disappointed. It's a collection of loosely strung-together encounters among a cast of sterotyped characters:-Howard, the insipid, dyspepsic, weary British academic has-been who can't keep his pants on-Kiki, his African-American wife who's large of heart and girth-Jerome, the son who drifts in and out of the story and who's born-again in defiance of his atheist upbringing-Zora, the awkward over-achiever activist daughter-Levi, the son in his mid-teens who's pretending to be from the 'hood-Carl the sullen rapper who actually is from the hood-Monty, the self-righteous and ultimately hypocritical evangelical conservative-Victoria, his stunningly gorgeous and slutty daughter-Carlene, his mysterious sickly wife-Claire, the self-consciously liberal poet-professorOver the course of a year, they drop in and out of each other's lives, sometimes in the college town of Wellington, Mass and sometimes in London. And then...the book ends. Just ends. Did the author get bored? Deadline was up? Set herself a goal of so many pages and made it? If I'd been listening to in on CDs, I'd have thought the last one was missing."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I felt exhausted by \\"White Teeth\\" and could barely bring myself to finish it, but when I saw the sale price here on Amazon, I thought I'd give Zadie another go; I'm halfway through the novel now, and I've got another howling headache. I recognize her gifts, of course, but what I don't understand is her lack of discipline and craft. She seems very young, still, to me; every possible idea sprouting in her brain is deemed worthy of putting down on paper. She mentions in a forward that if it wasn't for her editor, this would be longer and 'worse'. I wish the editor had been more strict (and also that they had employed a halfway decent proofreader -- there are a multitude of typos in the book, shocking). Was it necessary to include Zadie's husband's poem (also titled 'On Beauty') in here? It's all so indulgent. Much has been said about her attempts at imitating American modes of speech -- this is the exhausting part. So many character types, each speaking in their own vernacular, but in very cliched ways, and THEY NEVER STOP TALKING. This is one of the talkiest books I've ever read, and what makes that challenging is that no one seems to have anything worthwhile to say. Another complaint, while I'm at it -- Kiki, the matriarch, is referred to as a nurse, but halfway through the book she still has yet to be seen doing anything nurse-like, no work, nothing. She doesn't even relate to an obviously ailing woman in a nurse-like way -- an arbitrary choice by the author, apparently, and then forgotten. I think this is the character Zadie missed by the longest shot, and the more she writes, the farther from a genuine character she gets. There is no real story here, that I can see. Indulgent, immature writing. I may not finish it."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Many of my friends had recommended White Teeth to me, so when a book club I go to picked On Beauty by the same author, I was excited. However, I thought this book did not deserve any of the accolades heaped upon it. Her metaphors are way over used, and some of them just made no sense. Other descriptions were just so poor that I didn't know what she meant then either. Physical descriptions of characters left me picturing that everyone was one of Van Gogh's Potato Eaters, and I couldn't see why, in this book focused on love and relationships, anyone was with anyone for anything. It is said that writers should write about what they know. Based on her descriptions of anything American, I was surprised to learn that she had been in the country even once. She needed more research and a better editor. What's weird though is that I could see she was talented. But after this there is no way I want to try White Teeth. I don't trust her to not make me mad with these elements again."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Why did Howard and Kiki ever get married? How did all of their children go such different ways? Why, after 443 pages, do I not know or care? Zadie Smith has written some beautiful passages, surrounded by flat characters. Phew, and not to mention the unending snippets of sociopolitical commentary she drags us through without ever getting to a point, or a compelling concept."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I grant that Zadie Smith can write an evocative scene, or describe a setting well. But this skill does not an engaging story make.On Beauty sets out to examine the issues which divide men and women, parents and children, husbands and wives, Old World (UK) and New World (US), and academe and reality. Given the huge number of books which have tackled all or some of these subjects already, a great onus is placed upon the author to deliver a unique insight or two, and here Smith fails.Perhaps Smith could learn from her brilliant contemporary, Kate Atkinson, who can pull an engaging plot and lovely prose together while engaing us intellectually.Smith also incorporates some of her poet-husband's work in this book, which I found a tad precious. As well as a crude attempt to boost his sales.I keep reading rave reviews of Smith's work, so I keep reading her books, but this may be the last. Somehow I am missing whatever the raves are about."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"On Beauty is an easy read whose largely stereotyped characters can fill an evening better than TV. I picked it up because I'm always curious about literary fiction that win prizes. Amazon provides short reviews from Kirkus Review, Booklist, Publishers Weekly, etc. But I've learned not to take them too seriously. Witness the Publishers Weekly starred review that doesn't even get the names of the characters right. Caveat emptor!"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"It surprises me that Zadie Smith was a contender for the Booker Prize with this novel. It struck me as structurally similar to her earlier White Teeth, which I thoroughly enjoyed. The structure of the two parallel families is the same, the multicultural aspects of exile/mixed marriage/mixed races are the same, only that Smith now transports most of the plot to Massachusetts. I don't think she has the same cultural understanding of the US as she has of England (and as she showed in White Teeth). The worst really is to read American teenagers, however educated and academic they may be, asking for \\"favours\\". English spelling does no favor to her portrait of hip-hop culture, which seems to be limited to one of the characters' use of \\"scene\\" anyway. In short, Smith's characters are a bit culturally superficial; she makes up for it with lively descriptions of the characters' inner lives, but somehow that is also so much like White Teeth. All in all, I am disappointed."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"10/19/05It is an honor to review ON BEAUTY, Zadie Smith. I read the book, putting it down only to walk the dog, talk with my husband and sleep. I regretted leaving the people in the book when it ended.On Beauty is full of characters; perhaps this is a flaw, but I found the people exciting and all were differentiated, most growing or changing in some way in the course of the book. The book begins with a BANG and ends with a bang and a whimper; how, I wonder, will the people go on with their lives? Reading On Beauty is similar to walking down a crowded street in lower Manhattan, a street filled with people of every nation, every color, all talking with or often at cross purposes to each other, but all, nonetheless, living full lives.If for no other reason than this next one, the book is worth reading: Zadie Smith has an absolutely accutely attuned ear for accents. She has captured, on paper, the accents of people from all economic, educational and social walks of life. It is amazing to hear people talking so clearly on paper. Who am I to say this, but I will take this chance: I do believe that 40, 50 years from now, when people want to know what life was like in 2005, they will just pick up this book and enter life in our present, their past.This book is about people in all our glorious, basic, stupid and fantastic selves, with hundreds of roads to take, but the one taken really does make a difference in peoples' lives.I think that you cannot skim this book. It is actually an easy read, but the book is so full of people and ideas and those marvellous accents, that only a careful reading will allow you to enter fully into this book. I can hardly wait until Smith's next book. I also read Smith's book, White Teeth, but truly, I feel that this book definitely tops White Teeth. Zadie Smith is only 30 years old--imagine what her \\"take\\" on life will be as she grows older???"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Zadie Smith takes the English language and weaves a tapestry of prose to be marveled at. This is one of the most down to earth, insightful and just plain entertaining books I have read in many years.Some books are best read during a specific season or time in your life. this is an anytime read. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Smith's OB is a fine novel. Not great. Not particularly memorable (at least I don't suppose that it will leave a lasting impression on me; I doubt I'll find myself quoting from it days, weeks, or years from now). But solid: well written, well styled, balanced, strong on character development, well researched. This last point bears underscoring. OB is a perfect evocation of university life, in certain quarters of certain universities. I'm not familiar with the details of Smith's own biography, but I assume she herself was, once upon a time, enrolled in a school similar to the eponymous one at the center of this novel. OB evinces the kind of offhand familiarity with academia that experience (and, I imagine, only rarely research) brings. Kudos to Smith for successfully toeing the very fine line between characterization and stereotyping. The protagonists of this novel, their strengths and their foibles, the storylines, the setting -- in short, everything about OB -- seem genuine. That said, OB gets 4 stars from this reader for the following reason: that which is genuine is not always compelling. In the end, OB felt over-long to me and a little less substantial than it might have been. The classics to which it has been compared, and on which it was consciously modeled, all have something this one lacks. For all the reasons I can imagine reading Howard's End again and again, at different stages of my life, I doubt I'll ever crack the pages of OB again. Smith is a fine writer, to be sure. I look forward to reading more of her in future. OB is a fine novel. It's no masterpiece, though."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"After reading White Teeth on tour through Canada, I became a devotee of Zadie Smith. So, like other smitten fans I was stoked when On Beauty was published and pre-ordered a copy. The book arrives. I read the first few pages. I am disappointed. The book sits on my shelf for nearly a year.I decided to give it another go last month. I struggled through the introductory e-mail correspondence quite a bit. However, by the second \\"chapter\\" I was fully engrossed and devoured the story in three days.Overall, the plot of this novel is not as vibrantly paced as White Teeth or The Autograph Man, character development is...bizarre. There are no heroes in this story, just nemeses. Everyone is at war with one another (even if they are friends). If you like nice and tidy resolutions in your stories, this may not be the novel for you. The relationships between the characters are at once complex and superficial. One of the main characters, Howard, is just tragically dense and self-absorbed. At times, it's hard to have any sympathy for him.The ending is pretty open. I read it a few times and decided that it was just incomplete. Incompleteness is a general theme of the book and my general experience while reading it.Despite this, I give the novel 4 stars. It has these wonderful, illuminating moments that make it float.Smith's portrait of the pitfalls and tragic politics of academic life was downright hilarious and all too familiar. The dialogue in the story is for the most part brilliant. A good example is when Belsey visits his estranged father in London. She captures the tension, frustration, and love between father and son wonderfully. She's a gifted wordsmith and has an amazing method of interweaving metaphors with literal phrases. Similar to Joanne Harris, she's sensuous and writes with all senses in mind."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Zadie Smith's new novel is at its core an exploration of family life, and the ways in which love sustains and fails us. She does a remarkable job of capturing this with the Belsey clan: Howard, who has lost the ability to articulate his emotions and in the process devalued them; Kiki, who \\"gave her life\\" to Howard and has to reevaluate that decision in the face of his infidelity; Jerome, embracing faith as an act of rebellion; Zora, ambitious and insecure, forced to reconsider what she really cares about; and Levi, struggling with how his middle-class existence can be reconciled with his identity as a black teenager. Smith understands the intricacies of this family, and she portrays them in a way that allows the reader to forgive them for the things they struggle to forgive in themselves and each other.Smith's prose is lively, interesting and often very funny; most of her characters are fully realized and multi-dimensional; and even minor scenes often reflect uncommon insight. To the extent that the novel tries to impart a larger commentary about race, class, politics and art, it is often less successful than it is in the portrayal of the individual. It is nonetheless an excellent read.Smith describes this novel as an \\"hommage\\" to E.M. Forster, and it is certainly that--but it is also limited by its efforts to mirror Howards End. The best novels can be retold in ways that make the reader appreciate their universality, and Smith's book has the opposite effect: it reminds the reader of the ways in which Howards End is limited by its time and place. You can see this in the way she has to change events and characters to fit them into a more contemporary setting. The Belseys have neither the charm nor the innocence of the Schlegel sisters, and the Kippses do not carry the same dominant assurance that the Wilcoxes have--they are accused of self-hatred, and deny it, but are tinged with it in a way the Wilcoxes would never have been. Carlene Kipps is too much Ruth Wilcox, and does not receive the benefit of the peculiar insights Smith brings to characters more fully her own. And Kiki Belsey is insufficiently Margaret Schlegel, with neither the wisdom nor the compassion of Forster's character.The strengths of this novel are Smith's, not Forster's. But Smith's strengths come through on every page."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I enjoyed white teeth as a book, but was disappointed by the ending, which I felt was very rushed. In contrast, I found On Beauty a bit laborious to read (not as quick a read as White Teeth) but the ending was much more satisfying. The character development is as detailed as Smith always is, but it is quite obvious that she has studied life in America to write about it, not lived it."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Zadie Smith's excellent third novel, On Beauty, limns the tale of a thoroughly modern family beset by issues of trust, adultery, race and class in a New England academic town.Howard and Kiki Belsey (he Caucasian and English, she black and from small-town Florida) have forged a decades-long and mostly-successful marriage that has produced three children. On Beauty follows the family through a troubled passage both in Howard and Kiki's marriage and in Howard's university career that raises questions about honesty (both marital and otherwise), fidelity, racial identity and politics.While Smith revisits some of the questions addressed in her first novel, the wonderful White Teeth, the tone of the two novels varies markedly. Where White Teeth was allegorical, On Beauty is more intimate and its central characters more finely drawn. The depiction of Kiki, a middle-aged woman caught between the needs of her children, her husband and herself, is especially moving and generous.On Beauty is highly recommended as a beautifully written and absorbing novel of family relationships, with welcome comedic turns. For those who wondered whether Smith could produce a second novel of the caliber of her acclaimed White Teeth debut, the answer is decidedly yes. Even better, the two novels are sufficiently different so as to diminish disparaging side by side comparisons of either. What can be said is the Zadie Smith is a major new literary talent who deserves the praise that readers and critics are bestowing on her."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Zadie Smith has a nice ear for dialogue, especially when the young fend off their parents or when her characters quarrel. Scenes are sometimes funny and, on one or two occasions, moving. She is good on immature students, on faculty rivalries and on fashionable political issues on American university campuses. Her main characters are mostly well drawn, though one of them surely descends into caricature when she has him lecture on art in meaningless post-structuralist jargon; and the way in which most of his students respond in the same jargon is frankly unbelievable: that sort of lecturer would never keep a class. (Incidentally, the title of the book led me to think that issues about art and poetry would be much more central than they actually are. The poem, On Beauty, which is quoted on p.153, is presumably supposed to be a clue to much else in the book, but I couldn't make head or tail of it.)I think the novel is not tightly enough constructed. In the first half there are several scenes whose purpose in the overall scheme eluded me, and at that stage it was hardly a page-turner for me: I was not eager to find out what happened next. But in its last quarter the book gathers momentum, and the ending is terrific."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Wellington is a fictitious college somewhere near Boston. Howard is a white art history professor who cheated on his black wife, Kiki, with a white poetry professor, Claire. Howard is a staunch proponent of affirmative action and liberal politics in general, and Howard's nemesis, Monty, a black professor, is a stalwart of the religious right who wants to take the \\"liberal\\" out of liberal arts. There is a fair amount of contention among Howard's colleagues over Monty's right to espouse his right-wing opinions in a series of lectures and over Claire's right to include poor but talented students in her very exclusive poetry class, even though they are not enrolled at Wellington. These issues, however, are not as compelling as the more intimate ones facing Howard's family. The book opens with the very uncomfortable scene where Howard attempts to break off the engagement of his son Jeremy to Monty's daughter, Victoria, when the whole thing was a rather unfortunate misunderstanding. In fact, the book's most memorable events are all somewhat embarrassing, including Howard's youngest son Levi's attempt to rally his co-workers to refuse to work on Christmas Day. The irony is that Levi's family members are mostly atheists, and his coworkers are actually pumped about the opportunity to be paid double-time for the holiday. Howard and Kiki's daughter Zora's forte is argument, and she manages to blackmail her way into Claire's poetry class. The ten or so main characters become tangled in relationships with one another that are often surprising and usually regrettable. Although Kiki is the emotional and ethical conscience in the family, no one person is truly the central character; it's more of an ensemble cast. The finale happens in sort of a flourish that puts the finishing touches on this colorful canvas of a family with still a few challenges ahead."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I absolutely loved this book and recommend it to many friends. She captures a sort of family, a sort of dialogue, a way of talking-- perfectly. I did not hear her statement that the book was based on the plot of Howard's End until after I read it, but I love that fact. Not just because Howard's End is one of my favorite books of all time, but also because there there is something inherently humorous about basing a book's plot on another book which has a nearly indecipherable plot... I do not understand other people's bad reviews of this novel. Perhaps because I live in a community of academics and have two parents who are/have been academics, I found nothing about these people inauthentic... quite the contrary. Her ability to humorously and sympathetically portray these people is stunning. Not to mention her language."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I decided to check out the reviews, and was shocked at the plethora of bad reviews of this book. I picked it up after reading \\"Autograph Man\\" and have read it at least twice since then. There are some subtle nuances in the book, the way certain characters are shaped, but especially the themes of love and loss and failure that keeps me returning to this book. I read this just for the fun of it, and not in terms of a class or a book club, so cannot speak to a very critical and careful assessment. What I enjoyed about the book seems to be what everyone else hated! Namely, that ZS's characters don't present themselves in the same way that black American characters typically do. I am certainly not going to try and make a case that every single black american character is presented in essentially the same fashion, as that would be absurd. However, it seems to me that there is a certain trend or an aeshtetic that links black american writers of fiction to the greatest works of the Harlem Rennaissance and a steady stream of influence, \\"In search of our mothers gardens\\" often becomes a mold, a manner of being or presenting that is consistent with what is 'considered' authentic as far as african american speech or identity or expression. I hope that made sense, I won't claim to know a damned thing about black southern living or dialect, food or style; as a white girl on the west coast I have literally nothing on that. What I am alluding to here, is a kind of discourse, ok so you know how if you hear the news you know its the news because it sounds like the news? Even if its in Spanish or Cantonese, its still sounds like the news, right? The pauses, the cadences, the manners of shaping phrases...that's what I'm talking about. When you pick up a novel about black North American characters, you know what sort of voice to expect. I am certainly not saying that all of these novelists are mimicking Alice Walker or Toni Morrison, I just mean that there is a set discourse that regulates how these characters speak, and what I loved about ZS's book was that she just broke with that tradition entirely. I don't know that I can even consider what is or is not 'authentic' apart from what is or is not considered as adequate representations of 'authenticity' in the world of fiction. I just know that I like books that surprise me, that keep me guessing and shape themselves in unusual and interesting ways, and this one did that."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I first spotted this book when it was released in hardcover and was excited about it. I LOVED her novel White Teeth and was impressed by the glowing reviews of On Beauty. Once it came out in paperback, I scooped it up. My first impression was not a good one. The dialouge in the beginning was flat, boring and often times confusing. But I trudged on, hoping that it would be another Zadie Smith gem. It never got any better. The characters were dull, annoying and stereotypical. The plotline was never interesting. All in all, i was very disapointed. Zadie Smith is usually a brilliant writer and that is the only reason I forced myself to make it through the book, months later. A good book usually takes me about 3 days. If you haven't read White Teeth, get that instead.White Teeth: A Novel"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"DID I JUST READ THAT?Is what I kept saying to myself while reading this absolutely deliciously written book by Zadie Smith. Her characters are all bold and probably a little larger than life. Her dialogue is so witty and gritty. Her plot emerges slowly through these peoples' lives but it nevertheless moves. A terrific story about quirky people living in our time. A great read."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I enjoyed On Beauty. It is a book set mostly in upper middle class academia with some forays into lower class life. The depiction of life in academia with all the infighting is very well done. There is a dynamic between liberal and conservative philosophies that I would have liked to see more of. A lot happens in this book. There is marriage trouble, a depiction of the life of a up and coming street artist and student life at a fictional school that is modelled after the Ivy Leagues. Although I enjoyed this book I found it to be uneven. For example the disintegration and perhaps resurgence of the marriage is very interesting but the life of Carl and his conclusions about the world of academia are difficult to believe in. However, this is a minor complaint about an overall enjoyable book."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Fans of the BBC soap \\"EastEnders\\" will recognize the way Zadie Smith has constructed this wonderful send-up of academic life. Here are the closely interwoven lives of people related by blood, lust, and a too-tightly knit community. Here also are the racially mixed families, the full-blown sibling disputes, the marital infidelities, the class divisions, high-volume generational conflicts, the festering animosities, and the seldom acknowledged but visible contrast between the good-looking and the plainly unattractive. Meanwhile, there are uncounted threads of plot lines as we cut from one character to the next and learn the secrets they are keeping from each other, secrets that will eventually have their day of revelation.Layered over all this melodrama is a brilliant comedy of manners that is often laugh-out-loud hilarious. Smith occasionally dips below the surface of her characters to reveal their self-awareness, but most of the time her scenes are about what happens when people are talking to each other. With her fine-tuned ear to the varieties of speech, Smith uses wildly different ways of using language to represent collisions of personalities. And she invariably sets her characters on a collision course with each other.This is a hugely entertaining novel and a refreshing departure from more sober-sided and politically correct portrayals of \\"diversity.\\" The novel has some ideas on that subject, but they're not very big ones. Readers should just settle back and let themselves get lost in the fun house."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Our book club read it with disbelief and puzzlement: why the universal critical acclaim? The writing is stilted, the story tedious and plot absurd: all in all I couldn't care too much about any of the characters. If anything, it is similar to her meandering horrible first book."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"This is the first of this author's works I've read and I'm very impressed. I also know nothing about her background, except that she's a thirty-year-old black Londoner, but she does a terrific job describing the dynamics of a mixed marriage in Massachusetts. This consists of Howard Belsey, a transplanted Brit and untenured art history professor at Wellington College; his black wife, Kiki, a hospital administrator and self-described non-intellectual -- though she has a forbidably analytical mind -- and their three children ranging from fifteen to twenty. The author takes you inside each of their minds in rotation, giving the reader a multifaceted view of the action and of everyone's reactions to it. The other major player is Sir Monty Kipps, a hypocritical, black, hyper-Christian, right-wing apologist of the sort who pretends to openmindedness and egalitarianism but who cannot pronounce the word \\"liberal\\" without a sneer. Kipps, also from London, and Howard are mortal professional enemies and political opposites, and when Kipps comes to spend a year at Wellington -- ironically in the Black Studies Department, which he also sneers at -- the battle lines are drawn. But that's only one plot among many. Howard was rather stupidly unfaithful to his wife with a colleague. The marriage may be simply running out of steam. Jerome Belsey, the eldest son, had a very brief affair with Victoria Kipps, a very, very hot number indeed. Zora, Jerome's overachieving sister, is a freshman at Wellington and already a master of academic politics. Levi, the youngest son, wants desperately to be \\"street,\\" one of the brothers from Roxbury; he also has sold his soul to rap music -- which brings him into contact with Carl, a very talented young poet/rap artist, who gets into a creative writing class at the college (though he's not a student), then into the Black Studies music library, and whom Zora also has a massive crush on. And there's Levi's other sort-of-friend, a Haitian teacher refugee now earning a living on the street. And hovering in the background is Carlene Kipps, Monty's wife and a complicated lady with whom Kiki develops an unlikely friendship. All these layers and interrelationships sound like too much for a book of less than 450 pages, but Smith is extremely talented and very subtle. I shall definitely be pursuing her other works."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I've read Howard's End a few times and think it far superior to this book. However, On Beauty was a nice read during my recent Mexican cruise. I thought there were some interesting parallels to Forester's book, and I enjoyed the descriptions of the politics that goes on with professors at a liberal arts college. However, I didn't really care about any of the characters that much, and found most of them shallow and annoying. I'm not sure if I'll be willing to invest much time in another book by this author in the future."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Coming to it from a background as an academic whose area is developmental issues across the lifespan, I found her depiction of the individual characters insightful and sympathetic."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Zadie Smith makes a literary comeback with On Beauty, an ode to EM Forster's Howard's End. Like her first novel, White Teeth, Smith examines the complex lives of two families - the Belseys and the Kipps - battling it out in the fictionalized college town of Wellington. Howard Belsey is a liberal Rembrandt scholar who is on the brink of tearing his family apart after having an affair with a fellow professor. His long suffering wife, the lovable Kiki, tries to keep together the sanity of her three children - Jerome, Zora and Levi. Howard's archrival is Monty Kipps, the ultraconservative Trinidadian academic who comes to Wellington with his sensitive wife, Carlene and their promiscuous offspring, Victoria. Beginning with the rumor that Victoria and Jerome are to wed, the novel is a perfect capsule of the red state/blue state battle in America. This book is the perfect comic relief for anyone still recovering from the 2004 and/or even the 2000 US Presidential election. Any reader can relate to at least one of the characters. Smith gives her readers her version of race, gender, class, art, psychology, religion, family and politics - 21st century style. Lovers of Smith's first book will continue to be proud of this young writer who is beyond her years. Like in real life all her characters have flaws and concerns that they come to terms with in the end. Smith is a remarkable voice in latest crop of new writers. Forster would be most proud."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Zadie Smith's ambitious first novel, WHITE TEETH, sent its young author into the stratosphere of literary culture, earning her rave reviews with critics and readers alike. Although her second novel, THE AUTOGRAPH MAN, received mixed reviews, Smith's intellect and creativity have firmly established her as an author to watch. Now, with her third novel, ON BEAUTY, Smith returns to her fine form as a gifted storyteller and astute cultural critic.ON BEAUTY focuses on two families that couldn't be more different. Howard Belsey is a white Englishman, an art historian on the verge of obscurity, teaching at Wellington, a fictional prestigious university in New England. His African-American wife, Kiki, is larger than life in more ways than one. A big woman with a taste for bright clothes and a passion for food, Kiki struggles to comprehend why Howard had an affair with a woman who appears to be Kiki's polar opposite. Their children --- Jerome, Zora and Levi --- are each brilliant in their own way, eager to define themselves apart from their parents and as part of some culture, whether religious, academic, or \\"street.\\"On the other side of the coin (and the pond) are the Kippses. Howard Belsey and Monty Kipps (a so-called public intellectual) have bickered via the pages of academic journals for years. Kipps, a black Englishman, has the fame and respect (and book deals) Howard has never achieved, even though his conservative politics couldn't be more removed from Howard's liberal sensitivities. When Howard's son Jerome, bitter over his father's infidelities and eager to explore evangelical Christianity, accepts an internship with Kipps and then carries on an ill-fated love affair with Kipps's daughter Victoria, a more personal connection between the two families arises, a connection that grows only stronger (to Howard's chagrin) when Kipps accepts a visiting professorship at Wellington. Forced into close proximity, Kiki Belsey begins a surprisingly intense friendship with Monty's sickly, stay-at-home wife Carlene.ON BEAUTY is a broad, sometimes messy novel, full of ideas and unafraid to tackle subjects both lofty and earthy. The novel's title is reminiscent of a scholarly treatise, and indeed, Smith does touch on aesthetic theories both directly --- in numerous discussions of Rembrandt paintings and in other contexts --- and indirectly. Her female characters are brilliant and accomplished but still loathe their own bodies. Her male characters argue articulately about politics and art but still remain in thrall to their own desires. The \\"mommy wars,\\" rap music, campus politics, love --- Smith tackles them all with her characteristic wisdom and humor. Along the way, she adroitly references pop culture high and low, including Alice in Wonderland, Outkast, and practically everything in between.Like Smith's earlier novels, ON BEAUTY is ambitious and bold in its storytelling. This time, Smith's book is a homage to E. M. Forster's masterpiece HOWARDS END. That is not to say that readers unfamiliar with Forster's novel can't enjoy ON BEAUTY; when read in tandem, though, Smith's novel gains even more richness, as it adds dimensions of race and gender to Forster's ideas about class and human connections.--- Reviewed by Norah Piehl"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"\\"On Beauty\\" constitutes Zadie Smith's most accomplished novel to date. Its focus is the Belsey family, comprising the devoted African-American matriarch, Kiki; the father, Howard - an emotionally detached English academic, and their three fiercely individual teenage children, inhabiting the affluent college town of Wellington in New England. Here, each character faces a challenge to their own morality and beliefs, and must come to terms with a redefining perception of the nature of true beauty and fulfilment, whilst endeavouring to preserve the cherished family unit. This is an honest look at domestic life: the impact of the cultural and political backdrop on these people, and their effect on each other - articulated with Smith's typical wit and elaborate metaphor. In short, an absolute joy to read."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"This novel is the story of Kiki Belsey and Carlene Kipps, feminist matriarchs of the Belsey and Kipps families, of their feckless husbands, leftist agitator Howard and conservative Monty, and their very interesting children. Kiki, married to Howard for 30 years, is tested in the course of this novel by various ethical and moral concerns, just as the characters in Smith's model, E. M. Forster's *Howards End*, are tested. Carlene's gift to Kiki provides a delightfully witty moral center to the novel.The husbands, Howard Belsey and Monty Kipps, are locked in a battle of words and ideology over Rembrandt, each being an academic specialist in the field. Drama ensues when Monty comes to Wellington (a thinly disguised Ivy League university)from London as a visiting professor. Howard, an activist proponent of free speech, promptly sets out to prevent Monty from lecturing on removing \\"liberal\\" from \\"liberal arts.\\"The daft behaviour of the husbands is mirrored in the highly hilarious behaviours of their teenage and college age children. The privileged lives of the children are counterbalanced by that of Carl, whose fate is not surprising.*On Beauty*, a reflection on defining \\"beauty,\\" covers large terrains: geography of London and a small New England town near Boston; racial politics; generational conflicts; teenage angst; middle age angst; inheritances; wife-husband conflicts; gender politics; contemporary popular music; the sublime; the ridiculous; authority and challenges to authority; the importance of poetry in the world; the life of the mind. Smith's sensitive handling of the explosive topics she explores makes this novel a delight to read.Smith's writing style is very agreeable. She has an excellent ear for various types of speech and conveys the utterances of her characters with dispatch.Smith's satire is thoughtful, incisive, penetrating, and, ultimately, uplifting. Her comic genius, shown to great advantage in her novel, *White Teeth,* here again beguiles the reader. Even as one winces at some of the rightfully placed jabs that Smith offers, one still finds the book to be a real page-turner. Students, faculty, and non-academics alike are bound to enjoy this fictive universe, so similar to the real world of academe."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"This book is excellent. Well written, engaging and enthralling-- I couldn't put it down. Left me with many new perspectives."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"The ladies of my book club loved \\"On Beauty\\" and were amazed that the author who was born in 1975 was so able to get into the minds of characters in their 50s. She sets up two academic families, one in England and one in Massachusetts. The English family is black and conservative while the American one is mixed race and liberal. There is professional competition and hard feelings between the two patriarchs; and when the English professor comes to teach at his competitor's college, the men take opposing stands with regard to academic politics. In the small town environment their families also develop interesting relationships.The juxtaposition of liberal and conservative attitudes is interesting and I kept watching to see which the author was going to prefer. However, she revealed no bias and showed both liberals and conservatives as a mix of good and bad traits with a touch of hypocrisy and a little infidelity here and there."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I have read the three Zadie Smith's novels, starting with the brilliant \\"White Teeth\\"; then the rather, to me, esoteric, but also well-crafted and well worth it, \\"Autograph Man.\\" \\"On Beauty\\" asks all the right questions about relationships, truth, beauty, in Zadie Smith's original inimitable style -- that her husband is a poet is so very fitting! That she is so young and so wise is a tribute to her keen intelligence."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Sometimes I avoid novels with too much hype, and at the beginning this one had a little too much hype surrounding it for my taste. Ultimately, I was unable to reist the lure of it. I purchased the hardback, and I was quite engrossed in the tale. But I still don't understand the hype, and even worse, I didn't like ANY of the characters. None of them seemed realistic, likeable or relatable. Merely interesting. And at some point, my jaw just dropped and I was never able to pick it up again. Good story teller. Not scared of a tough topic. But, unfortunately, the book is not a great work of fiction. Just a good one."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"After hearing several people suggest that this was indeed a good book, I made the purchase. This certainly wasn't one of the worst books I have ever read, but it is certainly very poorly written. As you read chapter after chapter, you are left wondering why exactly you are reading this book in the first place. I can't say I have ever read any other of Zadie Smith's works, but throughout the entire book, I couldn't help but feel like a 13-14 year old decided to write a book. You wanted to like the characters and find something interesting, but the book never delivers. I certainly regret making the purchase instead of borrowing the book from a friend or the library. If you are truly interested in reading this book, don't let me discourage you, but do not BUY the book."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"From the description of the book, I expected On Beauty to be an interesting, insightful work that would influence my thought processes and bring to the forefront of my mind issues that I otherwise would not consider. While the book had moments of truth, of insight, and of humanity, they were strung together incohesively, rendering the novel almost impossible to comprehend in its entirety. There were too many issues brought up and too many characters followed, that the experience was rather overwhelming.Of course, the focus on many characters would not have been such a negative thing had they been developed properly. Instead, they seemed to remain the same from beginning to end.On Beauty is not an engrossing story. It is, instead, a slice of life from the Belsey and Kipps families that is all too stagnant and ultimately leaves the reader wondering what the author was getting at in the first place. Its lack of momentum left me wondering if I should even finish. I pulled through it, though, and was left disappointed."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"On Beauty is the second Smith novel that I have tried to read. I loved White Teeth and although I was underwhelmed by the sloppy ending, I tried reading her second novel, The Autograph Man to no avail. Ever positive, I made the mistake of taking On Beauty as my only reading material on a trip to Europe and waded through the first 150 pages. I cannot say that I have very much interest in finishing it. The novel lacks a cohesive story and seems to be only a loose structure in which Smith attempts to write clever dialogue for her uninteresting characters. To make matter worse, the novel's characters are not very believable and doubt the veracity of the \\"coolness\\" of their dialogue, especially in the case of the younger characters. Even more disconcerting, I find myself back in a the world of academia, chockfull of literary references and academic observations and slights only entertaining to individuals in those very tedious circles. While there are some beautiful sentences and pithy observations about life and its vagaries, many of the sentences are overly labored, distracting from the narrative flow. Ultimately, so much crafting of language makes the novel suffer. At this point, I could care less about what happens to any of the characters. Fourth time a charm, maybe?"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"A flawed but lyrical and energetic novel. Zadie Smith clearly has the ability to invent and then to describe compelling and vivid characters: Kiki and Howard Belsey; their three children Jerome, Zora, and young Levi; Montague and Carlene Kipps, and their offspring the gorgeous Victoria (\\"Vee\\") and the stiff and judgmental Michael; even a sudden ingenue, one Katie Armstrong, 16 and from South Bend, IN, whose feelings of bewilderment at post-structuralism intrude briefly on the center of the book. Then poor Katie just as suddenly disappears from the book, never to be heard of or from again. Her vanishing act is emblematic of the problem with this book: its fundamental lack of coherence and staying power. The only character who spans the entire novel is the bountiful Kiki. The others slip in and out when Smith needs them to make one point or another. As the book starts to flag, which it does, she desperately engages the characters in increasingly desperate activities, bringing the book to a crisis in the final chapters that she seems to have no plan in hand to resolve.Another reader who suggested that a good editor was needed here certainly has it right. Zadie Smith is a talented young writer, but she is not well served by a reputation that exempts her from the kind of editorial scrutiny that would have been required to make this into the great book that it could have been. I found the wit, the author's descriptive power, and the charisma of the world she populates to be sufficient to keep me engaged in the novel. It doesn't, however, realize its potential."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I love Zadie Smith. I think she is an amazing talent. Whte Teeth is among my favorite novels, but I felt like all Ms. Smith's weaknesses came to roost in this novel. This novel lacked focus, but if you think about it so did White Teeth, the difference is you have to think about it with White Teeth, and with On Beauty it is far too painfully obvious. I still enjoyed her social commentary, and I enjoyed the process of reading the novel, however, it left me feeling nothing. I don't know that there was a point to this novel, and honestly much of it wasn't even worth remembering it was so mundane.Fast paced it is not, but that's not her style. I still think she is an amazing talent and can't wait to read the next one."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"It was just that dry and boring I never really connected with any of the characters, I gave up reading about 3/4ths of the way through."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"When I first began reading the novel, I was not sure if I could believe in the characters. With a short amount of time, I did. Then I began to feel anxious, because the novel's cynical tone and tendency to question and deconstruct every element of \\"polite conversation\\" as false and ingenuine made me feel self conscious and as though few conversations could be trusted as real or honest. With time, I came to see that this constant questioning of the banal interactions of our lives made the rare moments of true, deep, and honest connection between characters all the more meaningful, much like our own life experiences. In fact, most of my initial impressions of this book, whatever they included, changed with time, which I believe is part of the beauty of this book. It is definitely worth sticking with the book and giving it the time it requires to recognize the subtle, slow growth and change in characters and yourself as a reader."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"not nearly as bad as the autograph man. not as sparkling as white teeth. it started off really slow, then i started enjoying myself around p. 100. however, it went back to mediocre. i won't give up on zadie smith, but i'm waiting for her to write something satisfying all the way through again."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I think I feel sorry for Zadie Smith. Maybe she could develop into a good writer if she were left alone to hone her craft through much practice and reflection. Alas, she has been adopted as a media darling, and she is being made out to be much better than her work shows her to be. But, hey, she's young, and she has a long way to go yet. I thought that \\"On Beauty\\" was replete with rather loathsome characters (who can stand these people?!) who only succeed at sabotaging their happiness over and over again -- rather predictably. I know, that's human, but what's the point of reading hundreds of pages of it? The only person who isn't so annoying is Jerome, and that's only because he's blessedly absent for most of the book. So who are we supposed to believe is a redemptive character? Kiki? I don't sympathize with Kiki because she has raised shallow, self-centered, maladjusted children, and has remained in a marriage to an awkward pedant. The Kippses (or the Kipps', as Ms. Smith interestingly spells out every time) succeed at being not only annoying, but self-righteous to boot. The \\"showdown\\" between Carl, Victoria, and the motor-mouth Belsey girl is the only part that woke me out of my stupor, and only because it resembled a seedy talk show brawl. Hey, I tried to get enjoyment where I could, however base.\\"On Beauty\\" is beach reading (if you like lugging a novel the size of a phone book to the beach) but it is nothing more than that. I think E.M. Forster would not indeed be puffed up with pride at the fact that Ms. Smith made the unfortunate comparison between her book and \\"Howard's End\\". Don't waste your money on this homely tale."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"As actor William Hurt might say in his stolid and mannered, look-at-the wheels-turning-in-my-head voice: \\" I.............could not................finish.................this book. . For a book about race and identity, family dynamics and adultery, and academic rivalry and competition it's surprisingly dull. Midway through the book, there is little or no character or plot development, and the overall feeling is that it was written to fulfill a publishing contract. There's some amusing banter from the younger son, a teen teen who lives in an academic community (a disguised Wellesley, Massachusetts?) but tries on an inner city \\"hood\\" identity, and several of the scenes are very well written.There's a lot of potential here, with the relationships between races, the liberal/conservative dichotomy and the two affairs, one emanating from the liberal father (a Rembrandt scholar), and another between his older son and the daughter of the right wing Rembrandt scholar. (It seems that almost every best-seller over the last ten years either connects somehow to a European painter or contains recipes, and is presented to the consumer as either erudition, or a creative subversion of the novel, or both.) However, the book meanders rather than moves, and, as noted by other reviewers here, the characters sometimes lack authenticity. Perhaps, in this admitted attempt to emulate Forster, the author overlooked the necessity to keep the book interesting and credible."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"What I like most about Zadie's style of writing is her ability to create believable characters that are wonderful yet flawed - which is, I believe, the human condition. And she does this with great heart. She also has an insightful sense of humor. For instance, the interactions at the party which Kiki and Howard put on for their friends and college colleagues is hysterical. One of the funniest episodes in literature I've read in years. It rivals one of my favorite party scenes (also among college professors) that was created by John Gardner in his novel Michelson's Ghosts. Zadie Smith is quite an amazing writer. On Beauty is a great read."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"This book has its moments-- bits of lovely writing, occasional insightful moments, some good laughs. It wasn't a page turner, but I'm not sorry I read it. The book also has a lot of problems, and they distract from the reading experience. The most noteable problem, is, as others have pointed out, the terrible and terribly overdone dialect. The southern graduate student's speech is ridiculous and laughable. Levi's is as well-- and I'm giving smith credit here by assuming it was supposed to be bad dialect, a middle class black american kid emulating slang, but it fails to accurately capture that. Levi speaks like no person in the history of ever, and would be laughed out of his house AND off of any street corner. Moreover, the characters never really come to life-- and this was a book about types I recognized and wanted to like. The Belsey's feel like walking lessons, and fall into cliche. Their feelings are never clear unless they're explicity telling you why they are the way they are. For a while, the sweeping tone of the book and frequent point of view shifts distract from this, but eventually you want a character to hold onto, and there isn't one. The Kipps' are even worse, seeming to exist solely as foils for the Belsey's. Their conservatism and Christianity are so shallow and underutilized from the begining that the subsequent exposure of hypocrisy doesn't pack any sort of punch. No one feels fully imagined. Characters can state a worldview or a self perception, but when all of the characters have to explicitly announce their politics and purposes all the time, it's a problem. More problematically, the pivotal scene of the book isn't really written. It's as if Smith got to the book's climax, realized it was already at least a hundred pages too long, and rushed the ending. Kiki's deciscion never feels real, and the final scene seems to indicate that there's been a good deal of forgiveness on the part of the children, something that seems unlikely.I'm not sure that this book would be great even with better editing and dialogue. I think we've gotten to the point in literature where we pat an author on the back for even bothering with the \\"big questions.\\" This book isn't really telling us anything new, and it seems confused about what it wants its reader to take away. Ok, beauty standards are varied, and in one way or another dominate women's lives. Pretty girls have problems because they're too pretty and ugly girls have problems because they're not pretty enough. OK... and? It's amazing that in a book about appearances, we never know what anyone looks like, aside from basic physical shape. What does Zora look like, beides big? Why is it that Kiki still gets hit on in black neighborhoods, even with the extra weight, but Zora is invisible to the opposite sex? What does it mean that Victoria isn't just a pretty girl, she's a pretty, dark-skinned black girl in a world where that's still often seen as a rarity or contradiction? Is her sexuality a rebellion against her family,and if so why does she side with them in key deciscions? Race creates identity issues, especially when mixed with class issues... and? This books doesn't tell us anything new about middle class kids trying to pass themselves off as poor, or interracial families having racial tension. It's not enough to have provocative material, or to have big issues-- you've still got to do something with them, and this book really doesn't."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Other reviewers have covered most of what I consider problematic about this book. What bothered me most was that Kiki is a black, Southern woman with absolutely no connection to any black Southern woman I've known or seen. Other reviewers have criticized Smith for her inauthentic dialogue. The inauthenticity extends beyond the dialogue. Smith knows little to nothing about black Southerners. Her description of \\"soul food,\\" in the book is unrecognizable to any \\"soul food\\" emanating from the South. When she has Kiki reverting to her Southern roots, her dialogue, culture, etc. are markedly more Caribbean instead of Southern. The Belsey children speak slang that is Caribbean, not Southern. To some, this may be a minor point, but since Kiki's Florida roots are a central part of her character, that they weren't authentic is troubling.A sabbatical in New England does not make Smith an authority able to accurately critique American culture, especially black-American culture."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"It's almost impossible to dislike Zadie Smith's writing because she's very funny and has a fine handle on character; still, there were so many strange flaws in this novel I kept commenting on them out loud with the friend with whom I was travelling while I read Smith's third novel. She seems to misunderstand entirely the way the American tenure system in private colleges works (it is impossible Howard Belsey would have the institutional authority and privileges he has and yet be untenured), and she also seems to have done little research on things as simple as American labor laws (a major subplot about one of the characters being forced to work by a megastore on Christmas Day is another impossibility in the US). And her re-working of many of the basic plot points of Forster's HOWARDS END are simply unnecessary, and force Smith to create all kinds of plot contrivances to allow the truth of Mrs. KIpps's bequest to come to light. The novel is most valuable as a study in character, and here Smith does not fail to delight: the characters of Howard, Kiki, and Zora Belsey are so funny and finely drawn that even with all the errors and elaborate plotting coincidences I've still recommended this book to others already. Yet it is a bit of a puzzle why by her third novel Smith should be making such elementary errors in her plotting research."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I just finished reading \\"On Beauty\\" after several friends recommended \\"White Teeth\\" and I found Smith to be an enormously talented writer who does not humanize her characters. It is hard to say that she does not flesh them out, we do hear their voices but we cannot relate to them except as objects of Smith's satire. There is nothing wrong with writing a purely satirical work but she is trying for something more here and it does not work. After introducing her characters we are ready to enjoy their humor, their failures, their triumphs and eventually their redemptions but, alas, the book ends on a note of cheap revenge that is decidedly unpleasant. She makes some attempts to honor these characters but Smith's basic cynicism does not allow her to do so. I believe Smith believes she is transcending stereotypes by portraying a mixed race marriage and young black intellectuals. Why is it then that Howard, a white, working class man ultimately fails in his dream career and as a family man, that a beautiful, smart black student is portrayed as a sexual predator destroying lives around her. Did Smith so hate her time in America that she has her character Victoria destroy so many lives from the minute she lands here? And on and on with each character whether black or white. One wants to like these characters but she just wont let us. Two scenes I did think were brilliant - the way Claire, the teacher of poetry interacts with her students especially during their evening at The Bus Stop, and the department head making introductory remarks at a faculty meeting with a one line cameo appearance by Smith herself.Ultimately, this is a mean book with mean characters that leaves a bad taste in one's mouth. I would have given it one star only that Zadie Smith is a brilliant writer. I would say to her \\"channel your anger, give us believable characters that we can care about\\". Zadie Smith needs to grow up."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I read so many glowing reviews of this book that I couldn't wait to read it myself. I hadn't read Zadie Smith's other book but I knew that it, too, was well-acclaimed. This book was really hard for me to finish, so I didn't. That doesn't happen to me very often. I try to give any book enough of a chance that I'll keep reading to the end. In this case, I didn't care enough about any of the characters to keep going. All of the characters left me feeling indifferent at best, except perhaps for Kiki and Levi. I can appreciate books that are slow-moving; I don't read many mainstream pulp novels and was a literature minor in college. But this book moved so slowly that I just couldn't get into it. If I had felt something - anything at all - for the characters, maybe I could have.I agree with the other reviewer who said that the book really should have been set in England. I had to keep checking back to make sure, because it really did not ring true to real American life to me. The tone of the book seemed much more British. Because of that, I think there were some inconsistencies in the book that contributed to the reason I found it so difficult to read. I don't honestly understand why so many people have rated this book so well. To me it was just pretentious and unjustifiably long-winded, and with characters I didn't find especially compelling."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I was hugely disappointed with \\"On Beauty\\" after being blown away with Smith's debut \\"White Teeth\\". I was certain that she was the UK's new wunderkind.Many of the storylines lagged with soggy prose and inconsistent characterisation. Who are these people? We get to the end of this book not really knowing the essence of these characters. Too many of the characters are unlikeable. Not helpful for one who is desperately trying to like a book.I was also concerned with the amount of typos. I am a shameless stickler when it comes to this and was horrified to find so many mistakes. Where were the editors?It's not all bad, though. There are some beautifully written and hilarious moments throughout this book. The overall picture for me, however, was that of a boring effort and one which did not deserve to be shortlisted for the 2005 Man Booker Prize."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"In many ways, On Beauty is similar to White Teeth. It's laugh-out-loud funny and contains marvelous descriptive passages. In the end, however, the similarities the novel bears to White Teeth work against it. Reading On Beauty, I got the feeling that I'd already experienced much of what unfolds. And I had--in White Teeth. For example, a character named Jerome falls in love with another family in the same vein in which Irie Jones and Millat Iqbal fall in love with the Chalfens. Zora, by the way, seems nothing more than a smarter version of Irie. Also, Smith describes the beauty of Zora's love interest, Carl, in the same manner she describes Millat's beauty. And, as in White Teeth, On Beauty's religious characters prove themselves hypocritical. But the similarities don't end there. In, On Beauty, Smith even borrows a line she devoted several paragraphs to in White Teeth--\\"What you looking at?\\" While Smith's commentary surrounding this question is hilarious in White Teeth, it should have been left out of On Beauty.The novel's similarity to White Teeth does not ruin it. Its many flaws do, though.The dialogue is disastrous. At one point Roxbury resident Carl asks Zora, \\"Am I meant to be grateful?\\" This is a British phrasing. An American would say, \\"Am I supposed to be grateful?\\"Smith particularly fails at her attempt to incorporate Black English Vernacular into the text. Sometimes she nails it, as is the case when a character named Levi asks, \\"Where they at?\\" Other times, she stumbles, such as when Levi asks, \\"Who you on the phone to?\\" \\"Who you talking to?\\" or \\"Who you on the phone with?\\" should have been used instead. Also, an abundance of black characters say \\"I be.\\" This wouldn't sound strange coming from an old black Southerner, perhaps, but, coming from young blacks, it does. Even uneducated young black urbanites speak a more standard form of English than this. Even the blacks on UPN shows speak a more standard form of English than this. Then there's Kiki, a middle-aged black woman with Florida roots, who speaks consistently inconsistently. At the beginning of the book, she tells her husband, Howard, \\"Your life is just an orgy of deprivation.\\" But later she remarks that the sun \\"done set.\\" It's unlikely that the same speaker would have birthed both lines. I was similarly startled when Carl, an uneducated rapper, who utters sentences such as, \\"I be a college a man now,\\" has no difficulty writing lengthy papers for the music department of upper-crust Wellington College.Often, the black American characters are stereotypes. All of the women have large breasts and backsides and use the words \\"baby\\" and \\"honey\\" gratuitously. At one point we meet LaShonda, a young woman who calls Levi \\"baby\\" a half-dozen times in the span of two pages. Of course a girl with a \\"ghetto\\" name such as LaShonda must not only have a \\"big old booty,\\" she must also be an unwed mother of three on the prowl for a new baby daddy. It's also apparent that Smith believes all black Americans refer to each other as \\"brother\\" or \\"sister.\\" Maybe during the Black Power Movement. Not in 2005.Kiki's weight is also problematic. While Howard cites Kiki's 250-pound frame, in part, for his adultery, black urban men won't stop hitting on her. Shapeliness is said to be valued in black culture, yes, but 250 pounds is not shapeliness, it's morbid obesity. Reading On Beauty I am puzzled as to why celebs such as Star Jones and Oprah Winfrey weren't sex symbols in the black community when they were at their heaviest. There's also the fact that there are no consequences for Kiki's weight gain. In real life, middle-aged, overweight black women suffer from hypertension, diabetes, joint-pain, back pain, etc. Kiki, on the other hand, does yoga.The novel includes other inaccuracies about black Americans. At one point, Kiki says, \\"We got black kids dying on the front line..., and they're in that army 'cos they think college has got nothing to offer them.\\" Actually, the military's promise to pay college tuition is the main reason young people of all races, blacks included, enlist.Smith's description of Kiki's and Carl's palms is also wrong. The two are described as having rich-brown palms. Blacks, even dark-skinned ones, have palms that fall into the pinkish-beige range. Smith makes the opposite mistake when describing Kiki's areolas, which she describes as pinkish brown. In fact, a dark-skinned black woman would have dark brown areolas.While not all of what Smith writes is wrong, it isn't necessarily good. She uses an abundance of adverbs and adjectives, many repeatedly. How often can someone be called fatuous? There are also redundancies such as, \\"He nodded mutely\\" and non sequiturs such as, \\"Kiki restrained herself. Instead she opened her purse and began searching through it for her lip-gloss.\\" Huh? Instead of what?Character development is also lacking. Choo, the main Haitian character, is nothing more than Smith's mouthpiece. His sole purpose is to inform the reader about Haiti's plight. Then there's Victoria Kipps. Worshipped for her beauty, Kipps turns out to be a walking cliche. She may be stunning, but, guess what, she's dumb! She may be promiscuous, but, guess what, she's easy because sex is all men want from her. Sigh. Katherine Armstrong, a character who makes an inexplicable cameo (as does Helen Keller), is eerily similar to Lee Fiora, the protagonist of Curtis Sittenfeld's novel, Prep. Like Lee, Katie is from South Bend, Ind. There, she was the brightest kid in town. But, surrounded by New England preppies at Wellington, Katie is overwhelmed and, thus, painfully shy. Ring any bells? It's also problematic that Smith features other minor characters such as Doc Brown, her rapper-brother's stage name in real life. This choice uproots readers from the fictional world and places them into the real one. The same thing happens when the reader encounters a poem written by Smith's husband mid-novel. The rap lyrics and poetry used in the novel should reflect the characters who authored them. How can this occur if Smith gives fictional characters credit for verse composed by real people? This move also led Smith to make another mistake. When Carl recites the lyrics of Smith's real-life brother, he refers to Mc Donald's as Macca D's. No one in the States calls McDonald's Macca D's. Amercians say Mickey D's.In closing, read On Beauty if you're a Zadie Smith fan or if you'd like to see how she tweaked Howard's End. Don't read it because you've heard it's a good book. At best, it's mediocre. I give it two-and-a-half stars."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"After having read \\"White Teeth\\" a few years ago, I was anticipating another novel of similar caliber. What a disappointment!While she acknowledges up front that it is written as an hommage to E.M. Forster- the storyline is needlessly convoluted in order to mirror the plot of \\"Howard's End\\". What's worse are the underdeveloped, frustratingly shallow and across the board uninteresting characters- at the end of the book the reader doesn't particularly care what happens to any of them. I gather the intent was to examine personal relationships through the lens of larger scale issues of class, race, gender and aesthetic- but to say that she falls short is a gross understatement. It just feels so contrived- the dialogue- the meandering plot- the lifeless characters- all of it. This is definitely not a novel that will transport you into the story. It was a complete waste of time to read (I am kicking myslf for buying it in hardback)-and such a let-down after having read Ms. Smith's other work."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Zadie Smith may have bitten off more than she can chew with \\"On Beauty.\\" An examination of families, academia, race, class, infidelity, truth, and, ostensibly, beauty, the novel is wide ranging yet lacks a cohesive center. Smith relies heavily on dialogue that is unrealistic, clunky, and detracts from both the narrative threads and character development. Her grasps of American English is tenuous at best, especially her portrayal of \\"street\\" talk and even her use of academic language. Furthermore, her characters' voices lack consistency and constantly contradict themselves in tone and cadence. That said, the plot is fairly engaging, in particular the story line that follows Harold Belsey through a mid-life crisis. Perhaps in the future Smith should stick to a world that she knows and understands, as well as employ an adequate copy editor. For an intelligent and witty look at academic life and marital relationships, I heartily recommend Richard Russo's \\"Straight Man.\\""},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I don't like to put a book down, and the only reason I didn't toss this one aside is because it was a gift. What is all the hype about? The characters were stereotypical, and worse, even after 100 pages into the book, I couldn't have cared less about what happened to any of them. The author is far too judgemental of her characters. She forced her judgement of them so much on the reader that I was almost inclined to root for the ones she didn't like. But like I said, I couldn't bring myself to care for any of them. The author inserts too much of herself and her opinions into the book, thereby beating the reader over the head with her viewpoints about race, academia, culture, and family life. A superb author can win a reader over to his/her viewpoint in such a subtle way that the reader does not even know that he/she is being pulled in a certain direction. This author clearly prefers a crass sledgehammer approach."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"It is obvious Zadie Smith is excellent at the craft of writing. But I don't understand the hype about this book. Too many characters, some not developed very well."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I loved this novel by Zadie Smith. I'm so poor--I was an English major--that I have to get my books from the library. So, I checked out and read On Beauty last year. However, tonight I was at Borders and I saw this book on the remainder table. I choked! How could such a great, well written novel be priced at $5.99? I loved this book so much that I bought it. I've read the negative reviews posted here and do not understand what the reviewers were thinking. Maybe they are jealous. I'm a writer, but not jealous, just joyous whenever I can find something good to read (difficult these days). This novel is fresh, interesting, well written, great characters, great story, I learned a lot. In some ways this book reminds me of Lush Life by Richard Price. However, On Beauty did something that I dearly need and almost never get out of a book anymore...it made me laugh...out loud...God that felt SO good. (Glee Club.) Richard Russo's Straight Man did that to me too. Anyway, if you want to enjoy a novel, try reading this insightful, perceptive book. Kiki is such a wonderful character. She still makes me smile!"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I recently read \\"On Beauty\\" by Zadie Smith and found it to be a very good read. The novel askes many questions that give readers much to think about: the male/female perspectives on beauty and aging; what is an \\"authentic\\" black experience; essentially 'airheaded' academics and much more.You will get to know the Belsey family of liberal white British academic Howard, his earthy African-American wife Kiki and their children: the pious and heartsick Jerome, the single-minded yet slightly out of touch Zora, and the desperate-to-be-down Levi. It is a family that is very different from any family in most new novels and I found the racial mix, politics, and setting of the novel very refreshing. You fall in love, get infuriated, and laugh with this family. To make a pop culture comparison, they are the \\"Huxtables After Dark\\", if you will.The only place Ms. Smith trips up is in capturing real American dialects and idioms--sometimes she comes off as a British person who gets all of her information about America via sitcoms and MTV. Also, since this book is often placed in the 'black section' of the book store, it may have a problem finding a wider audience, unfortunately stuck between books with titles like \\"Thug Missez\\" and \\"On Tha Down Low\\" ( I wish I was making this up!). But for people looking for a different sort of read from what you may usually find, this is a good one."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I'm quite surprised by the negative reviews here- I found this book absolutely compulsive- its full of great dialogue, witty descriptions and is, at times, laugh out loud funny. The funniest part I remember is when Howard is at an academic dinner, and nearly wets himself because a barber-shop quartet are singing U2's In The Name of Love- in a samba style, complete with an impromptu moonwalk. That, alone, nearly had me in tears.I notice that many of the reviews are critical of Smith's use of dialogue, and her portrayal of black Americans such as Howard's wife Kiki. Being from Britain I can't comment on this, but I personally found the dialogue snappy and convincing, and Kiki to be a warm and empathetic character (and, unlike one of the nuttier reviewers, I didnt worry about why Zadie Smith didnt elaborate on the myriad of potential medical conditions which Kiki's 250 pound weight would entail. This is fiction, after all.)Many other reviewers complain that there is no plot. This is true, but because there is such a complex tangle of relationships throughout the book, this simply isn't an issue- in fact, it zips along beautifully. This novel isnt meant to be a fast-paced thriller- it's a study of human relationships. But it is perhaps here that the critics are on to something. For if I were to criticise On Beauty, its that the characters, while being interesting and recognisable, are rather stereotypical. Anyone who's been to university will recognise the clever but overly-eager Zora, or the hippy poetry teacher Claire. But Smith doesn't do enough to develop them. In fact, the characters fit rather too neatly into the reader's expectations. The characters Howard and Monty Kipps, exemplify this- the former a pretentious left-wing intellectual who's not much good at coping with reality, the latter a hypocritical right-wing ideologue. So far, so predictable. But Smith never really problematises this- the Kipps family in particular just weren't developed much beyond their hard-line Christian values. (Although the one exception to this is Kiki's touchingly brief friendship with Monty's wife, Carlene). This rather superficial charcaterisation is both On Beauty's strength, and its weakness. Its strength, in that it caters to its audience very well- if you're middle-class and university-educated, or have a literary inclination, you will revel in this novel's jokes about intellectuals and student life, etc. But the responses of some of the reviews posted here prove that not everyone was enamoured by Smith's potrayal of race relations, or minority ethnic groups.When you enjoy a book as much as I enjoyed reading this one, you do ask yourself if there's something suspicious about its being too readily appealing. And I think that the criticism above accounts for that. Perhaps, in trying to deal with large, thorny issues, Smith has bitten off more than she can chew, and has skimmed the surface as a result. However, had Smith undertaken a more thorough and complex exploration of these issues, the result would have been a much weighter piece of literature, but a far less enjoyable read."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"On the face of things the two families featured in Zadie Smith's On Beauty are fairly functional. The Belsey family lives in New England, near Boston to be more precise. Howard is English and white. Kiki, the wife, is from Florida and is black. There are three intensely sophisticated progeny, Jerome, Levi and Zora. The Kipps family, meanwhile, lives in Old England in a less than fashionable area of north London. Monty and Carlene are black British with Caribbean roots. Their children are the delectable Victoria and an older, cool, already achieving son, who figures little in the tale. Both husbands are academics. Howard is a specialist on art history and is an arch-liberal. His rival, Monty, is almost rabidly neo-conservative. They have feuded for some time, academically speaking, despite their families being on good enough terms to want to stay with one another. When the story opens, Jerome Belsey is in London and has fallen for the obvious charms of Victoria Kipps and is suggesting engagement. Now wouldn't that complicate things!As the book progresses we learn that these apparent domestic heavens are less perfect than they appear. The two fathers are not as dedicated to the promotion of domestic harmony as they at first seem. Romances bud and blossom amongst and between the younger members of the plot. There are inter-generational liaisons of various kinds.There is also a heightened professional rivalry between Howard and Monty. There ensues an ideological battle that intensifies when Monty joins Howard's US college on an invitation. Monty tries to stir things up and, as ever, liberals are his prime target. Howard effectively assists by rising to take the bait, trying, as liberals sometimes do, to equalise before he has gone behind.Zora, Howard's daughter, wants to enrol in a poetry class. There are no places, however, because the tutor - a poet who has a special relationship with Howard - takes in talented candidates who are not actually on the college roll. A campaign is launched and Zora, her dad and Monty are in the thick of the argument. Things come to a head when a poor lad from the rough end of town is invited to join the class because of his unique gift for rap. An accommodation must be found. Victoria, Monty's daughter also figures on campus and she manages to complicate most things simply by looking the way she does.Basically the lives of these families begin to unravel as tensions pull at the frayed ends of their lives. Zadie Smith writes with great poignancy and irony. She is particularly successful in characterising the generational gaps, and she does this without ever sounding clich&eacute;d or patronising. The sex that simmers throughout just beneath the surface occasionally bubbles through and, when it does, it generally makes quite a mess.In theory, all these people want to do the right thing by and for others, but when opportunities arise, they usually can't resist the pull of blatant self-interest. They all profess the long view, but in reality they all live for the moment, and that is usually passing.On Beauty is a convincing and moving portrait of modern family life. Zadie Smith consistently resists the temptation to pitch the populist against the elitist. Her characters merely live, and the ups and downs they all suffer are eventually no more than their individual and collective experience."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I have always been a sucker for academic novels, and (though I liked _Moo_) this is the first academic satire I've read that comes up to the standards set by David Lodge's _Trading Places_. The criticism other reviewers make of Smith's handling of dialect may be correct, but her ability to capture academic discourse is excellent, and her parody of deconstructionist dialogue in Professor Belsey's class (a scene that comes right at the centre of the book) is dead on. More generally Smith's take on the mixture of and confusion between beauty as aesthetics and beauty as an object of (or source of) desire (particularly sexual desire) was fascinating. And the openness of the question with which this novel ends, which is the difficulty of understanding how love survives though beauty does not, makes it poignant. (Now I need to read _Straight Man_ ...)"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"As a Booker Prize finalist, this novel should be good. Unfortunately, it isn't. Almost without exception, the characters are unlikeable and shallow. Most of them live in a college town, but author Zadie Smith apparently doesn't care much for universities. She makes dueling Rembrandt scholars Monty Kipps (an unchristian Christian, grave robber, and neo-con) and Howard Belsey (an illiberal liberal, without a recent original thought, who is temperamentally unable to avoid coupling with members of his faculty and student body) into cardboard cutouts of the life of the mind. Their respective families and heavily satirized university colleagues don't fare much better.Philosophically \\"On Beauty\\" leaves much to be desired as well. Is Mozart or Keats more beautiful than hip-hop, and if so, why? Is beauty physical, e.g., the 20-year-old temptress Victoria Kipps, or is it found rather in a breadth of humanity, e.g., the 250-pound matron and pie-giver Kiki Belsey? Does deconstructing a text or a painting reveal its beauty or kill it? Is art life? Does anyone care?The pacing is uneven, the book has a bloated feel, the prose is often Edwardian, there are riffs (such as Howard's visit with his estranged father) that lead nowhere, characters disappear without a trace, the end is unilluminating. On the other hand, the publisher overstocked by half. The resulting price is more than right."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I recently got this book and White Teeth and was disappointed in both. Descriptive passages without narrative momentum, snarky and repetitive. This author does not have much to say. I would recommend at least getting them from the library before you waste any money."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"On Beauty takes place in a suburb of Massachusetts and follows two families: The Belseys and The Kipps. Howard Belsey is an Art History professor at the prestigious Wellington University. His archrival Monty Kipps comes to Wellington for a year with his family as a visiting professor. Howard and Monty represent opposite ends of the spectrum: liberal and conservative, non-religious and religious, pro-Affirmative action and anti-Affirmative action and on and on. Their views are brought to life as On Beauty covers the year they share at Wellington.On Beauty has strong character description. It tackles the various issues that professors and students of a university face as well as the issues of the home (loyalty, fidelity, marriage, parenting, etc.) While not a fast paced read this book provides a good deal of conversation starters and controversial topics. It would be a good book group read."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Zadie Smith has once again created some interesting characters in her latest book \\"On Beauty\\". This time she seems to take some delight in sticking some painful pins in their dolls. Death, infidelity, occupational hazards, and theft are all part of a novel which still, despite these difficulties, provides a lot of entertainment. Two mixed race couples (one British and the other American) and their families find both friendship and hostility in their relationships with each other. The two male heads of family, both academics, are pompous bulls who paw the earth, and roar their political disagreements at each other. One is a liberal and the other a conservative, so what else can you expect?One of the half white, half black sons is so desirous of identifying with his black heritage that his efforts to identify with the black community are often quite comical. A daughter's promiscuity wreaks havoc within the other family. The American father who dearly loves his wife (?) survives one affair that becomes publicly known, and then falls into another one.Fine writing coupled with an interesting tale makes this an enjoyable book. Yet I was a bit disappointed; this book does not match up to her first novel \\"White Teeth\\". Some of the family members lacked definition. Perhaps there's just too large a cast to be able to do justice to without writing a much longer book. And, sadly, this novel lacked the wit of \\"White Teeth\\". Ms Smith did have one funny farcical scene when our professor was the guest of a student at a college banquet. It seems that there is something about small choral groups singing in harmony that he finds hilariously funny. Sure enough a choral group marches on stage during this black tie dinner, and starts singing. The prof's reaction to their performance totally embarrasses his student, and himself. To me this was the funniest part of the novel. Smith is an expert at this kind of inanity, and I just wishe there had been more of it. All in all, though, it's a good read."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I enjoyed this book a lot! Others have explored the plot in detail, but I found Smith's characters rich and diverse -- in particular Kiki. There were times when I wanted to see other characters explored further (what happened to the new husband of Howard's mistress after the affair was revealed?). All in all, this is an entertaining book from a talented writer. I recommend it!"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"She's here to stay!!!Zadie Smith's big comeback!An excellent read and very different for a change. I actually liked this better than WHITE TEETH and to me it proves that Zadie is here to stay. She's a brilliant writer, not just intellectually, but with soul and guts. I FEEL HER as the young people say.I still, however, think that Kola Boof is the most important new VOICE in Black women's literature. Sure she's raw and unorthodox, but she's more powerful than Zadie and Z.Z. I put Zadie Smith and Z.Z. Packer just a little behind Boof in revelancy and a LOT BEHIND in daring.

He smokes.Who is the protagonist here? There is no single story line but several. There are oddities and profanities sexualities and ambiguities of heart. The sex is violent and gratuitous. The profanities stupid and gratuitous. This was a good idea for a long short story.There is mystery, but no resolution.There is infidelity and unwarranted forgiveness. The end left me feeling like Ms. Smith didn't want to go out to buy more ink for the printer.The intellectual/academic men in this book are stupid. The women are wise.For WRITERS who wish to read a young, contemporary novelist with a hand on her own heart -- not on the pulse of the commercial public -- read \\"THE HISTORY OF LOVE\\" by Nicole Krauss.Zadie Smith's celebrity sold this book. Nicole Krauss's talent sells hers.Zadie Smith's On Beauty, said to be a take off on Howard's End and like an experiment is remains unfinished, uncertain.Nicole Krauss's book is its own story, the story of a book, of how a book written sixty years before impacts a random reader and how what we put **out there** stays there.The legacy of On Beauty will be its momentary snapshot of a poorly framed current culture of youth.The legacy of A History of Love will be its universal, ever current longing to not be invisible.The main male character in On Beauty is an unattractive wimp who can't keep his pants on. Howard's voice is a whine. I think Ms. Smith despises men.The main male character in The History of Love is an old man who awaits his death. Leo's voice is permanent and familiar. Ms. Krauss adores her elders.In all the result, for me, of On Beauty, was an exercise in placing all the *right* ingredients into her big soupy novel.Comparing the writing between the two is another review entirely. There is no real heart in On Beauty. It is superficial, yet perfectly written.In \\"The History of Love,\\" the writing is as alive as its characters. The language does not intrude or insult. The words are perfect, the pauses as well as the gushes of emotion. If only it were a difference in technique, but no - the difference between this book and On Beauty is in the amount of blood the author was willing to pour from herself into the work. Nicole Krauss will need time to heal.I have a personal distaste for writers who add such things as song references, or current trendy markers as items credibility or as time stamps to their stories. Do I really care what the boy listens to on his iPod? No. I care what the boy feels in his heart.In On Beauty there are wonderful, well developed subplots. It's the story line that is empty and dependent on these digressions.In A History of Love, one never forgets the very real characters (though one can become a little lost) The reader never loses track of the book about which the novel is titled and written, the piece of string that keeps it all together.On Beauty: 2 Stars ; History of Love: 4 stars (But then, the first books I can think of that I would rate 5 stars would include Madame Bovary, Les Miserables, Atlas Shrugged and To Kill a Mockingbird.Get Beauty from the library. There are no words or passages which cry out for highlighting, no pages to be dogeared and referred to again and again.

I have since read White Teeth which I too thought was amazing but quite different in approach and method.When looking to rate in some nebulous, objective manner the quality of an author's work, it may be best to look into what the author set out to accomplish in the first place. If Smith was setting out to do some sort of historical fiction or dramatized non-fiction about the American academic culture or do some scathing exposition of the dodgy world of Rembrandt criticism, she had done a bad job of it (Zadie Smith is not a documentarian in the strict sense of the word, she is, however, a great recreator of contemporary Western society). That's why I don't think it's the case that she sought to do that kind of story.This book is about two things: middle age and social (interpersonal) politics, it is as much about the interaction between middle age and social politics as it is the way each of them affect the whole lives of the characters in the story. The story of Howard is terribly interesting because one can delight in his downfall as he realizes his agedness yet realize that the mistakes he makes along the way are at least human, if not understandable in some instances (the pridefulness of wishing to be recognized for his academic work at the expense of his nemesis). Of course, Smith doesn't stray far from her character wheelhouse of hybrids too, which always adds some pretty attractive complication to the storyline.A great book on an interesting subject."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Zadie Smith is a wonder.

But, alas I was disappointed. I didn't feel it was a terrible book, nor a super book, but rather a good, interesting read. In other words, I'd like to think I got my monies worth, but I'm not sure. Maybe I'll read it again.The story revolves around two families that live in Mass. The reader will find the Belseys family with the main character Howard Belsey an Art professor and from the second family; the Kipps there is Monty Kipps. Monty arrives with his family and begins his work at the same university that Howard is employed. In summary these two characters lock horns on various social issues (family life, marriage, faithfulness, etc.) and their strong views are covered in this story that spans over a one year period. I suspect that so far this sounds boring, but the author did weave this subplot (I say subplot because there seemed to be numerous plots where I'm in the middle or I'm just starting another one) into the story to make it very interesting.I use the word \\"interesting\\" loosely because I found it difficult to find a lot of empathy for the host of characters, although Zora with her sexual problems did stand out in my memory.The ending was a let down for me. It left me sort of confused, as if there were more pages to the story that needed to be read. Maybe that was intentional by the author. Overall I'm not sure if I would recommend \\"On Beauty\\" to my friends. I guess I would have to be very selective if I did opt to encourage someone to buy the book.

Again, Smith is wise, fiercely funny, and insightful.A Brit academic, Howard Belsey, is now teaching and living in a college town in New England. He's been married to for some 30 years to Kiki, an African-American, and they have three children, all about to find out for themselves what life is about.Their eldest son, Jerome, goes to England where he completely kicks over the family traces by going to work for a right-winger from Trinidad. He soon becomes enamored with his employer's daughter, Victoria.Another Belsey offspring, Zora, sets her sights on the salvation of a Boston rapper, and young son Levi seeks to define himself in perhaps not the wisest of ways.Can Belsey ever come to terms with a right-winger when the two are poles apart politically and culturally? Is it possible for these two families to reach an understanding of each other? Smith explores many human dilemmas with zest and perspicacity as the answers to this question are sought.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"The only problem with this well written, funny and insightful book, is that it ended. The author does such a great job of developing the characters, that I came to care about them and hated to see the end of their stories."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Compelling and well written. Gets you thinking about family and the dynamics and how we have woven threads even when we try to separate and be bold."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"If you'd like to read funny novels about academia, read David Lodge. As did many reviewers, I enjoyed White Teeth for the author's brash, audacious style (with certain reservations). This review should be rated in yawns not stars- she is an author with prodigiously interesting images but who really struggles when it comes to investing her own heart into characters and plotlines. Too clever for her own good and the reliance on Howard's End is a misstep. Clearly, Zadie Smith is the darling of critics but I trust Amazon reviewers on this one."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Talk about dont believe the hype this is truly an instance of that. A poor tree gave it's life for this book and to say nothing of all the man hours that went into writing this junk. Dont buy this book save your money. Nothing rings true of the book. It was like she was writing about a group of people she had heard about but never met. About places she had read a little about but never visited. There is no story here I would advice a soul to waste their time reading. Remember that is time you will wish you had that wasted time back on your death bed."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"After reading White Teeth, I was thrilled to pick up another Zadie Smith book, \\"on Beauty.\\" Although I do not like \\"On Beauty\\" as much as \\"White Teeth,\\" I believe it is a worthwhile read. Once again, I feel that Smith masterfully presents us with REAL people. These people aren't all good or all bad. They are REAL, and for that, I love Zadie Smith's writing. One thing I loved about White Teeth was the deep cultural messages and although \\"On Beauty\\" contained similar messages, it wasn't as profound. I was disappointed as I looked for deeper meanings into the characters and their motives and felt that Zadie Smith could have made a stronger effort to discuss the interracial marriage between Howard and Kiki and their children's own struggles for their identity in a rich white neighborhood. The two older children do not seem to think much about their personal idenity, at least in regards to race, and the only character who does is the youngest son, Levi, who tries desperately to be \\"street.\\"This book took a very pessimistic view of marriage and discussed affairs and divorce as if marriage has, like batteries, only a certain amount of \\"life\\" to it before it all goes to hell. I appreciated that the pain of affairs was clearly shown in all characters, including the wayward husband. The affairs the wayward husband has were so pointless and ruined his marriage and almost ruined his career. You find yourself so angry at the man! I was pissed because I was like, \\"Dude, you should have at least SOME rationale for having an affair beyond middle age boredom and lust!\\" Yet, the anger I feel toward this character simply testifies to Smith's ability to bring her characters alive and bring you into the story. It is truly masterful writing. The story is depressing but I couldn't NOT finish it. Each character is so complex, beautifully described, and beautifully developed. And although things go from bad to worse...you have to follow it through to the end. Throughout it all, you HOPE for the characters and I think that is the most powerful element of Smith's writing."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I actually enjoyed White Teeth better, unlike many reviewers who say this is Smith's best work. But make no mistake, \\"On Beauty\\" is a fine book and well worth reading. Smith is particularly good at dialogue."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I purchased and read this based on a great review in the New York Times Sunday Book Review. I was not disappointed.The story is constructed on a wonderful frame and decorated with engaging, careful writing. It is a highly embellished, almost rococo story; anyone seeking the distilled prose style of a JM Coetzee will be unhappy. The author gives voice to adolescents, especially, in a full and thorough way. She respects her young characters and does not create glossy caricatures of youths, as so many authors do.Other reviewrs here have complained that the author has a poorly tuned ear for American slang, gives inaccurate descriptions of black body colors and does a bad job of describing physical traits. I can only say that none of these things appeared to me to be a problem. I much admire the way her characters adjusted their speech and deportment according to their shifting milieus. Particularly with regard to descriptions of middle aged bodies and the way they work, I was on board. And as a 56 year old woman with many same-age intimate friends, I think I am on safe ground here.My only complaint about this book: God bless your young heart, Zadie Smith; middle-aged academics and others are a lot more nuanced and occult than you now know. The story from Howard's and Kiki's perspectives does not quite ring true. The writing has the mildly snide acerbity typically heard among slightly insecure graduate students. The author will improve in this area with more years on her.The author is a wonderful observer and chronicler of humans, especially young ones. I look forward to many more witty, kindhearted, trenchant stories. It is a joy to watch this talent develop."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"This book, though good, wasn't great. I expect great from something receiving so much hype. I was interested in the story, but didn't much care about what happened for the characters. I wish I had spent my time somewhere else."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"White Teeth was dead boring but gave her the benefit of the doubt and perservered with Autograph Man, which again failed to capture my interest on any level. Have only read On Beauty as I always try and read the Booker shortlist and how this novel can be nominated,let alone shortlisted is beyond me. Again it just seems to be a raving mess. I really want to like this author - she interviews well, is very beautiful, I definately admire her, but if this wins over Arthur and George and Never let me Go there is something seriously wrong ( although last years winner was rubbish too!)"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Zadie Smith knows little about life in a small liberal arts school in Massachusetts. After all, she is not even American and it appears that she has done little research on this subject matter. Characters did not seem realistic or believable. It seemed to me that she or her publisher wanted to market the book to an American audience so she made the book take place in the US, but that subject is not her expertise.I understand that this book was nominated for the Booker - I am starting to lose respect for the prize. It is not even well written. There is much better fiction out there - skip this one!"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Zadie Smith's third novel, \\"On Beauty\\", touted unashamedly as a rewrite of E M Forster's \\"Howard's End\\", succeeds on a level, which in lesser hands would not have been thought possible. Avoiding by a mile a verdict of misadventure which would have greeted such a seemingly foolishly brave venture, Smith brings us bang up-to-date in contemplating contemporary truths behind the famous \\"only connect\\" line from Forster's original novel by examining class and race divisions, political ideology and religion, the role of art and above all, universal human concerns and values in modern society.The liberal Belseys and conservative Kipps, two families from opposites sides of the track, cross paths and swords when their contrasting social values and beliefs collide as soon as the Kipps relocate from London to Massachusetts. Howard and Monty, heads of their respective clans and both Rembrandt scholars, are poised for a dangerous showdown that could cost them their academic reputation and careers. Ironically, the flash-in-the pan romance between Jerome and Victoria in London, rather than accentuating the rift between the two families, in fact provides the perfect excuse for Kiki to reach out to Carlene, thereby forging an unlikely friendship between the two older women that would form the moral center of the novel. There is a secondary plotline focusing on Carl, a member of the modern underclass, his accidental relationship with the idealistic Zora and his seduction by the heartless Victoria, which brings the conflict to a climax.But strip away the ideological faade and you will find the Belseys and the Kipps looking uncomfortably like each other. For all their puffed up conservatism and pro-establishment values, the worm at the heart of the Kipps family proves just as pernicious as the dysfunctional badge the Belseys wear on their sleeves. Howard's philandering, his undisguised disconnect with his family, etc, reveal the hollowness at the center of his agnostic secularism - Howard Belsey proudly declares they don't celebrate Christmas. In daring to subject the fractures and fissures of modern life to microscopic scrutiny, Smith has given us characters that don't endear themselves to us. Apart from Kiki and Carlene - earth mother and realist respectively - the other clan members are by turns pathetic (Howard), smug (Monty), repugnant (Victoria) or else surprisingly underwritten (Jerome and Michael).Smith's prose is wonderful and never less than compelling. The plot moves a tad slowly at first but picks up in the final third and best written part of the novel. The dialogue isn't always smooth - Levi's and Carl's street talk sound forced and awkward - and we could have done without all the gratituous sex. It just leaves a nasty aftertaste.Despite its flaws, \\"On Beauty\\" makes for a totally absorbing read and is one of the best novels I've read last year. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"As gifted a writer as Zadie Smith is, she disappoints in \\"On Beauty\\". Lifting a novel's entire structure from E.M Forster is not an \\"homage\\" - it is plagiarism. Translating another author's plot into present-day idiom is, at best, a sophomoric exercise. I expected better from this talented author.Do yourself a favor and ignore the hype that surrounds this book. Read the work in its original form, E.M. Forster's \\"Howard End\\". And pick up Zadie Smith's \\"White Teeth\\" to see what this author can do when she refrains from the derivative."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I initially enjoyed this book and the characters but as I got further into the story, I started to feel like it wasn't going anywhere. The story seemed to run out of steam for me after Carlene discovered the truth about Howard's affair. I found myself wandering and losing interest after that point and then I finally gave up without finishing the book."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"So I read it -based upon the euphoric reviews. Excuse me - while there are two hilarious scenes regarding academia (Zora's blackmail of the dean to gain admission to a class and a university faculty meeting) and one truly sad scene when an older faculty member goes back to visit his working class dad, there is nothing else to recommend reading 400+ pages about basically uninteresting, sometimes nasty folks - no matter what their color. The book is disjointed in terms of narrative and uninteresting in terms of characters. If I met them at a gathering of any sort I would run for cover and I am so annoyed that I spent as much time with them as I did."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"It is difficult to write a review of this third novel of Zadie Smith without making a comparison to her bestselling, freshman attempt \\"White Teeth\\". I was captivated by \\"White Teeth\\"'s sometime caricature-ish portrayal of the culturally and ethnically diverse cast of characters: some of them take themselves too seriously, some of them don't think much of themselves or of their surroundings, but in the author made even the most self-conscious characters be a little self-deprecating in a humorous way. Details are thrown at the reader either purposefully and effectively, or in a way that adds more color to the writing. Upon reading the book, I felt that it's alright to take one's self seriously, and it's alright if one doesn't, but that we should both respect and take some humor in our diversity. In \\"White Teeth\\" I felt that the author used diversity as a very good tool to make captivate the reader's interest, propel the story along, introduce conflict, and introduce humor all at the same time.In \\"On Beauty\\", there is still that sprinkling of ethnic and cultural details, strong and minute, but they are more often neither necessary nor effective. It seems that taking all the ethnic, gender, and cultural aspects from this novel will not subtract much from it. The wit is still there, the cartoonish portrayals of certain archetypes and stereotypes are still there, but they are disconnected from the storyline. I have not read the original inspiration of this story, so perhaps I am missing something here, but if I hadn't read \\"White Teeth\\" I will still have written the same about \\"On Beauty\\".If you have read \\"White Teeth\\" and really enjoyed it, then \\"On Beauty\\" is worth the price of admission. If you have not read \\"White Teeth\\" and know Zadie Smith only from book reviews and interviews, I will only hesitatingly recommend this book. Perhaps it is Smith's familiarity with the British way of life that makes \\"White Teeth\\" appear to be a more integral and effortless piece of writing, but both aspects are lacking in this latest novel."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"For its first 200 pages, 'On Beauty' lacks clear momentum. The characters aren't yet in sharp focus and the reader - this reader at least - is uncertain of where the plot is heading. Once the story begins to come together, however, it takes off with a bang, rewarding the patient reader with plot-lines that neatly (but unpredictably) interweave and characters that are fully realized and sympathetic, despite their flaws. Smith's send-up of the vacuousness of modern academia is spot-on, and the pain her characters cause each other and themselves really resonates. The ending of the novel is simultaneously ambiguous and satisfying - as in life, some characters are left happily and others less so.I would recommend 'On Beauty,' but it requires a willingness to plod through the first sections."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Firstly, I was extremely impressed with Zadie Smith's first effort, 'White Teeth', though less taken with her follow up, 'The Autograph Man'.'On Beauty' is undoubtedly a return to the form 'White Teeth'. Another epic sprawling family novel with lovely (though not overdone) writing and fascinatingly flawed characters. I particularly loved Kiki, the strong wise matriarch of the house, whose humanity is continously juxtaposed against her husband's intellect.Unfortunately, as addicted as I was to 'On Beauty', it suffers the same problems as her earlier two novels. Namely, the pacing within the text is slightly off-centred, with almost nothing occuring within the first and last forty pages. Nothing appears to evolve quickly enough, and although I was entirely captivated, I was never sure why. I also found the African-American characters simplistic and capable of falling into the mold Smith was perhaps trying to break from. Perhaps it would have been better set in England (like 'White Teeth'), because some of phrasing has a distinctly un-American ring to it.Similarly, the title 'On Beauty' is somewhat illogical, although I can see that Smith is essentially writing about discovering the flaws of selfhood and learning to dance with those flaws.Despite this, an interesting read, although not as engaging as 'White Teeth.' I am looking forward to Smith reaching her full and obvious potential."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"It has taken me over a month to get round to writing this review, as I really struggled to decide whether or not this book is worthy of recommendation. An enjoyable read, certainly, but often it seemed to me that Smith was making a point and I was simply missing it...unclear where the narrative was going, what the characters were about and actually at times what the whole point of the story was. Howard's spinelessness irritated me endlessly. A shame, since Smith's style of writing is accessible and persuasive. Will read 'White Teeth' on the basis of having read this novel though, as I am told it is superior to 'On Beauty'."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"After writing \\"White Teeth,\\" (which I highly recommend) Zadie Smith has not come close to a satisfying read.The plot of \\"On Beauty\\" is unoriginal -- how many times have we read about middle aged professors sleeping around, with the \\"good\\" wife and hip kids -- puhleese!The main charcters are uninteresting, and the writing is just OK.When the cover of a book has the author's name in type 5 times larger than the title, watch out!Waste of time."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Chekov would've hated this novel. Why? By the end of the novel, there are a dozen guns on the mantle, not one of them fired.Every character had potential. Every story thread had potential.But non of them go anywhere!I read the whole novel WAITING and nothing ever really happened.There is an affair which has no real meaning in the book but to supposedly add weight. There are friendships which never go anyhwere.The supposed main plot never even really happens.Guns guns everywhere but not a single shot fired!"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Our entire book club disliked this book. We had a hard time feeling a connection to the characters. Howard, the largest presence in this story, feels like a blank at the core. Upon putting this book down, his motivations and what might be in his heart were still a mystery to me. Characters such as Jerome, Victoria, and Carl were intriguingly introduced, but then inconsistently treated for the rest of the text. Especially Carl - he just disappears - no resolution to his story at all. As am homage to Howard's End, some of the parallels were not strongly enough underscored to flesh out this book for me. For example, the heart-to-heart connection between Kiki Belsey and Carlene Kipps does not jump off the page at you the way the connection between Margaret Schlegel and Mrs. Wilcox did.I thought Zora was one of the most interesting characters, and I like how Smith contrasted her obviously high intelligence and intellectual arrogance with her social awkwardness and sexual insecurity. But Smith makes her smug a bit too often, and so feeling a connection with Zora is difficult as well - most of the time I just wanted to smack her. And I have to agree with the others that Smith needs to brush up on her American characterizations. There was next to no authenticity in that regard. Especially the Southern dialogue - laughable!It also feels like Smith had a hard time figuring out how to end this book...I understand that end is supposed to be a beginning of sorts...but the fact that there were so many plot threads left dangling, unresolved, by the last page just gave me a feeling of incomplete-ness.Aaaargh...must go and re-read Howard's End to dispell the queasy feeling left by On Beauty."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Sometimes we read books simply to enjoy the feeling of recognition -- of ourselves, of the \\"types\\" of people we've encountered, of the world around us. For me, On Beauty was that kind of book. Not the kind of novel that will change my life or take me to new places, and not \\"Important Literature\\" that will be read generations from now, but a story that presents me with characters and situations, cleverly and carefully evoked, that I find delightfully and sometimes disturbingly familiar.This being said, it makes sense that the book wouldn't have universal appeal. I live in Boston and I went to a college very much like Wellington. So I can relate to many of the scenarios and characters (and I mean that in the sense of saying \\"that guy's a real character\\"). For me, reading the book was like looking through old yearbooks or photo albums. The pleasure of it was akin to watching a well-written but not particularly deep TV show, like Six Feet Under, or Sex & the City.My major beef with the book was the dialogue. I second the reviewer who commented on Smith's tin ear for American speech. Where were her American editors? An American--even one with a British father, I'd think--would never say \\"You were meant to be here,\\" but \\"You were supposed to be here.\\" Jerome would call his emails \\"emails,\\" not \\"mails.\\" And Levi would certainly not \\"pay a call\\" to his friend in Roxbury. It's incredible that no one made the necessary edits, for the American printing if nothing else."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I am one third of the way through On Beauty. I came to Amazon to see if I was the only one just not getting this book. I don't care about the characters, the setting or plot. I agree with one of the other reviewer's when he said the book was long winded. I finish most books and even picked this book up for the second time to give it a chance but I just don't have the patience to continue when there are so many good books I still have not read. Once again, I should have read the reviews on the jacket more carefully and I would have realized they were for her last book and none were for this book, always a dead giveaway. I just checked my only other review and saw that in that review I recommended Zadie Smith's White Teeth. Funny."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Hard to beleive a first time novelist would have gotten this published, let alone well reviewed. the characters don't speak anything like real people (an inner city rapper: \\"I'm awfully glad you could come.\\"), the plot is barely in existence, the last third feel chopped together in a software program. Its childish. Prudish. Pompous. Read any two pages and you'll see."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"This is the story of two families, each family headed up by a strong-willed academic man. These two patriarchs are opposites and enemies (or rivals, if you want to be optimistic). The emotional center of the book revolves around Howard's struggling marriage to Kiki. This novel is satirical and comic, on the one hand, and heartbreaking and sensitive on the other. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"So, this is one of the greatest works of contemporary fiction I've read (listened to) in a while. The only reason I considered it at all (being a strict devotee of the cannon)was because it won the Orange Prize for Fiction in 2006 which is the UK's award given to the best original full-length novel written by a woman in the English language.My complaint with this set, therefore, lies not with the story, but rather with the quality. I noticed that there were many \\"blips\\" or \\"skips\\" in the CD - not sure if it's just my copy or all of them. I suppose I could have sent it back, but by the time I noticed it was a recurring problem, I was already too involved in the story to let it go.Peter Francis James gives an excellent oral reading of this work."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Una de esas novelas que cuando las termin&aacute;s, extra&ntilde;&aacute;s a todos los personajes como si los hubieras conocido. Tiene buen ritmo. Lo mejor: las descripciones de las familias y susmiembros. Lo de la acad&eacute;mica de la pintura me pareci&oacute; lo m&aacute;s flojo del texto."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Zadie Smith is a young brilliant British novelist whose best strength is in creating characters, such as Howard, Kiki and Zora Belsey - the main protagonists of \\"On Beauty\\" - sucessfully breathing life into them with a keen wit and sensibility of the human condition. She also succeeds admirably with several members of the Kripps family; husband Monty, wife Carlene, and daughter Victoria. Their tightly interwoven interactions are those often replete with ample mirth, which frequently left me laughing almost out loud, as I read about their interpersonal foibles. But Smith's skills as a compelling storyteller leave much to be desired, even though she has written a very good homage to E. M. Forster's \\"Howard's End\\", introducing academic politics, race and gender relations and rap music, among others, into a heady, occasionally fascinating mix. However, Smith tries too hard to emulate Forster's plot and prose, occasionally coming across as a second-rate version of Rick Moody, emulating his penchant for long-winded sentences and prose, which I find in her case too exasperating to comprehend (In Rick's case, he often has a sound artistic reason for his literary pyrotechnics.). Regardless, I can still recommend \\"On Beauty\\" to those unfamiliar with her work, since I find it a substantial artistic improvement over her literary debut \\"White Teeth\\". However, if I am interested in reading some elegant contemporary fiction on politics, race and religion, I'll have to turn elsewhere, to authors as diverse as Edwidge Danticat and William Gibson, not Zadie Smith."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Having read White Teeth with glee and interest, I felt that On Beauty might be as good if not better. It is not. It is annoying. What happened to the editorial process? Zadie Smith uses English vernacular where American would be appropriate. It's a trap a lot of English people new to America fall into and it is jarring.The story is just a ghastly rehash of the usual academics-are-god type that has been written countless times, and it is done without gusto. There is a smugness to the tone of the writing that is also unattractive. There is a lack of wisdom to the whole enterprise that makes this read like a high school essay.In summary, I agree with the above reviewer's comment \\"the author overlooked the necessity to keep the book interesting and credible.\\""},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"A big brawling novel ripe with ideas of race, class, and education, 'On Beauty' surprised me with how quickly it had me invested in it's characters. I have to admit the first fifty or so pages I had to work to get a foothold, but soon the novel found it's rhythm and I keyed right in. A white English University professor, Howard Belsey, is teaching at a prestigious Boston college,has been married for thirty years to an African American woman, and has three bi-racial children each in various stages of their adulthood. His somewhat routine life is sent into a tailspin when a rival conservative African American professor comes to teach at the same school. Funny, thought provoking, and just wonderfully written, it was a great book to end the year with."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"This book packs a great deal into 450 pages or so, and it's not all fully digested. The academic debates over the nature of beauty in art, which clearly matter to Smith (note the title of the book!) are not really integrated into the book's structure. In fact, Smith plays them for satire more than for anything else. The characters who are not part of the academic world (Kiki, Carl, for example) seem more real and more fully developed than the university types.As this book picks up steam about one-third of the way through, however, it hits its stride. Smith does well in showing how all these imperfect characters from two generations interact with each other, across the generations and within them. Her portrayal of the Belsey marriage seems very real to me. Kiki is constantly frustrated with Howard's failings (infidelity is only one of them), but until the end, always seems to find that there is enough history between them to continue the marriage."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I think it was courageous of Smith to tackle bi-racial America academia. But her distance makes the story quite awkward, ven slow at times. I am halfway through the book, regaining interest after several scenes that I forced myself through. Smith will always captivate me with her ability to illustrate dialogue, inner thoughts and gestures. My only real gripe with On Beauty, right now, is that I feel all the nuances of voices actually very familiar to me (Floridian \\"country\\" grammar, Roxbury slang, alienating white academia, well-to-do West Indian) is constantly being broken down by the narrator. Before I began reading her first novel, White Teeth, I worried the British vernacular would throw me for a loop. It didn't. It became natural after the first fw pages, nothing overtly explained. I wish Smith would have kept in mind that her readers, like her, are quite conscious of the languages heard in urban spaces, that we can recall and even imagine tones specific to age, class, region and skin color. And to echo other reviews, the young people in the story are at times unbelievable.I'll keep reading. I can't let a story go unfinished.P.S. Am I silly to think that reviews about books need not give away the entire story?"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Zadie Smith is one of the most powerful authors I have read in recent times. She is so subtle about the race factor that we don't get to find out the races of the protagonists till the first 50 pages or so. She has also captured the emotions of Kiki and Zora perfectly (why is it that women always stand out in emotional moments!) and the characters stay with you even after you put the book down.If you enjoyed the movie \\"Crash\\", you will love this one."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I read this book on a train and then plane. The only option to not finishing the book was to stare at the seat in front of me. I would not have bothered to finish it otherwise. It is dull. There is not a single character that is likeable. I don't want to read a book where I dislike every character. The characters do not grow as people. The main character, Howard, learns to use Powerpoint by the end of the book. That is his biggest achievement. It is that dull.It felt to me as if Ms Smith was tasked with writing a book that could be sold to the broadest possible audience, so it is a transatlantic and mixed race. There are lots of things she obviously doesn't know about America.The sex in it is horrible. One of the things that annoy me about literature aimed at young women is the propensity for attractive young females to form relationships with crusty old men, of the age where nasty hairs have sprouted out of their ears. Is this realistic? (Another example is A girls guide to fishing and Hunting.) Maybe this is the norm for those in the publishing field, but it just doesn't work for me. It happened twice in this book, with different old geezers. It is a statistical anomaly.The academic setting was not at convincing either. Moo by Jane Smiley does a better job.I'm giving it a two because the girl can write well, I just don't think she has that much to write about. I'm sorry to be so harsh as I thought White Teeth was great."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Zadie Smith's \\"On Beauty\\" is a sweeping novel chronicling the lives of two disparate academic families - the liberal-leaning Belseys and the staunchly conservative Kipps. Howard Belsey is a white professor, and Monty Kipps is a black professor; both study art and hail from the U.K. They also both married black women, but that's where the similarities end. Specifically, Howard and Monty have been waging an academic vendetta across the Atlantic. These two families start to intertwine in unexpected ways - or at least unexpected to the characters in the novel. When Monty comes to the U.S. and joins the faculty at Howard's tony liberal arts college (the fictional Wellington), sparks fly.\\"On Beauty\\" has a bit of a hook - it's an homage to E.M. Forster's \\"Howards End,\\" which is a book I really love. Primarily, the similarity between these two books rests on common motifs and a few shared plot points. Specifically, both novels explore the potentially negative consequences that can occur when well-meaning progressives become overly involved in the lives of the \\"less fortunate.\\" In this case, Howard's daughter, Zora, attempts to help a talented street poet she meets. However, her munificence may be more about wanting to remold Carl in her own intellectual image rather than help him on his own terms; plus, she kind of has a crush on Carl and hopes he'll reciprocate. In addition, both novels concern class struggles, with \\"On Beauty\\" focusing especially on race.\\"On Beauty\\" is a sprawling, messy book crammed with interesting ideas and details; unfortunately, many of its themes are not fully developed. In addition, the characters sometimes ring a bit false, and the elements relevant to \\"Howards End\\" feel a tad forced. As a result, some readers may view this book as more of an experiment than a truly great novel; I know I did at times. However, even when it falls short, it does so in an interesting way. Overall, I recommend this book, although less enthusiastically to readers who dislike books that are more than a bit self-conscious or pretentious."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Like many of the other reviewers, there were times during this longish book that I wondered what the hype about it was. Interesting, yes; humorous, certainly. But I wasn't entirely sure what the direction was-until the very end. And the last 3 pages explains the entire trajectory and raison d'etre (sorry for the bad spelling) of the book. And ultimately, reading this book was a worthwhile endeavor.This book is about how everyone sees other people through blinders and through the prism of our beliefs and ideals--nothing too startling there--but then the book goes on to examine what happens when those blinders are or are not removed. It's much easier to live a life in which one interacts with simplified 'types.' But life isn't that simple, and it is much richer when one learns acceptance of all the flaws and complexities within oneself and within others, that is, if one is developmentally ready to do so. One of the strengths of the book is the recognition that because various characters are different ages, their ability to adapt, change and accept are different. The author has a good ear for the voices (literal and figurative) of her characters at all their various life stages.I also enjoyed this book because I am a recovering academic. In turn, perhaps because of this, in contrast to some of the other reviewers, I found the picture presented of academic life to be quite accurate. Take, for example, the Chair of the African-American Studies Dept. He is pleasant, bright, engaging, somewhat flawed in his personal life, and dispenses professional problems--including problem-people--by re-directing them in the extreme. (I'm not being specific here because to do so would ruin some parts of the book.) Having known a number of department chairs, the fictional character was far less unpleasant than the reality, but the principles rang true. Similarly, there are other academically-based characters who are variously exploitive, overwhelmingly self involved, or who have made careers of wielding a certain ideology, all of whom are well represented in universities throughout the US. I can well believe that Smith wrote this while at Harvard or any other liberal arts institution."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Loved the book: I liked the treatment of race, not too heavy-handed, not too melodramatic, but ever-present. Books that feature black women characters often focus too much on racial politics, and lose sight of their humanity and their being a woman. The main character's struggle with issues of fidelity, body image, and aging were well done."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I can't believe anyone gave this less than five stars. Her earlier work is a bit quirky, but she hits it on the nail here. The academic world updated and as observant as Kingsley Amis in \\"Lucky Jim\\", racial sensitivity examined with humor and precision, great characters... I loved it."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"If this book owes its \\"structure\\" to Howard's End (as the author readily admits), it nonetheless seems better compared to Tom Wolfe's \\"I Am Charlotte Simmons.\\" Like that 2004 novel, \\"On Beauty\\" shows how college campuses simmer with the tensions of diversity. Race and class flare up to confound the lives of the Belseys and Kipps.In this case, the campus is Wellington. I believe that Wellington is supposed to be in Boston. The setting is current. Characters go to poetry jams, have views on current affairs, and make mistakes with powerpoints and emails.And, the book is very upfront. She takes on figures like \\"Condaleeza and Colin.\\" Why do they seem to reject a system that may have given them a start? Equally, what really comes of years of orations in art history class? How can people take a painting about love and become competitive about its interpretation, especially if they cannot pursue love in their own life?The thing I like about this book is the way that it handles the charged topic. With Wolfe, I felt like he was writing about something that shocked his own sensibility. Zadie Smith is just 30 or so. She has probably used an Ipods or surfed on myspace.If I could change something, though, I would end more like Wolfe: with a big event that brings all of the characters together in a way that forever changes everything. Here, , it is just the opposite -- earlier misdeeds wither under sunshine and with it the hopes for a good ending for Mr. Belsey."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"This is the only book by Zadie Smith that I have read and by the contents of this one I don't feel like reading any other. However, I guess I should not judge this \\"it\\" author by one lousy book. This book was so boring, it centered too much on academia and not on the people who had potential of being slightly riveting. There were too many stories at once, the connection between the characters was dubious, none of the chapters of the characters culminated in a satisfying ending. To conclude, Howard is such a bore, it was a mistake to center the book on this character."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I just devoured this novel. Zadie Smith is outrageously insightful about the business of family. The novel is tender and forgiving. Bits of it left me stuck in an emotion. It is by no means a \\"perfect novel\\" whatever that would be...there are names that I would change, particular lines that stick out like an unfinished hem. But what you feel like while reading is that you're swirling around in the lives of these broken characters, and when you put the book down, they linger. Their problems are recognizable, human. That aside, she's hilarious. Just buy the thing and read for yourself."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"This was the first time while reading a book I have lost my place and thought it wouldn't matter where I started again. I was tempted to go on reading close to the end rather than try and find my place. Now having finished and read the whole thing I regret the extra time spent. Not only did the characters not learn from each other or develop over time, but I stayed much the same too from taking the journey with them."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I cannot understand the praise this book has received. The subject matter was kind of boring, the characters completely unbelievable. It was an ok read and I laughed once or twice but it was really nothing special."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Beauty is not only what we see but who we are inside. Sounds like a cliche but the way Zadie Smith writes about human beauty has nothing to do with cliches. The way she portrays each character, even the secondary ones, is breath-taking and aw-inspiring. I wish I was a writer so that I could express how magnificent and inspiring the book is. I'm just rereading it at the moment and find more depth and beauty in everyday world of average people. It depicts identity struggles every one of us has had: race, nationality, gender, sexuality, etc. Reading it once leaves you craving for more. Just read it and see for yourself."},{"Title":"Modern Written Arabic","review":"This volume is perhaps the most important contemporary Arabic descriptive grammar in English. It is based on texts from the 1990s with a preference for texts other than high literature. In its 800 pages, it covers most of modern Arabic grammar and syntax.As a reference grammar, it will not be necessary (perhaps not even useful) to the student until he is at least at intermediate level. The grammatical terminology is highly technical - there is a useful glossary of terms in the back - and has rather idiosyncratic variations from terms that have become standard over the last century and a half (e.g. the 'accusative' case becomes the 'dependant' case). This is annoying: more seriously in my opinion, no attempt at all is made to provide native Arabic terms. Grammar is illustrated by a wealth of examples, presented in unpointed Arabic script, in a formal transliteration (i.e. with i'rab transliterated) and in translation (sometimes two where the idiom differs vastly between English and Arabic). This is excellent, and mitigates my strongest criticism of the book - it is littered with typos, especially in the Arabic script. Fortunately with the transliteration, one has a check. It is disappointing that Routledge who, after all, are charging a vast sum equivalent to a Harissowitz or Brill book for the hard-back edition haven't tried to emulate the editorial standards of the serious academic presses.However, despite complaints, this is a work that will amply repay study. I would still recommend the student to use a good teaching grammar - I like Haywood and Nahmad - before and as a guide to 'recommended' usage, especially as Haywood and Nahmad has reference to Arabic terminology (Wright could serve as a terminological reference for the more advanced Classical Arabic student, and indeed goes far beyond H&N; in covering terminology). Finally, thanks to Routledge for bringing this book out at a price that a student can (just about) afford.Karin Ryding'sA Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic, which I thought might be comparable, is a fairly normal reference grammar of MSA. I personally prefer Ron Buckley's grammar,Modern Literary Arabic, to Ryding. It compliments Modern Written Arabic, and would be better as a first reference."},{"Title":"Modern Written Arabic","review":"this is meant for upper-intermediate and advanced learners.Descriptive grammar with full transliteration of the sentences.exhaustive details.hundreds of example sentences.I suggest to buy this book together with 'a reference grammar of modern standard arabic' by karin ryding to get the maximum."},{"Title":"Modern Written Arabic","review":"This is a very comprehensive reference grammar of the written Arabic language. I applaud the authors' industry and erudition. At the same time, I have to say that it is not very reader-friendly. The language is consistently technical, and the index does not make it easy to find the information required. I understand that the book is aimed at advanced students, but the same information is provided, much more accessibly, in Karin C. Ryding's \\"A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic,\\" and Ron Buckley's \\"Modern Literary Arabic - A Reference Grammar.\\" Thoroughness does not necessarily preclude readibility."},{"Title":"Modern Written Arabic","review":"While learning arabic you find sentences which you have a hard time to fully understand. You find each word in Hans Wehr or al-Mawrid, but the words context is new for you and your grammar books don't help you much in grasping the meaning of the sentence. That's when you pick up this helpful tool which often have alot of examples that makes the grammar more clearer and understandable for you, thus the true meaning of that tricky sentence is now fully translatable, meaningwise and grammatically.Ofcourse, it have some flaws, spelling errors, etc., but it is a very helpful tool, like no other source or reference tool."},{"Title":"Modern Written Arabic","review":"A very thorough and comprehensive grammar of MODERN Arabic. An elaborated table of contents is lacking. The index is almost useless. Authors have decided on certain linguistic terminology but failed to include references to common terminology in the index. If you look up the index for \\"Construct State\\" or \\"Status Constructus\\" you find nothing since the linguistic term used is \\"Annexation\\". This term is excellent (actually much more precise than \\"Construct State\\") but how is the reader supposed to locate it unless he reads the book cover to cover?MANY typos in Arabic script. Even in verb paradigms.Nevertheless, if you are searching for syntactical phenomena in MWA and you don't have a copy of Cantarino, or if you are looking for information about current trends in MWA , better have a copy of this book on your shelf."},{"Title":"Reflections of Nature: Paintings by Joseph Raffael","review":"REFLECTIONS OF NATURE: Paintings of Joseph Raffael is one of the most elegant monographs on a practicing artist I have had the pleasure of reading. Yes, &quot;reading&quot; is an operative word here. Too often artist monographs are coffee table picture books, lush and lovely to look at, enlightening as to a chronologial path of achievement, and even historically relevant - solely on the basis of the images: the written essays are seldom read and if they are read, they are merely perused. Such is not the case with this warmly informative and evocative collection of the works of this fine realist painter. Authors Amei Wallach and Donald Kuspit write with courage about techniques (use of the photograph as the springboard, method of appropriation form the photo image to the paper or canvas, etc) that would frighten most of our painters today, so revealing of secrets and methods publically scorned as &quot;copying&quot; or NOT &quot;representational&quot;. But the real coups in this valuable volume is having the artist talk us through not only his techniques, but is personal history and vulnerabilites.As for the paintings, there are splendid reproductions of those paintings we all know and love (koi, water, water lilies, flowers) but there are also many examples of Raffael's wildlife images, spiritual images, and those of his wife Lannis seeming to metamorphose out of her garden. This book is a fine standard for future art books that stirve to inform as well as document an artist's work. Even if you don't know Raffael's paintings, I would recommend your adding this volume ot your library - for you eye's AND your soul's sake. Outstanding!"},{"Title":"Reflections of Nature: Paintings by Joseph Raffael","review":"Interesting background information on one of this country's foremost contemporary artists.

For over a year I was enthralled and captivated by the illustrations in this book and took the book with me everywhere, in case I had to wait for an appointment or have a cup of coffee at Starbucks.

Michener must be anticipating his own retirement in this book as he writes a compelling and interesting novel about a retirement facility in Florida. What to most might be a very boring subject, Michener once again enlivens his characters and makes them so interesting that the book is a real page-turner. In our contemporary society, the aged are packed away into retirement homes and forgotten. In Michener's view, the elderly live interesting lives, have meaning and purpose, and are thinking, feeling people. Particularly facinating is the attempt of four of the elderly men who attempt to build and fly an experimental aircraft!Michener invites the reader to ponder the intricate problem of medical science extending human life, and when life ceases to be meaningful. In 2003, the media was buzzing with the attempt by a husband to end the life of his brain damaged wife in a nursing home. Michener has stong opinions on this subject and appears to be a prophet in dealing with a topic that only recently came to the american public's attention.This is perhaps Michener's last great novel. I believe the reader will find it engaging and worthwhile. Although it is not as superb as &quot;Texas&quot;, &quot;Centennial&quot;, or &quot;The Source&quot;, Michener will not disappoint you in &quot;Recessional&quot;.Jim Koenig"},{"Title":"Recessional Pb","review":"While I have read a great number of his other books and enjoyed most of them thoroughly, this book touched me like no others. I have two grandmothers living in similar retirement communities to that in the story and this gave me some great insight and understanding to their lives in there. It felt like a true story based on their lives and those of their friends. I highly recogmend the book although it is certainly not like his other epics."},{"Title":"Recessional Pb","review":"If you enjoy Michener's style at all, you'll find this a good read too. It is true, as others have noticed, that the author may be getting old. Where before, when my first impulse was &quot;nobody talks that way&quot; I could remind myself that English is not my native language and America not my home, in this book many dialogs are clearly contrived. Nevertheless, the thing that matters is how much Michener managed to put into them, and believe me, he still does.A point noone else commented on: The whole book, from beginning to end, is a royal slagging off of the one profession I despise most. So if you happen to be a lawyer, it may be you will not enjoy the book as much as I did - but especially then I recommend you to read it and try to take it to heart."},{"Title":"Recessional Pb","review":"\\"Recessional\\" was my introduction into James Michener's writing. This novel is the work of a fine craftsman. Upon reading, you feel that there are no wasted characters or scenes; all are important and work towards making a beautiful canvas for you to enjoy.In this story a young doctor, Dr. Andy Zorn, is driven from his practice in Chicago by a frivolous lawsuit against him and by his divorce. Mr. Taggert, the owner of a chain of retirement communities, hires Dr. Zorn to manage of his properties, The Palms in Tampa, which is not making a profit. It is at this location that Zorn must rebuild the community and his life.Of the characters Zorn meets, you feel that you have met them before, but never took the time to know them. For instance, there is Mr. Bixby who seems like just another retiree. One day, someone notices that he is \\"the\\" Buzz Bixby of World Series fame many years ago. All the characters, and for the matter all retirees, have had a wealth of experiences which get overlooked when we do not try to understand.Michener also discusses many issues (as an aside, this was written in the early nineties) such as Alzheimer's, AIDS, euthanasia, and living wills. There are other topics, but these seem to be the most poignant. Throughout these issues, you will never feel that Michener is preaching to you, but you will know how he feels.I would recommend this book. It is an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Recessional Pb","review":"I really love this book - but it's not really anything like other things the author has written. It's just a good story about a topic that many of us are uncomfortable with - growing old. Give this book a try. You may be surpised.

It's my understanding that Michener himself actually lived at the retirement center he based the book on and that many of the characters were based very closely on residents there. My teacher describes it as more of an ethnography than a novel, which made it that much more interesting to me."},{"Title":"Recessional Pb","review":"&quot;Recessional&quot; was alot like the salad bar served nightly at &quot;The Palms&quot; - lots of choices with very little quality. I got the distinct impression that the story line of this shallow novel was only a vehicle for Michener's pontifications on subjects as diverse as Aids, Race Relations and Aging. There was very little character development, so it was difficult to care about any one in particular. But the biggest problem I had was the inattention to detail; detail which has made earlier Michener novels so captivating and entertaining. There are few Michener books I haven't read, so it it hard for me to suggest, but perhaps it is time for Mr. Michener to pack up his typewriter and enjoy the company of his peers in a &quot;Palms&quot;"},{"Title":"Recessional Pb","review":"If you live in a retirement home, this book is for you...you'll recognize all your neighbors & yourself...

A great bargain!"},{"Title":"Recessional Pb","review":"This book deals with many aspects of the kind of life that faces the older generation. Mr. Michener has written not only a wonderful story with sometimes ordinary, sometimes eccentric characters, but has touched upon some of the problems that are endured because of age. It decries the use of the term \\"nursing home\\" for any and all retirement communities. It denounces the attitude that because a person having reached a certain age and/or with some physical disabilities, must also be mentally deficient and unable to make intelligent decisions. It tells of the love and devotion of a man whose wife is suffering with the final stages of Alzheimers disease. It touches on the questions of living wills and on pro-life groups that use unscrupulous methods for interfering with legally written and expressed wishes of those facing the final stages of life. It also tells of the loving care and deep concern that the staff of the retirement community in which the story unfolds feels and expresses toward all the residents. This book, although written in the early nineteen nineties, is in my opinion, one that should be read by everyone, whether in the age bracket known as the older generation, or has a parent or relative of advanced age, or simply comes in daily contact with those who don't think of themselves as being old and should not be considered just old folks. Alma Winter, Author-ONCE UPON A TIME TALES."},{"Title":"Recessional Pb","review":"While not one of Mr. Michener's epics I found Recessional to be highly inspiring but at the same time tragic dealing with the problems of growing old and looking at the problems of dying or for that matter not dying. While it probably won't change any minds about euthanasia it did make me convinced that I need to insure my family knows and respects my own wishes should I become completely incapacitated or terminally ill."},{"Title":"Recessional Pb","review":"I have read almost all of Mitchner's books and I have enjoyed all of them until this one. It is bland, overly predictable. It also seems like whoever wrote it (I would be willing to bet that some ghostwriter did or maybe James Mitchner JUNIOR to collect just one last big royalty before the old guy died) Which would be very ironic since the book spends lot of time on GREEDY children. The book is just one long SOAPBOX for someone to attack 1) greedy lawyers causing doctors to fear doing their jobs because of bogus lawsuits 2) greedy dentists in Florida who rip off old patients 3) poor blacks who no matter how hard they try will never get a fair chance; 4) lack of free healthcare for AIDS patients and 5) evil religious people who believe in the right to life..................... Gets old really fast."},{"Title":"Recessional Pb","review":"As the novel opens it is December 31st and a young doctor, Andy Zorn, is on his way to a meeting, a job interview. A raging snow storm is making his trip more like an artic wilderness trek than a usually pleasant stroll along Michigan Avenue in Chicago. Dr. Zorn is anxious to get the job, to leave behind his former life and career, to move on to anywhere or anything other than Chicago. Zorn gets the job, that of director, but not medical director, of a retirement community in Tampa, Florida. Within hours the doctor is on the road south.The various stories of the residents of the retirement home, The Palms, comprise the remainder of the novel. We learn about the various residents of The Palms, how they came to live there, and what transpires for them there during the next year.This is reminiscient in some ways to classic Michener style in that it has a huge cast of characters that the reader follows over an extended period. Stories that start out isolated eventually become entwined with others often after being seemingly forgotten. In other ways though this is a departure from Michener's usual style, instead of being transported to an exotic locale we are taken to Florida. Instead of the vast timeline Michener is noted for, spanning many decades and generations, RECESSIONAL takes place in the course of one calendar year.This is darker overall than much of Michener works, although it is not without the usual Michener theme of the triumph of the human spirit despite adverse circumstances. Also Michener's various agendas are more prevalent in this one than is his usual style. Still, fans of Michener will enjoy this one even though it is not quite the sweeping epic that he is known for."},{"Title":"Recessional Pb","review":"i liked this book very much, but if you are a regular fan of Michener, you may be dissapointed.

Definitely one for the recycle bin."},{"Title":"Recessional Pb","review":"The Kirkus review says it all. I wonder if Michener did more than preside over this book rather than write it himself.

The Scoutmaster is expected to deliver a brief story with a moral point. Most Scoutmasters are good at this, but after a few years they may run out of original material. Ron Wendel's book was written to save the day.This book contains more than 120 pages of brief stories, quotes and min-history lessons. The stories are organized into chapters my grouping important values from the Scout Oath and Scout Law. There are chapters for Character (Trustworthiness and Loyalty), Mind (Obedience and Cheerfulness), Body (Thriftiness and Cleanliness), Spirit (Bravery and Reverence), and a catch-the-rest chapter Other (Helpfulness, Friendliness, Courteousness and Kindness).

This one is as good as all the others. Somehow she makes all her books feel \\"new\\" even though they have the same theme. They never get boring or tedious. Being a European myself, I like the way a lot of her plots revolve around European cities and countries. She aparently knows a lot about the places she write, and also a lot about antiquites and history. I am looking forward to her writing about Sweden some day.

Of course, the murder mystery portion is also interesting...breathtakingly interesting.If you have never travelled to Budapest or if you have or if you want to, this book is for you. if you want an \\"edge of your seat\\" exciting experience, read the book.

In fact Clive Swain carries most of the business load because Lara is depressed because she broke up with her long time lover. In downtown Toronto Lara meets an old schoolmate who is on her way to meet some other college friends. Lara joins them because she shared an apartment with them and was one of the Dovercourt Divas as they were called.The six divas attend an exhibit at the Cottingham Museum hosted by new curator, Lara?s former lover Karoly Ndmar. He displays the Magyar Venus that he acquired for the museum. Some of the divas think he committed fraud so Lara goes to Hungary to trace the history of the three inch ivory statue. While there the man who sold the Venus to Karoly dies. The police believe he slipped but Lara thinks someone killed him; she also believes that one of the Divas didn?t commit suicide but was chased and fell off the bridge trying to get away from someone she knew. Determined to find out the truth, Lara goes to London where she finds the evidence she needs to confront the perpetrator and almost loses her life in the process.Lyn Hamilton?s archeological mysteries always make the reader want to travel to the setting of her latest book and THE MAGYAR VENUS is no exception. She makes Hungary come alive in the mind?s eye with her descriptions of the country and its people. The heroine is a fascinating and complex person who has the courage to do what is right even if it means putting herself in danger. The armchair travel crowd and fans of excellent amateur sleuth novels will want to read this book in one sitting.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Magyar Venus (Archaeological Mysteries, No. 8)","review":"I thoroughly enjoy the Archaeological Mystery Series.

How could I resist reading \\"The Thai Amulet\\"? Once I came back home, I bought all of her other books, and was sad to discover that she has decided to stop writing mysteries.Lyn Hamilton, in the tradition of writers like Ellis Peters and Peter Tremayne, is a bright and articulate author who wants to teach you about things she finds interesting by writing mysteries. This particular book tells you all about the prehistoric \\"venus\\" (perhaps fertility-related) figures that were found in Europe. As with all of her books, you would not disappointed if you researched her factual background -- she doesn't toy with history. What she does toy with is the life of her main character, and this produces a fun read.If you enjoy being fed some interesting history along with a nice murder mystery, this is your book (as are her others)."},{"Title":"The Magyar Venus (Archaeological Mysteries, No. 8)","review":"Even if you only read the cover, the author still deceived you. The Magyars conquered Hungary about 800 AD and the venus goes back a few thousand years.I also noted every one of Hamilton's Hungarians was either shady, greedy, or both. Worst of all, her plot was filled with unlikely coincidences.I grew up in a Hungarian family and so I regret the author didn't take advantage of Hungarian culture. For example, Hungarian is the world's most pretty language but the author hardly mentioned it. The author also could have written more about Hungarian cuisine.Hungarian cold cuts and sausage have a very unusual flavor that is unlike anything else in the world. Outside Hungary very few people know the taste sensation of a good Hurka."},{"Title":"The art of Persian cooking","review":"A simple, easy, and real way to cook Persian food is laid out in this book.

My life was deeply impacted by Faisal Malick's work The Destiny of Islam in the Endtime.- Rich MarshallAuthor, God@Work (Vol.1 & 2)"},{"Title":"Here Comes Ishmael: The Kairos Moment for the Muslim People","review":"This book comes as a breath of fresh air compared to the typical material spewed out by the church calumniating Ishmael's Moslem descendants. Malik takes every famous trait of Islam and finds in it hidden good with great promise for the future of Christianity.The book is easy to read (finished in about an hour) and very inspiring. Not like the venomous invective of people like Hagee, Shoebat, and Gabriel.Here's what I wrote to the author:Dear Faisal,Some friends lent my your book. I found it very well written and inspiring! I am an Israeli Jewish convert to Christianity. I would be happy to send you my testimonial if you wish.My views about Moslems have undergone huge changes since my conversion in 2000. I very much like your approach to finding the hidden good in Moslems rather than demonizing and vilifying them, as do Walid Shoebat, Brigitte Gabriel, and John Hagee. I think these latter three people, by focusing on the evil and speaking evil over Moslems, actually bring curse upon our society, for Jesus told us that we will be judged in the manner we judge others.I have some more specific ideas to share with you if possible.First of all, I wonder what you think of my fused name of the Godhead: YaHuWAllaH, which is a fusion of YHWH and Allah, and similar to the name YHWH-Elohim found in the bible?Second, you might find of interest the following three Jewish midrashim about Ishmael. (1) According to the Midrash, Abraham visited Ishmael a number of times in the wilderness to encourage him. Abraham never stopped loving him, even if Sarah hated him. (2) Ishmael died as a righteous man (Tzaddiq), as evidenced by his burying Abraham together with his brother Isaac, showing they had reconciled. (3) A fascinating Midrash about Ishmael and Esau says that when Esau married Ishmael's daughter Basmat, his intentions were evil: to slander Jacob to Ishmael (Esau's new father in law) to reopen the wounds of how Ishmael had been excommunicated from Abraham's family, and to incite Ishmael to kill Jacob in revenge. Esau hoped to provoke Ishmael's jealousy for his daughter Basmat, who now would live without the blessings that Isaac had given to Jacob. The rabbis say that God arranged for Ishmael to die after he agreed to the marriage of Basmat and Esau, but before the marriage took place, thus sparing Ishmael from being drawn into Esau's evil plot!Third, my opinion after living as an Orthodox Jew for 18 years, is that Judaism and Islam are flip sides of the same anti-Christ coin. Both religions are extremely legalistic and ritualistic with many similar laws. I also believe that Mohammed emerged as a measure for measure consequence of the Jews rejecting Jesus in favor of a conquering Davidic king. I think Mohammed functions exactly in this role. Note that Mohammed was a warrior, general, poet, judge, king, prophet, exactly like David! I think one can argue that Mohammed's legacy was much greater than that of David and Solomon, who ruled over a divided and weakened kingdom. Mohammed also drove idolatry out of Arabia while under Solomon idolatry returned to Israel. Finally I think it is clear that Mohammed's harem was much smaller than that of Solomon and even David, of whom the Talmud writes that he fathered 400 children from women captured in war. And concerning Ayisha, the child bride, the Talmud reports that Bathsheba may have been as young as seven when David seduced her and only nine when she gave birth to Solomon.God Bless You for your hopeful vision for the Seed of Ishmael!MevashirPS I very much liked your point about Ishmael being only one of four people in the Tenach named by God before their births. Ishmael also was traditionally a very popular rabbinic name in the Talmudic era."},{"Title":"Robert Browning, (English men of letters)","review":"I really loved this book.

It is designed for one who knows at least a little about aromatherapy, and plans to be working with the oils. Warning: the drawings on some of the pages may be offensive to some, depicting a witch with an herb popularly used by witches at one time, and people not fully dressed on others. I value the book for it's wealth of information, and ignore some of the illustrations.Two pages are devoted to each of the essential oils, which are in alphabetical order. Near the title of each oil there is a chart listing the plant/part (plant as in \\"tree\\", and part as in \\"leaves\\" or \\"fruit\\"), Latin name, family, note (top, middle or base), planet, and means of extraction. There are several categories that describe each oil. Aroma describes the kind of fragrance; \\"features\\" tell about physical characteristics of the plant, and where it is grown, and such. A section called \\"History and Myth\\" tells about how the oil was used historically, and any myths associated with it. The chemical constituents, oil properties, and any precautions are listed. Three sections are devoted to telling how each oil may effect the mind (as in being a sedative), body (as in helping to regulate women's cycles), and skin (as in reactions to say, oily or sensitive skin). The last heading on each page is \\"blends\\" which lists other essential oils which blend well with the one under discussion.There are several helpful resources in the back of the book. A glossary gives a short definition of oil properties, and lists the oils with each property. A blending chart is included, categorizing the oils by what they are (trees, flowers, spices, etc.) and telling what commonly works well together. Another chart lists the oils under which skin types for which they would be most helpful."},{"Title":"Directory of Essential Oils","review":"This book is definately a must for anyone studying or wants to know more about essential oils.

Reader's Digest did it, and so we have here four complete and original novellas by Leslie Charteris, G.K. Chesterton, Michael Gilbert and the always awesome Dorothy L. Sayers. They vary in quality, so if you're just browsing here's a quick breakdown:1.) The Beauty Specialist- Leslie Charteris This is one of over 150 stories Charteris wrote about The Saint, and I was very excited to read it. Unfortunately, while the characters are interesting and the plot decent Charteris' writing style is really, really bad. If you're not a stickler for grammar or a fan of Strunk & White's \\"The Elements of Style\\" you might not notice, but everyone else is likely to be driven crazy by Charteris' muddled sentences and excessive use of adverbs. The guy needed an editor but bad. GRADE: C/B-2.) The Oracle of the Dog- G.K. ChestertonChesterton's a far better writer, and it shows here in one of his classic Father Brown stories. Unlike a lot of mystery fans I don't think the plot of \\"Oracle\\" is anything spectacular, but it's tight and holds your interest. GRADE: B/B-3.) The Cleaners- Michael GilbertAn Inspector Petrella mystery. I liked this one all the way up until the ending, which I felt negated everything that came before. Read it and see what I mean. What was the point? GRADE: B-/C+4.) The Incredible Elopement of Lord Peter Whimsey- Dorothy L. SayersYay! Always a pleasure to read a Lord Peter mystery, isn't it? They're just so classy and fun. This has exotic locations, a great villain, a damsel in distress (beautiful, of course), and Lord Peter playing with peoples minds. What more could you want?GRADE: B+/A-So there you have it, and hopefully you have enough info to decide if you want to buy the collection. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Great British Detectives (Academy Mystery Novellas)","review":"I had read one of the stories already-The Oracle of the Dog- which was fine, but you can find that in an anthology of Chesterton's Father Brown.

Actually this is an unperformable play which at the same time has a low budget Indy Film quality to it. The premise of this play is that the entire book of Revelation is happening in a bar as a band is playing. I would recommend having at least some background on the book of Revelation before reading this play (that is if you want to understand all of the author's references and his humor).In spite of accomodating much of the imagery from the book of Revelation, the author still manages to insert some of his larger motifs which seem to find their way into most of his writings. His angst toward Julia Roberts is certainly present in this work, and I would argue that there are anti-French sentiments as well. If you read this play make sure to take note of the \\"144,000,\\" then I think you'll see what I'm talking about.I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in reading something that is decidedly not Tom Clancy or for anyone who has read one too many \\"Left Behind\\" books.This book also caused me to pose the all too important question:\\"When are the Obese Firemen going to tour?\\""},{"Title":"This was Rehoboth Beach: Flotsam, jetsam and trivia","review":"This Was Rehoboth Beach: Flotsam, Jetsam and triviaThe Booklet was received in excellent condition in 2 days!"},{"Title":"Zarathustra's sister: The case of Elisabeth and Friedrich Nietzsche","review":"H.F. Peters also wrote books such asMy Sister, My Spouse: A Biography of Lou Andreas-Salome (The Norton Library, N748)andRainer Maria Rilke: Masks and the Man. He wrote in the Introduction to this 1977 book, \\"The reason why it has not been possible before now to show the interrelationship between Nietzsche and his sister is that as long as Elisabeth was alive nobody had access to her private papers, and even after her death they were kept under lock and key in the Nietzsche Archives... [such research] could only be made after the defeat of the Third Reich, and even then it took years before the rulers of the German Democratic Republic who inherited the Nietzsche Archives were willing to open that section that deals with Elisabeth. She had been an ardent Nazi... In December 1969 I was finally given permission to view them, to take extensive notes, and to order photostatic copies of entire documents.\\" (Pg. x-xi)Peters notes that Elisabeth \\"wrote [Nietzsche] that she was getting thoroughly familar with his Leipzig past, a remark that must have made him wince, for there were aspects of his past that nobody knew---furtive nightly visits to prostitutes, anxious moments in doctors' consulting rooms. It was just as well that his faithful Llama would never know this part of his past.\\" (Pg. 26) He observes that Elisabeth's \\"wedding took place in Naumburg amid a small circle of relatives and friends. The only member of the Nietzsche family who was conspicuously absent was Elisabeth's beloved brother, [Nietzsche].\\" (Pg. 84)He records that as his reputation grew after his death, \\"the bleak financial future that Elisabeth faced ... had become a prosperous present. She was well on the way to becoming the recognized spokesman for an author who had risen overnight from obscurity to international fame and who, while still alive, lay entombed in a grave of madness. In the eyes of the world the sister of the mad philosopher became an object of reverence. Most reviewers read her book on her brother's life as a young man, in which she played an important part, in that light.\\" (Pg. 140)He adds that Dr. P.J. M&ouml;bius \\"listened to Elisabeth's explanations [for Nietzsche's illness], but after a careful study of Nietzsche's medical history, he dismissed them... [M&ouml;bius] hinted that it was caused by syphilis... M&ouml;bius warned his countrymen that they should beware of Nietzsche, for his works were the products of a diseased brain.\\" (Pg. 183-184)He recounts that two scholars \\"scrutinized Nietzsche's notebooks carefully and discovered numerous cases in which Elisabeth had used letters her brother had drafted for others but which she had published as though he had written them to her... when he confronted Nietzsche's sister with this evidence---she was almost ninety years old at the time---she became furious...\\" (Pg. 218)Of Hitler's ascension to power, Peters writes, \\"If Elisabeth had hedged her bets about the Nazi leader until then, she now embraced his fervently... He could provide the financial support she needed. And she was not mistaken. Hitler listened to her requests for help with a sympathetic ear, made private contributions, and ordered official grants to be given to the Nietzsche Archives. Elisabeth felt that at long last the German Napoleon, the 'superman' her brother had called for, had arisen and that she had met him.\\" (Pg. 220) When she was in the hospital, Hitler visited, and \\"wanted to assure her that he would provide the money for the construction of a Nietzsche memorial and library... Tears of joy ran down Elisabeth's cheeks... Her lifelong struggle to secure the future of her Archives had finally been won... her brother's work and her own were under the personal protection of the architect of the Thousand-Year Reich.\\" (Pg. 222)This is a very insightful book that will be of considerable interest to anyone wanting to more about the life of Nietzsche."},{"Title":"It's Time!","review":"This luciously illustrated book for the very young follows a variety of animals on a barnyard romp as they rush to celebrate the the arrival of the farm's newest additions--a litter of adorable puppies.

Rhyme should be a large part of the early childhood literacy curriculum as this important skill is a precursor to later reading success. IT'S TIME! offers young children the opportunity to participate in the story on the first reading by anticipating the rhyme. Through subsequent readings, the child will easily memorize this buoyant text, giving him or her the ability to \\"read\\" this joyful book independently. I have acquired thousands of books in my 24 years of teaching 3 to 6 year old children, and I know what appeals to these little people. IT'S TIME! is one of those books that is dragged off the shelf and onto a little lap time and again."},{"Title":"The Worldly Philosophers. The Lives, Times and Ideas of the Great Economic Thinkers.","review":"\\"Worldly Philosophers\\" is probably the best, most authoritative title on the development and growth of economic theory. \\"Worldly Philosophers\\" is an outgrowth of Heilbroner's 1953 doctoral thesis and with each edition he's further refined and polished it and in the process it has gone on to sell four million copies, making it the second best selling book on the subject of economics. Heilbroner gives a great overview of the economic process in early societies up until the time of Adam Smith and his revolutionary \\"The Wealth of Nations.\\" Heilbroner carries the reader onwards as successive economists attempt to make sense of the world around them, introducing the reader to the theories of Ricardo, Malthus, Marx, Veblen, and Keynes, among others. Heilbroner charts the expansion of economic theory in a straightforward linear fashion and shows how these varied economists questioned the theories of those before and postulated their own theories based on how they saw the world.I hadn't expected \\"Worldly Philosophers\\" to be such a lively and enjoyable read, which says a lot about Heilbroner's clarity and caliber of writing. It is far more enjoyable than his later \\"Making of Economic Society,\\" which borrows liberally from this tome.

GrayWriter's Club PressISBN: 0-59519-250-5August 2003Romantic SuspenseLouisville, Kentucky - present dayHomicide detective Ross Burke can't imagine his life getting any worse than it is right now. After fourteen years of devoting his life to his job, all he has to show for it is a bitter wife suing him for divorce and a guilty conscience for being unable to prevent his partner's death. But when his partner's widow, Tasha Ryan, announces that she would like Ross to stop coming around her and her kids, it is like a kick to his gut. For reasons that he would rather not admit to either Tasha or himself, he is crushed by her request. And if that is not enough, Ross is completely shaken when a dead woman turns up with his name carved on her chest.Ross quickly learns he is dealing with a serial killer when other women are killed in a like manner as the first victim. Details at the crime scenes are eerily similar, most notably of which is his named carved on each woman's chest. With only weeks to go until hectic festivities descend upon Louisville due to the Kentucky Derby, Ross is under tremendous pressure by the city to catch The Carver, as the killer has been dubbed. He is pushing himself to the breaking point, working round the clock to find the connection between the victims. All he knows for sure is they were all single, had blonde hair, and were somehow linked to him. And it chills him to his soul to acknowledge that Tasha Ryan has all three of these things in common with those women. Now his desperation to be a part of her life is not only personal, it is a matter of life and death.Whenever Ross Burke is near, Tasha Ryan is reminded of her dead husband. And as long as Ross feels responsible for her and her children, she will never be free to move on with her life, which she desperately needs to do. Ross has no idea that her marriage to his best friend was not exactly the perfect union he thought it to be. The memories Ross evokes by his visits are mostly painful rather than sad or wistful, and Tasha admits that she is also frightened by her attraction to Ross. It would be so easy just to let him take control of her life, like her husband once did. That is something that she will not allow to happen again. But when she finds herself in the middle of the very dangerous hunt to catch The Carver, she realizes that she may have finally pushed away the only man who can save her.Gritty and intense are just two of the adjectives that best describe OBJECT OF HIS AFFECTION. Readers will be hard pressed to put the book down once they become involved in the grisly investigation to catch the serial killer known as The Carver. Suspense abounds as the reader follows Ross as he tracks down leads and uncovers evidence. Early on, readers will feel sure of the identity of the killer, only to find that Ms. Gray expertly throws in twists that leave everyone with doubts, including Ross, Tasha, and the reader.OBJECT OF HIS AFFECTION is Ross Burke's story as well. The hard-bitten, cynical, homicide detective is obviously capable, tough, and stressed out, yet strangely enough, he is vulnerable as well. He needs Tasha, or rather he needs her to need him. Seldom have I come across such a tortured, complex leading man, but I was thoroughly intrigued by him. Tasha, too, is dealing with her fair share of anguish. This is due not only to the murder investigation that she finds herself unwittingly involved in, but also from emotional baggage left over from her marriage. She does not want to depend on Ross for anything, and she most definitely does not want to feel anything for him. Their relationship is complicated, and it is questionable if their difficulties with each other will ever be resolved. But as sad as it may be to think that these two likable characters may not work things out, it makes for a very poignant ending.OBJECT OF HIS AFFECTION is for those who enjoy a potent crime story with elements of romance mixed in. It is also for readers who are not faint of heart. The language is often coarse and the content disturbing, especially during the climactic scene with the killer, which is quite unsettling. But these factors serve to make the characters very realistic and heighten the tension of the plot. It is very easy to believe that homicide detectives curse when conversing with each other and that they deal with very horrific situations on a daily basis that the average citizen is happily ignorant of. And while the crimes that Ms. Gray describes are gruesome, they help the reader feel Ross's urgency to catch the killer.This just the second time I have read T.L. Gray, but I am quickly becoming a fan. OBJECT OF HIS AFFECTION is complex, yet fast paced and gripping, and I highly recommend it.Sandra BrillReviewer for Romance Reviews Todayromrevtoday.com"},{"Title":"Object of His Affection","review":"Just finished this awesome book.

Since it is mainly roses, you get more varieties, which I find a tremendous bonus, since most cakes only display your basic white, red or pink rose. The book is separated into luxurious flower arrangements (that highlight a certain variety of rose) and the following pages tell you in detail how to create that rose, the other plants in the arrangement, and to assemble. All of the pages, including the ones of directions, are in lush full color photographs, and laid out as beautifully as the incomparable flower arrangements. Worth EVERY penny."},{"Title":"Sugar Roses for Cakes","review":"This volume deals with just about every rose ever grown as well as other flowers to accompany them in arrangements and on cakes.

For instance, one rose has 6 caylix pieces instead of the usual 5 and they go to the lengths to cut one extra and attach it! If this were a cook book, it would be \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" by Julia Child, volume one.

There are a variety of roses arranged creatively on elegant, simple cakes which serve as props for showcasing the flowers. The focus here are not the cakes, therefore it is assumed that you have already prepared your cake to your liking. The authors strive to teach the art of making a perfect rose. Being an absolute beginner at sugar paste, I can tell you I am not ready for this book yet since I lack the basic sugarcrafting knowledge.

I like the realism in their designs. I give this a four mainly because I wish there were a few more explanations in the making of the flowers. There are lots of beautiful pictures of the completed designs. There are some photos of the in-process project. The photo of the in-process are kind of the same through-out the book though. The individual parts of each project that are different are not specifically photographed and included in the photos. I am not an expert at gumpaste making or design, but I am not new to it either. Sometimes its a bit hard to understand. Thats why I think the other photos would help. All in all a beautiful design book. I have page-marked some designs and just plan on making them however I can lol."},{"Title":"Sugar Roses for Cakes","review":"I had this book on my wish list for a long time and, finally, I got it. I am not disappointed, but I am a little bit intimidated. There is no way I my roses will ever compare to this perfection, but that is my fault, not the books.It has excellent step-by-step instructions (even though, on occasion, the text and the photo are a bit different like when they tell you to make a pale pink cone and show a yellow one). You see each step in side-by-side progression, which is helpful because you know what your flower is supposed to look like at each stage instead of wondering where you went wrong at the end.The authors are so far above the usual cake decorator that they even give instructions on how to make your own leaf veiners so that the leaf is exactly the one that goes with the flower (using materials I've never heard of and may not be called the same thing in the US). A lot of the products listed are not available here (at least by that name)so we have to try to find something similar.They are very consciencious, perhaps compulsively so. When they make a rose, it is not a generic pink rose, it is a dead-ringer for a particular variety of pink rose, the Mme. Cecile Brunner rose. I am not that picky,as long as it generally looks like a pretty pink rose. After all, neither I nor my clients are botanists (and I will make it a point to never make a rose for someone who is).Every detail is realistic. Their shading is impeccable, I have struggled to find dusts that achieve both the color depth and translucency required for a certain realism. They not only have the materials, but an absolute sense of how to use them. The way the sprays are assembled, the way the petals are placed, the way the leaves and stems are arranged--flawless. I sit and stare at the detail and I just can't believe that these aren't flower show quality specimens.So, having established that, while I take pride in my work, I am not an absolute perfectionist, it is still nice to see what perfection looks like so I can strive to improve. While I probably will never follow any of the projects to the letter, and can't help feeling inferior and overwhelmed by the sheer mastery of their skill, I think it is a worthwhile investment in both time and expenditure to get this book and I'm glad I, finally, did."},{"Title":"Sugar Roses for Cakes","review":"I scanned through the book, and I am looking forwad to making some of the beautif flowers, Thank you for sharing. This is what I needed to complete my project. I foresee myself in the future to order from you again."},{"Title":"Sugar Roses for Cakes","review":"More user friendly than Alan Dunn's flowers book.

It includes instructions for several nice filler flowers, flower parts and leaves. The finished cakes are elegantly decorated, well photographed and inspiring. The book is directed to more advanced sugar artists, and definitely raises the bar. I consider this book to be a valuable tool and have used it often in the short time I've had it."},{"Title":"The ministry of fear: An entertainment","review":"British author Graham Greene divided his early novels into two distinct groups: \`serious' novels, like \\"The End of the Affair,\\" \\"Brighton Rock,\\" and \\"The Power and the Glory\\"; and \`entertainments,' his term for his espionage and suspense thrillers. This second group includes \\"A Gun for Sale\\" (U.S. title: \\"This Gun for Hire\\"), \\"Stamboul Train,\\" \\"The Confidential Agent\\"...and \\"The Ministry of Fear.\\" Looking back on Greene's long career, this distinction seems very artificial and almost silly; it perhaps made market sense back then, but Greene's entertainments are every bit as serious-minded as his non-genre work. These books are in no way lightweight time-wasters. They are as concerned with character, drama, and the human condition as any of his other books. In fact, I honestly prefer his entertainments; through the mode of the thriller, they actually stab deeper into the reader's mind.\\"The Ministry of Fear,\\" published in 1943 when World War II was raging in London's skies, is perhaps Greene's finest entertainment and my personal favorite of his novels. Greene produces here a quintessential noir novel using a premise we often associate with Alfred Hitchcock's films: an innocent man accidentally stumbles upon a secret that turns him into a man marked for death and hunted by the law. However, Greene's main character, Arthur Rowe, is hardly innocent. He is a solitary, lonely individual who harbors a deep guilt over a crime he committed in the past. When he speaks the wrong phrase to a fortune-teller at a fair, he suddenly finds himself the target of a shadowy group of spies in London -- the Ministry of the title. Soon he's fleeing through blitz London, framed for murder, desperate and near-suicidal, but harboring an anger toward the people who have tried to kill him.Suddenly, Greene pulls a massive plot switch on the reader. The novel makes an abrupt shift that alters the whole nature of the plot. Rowe's story becomes that of possible redemption and the washing away of past sins..but at the expense of feeling whole and complete. To say much more would ruin the surprises of the novel and the internal odyssey of the main character. It's one of the most fascinating moral and character-driven thrillers ever written. And the backdrop of war-torn London, facing daily rains of bombs, is astonishing. It's almost a fantasy world, albeit a horrific one.Greene's language can sometimes feel too exact and literary for some readers' tastes -- he certainly writes nothing like today's typical churner of bestsellers -- and his peculiar 1940s British terms may cause some head-scratching for American readers. However, Greene had a magical way of expressing ideas that anyone can relate to. He writes in flashes of truth that can make the reader shiver with realization. Only the greatest authors can do this, and Greene does it over and over again in \\"The Ministry of Fear.\\"If you've only read Greene's non-genre novels, I urge you to delve into \\"The Ministry of Fear.\\" It will make you wonder why Greene even bothered to divide up his books. For any lover of thrillers, espionage stories, or World War II, this book will fill all your needs and give you much more in the bargain."},{"Title":"The ministry of fear: An entertainment","review":"to one another. To live is to remember and to remember is to live. To die is to forget and to forget is to die.\\" Samuel ButlerI'm a bit embarrassed to admit that it has taken me close to three score years to pick up and read a book by Graham Greene. On the other hand, I now have quite a few books I can now add to my to be read pile.I purchased this book after reading Alan Furst's Introduction. I very much like Furst's work (SeeDark Voyage: A Novel) and, after reading that Furst was influenced by Eric Ambler I worked my way thought Ambler's works with a great deal of pleasure (SeeA Coffin for Dimitrios). In the Introduction to Ministry of Fear, Furst mentions that Greene was another key influence. So I was sold, and, more importantly, I was not disappointed.As in Ambler and Furst's books The Ministry of Fear gives us an ordinary man thrust into an extraordinary situation. Arthur Rowe is an ordinary man, albeit one with a troubled past. He is described by Greene as a tall stooping lean man with a narrow face and whose clothes were good \\"but gave the impression of being uncared for; you would have said a bachelor if it had not been for an indefinable married look.\\" Set in the early days of WWII, the blitz has just begun and Rowe finds himself in a charity fete. Rowe finds himself paying a few pence to have his fortune told and through a strange quirk of fate utters a phrase that puts him right in the middle of an espionage ring.The story takes off from there. The cast of characters introduced by Greene should be familiar to anyone who has read Ambler, Buchan, or Furst: the stolid police detectives, the sinister and inscrutable foreign spies and assorted hangers on; and the lovely lady who may be friend or foe. But what Green does here that I find so intriguing is to turn a rather generic story line into a brilliant examination of something entirely different: how memory and forgetfulness either free us or enslave us.The heart of the book for me was not the story line itself. [Note: possible spoiler follows.] About half way through the book we find that Arthur Rowe had been hurt during the blitz and was suffering from amnesia. As the story continues we see not only the plot develop but witness the transformation of Arthur Rowe. As noted earlier, he had been haunted by an earlier tragedy and, to my mind; this tragedy had totally enslaved Rowe. He was a prisoner of his own guilt and his thoughts and actions were constricted by that guilt. Now that the balance between memory and forgetfulness had shifted so to had Rowe's thoughts and actions. Given a new name he truly became a new person and as his memory starts to return Greene presents us with Rowe force to make a conscious decision as to whether his memory will continue to enslave him. Rowe's decision and the actions that follow take us through the book's satisfying conclusion.\\"I have done that\\", says my memory. \\"I cannot have done that\\" -- says my pride, and remains adamant. At last -- memory yields.\\" So said Friedrich Nietzsche and Graham Greene has taken that theme and run with it with great skill and with great delight to the reader.Highly recommended. L. Fleisig"},{"Title":"The ministry of fear: An entertainment","review":"Arthur Lowe's (uh, Rowe's) struggle to quiet his life from the awful memory of his merciful killing of his dying wife because he cannot stand to see her suffer is really a low point(if you will) for this man, yet we still feel sorry for him and his battle. He finds great pity at seeing anyone or thing suffer, so much so that he is blind to the moral imperative that murder is wrong and is a crime. Lowe gets away with it in the story, but not in his mind. We see Arthur stepping &quot;joyfully back into adolescence&quot;, to &quot;mislay the events of twenty years&quot;, that cause him to behave in a childish manner - he will not give up the cake at the fete. The action propels him into a journey of espionage that would change his life. Instead of trying to struggle to forget his past we see him struggle to find his past and to discover who he is. In the process he finds love once again.The backdrop of the bombing of London and all the underground cubby holes he seeks to shelter himself from the life altering bombs of his mind are all great metaphors that tie this very good novel together. Rowe is not a hero but a highly flawed human who coincidentally disrupts a spy plot at the moment of his catharsis. His purity of compassion and pity for suffering beings is his downfall because he crosses the line into unethical conduct to sooth himself - a selfish indulgence that results in him playing God, and then almost makes the same error again.How many times do we excuse ourselves for our actions in the name of noble spirit? It is the precursor to Catch 22 (&quot;We had to destroy the village to save it&quot;, or &quot;I had to kill my wife to put her out of her misery&quot;).There is much to learn from this &quot;entertaintment&quot;."},{"Title":"The ministry of fear: An entertainment","review":"Set in England during WWII, The Ministry of Fear is the story of Arthur Rowe surviving but not truly living in the shadow of what was once his life. He finds himself hunted by shadowy forces of espionage and the memory of having mercifully murdered his sick wife. Somewhat convuluted at times and not Greene's best effort, but still brilliant and heart tugging. Greene's fire always burns brightest when he speaks to the heart and not of cloak and dagger stuff."},{"Title":"The ministry of fear: An entertainment","review":"A kind of dark \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" story of one person's experience in World War II London. Greene excels in placing an ordinary character in dramatic, historical circumstances to play out the choices that make up his life.In this book, it's Arthur Rowe. Rowe steps nostalgically into a church bazaar, visits a fortuneteller, follows a chance mis-identification by the fortuneteller into a winning guess at a cake's weight, and ends up a central figure in international espionage, with the right side and wrong side, guilt and innocence, and even Arthur's own identity all thrown up in the airIt's a good ride through a winding plot, with a twist I'm not used to from Greene -- an involvement of the reader in the novel as a puzzle, almost like more modern or postmodern stories such as the movie Memento.Greene calls this book one of his \\"entertainments\\". I thought it was certainly entertaining, as well as another of his explorations of character under personal and historical stress."},{"Title":"The ministry of fear: An entertainment","review":"It is a pleasure to turn to the novels of Graham Greene (1904-91) the famous twentieth century British novelist. In a new Penguin edition his 1943 noir \\"The Ministry of Fear\\" includes a fine introduction by Alan Furst a fine novelist of spy fiction in his own right.The novel is set in World War II London suffering from the ravages of nightly bombing during the blitz. The anti hero is Arthur Rowe a shell of a man tortured by the mercy killing of his ill wife. Rowe had been tried for murder but was aquitted.He stops in at a fair for charity where he buys a cake. The cake was meant for a spy. The cake contains classified film. The short book follows Rowe's adventures as he is suspected of murdering a man at a seance. This book reminds the reviewer of Alfred Hitchcock's classic tales of innocent men wanted for murder.who solve the case (such as in \\"North by Northwest\\")The novel has a good resolution with Rowe finding true love and the Nazi criminals being killed or captured. One section of the book is set in a creepy nursing home where Rowe is sent following the loss of his memory. Through dreams the reader is carried back to an Arcadian England prior to the Great War of 1914.What makes Greene's tales so good is his ability to write elegant English, turn phrases and keep the reader in suspense.The Ministry of Fear is a superb classic of espionage writing!"},{"Title":"The ministry of fear: An entertainment","review":"Graham Greene was a very talented and prolific twentieth century writer, perhaps best known for his novels The End of the Affair and the Third Man, both of which were made into successful films. Many of his books explore the struggle of modern man or woman to make moral choices in a complex and often corrupt world. He also liked to write thrillers, which he called \\"entertainments\\" to distinguish them from what he considered his more serious novels.Greene's thriller The Ministry of Fear certainly is entertaining. Greene pulls out all the stops in this story of Arthur Rowe, a middle aged, disillusioned man with a sordid past who stumbles into a real mystery when he wins a cake in a raffle at a seedy charity fair. From the moment he claims his cake made with \\"real eggs\\" (real eggs were a true delicacy during the London Blitz!), Rowe becomes a marked man. He is followed, threatened, attacked, betrayed, imprisoned, and nearly blown up. Through it all he tries to figure out what mysterious message is connected with the cake. Does it all point to a devious plot to threaten the allied cause and his beloved England?Because Greene is such a first class writer, he can't write a story that doesn't have some deeper subtext about good and evil, or create a hero who doesn't engage and interest us. We cannot help but care about what happens to Arthur Rowe. Greene keeps us guessing until the very end about whom Rowe should trust.When we remember that The Ministry of Fear was written during the war when no one knew which side would ultimately triumph, this novel of espionage and moral choices packs an even more potent punch. Espionage writers come and go, but you will have to look hard to find a writer more engaging, effective, and ,yes, entertaining than Graham Greene."},{"Title":"The ministry of fear: An entertainment","review":"I was waiting to catch a plane at PDX and saw a young guy sitting across from me reading this book. No this isn't a Craigslist \\"Missed Connection;\\" I just thought the book looked interesting so I made a note of it and bought it when I arrived home.This was a very well written, succinct thriller that was written and published during World War II. Graham Greene is generally known for writing literary fiction but also wrote what would today be called thrillers or bestsellers (which he referred to as \\"entertainments\\") and *Ministry Of Fear* is a prime example of Greene's entertainments. It was fun to read a thriller written by such an accomplished literary author, and the book conveys a thick sense of fear and paranoia that I imagine is quite a genuine depiction of life during wartime.But wait, there's more! An interesting film was made based on this book, starring Ray Milland, who was perfect in the lead role. The movie had quite a few different plot elements than the book, some of which were actually improvements - but the best thing is the entire movie is available for free on youtube - cool!"},{"Title":"The ministry of fear: An entertainment","review":"In his introduction to THE MINISTRY OF FEAR, Alan Furst declares that a hero on a classic path in a literary spy novel \\"...must confront, and overcome, his own private darkness to confront, and defeat, the dark side of the world.\\" IMHO, this formulation applies only partially to TMoF, since the ironic Graham Greene ultimately adds, not overcomes, personal difficulties and fears to the guilty regrets of Arthur Rowe, his protagonist. Still, Rowe does--SPOILER ALERT!--confront the dark side successfully. But in doing so, the ironist Greene shows Rowe making what are probably unsustainable choices.Through much of TMoF, Rowe, a bombing victim, suffers from partial amnesia. In his case, Rowe can remember his sunny and idealistic youth clearly but has blocked all memories of twenty years of adult experience, including life with his deceased wife. Without memory of his adult years, Rowe connects to his youthful sensibility, which makes him both an oddly effective adversary to a Nazi espionage ring and attractive to the younger Anna, who finds his youthful and adventurous spirit refreshing. Initially, Greene uses the term \\"ministry of fear\\" to refer to the Nazis, who create an atmosphere of fear and distrust \\"so that you can't depend on a soul.\\" But ultimately, the term applies to Rowe, who is regaining his memory at the novel's end and moving into a life where he has guilt and much to lose. A normal life with a significant other, Greene seems to be saying, is also affected by a ministry of fear.This is the eleventh novel by Graham Greene that I've reviewed on Amazon.com. Like most of these books (THE COMEDIANS is a slow-starting exception), TMoF has a brisk pace, an interesting and surprising plot, memorable characters, and some exquisite lines. The novel is also what Greene deemed one of his \\"entertainments,\\" which apparently means the protagonist spends little time ruminating about his failings and responsibilities as a Christian or Catholic.This is an enjoyable novel and fully successful on its own terms.Recommended."},{"Title":"The ministry of fear: An entertainment","review":"Graham Greene wrote THE MINISTRY OF FEAR in 1943, while he was serving as chief of the British Secret Intelligence Service station at Freetown, Sierra Leone. That probably goes a long way in explaining why the book is a World War II spy thriller. It also may help explain why THE MINISTRY OF FEAR is the most chaotic and agitated of Greene's novels and why it features so many grotesqueries. (As he writes in the novel, \\"War is very like a bad dream in which familiar people appear in terrible and unlikely disguises.\\")I dare not venture a summary of the plot. It is just too weird, convoluted, and melodramatic. For that matter, it is too much of all three of those adjectives to be first-rate fiction. It seems more like a script for \\"The Twilight Zone\\". While many other Amazon reviewers appear quite taken with the book, I find it near the bottom of Greene's fiction, of which I now have read all but two or three works. But it still is a novel by Graham Greene, which means that the reader will be treated to a liberal helping of dour and portentous, yet vaguely cryptic, observations (sometimes, more like conjectures) about what is required to be a moral person in this mortal sinful world. I have borrowed one from THE MINISTRY OF FEAR as the title for this review. It was perhaps more apt during WWII, when people everywhere were espousing abstract sentiments. And, as is also typical with Greene, the moral \\"lesson\\" is not fully realized in the novel.The current Penguin Classics edition I bought has a useful Introduction by Alan Furst. It includes the following quote from Graham Greene, given in an interview late in life: \\"[E]ver since the age of nineteen I've been on the Left, but I don't know if it means anything or whether it's just my way of thinking. I think it means being against dictatorship. And it's against the extremes of capitalism, which I think is represented by the United States.\\" (And that was more than twenty years ago.)Three-and-a-half stars, rounded up."},{"Title":"The ministry of fear: An entertainment","review":"This was my first (and possibly last) reading of a Graham Greene novel. I wanted to read one of Greene's novels to get a sense for the origin of the modern espionage genre. I chose his first \\"spy\\" novel (taking my cue from LeCarre) to avoid the overload of anti-americanism for which Greene is known. The novel met these two expectations, but did not rise to the level of significant literature.The Ministry of Fear is structured in four sections that trace the develop of the protagonist, Arthur Rowe, as he confronts the irrationalities of bombardment and espionage in wartime Britain. I was pleased with with the intensely Kafkaesque style of the first section, The Unhappy Man, in which Rowe's world-view and psyche both fall apart. Unfortunately, Greene could not maintain this approach. The later sections become successively shorter and more mundane as Greene leans on disappointing and conventional plot devices. The Happy Man posits a fantastic form of amnesia in which Rowe remembers only an (inexplicably) idyllic childhood. Bits and Pieces skips through several scenes which instruct Rowe overnight to be a practical secret agent. Finally, in The Whole Man, the feckless Rowe supplants the true spy, Hilfe, and adopts the existential callousness that is the meaning of the book's title.It's hard to imagine that The Ministry of Fear was ever thought to be a \\"thriller.\\" What it offers a modern reader is a curious look into the attitudes of British liberals during WWII. There is no sense of anything evil about Nazism - or of any preference for Western values. I was chilled by the overt claims of moral equivalence. On the other hand, the story development depends heavily on an assumption that euthanasia is morally repugnant. Clearly, liberal values in 1942-3 were still not fully deconstructed."},{"Title":"The ministry of fear: An entertainment","review":"Arthur Rowe, an inhabitant of wartime London during the Blitz with a terrible secret, visits a fair one day on a lark, setting in motion a chain of events that will thrust him into a shadowy world where nobody, not even oneself, is quite what they seem. Graham Greene is an extraordinary writer, painting fully developed characters with great economy of language. He is also a master of atmosphere; I have rarely encountered an author who so skillfully develops an ambiance of fear, paranoia, and regret. This black mood and a dearth of exciting action set pieces may be the reason some reviewers question this novel's status as a thriller, but I was enthralled by the quiet dread that makes our hero's fate so uncertain. The brilliant conclusion infuses a superficially happy ending with a strong dose of tragedy."},{"Title":"The ministry of fear: An entertainment","review":"Greene at his most paranoid turns the war novel into something a great deal more sinister. Forget Da's Army and the spirit of the blitz and see ww2 turn into one man's own private nightmare. Like the dream you have where you keep running, but all you enter is one strange room after another, this is a fascinating book, marred only by the occasional lapse in pace and one of Greene's less memorable leading men."},{"Title":"The ministry of fear: An entertainment","review":"Put on an extra sweater when you sit down to read a Graham Greene novel because you are about to be chilled. There is always something not quite right about the scenes he creates and characters he populates them with. Suspicion, fear and alienation are the dominant themes and in The Ministry of Fear, set in blitzed out London where death from the air dogs every moment and life seems bleak indeed, Greene is able to plumb the depths of the human psyche. His juxtaposition of the seeming ordinariness of life against the ugly backdrop of total war - pinstriped bankers heading to work through smoking ruins - leaves us further disorientated. Nor is the central character, Arthur Rowe, a likeable figure, at least initially. Withdrawn and stigmatized he suppresses his finer qualities under a blanket of guilt and loneliness. After a series of harrowing adventures, he is able to reconstruct himself and although the scars of his double past will never fully heal, he is able to end the book with a new sense of hope. Does he entirely escape the fear that has enveloped so much of his adult life? Greene leaves us to draw our own conclusions, but I for one believe he does."},{"Title":"The ministry of fear: An entertainment","review":"\\"The Ministry of Fear,\\" (1943) is a British spy story/crime drama/thriller by much honored twentieth century British author/screen writer Graham Greene (The Third Man,The end of the affair). The book is set in England, a country violently at war during World War II.Arthur Rowe is released back into wartime England after serving two years in a mental asylum for the mercy killing of his terminally ill wife. Despite the attention given him by psychiatric professionals, he is still rather immature and self-centered. Somehow, at a local garden fete, he stumbles across a murderous Nazi spy ring, by correctly guessing the weight of a cake - made with real eggs, we are repeatedly told. As Rowe appears to be substantially friendless, he doesn't know where to turn; but stakes his survival on that well-known British ability to muddle through. First he consults Mr. Rennet at \\"Orthotex: Long Established Private Inquiry Bureau\\" that generally does divorce work. Then, in his shambling way, Rowe finds himself at the offices of Comforts of the Free Mothers, where he meets a brother/sister pair of Austrian refugees, Anna and Willie Hilfe. And at Mrs. Bellairs' fortune telling s&eacute;ance, where he meets a Dr. Forester, and a man going by the names of Cost/ Travers or Ford; and foul deeds are afoot. Mr. Rennet, of Orthotex, the employee Rennet assigns to Rowe's case, Mr. Jones, and most everyone else Rowe meets, as he tries to sort things out, will most likely regret having met Rowe.The book, as many of Greene's other works, was made into a film of the same titleMINISTRY OF FEAR, starring Ray Milland, directed by the great cinematic thriller-maker, the Austrian-born Fritz Lang (METROPOLIS). The film may now be better known than the novel it's based on: at any rate the talented Lang made some canny changes, such as setting the introductory garden fair in the still-charming countryside, rather than the war torn Russell Square, Bloomsbury, London, rather close to the British Museum, as Greene did. Still, it must be said, Greene gives us a first-rate view of London under bombardment, its shelters and smoking ruins. (Lang made his film, supposedly set in the U.K., in Hollywood, to escape the dangers and privations of the city at that time.)Graham Greene (1904-1991) was one of the most illustrious British writers of the 20th century. He enjoyed a very long life, most of the century, and a very long, prolific writing career, during which he gave usThe Power and the Glory (Penguin Classics), andOur Man in Havana (Penguin Classics). These two books, among Greene's many other masterworks, were made into notable films. His books were very well-written, highly literate; greatly honored; much praised by the critics, and enjoyed a wide readership, being frequent best sellers. The author had first-hand spy experience; he was recruited to Britain's secret service, and worked in the African country of Sierra Leone during the Second World War. The writer was also one of the better-known Catholic converts of his time; many of his thrillers, as this one, deal with Catholic themes of guilt and redemption. He created vivid characters with internal lives; they faced struggles and doubt. Sometimes his characters despaired, or suffered world-weary cynicism - they were always self-aware. But Greene always created a tight thriller, in a lean, realistic style that boasted almost cinematic visuals. If you've never read him before, the book at hand is relatively light and cheerful compared to some of his others: it's a good place to start."},{"Title":"The ministry of fear: An entertainment","review":"I like Greene's writing. While he takes you to different lands in each of his books (which necessitates the addition of some archaic vocabulary)the stories just flow. This point was brought home to me when I tried to tell the plot of the first half of this book to my wife. As I verbally went through the plot, it seemed convoluted with an absurd number of twists and surprises. However, as I read it, the story seems much more plausible. Thats good writing."},{"Title":"The ministry of fear: An entertainment","review":"Arthur Rowe, a retired journalist, is the unlikely winner of a cake, the weight of which he correctly guessed during a charity fte patronized by The Free Mothers. For Rowe, the fte should have been an innocent trip back to childhood and innocence, a welcome chance to escape the terror of the Blitz and to forget twenty years of his past as a murderer. Instead he becomes a haunted man because he possesses a cake which was destined for somebody else. It turns out that the cake contains some poison - hyoscine - which nearly kills an innocent man called Poole. Then Rowe is involved in a s&eacute;ance with Mrs Bellairs, a fortune teller, and several other people during which a man called Cost is killed with Rowe's own knife. He manages to escape with the help of Willi Hilfe, an Austrian refugee. Next Rowe is accosted by a man called Fullove who specialises in eighteenth century landscape gardening books and who asks Rowe to help him carry his heavy suitcase to the Regal Court and to leave it there in the room of a certain Travers. A page guides Rowe to Mr Travers's room where Anna, Willi Hilfe's sister, is waiting. Soon after that, Rowe and Anna open the suitcase which contains no books but a bomb which goes off...At this stage - the middle of the novel - the plot does not seem to make much sense but in the second part Mr Greene carefully assembles the pieces of the jigsaw so that by the end of the narrative the reader has a clear picture of the mystery. Reading the novel one realizes that war is like a bad dream in which familiar people appear in terrible and unlikely disguises and that nobody is to be trusted. That is the Ministry of Fear, the general atmosphere spread by the enemy so that one can't depend on a single soul. And then there is that other Ministry of Fear to which all who love belong since if one loves, one fears at the same time."},{"Title":"The ministry of fear: An entertainment","review":"Proceeds in a surreal fashion, predicting Orwell's 1984 in many respects. A good read, particularly if you like Greene's brand of writing."},{"Title":"The ministry of fear: An entertainment","review":"The sense of dread and agony pervading this novel makes 'Crime and Punishment' seem like an upbeat self-help guide. I couldn't help but feel that this orginiated in the author; clearly, it reflects the psyche of a person who wrestled with a lot of difficult questions and who didn't always find easy answers, and it makes the smug liberalism of his later works seem all the more ridiculous. As for a more concrete description of the novel, though, I think of it as a less life-affirming 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest,' evoking similiar nightmares of control, full of grotesque scenes and characters, with the occasional glimpse of hope - but even the few happy moments the protagonist is offered are tinged with doubt. The immense guilt that he feels for having killed his wife in an act of mercy - I can't help but feel there's some kind of religious undertone here - can never really be erased, but the world around him is so awful that his own crime is often put in perspective."},{"Title":"The ministry of fear: An entertainment","review":"I am a fan of the British suspense story. There is a long tradition of excellence starting with John Buchan and continuing with his many heirs including Eric Ambler, Alfred Hitchcock and John Le Carre. I had hoped that for me, Graham Greene would somehow fit somewhere in this continuum.\\"Ministry of Fear\\" has a clever enough plot. Set in London during the Blitz, there are the usual plot twists of mistaken identities and unpleasant foreign agents. I am almost embarrassed to admit this but where Greene lost me, was with his writing style. What Eric Ambler can say in a sentence or two, Greene does the same in a long complex paragraph. I found the plot with its clever twists and turns to be almost Gothic in its complexity. In my opinion the best suspense stories are almost economical in their description of time and place. The best writers let the reader's imagination fill in the details.There is no doubt that Graham Greene is one of the major novelists of the Twentieth Century. However, World War Two spy thriller is better done on film by Orson Welles or Alfred Hitchcock and in the book form by Eric Ambler and Alan Furst. The Ministry of Fear is very clever but unfortunately not my cup of tea."},{"Title":"The ministry of fear: An entertainment","review":"Arthur Rowe is a graying middle-aged man who visits a parish carnival. He tries the fortune teller and unknowingly mentions a coded question. He is told to guess the weight of the cake raffle as \\"four pounds eight and a half ounces\\"! Rowe won this prize, but there was some question about it. Back at his apartment he has a piece of cake. Then a bomb falls and destroys his apartment (war time London). The new tenant went to the hospital. Rowe goes to a Private Inquirer to find out about this new tenant, and why he put a drug in Rowe's tea. Next Rowe goes to track down the fortune teller, and visits the lobbying group called the \\"Free Mothers\\". Hilfe takes him to a seance where somebody is stabbed. Rowe makes his escape before the police arrive. [This is followed by pages of reminiscing about Rowe's boyhood. It pads the story, and displays Greene's literary prowess. A film would cut it all out to simplify the story.] Pages tell of life in wartime London under the bombs.The story continues with an undercover operative fooling Rowe into taking a suitcase to a hotel room. [\\"No good deed ever goes unpunished.\\"] Johns explains the \\"Ministry of Fear\\" as the method of gathering dirt on important people then threatening them with exposure if they don't cooperate. [SOP for the Secret Services.] Could a witness disappear into a private asylum (Book Two)? Rowe manages to escape from the asylum, and goes to the police. His information matches what is known. The police raid the private asylum and find 3 dead men. They cannot find the spool of microfilm with the secret papers. They find the buttons and shoes from Jones, the private inquirer, but nothing else. Its easy to get rid of a body in war time. It all ends well: the secret microfilm is recovered, and Arthur is happy.What could Green have been thinking? The drama about a secret spy ring is masked by the psychological musings of Arthur. The much better \\"The Third Man\\" is an improved version of this story, all the dull parts were omitted. Was this written for domestic propaganda? Greene worked for British Intelligence during the war, he could have written a better story."},{"Title":"The People's Catechism: Catholic Faith for Adults","review":"This is an intense book! I personally felt a need to read it slowly over a long period of time as there was much to savor here. The subject matter also lends itself to discussion--I think it would make a very good source text for a discussion group or a retreat.This book, like the Catechism of the Catholic Church, is divided into 4 sections: faith, sacraments, morals, and prayer. Each of the 4 sections is written by a different author (or team of authors).The book's 40 chapters also share a common organization--each begins with a quote from scripture, follows with an essay on the relevance of the biblical teaching in the real world, then challenges the reader to put his or her faith into action, and concludes with a section on prayer.The choices from scripture are relevant. The essays are clear, contemporary, and meaningful. There is a strong thread throughout the text on the importance of the Christian community and the need to apply the faith to every day living.The calls to action issue blunt challenges. For example, the reader is asked: if someone wished to persecute Christians, would they have enough evidence to convict you?"},{"Title":"The People's Catechism: Catholic Faith for Adults","review":"This book is full of errors, some blatant, some subtle, especially about Jesus Christ himself and about Scripture. I'd give it zero stars. While there are a few parts that are ok, there are some outrageous errors in it and it contradicts or misinterprets the teaching of the Church in a number of places. You can get good information elsewhere without these errors that will lead people astray. Read the real Catechism of the Catholic Church if you want to know the faith. And PS, contrary to the claims of this or any other supposedly Catholic book, the Second Vatican Council reaffirmed in its document Dei Verbum (see section 19), what the Church has always maintained: that the gospels are historically accurate, that they really teach what Jesus did and taught.

Kirby knows little about vegetarian nutrition and is apparently unaware of what is really now old news - that the old-style food combining of the seventies actually isn't necessary. She also proposes a hard-boiled egg as a healthful diet snack, so one has to wonder about her general nutritional knowledge as well. Such a high-cholesterol snack might be all right once in a while, but it's hardly a good food for someone trying to avoid heart disease as well as lose weight.

The introduction says &quot;You can trust us, we are from the American Dietetic Association&quot;. But I think it is the same old junk that the FDA and the USDA and all our so-called experts have been giving us for the last 25 years while we get fatter and fatter and lose more and more of our grandparents and parents to heart disease and diabetes. Diabetes has become a problem now even for children as young as 10 years old. Why? I cannot understand why it is taking so long for the word to get out. There is a revolution going on right under our noses. In my opinion, while people like Dr. Atkins and others were on the right track, only Doctors Michael and Mary Dan Eades have put it all together and come up with a health program that really works. I've lost 55 pounds,lowered my cholesterol by 17%, my triglycerides by 66%, and my LDL by 15%. Moreover, I've rasied my HDL (the &quot;good&quot; cholesterol)by 13%. My blood pressure is now around 120/70. My ratio of Total Cholesterol to HDL is down from 5.0 to 3.7. (5.0 and over is associated with heart disease). I've read all of this stuff before! I've been to Weight Watchers, Nutri Systems and Jenny Craig. I've tried all kinds of diets. Trying to follow the food pyramid just doesn't work.

I have read numerous books on dieting, ect and I never really understood what they were trying to teach, but this one really hit the nail on the head, so to speak.It shows you how to cut back safely and how not to cut too much and why. It also explains in easy terms why your body works a certain way and how to obtain what you want. For example, it explains how many calories you would need to cut back to lose X amount of weight in X amount of time. It has information on weight groups, the food pyramid, healthy weights and even a section in the back with foods listed and how many calories and fat they contain. So far I have been following the suggestions and have lost just about 40 pounds so I would definately say its worth the money! Its not hard to stick to (believe me, I HATE dieting) and you don't feel hungry all the time. It shows you how to start eating right and how to indulge when you crave. Its definately not a diehard-drop-the-weight-now book in any means. Learning how to eat right and how to eat your favorite foods and how to learn when to say when. I have since learned how to eat better and how your body sends signals when its full, truly full, and when its really hungry and not just craving that piece of cake you were eyeing. LOL...

The good thing about the &quot;Dummies&quot; series is it's simplicity; this book is easy to understand and has sound dieting principles that will really help a person get control of their eating. Check it out!"},{"Title":"Dieting for Dummies","review":"This book may be useful if you have only a modest amount to lose and know very little about weight loss. In that case, the advice here -- fill up on vegetables, don't skip meals -- may help you reach your goal. But, for anyone who has a more serious weight problem, this book may do more harm that good.Some of the book's advice is so overambitious, it's ludicrous. For example, the author claims that a good daily exercise goal to shoot for is 20,000 steps of walking, which she notes is about ten miles. She claims this takes about an hour. Just how unrealistic is it to expect dieters to walk 10 miles in an hour? Very -- it's faster than the WORLD RECORD for race walking.The book's advice is often contradictory. Early in the book, the author says that people under the age of 18 should not try to lose weight. Later on, she says that they should. At other times, the advice is also lacking in detail. She says one should cut back on fat, but then says eating a little fat with each meal helps stave off hunger. How much fat is \\"a little\\"? She doesn't say.One section that was very interesting was the part about bariatric surgery. The descriptions of the surgical procedures and of likely long-term side effects would be quite useful for anyone contemplating this drastic route to weight loss. However, even here the book contradicts itself. First, the authors says that people undergoing this procedure can expect to lose 30-40% of their starting weight, which would take a 400 lb person down to about 250 lbs; later, she says they can expect to lose 60% of their starting weight -- which would bring a 400 lb person all the way down to 160 pounds.Perhaps most importantly, the author heavily emphasizes how unhealthy it is to be even slightly overweight, but barely mentions research showing that losing a modest amount -- 10% of starting weight -- has huge health benefits. This book may leave seriously overweight people thinking that improving their health is hopeless.In summary, this book may be a useful starting point for people who are just learning how to diet, but is likely to frustrate and discourage anyone with a serious weight problem."},{"Title":"Dieting for Dummies","review":"I think this book is an excellent resource. I completely dissagree with the customer from Ann Arbor. As the title indicates, this book is intended to give the general public basic background about healthy eating and weight loss. This sound, research-based information is sorely needed in response to fad diet claims so prominent these days. And, by the way, eggs do not cause heart disease, and neither does dietary cholesterol. It is well known that saturated fat is the culprit. Maybe you should have read the book instead of returned it?"},{"Title":"Dieting for Dummies","review":"This book does contain useful information based on scientific facts, not quick fixes and fads; but its delivery is BORING. It just doesn't make the information interesting or compelling. And it didn't pay much attention on how to plan well-balanced meals. Further, there was no advice on how to incorporate &quot;treats&quot; wisely into your regular eating plan or how to incorporate exercise into your daily life. However, it had three really good chapters: &quot;Ten Myths about Dieting,&quot; &quot;Ten Ways to Cut Calories,&quot; and &quot;Ten Rules for Healthy Living.&quot; I don't recommend buying buy this book, but do check out the three chapters mentioned next time you're at your local bookstore.

I had read this years ago and it is a bit dated technology wise, but what isn't these days. Filled with the author's usual bizarre characters and good over evil in the end."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"The usual (maybe not 'usual' except for the folks who end up in the police blotter sections of newspapers) odd Florida characters from murderers to con artists to the distinctly cracked in the head somewhere are involved in various linked ways. This time it's a Florida hurricane which starts the ball rolling, as various couples find the hurricane itself has completely wrecked the lives they had been living before the winds hit and overturned everything that made them the people they felt themselves to be. A Hiaasen book is always entertaining, and like most, this one ends happily as long as you aren't a really bad person."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"Clever observational story about the surreal chaos surrounding a natural disaster. It reads like the author experienced a hurricane first hand and that turned into a treasure trove of ideas to weave into a novel, and this amusing book is the result. The characters have their lives turned upside down, just like the homes throughout southern florida, as the storm tears away the fragile web of society. This liberates the characters to indulge the dominant aspects of their personalities, whether that is venal, criminal, adventurous, altruistic, or just plain crazy. Hiaasen populates the story with pretty much that entire gamut. And that's what this story is about: a singular incident in which those character extremes are on display to rub up against each other and create sparks that would normally be subdued when normal societal constraints are in place.The result is a character driven story which provides humorous interest for as long as the characters are novel. Unfortunately, that runs out about half way through the book and you're then left with a thin story that grows a bit wearisome by the end. On balance though, a sardonically clever and inventive story."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"Wow!! I have read several of his books and this one was my favorite. I could not put it down.You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"My first read by Hiaasen was Double Whammy, and this book was equally impressive.

This story starts with a bang and keeps moving at that speed. An additional benefit is that I grew up in Florida about the time Carl did, and it gives me an added point of reference. I've read \\"Stormy Weather a few times now. After the first time, I used it as therapy when i really felt depressed. It's medicine. It brings me out from a gloom. This book is good medicine.

A bad hurricane hits southern Florida, blowing away whole trailer parks and all manner of people's roofs, accompanied by widespread devastation, even a few deaths. We then meet quite a quirky cast of characters: newlyweds Bonnie and Max, with Max abandoning all the honeymoon plans to go south and videotape the damages; \\"Snapper\\" and Edie, whose goal is to scam missing homeowners out of their insurance money; Augustine, who has inherited his uncle's wildlife collection, all of which is set loose during the storm; ex-governor \\"Skink\\", who kidnaps Max for fun; a bunch of roofer scammers, and so on and so on! The hi-jinks soon follow: will the \\"roofers\\" get caught; will Max get back to Bonnie; will Edie get her insurance check?It's not easy to summarize a book with like six concurrent long-running gag lines comprising some 388 pages, but suffice to say that hilarity prevails throughout, with a dollop of romance and sex thrown in here and there for good measure.

Carl Hiassen brings Florida wildlife, both four-footed and two-footed, to vibrant life."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"Like the two-word titles of all his books, my title states from the outset the enormous pleasure that reading this author gives me. There is no better laugh-a-minute, screw-the-villians, state-the-truth-as-it-is writer who sees into the morass that Florida has become with the eyes of a native son, somewhat like the Indian in the commercial who stood on a hill, a tear trickling from his eye, looking over the polluted, overdeveloped plains of America. His take on born-again Christians, Cuban nationalists, land developers, medical and legal charlatans and just plain old bubba bad boys is acute, hilarious and unsympathetic. The &quot;bad guys&quot; usually die well-deserved and well-designed deaths. This is the best, if not one of the best of all his tremendous books. Hollywood, to no one's surprise, totally missed finding its creative orifice with both hands even in strong studio light when it cast the large-breasted, small-talented Demi Moore as the heroine (clearly described in the book as having small breasts and long lovely legs--does that bring Demi to mind?). On the other hand casting Burt Reynolds as the lusty Representative Dilbeck was genius and his adventures and character ring amazingly true and prescient as we have watched the Elian farce and the Catherine &quot;I really am somebody&quot; Harris fiasco in Florida. Can't wait to read Hiaasen's take on these two latest Florida embarassments."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"First Hiaasen book I read and it was hell funny, since then I've read all his books. This book rates high on the list. My advice is to read it."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"Hiassen's rich use of satire and humor are the strengths of this book. The cast of characters are fun to read, but it is somewhat depressing if this is an accurate representation of today's society. Like his novel &quot;Strip Tease&quot;, Hiaasen focuses on the seedy underbelly of life, with greed and corruption being the major theme. However he does allow human goodness to shine through and triumph in the end. Fun to read, even though the cast of characters got confusing at times."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"Hiaassen brings out Skink and Jim again in his novel Stormy Weather. This time, another bloody yahoo tourist has turned the destruction of a hurricane into a camcorder event. The characters are likeable, Skink is every bit as absurdly loveable as usual, and the imagery is superb. However, this novel lacked something. I'm not sure what, but it didn't pack the punch most Hiaasen books do for me. I'm used to reading a Hiaasen book and wanting to read it again immediately, yet this one didn't hold the same splendor. Also, as some of you know, in many books the epilogue wasn't printed. I wound up getting one of those copes, so until I tracked down the epilogue on the web, I was a tad confused about the ending."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"While I enjoyed this book I was a little disappointed.Familiar ideas are presented however it seems that no real progression of thought has been made since double whammy and naked tongue.The entertainment value is lost with too many Hiassen cliches and too many re-run renamed villans. Superfluous characters are introduced for comical effect who play no real role in terms of plot development.Lacking is the underlying evil and the bigger picture conspiracy.Read one of his earlier books before this one. I think that you will feel more satisfied at the result."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"My favorite of Carl Hiaasen's books so far. A very enjoyable page turner, with more twists and turns than an alligator hunting dinner. Carl Hiaasen kills his bad guys in the most inventive and mind- boogling ways."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"Hiaasen has done it again with Stormy Weather. This is the second book of his that I've read this week, and both have been a complete joy.The books revolves around a couple going through their first marital problems, and on their honeymoon of all times!A hurricane has ravaged south Florida and it brings out the worst in everyone.Hiaasen once again brings Skink into his story. Skink is a fun and colorful character that gave up on politics to live the life of a recluse in the everglades. He is appalled by what is happening to Florida and every once in a while goes off the deep end.The story is fast passed, and kept me interested from cover to cover. The characters are well developed and I found myself truly feeling for the good guys, and repulsed by the bad guys.Over all I found this to be a very easy read, and very entertaining."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"In &quot;Stormy Weather,&quot; southern Florida is ravaged by a monster hurricane of Andrew-like proportions. What happens to the physical landscape is not as bad as what happens to the social landscape in the aftermath: into the devastation come bootleg contractors, shady insurance reps, assorted ne'er-do-wells and one honeymooning couple who just came out of voyeuristic interest.Imagine what can happen when strangers inhabit a house pretending to be its owner--when a former governor has become a feral &quot;wild man&quot; out to wreak acts of eco-terrorism on behalf of his beloved state--when half the honeymoon couple gets kidnapped--then you'll get an idea of what &quot;Stormy Weather&quot; is like.This story is told with typical Hiaasen crispness and pacing, and with his well-honed sense of timing. What I missed was not the humor, but the quality of humor. There is plenty of humor here, but 100% of it is black. It makes a book like &quot;Strip Tease&quot; look positively lighthearted by comparison. Still, readers of Hiaasen will enjoy this one and will know what to expect."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"With everyone else raving about how funny this book was I bought it. I was not disappointed with the story, but it really wasn't all that humorous. Dave Barry has a much better feel for humor, especially in Florida. Still, I will read other Hiassen books. I will simply change my expectations to drama rather than humor. That's why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5; false advertising."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"If you believe that there's a little good in everyone, then Stormy Weather and Carl Hiaasen are not for you.Stormy Weather is classic Hiaasen. His writing is so sarcastic and unrestrained by reality that it reminds me a little of Douglas Adams (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) or Neil Stevenson (Snow Crash). Interestingly, these are science fiction authors and Hiaasen doesn't write science fiction, but, like these science fiction writers, Hiaasen's writing is modern and clever and his imagination knows no limits. His books are parodies of human nature, especially greed and stupidity, sort of like Voltaire's Candide. After painting such surreal pictures of a cast of very selfish characters, often criminals, Hiaasen then draws upon some Dante as he assigns the characters to their inevitable and well-earned unique circles of hell (that's usually in Florida involving water, alligators, or at least a storm). It says something about a writer when his best known hero is a one-eyed crazy man who lives in the everglades but used to be the governor of the great state of Florida.If you like the sarcastic social comedy of George Carlin, the ironic wit of Steven Wright, and the slapstick of Peter Sellers, then you will love Carl Hiaasen's Stormy Weather. If you find Carlin offensive, Wright unfunny, and Sellers overrated, then you're going to hate Carl Hiaasen.If you're new to Hiaasen's books, Stormy Weather is a good place to start. My favorite Hiaasen books are: Strip Tease, 1993; Stormy Weather, 1995; Lucky You, 1997; Sick Puppy, 2000; and Skinny Dip, 2004."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"Given the recent hurricanes Katrina and Rita that hit the United States in the past year, 'Stormy Weather,' by Carl Hiaasen, seemed like a timely read. This novel tells a story of tourists, native Floridians, scam artists, and insurance adjusters as they interact in Miami after a Hurricane strikes.Max and Bonnie Lamb are honeymooning in Disney World when the hurricane hits Florida. Bonnie just wants to resume the honey moon festivities, but her husband, Max, an advertising rep, sees an opportunity to impress his bosses and drags Bonnie down to Miami to get footage of the destruction carved out by the storm.Edie Marsh has been roving Florida in search of a Kennedy. Her plan has been to seduce one, and then blackmail them on her way to easy street. The plan never bears fruit. After the hurricane, she sees an opportunity to work another scam and sets off for Miami with a partner named Snapper, who acquired his nickname after an unfortunate childhoot incident left him with a deformed jaw. Edie's plans go awry when Snapper turns out to be more difficult to handle than she thought.Augustine took a plane trip one day to discover he had spent months in a coma after the plane he was riding crashed. He also found wealth in the form of an insurance settlement. He no longer works, and spends his time dating the wrong women and juggling human skulls. Just before the hurricane strikes, he learns he had inherited his uncles exotic animal farm. After the hurricane, he has a problem: although the weather passed, the animals are loose.Finally, there is Skink. This crazy wild man has great teeth and a protective streak for Florida's wilderness. He trusts one man, Jim Tile (one of Florida's few black highway patrolmen). He has been waiting for just the right hurricane to hit Florida, and is disappointed when this one doesn't do all he hoped for. However, when he spies a tourist taking advantage of the destruction to shoot home movies, he hatches a new plan.These are just some of the characters that fill the pages of 'Stormy Weather.' Throughout the novel, they end up running into each other and confounding one another's plans. It's an incredibly twisted plot, but Hiaasen pulls it off perfectly.This is more than just a spirited novel. This book allows Hiaasen to take swipes at many Florida institutions from Disney World and high rise developments to crooked politicians that sell out the environment and scam artists preying on the desperate after the hurricane. Still, the novel is a great read and to borrow a cliche, a real page turner.I recommend this novel to anyone that wants a fun and entertaining read that falls on the edge of crime fiction. Elmore Leonard and Dave Barry fans should enjoy it immensely. Existing fans of Hiaasen will delight in getting more adventures of Skink.Overall Grade: 5 stars."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"After weeks of overtime I escaped to the Sierra Foothills, hosted to a relaxing Thanksgiving weekend with Stormy Weather (thanks Bill &amp; Karen!). The greatest disappointment of this book was that it ended before the weekend &amp; I had no sequel!&quot;On August 23, the day before the hurricane struck, Max and Bonnie Lamb awoke early, made love twiece and rode the shuttle bus to Disney World.&quot; So begins this marvelously improbably tale which weaves together the paths of newlyweds, cons, thugs, and a living-off-the-land, scraggly haired ex-governor. Easy to pick up and slide into, difficult to put down, this romp into Hurricane Andrew's wake tosses quirky characters into chaos. Not as extreme as Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Adams), more of a down-home Good Omens (Pratchett &amp; Gaiman) without devils or angels.Character development is not intense, but the contrived situations that bring those characters to light actually seem plausible. Fewer laughs in this book and more subconscious chuckles. If you want something traditional &amp; predictable, leave this one on the shelf and go buy Grisham or Clancy. But if a road-kill scavenging, toad-licking ex-governor piques your curiousity (and he's a much better guardian of the land than our current &quot;president&quot;), grant serious consideration to this book!Five stars for creating an extremely improbable story and making it seem as natural as a tale about the Springfield 'burbs!

It's similar to what Elmore Leonard does, but much as I love Leonard, I have even more of an affection for Hiaasen. STORMY WEATHER is an absolute laugh riot from start to finish, the labyrinthe plot makes it un-putdownable, and it's got an intense streak of moral high ground to keep things interesting. This book rules. --Thomas S.

My giving it 3 stars is actually generous.Perhaps the book was just built up too much, or maybe I'm just jaded, but this novel never really engaged me. I could have put it down after 100 pages and not felt bad or any lack of \\"closure\\" for not knowing what happens. Then again, I enjoy \\"quirky\\" and \\"off-beat\\" literature, and this struck me as a mainstream book **trying** to be off-beat for mainstream readers. Maybe I just have a higher threshold for such stuff.There are several reasons why this didn't click with me. First and foremost, almost every character in here annoyed me. Let me be clear and clarify/contrast that: a well-written book designs antagonists that we are obviously not supposed to like and secretly hope they get a \\"come-uppance\\". That isn't what happened here: everyone (heroes and villains) were simply irritating--without actually being **interesting**, and I simply wished they'd go away so someone more interessting would come along.Going hand-in-hand with that, the antagonists consistently suffered from \\"willful stupidity\\" -- they would do dumb things that were obviously dumb and served no purpose except plot convenience, because if they had a few more brain cells to rub together they wouldn't be in whatever situation there was and the book would grind to a halt. That may or may not be lazy writing, but to me it's certainly frustrating: I enjoy my villains to have a mind and a master plan that's interesting.Lastly, the book is about 100 pages longer than it needs to be, and since it had already worn out its welcome by that point it seemed especially tedious to me. Again, I could have walked away from this by then with a clean conscience, but the only thing preventing me from doing so was that there wasn't anything else handy for me to read at the time.I can see why mainstream readers might think Hiaasen in general and this book in particular are funny and off-beat, but since I read a lot of that type of stuff anyway, this is a sub-par offering. For instance, Tim Dorsey does the same type of thing, but much, much better."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"I admit I was suspect when I first picked up this set and saw Ed Asner was reading Stormy Weather. Carl Hiaasen books get pretty raunchy at times and I was not sure I could listen to Ed Asner reading about hot and dirty action. I was pleased to find my misgivings to be unfounded. The consummate actor Mr. Asner brings Stormy Weather to life with a dry , sardonic wit that fits the material and allows the listener to get to know the characters and revel in their adventures and misadventures.The most colorful character in this ensemble piece- the crazy ex-governor turned swamp dweller Skink is particularily well drawn in Asner's reading. This is one of my favorite Hiaasen books and I am very happy I got an audio copy to listen to in the car!For those of you who are new to Hiaasen- the governor appears again in Sick Puppy."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"Hiaasen as his best! What better way to write an adventurous novel about Florida than to incorporate the act of God that plagues us most...a hurricane!!! But what most people do not think of, that Hiaasen has lived through, is the crazy aftermath of said hurricane. Lack of fresh water, food and ice cannot drive away those hell bent on insurance fraud, roofing scams, or the crazed tourist that wants to capitalize on some original footage of the events as they unfold.Beautifully told, masterfully woven stories of corruption, adultery, murder, kidnapping, sex, circus freaks, mafia, exotic animals on the loose, and an ex governor with an electronic dog collar. This book will have you on the edge of your seat without the ability to put it down. Stormy Weather provides a refreshing break from reality that makes you thankful you are not a character in the story.I love the way Hiaasen correlates being a politician or wealthy real estate developer with corruption and complete lack of moral conviction. In reality, this is not true but perhaps in Hiaasen's \\"newsworthy\\" south Florida world, it is true. He comically weaves his opinions about the state of Florida's insurance laws and medical laws into this action packed story of environmental extremist who take it upon themselves to play God.This book has my highest recommendation for anyone who loves fiction novels, particularly those who are familiar with the state of Florida.M.J. Wright of Reed & Wright Book Review, Inc."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"As a Florida resident, I can surely attest that the craziness demonstrated in this book is a fact! Hiassen is a master at capturing our insane little world and making it hilarious. I loved this book - and as I neared the end - I wished it would go on forever."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"For those readers who are unfamiliar with Carl Hiaasen's novels, the opening scene with the two Miami honeymooners, Bonnie &amp; Max, might read like a contemporary novel on a bored and restless couple. But add the 1992 Hurricane Andrew, the corruption in Florida, and several con artists, and Hiaasen has given us a virtual witch's brew of wickedly funny characters, each unique in their own way. Fans of Hiaasen's prior stories will be glad to learn that the infamous Skink will make his appearance and force his &quot;wildlife&quot; culture on Max Lamb, a pompous ad man who has the gall to videotape the hurricane victims in all of their misery. His bride of only one night, Bonnie, quickly reinforces her initial impression of him (disgust), but finds herself in the midst of a great adventure in the process of rescuing him. Augustine, the unfortunate owner of several escaped wild animals (including rhesus monkeys and buffaloes!) gets caught up in the rescue mission with Bonnie. The animals alone take on the starring roles when it comes to the &quot;just desserts&quot; that Hiaasen so fondly dishes out to his most deserving characters. And THESE are the true stars of his story:Edie Marsh is a tough cookie who, failing to &quot;get&quot; one of the Kennedys on a rape charge, settles for scoring money on an insurance fraud scheme. Her rapid, sparring repartee alone is worth the price of the book; she fears no one and uses everyone, including her hapless partners in crime. &quot;Snapper&quot; is one of these partners, the stock &quot;low-class stupid Southern bigot&quot; character, but he also occasionally displays some cynical wit. His come-uppance is custom-made for him. Ditto for the other &quot;slime&quot; such as Avila, the crooked housing inspector who does his best work speeding by houses at 40 miles an hour. Tony Torres, the unscrupulous mobile home salesman, also gets more than he bargained for. The more vile the character, the more creative Hiaasen gets with the revenge tactics; if revenge is usually considered to be best served cold, Hiaasen prefers to toss in hot peppers and loads of fireworks. This is easily as entertaining a novel as &quot;Strip Tease&quot; (and PLEASE try to find a copy of &quot;Strip Tease&quot; without Ms. Demi on the cover, so as not to be reminded of the horrible movie version that blasphemed the book). Thankfully, it seems that a Miami hurricane would be far too expensive to reconstruct, even for a movie, so there is no danger of Mr. Hiaasen's wonderfully over-the-top satire getting the hatchet treatment by a conventional, &quot;by-the-numbers&quot; Hollywood producer. I was surprised to learn that there was an epilogue with this story, since my copy didn't have one; it didn't seem necessary. My only beef was with the money (I won't get too specific and spoil the plot). Why wasn't it used to help the victims? Even a radically non-materialistic jungle fighter like Skink would want to help poor families get back on their feet, wouldn't he? Then again, given his former-governor status and bufo-toad mind trips, maybe not. His dream is probably for everyone to get back to their &quot;roots&quot;. Other than this minor quibble, the intertwining plots come together in an inspiring finale, and it's hard to resist a book in which Skink finally &quot;gets lucky&quot;. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"[...]When I first read this book, it was back when it had the flamingo on the cover, so it has been awhile. But my opinion about the book has not changed.Having gone through Hurricane Andrew in Homestead, this book touched more than a nerve. Only those that have dealt with tragedy like this, from both Mother Nature and humans, truly understand the heart-ache and anger that is felt. It's not contrived, it is not in our heads, but something that we lived with for a long time.Between tourists, scammers, developers and politicians, Florida (and our country), needs heroes that will stand up and do what is needed for the right reasons - and greed isn't it.I have thoroughly enjoyed all of Carl Hiaasen's books that I've read, and I've only missed 5, this one though, is at the top of my list for showing just what it was like living in South Florida after the hurricane.Having read through the reviews, I have to say, it was amusing to read how some reviewers say that what happened in the book is basically far-fetched. Well, having hunted for escaped monkeys, sat up with rifle in lap for my turn at watch, paid $10.00 for a bag of ice, learned to cook pretty much anything on a grill, far-fetched was close to reality."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"Pure enjoyable pulp. Vibrant characters, grifters &amp; erudite madmen - loved it! Quite a find."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"...adds up to a laugh riot. This book is quirkily hilarious, and very sharp. Even the most minor of characters in this wacky story is brought out in funny detail. The major players are both bizarre and believable, and their interactions are a storm in themselves. Yet it all makes a kind of wonderful sense.I liked this book so much I tell all my friends to read it, too. Don't shortchange yourself with an abridged audio version; you need every wry detail."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"Carl Hiaasen writes books that could take place only in Southern Florida or South Louisiana. If you've ever been to either, you know what I mean. Hiaasen manages to populate his books with a collection of low-lifes and weirdos that should be repulsive but wind up hilarious. The plots are like episodes of Seinfeld, twisting and turning in all directions before coming full circle. Stormy Weather is one of his best, in my opinion. The targets are classic Hiaasen--tourists, snowbirds, and developers. No one skewers them all like Carl Hiaasen."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"When I sit down to read a book, I am usually searching for entertainment, Stormy Weather gave me that and more. The incredibly dark humor, and the bizarre twisting plot all tied into Hiaasen's political message about Florida sucked me into his strange mystery. One of the few mysteries I have that is so intriguing you don't have time to predict how its going to end, you're having fun on the ride not at the destination. I felt that he developed his characters very well, completely unique characters who make you wonder who the good guys are, everyone has their flaws and their upsides. Overall I found it entirely enjoyable."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"As a native Floridian, I love Carl's books because so much of what he writes really hits home. I REMEMBER when the birds and monkeys were out loose after the hurricane! You may think he's making this stuff up, but it's scary how much is REAL! I also secretly like to see the tourists get messed with. Sweet revenge! Hilarious, sick fun!"},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"As a South Floridian who lived through Andrew I can relate to much of Mr. Hiaasen's story.You had to be here to appreciate what South FL was like in the aftermath of Andrew. This book is hilarious at times and always entertaining. As an avid reader who has become bored with book after book that seems to be cranked out with little imagination, this was a refreshing change. This was my first exposure to Mr. Hiaasen's talent and I plan to read more of his work. If the rest of his books are as entertaining as this one I am in for a real treat."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"Great humor , great characters , great storyline drawing them all together. Everyone knows someone resembling these characters. I am a fan from way back , and cannot wait for the next one."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"Hiaasen's been chronicling Miami for decades, and his amusement by, and occasional disdain for, its habitues is in full bloom in &quot;Stormy Weather&quot;. After beginning innocuously enough, introducing a weaselly New Yorker and his wife who plan to videotape the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew, his cast of characters soon take on the sun-baked and brain-rotted pall that Miami cast over all...residents and tourists alike. Any book that can make you sympathize with a crazy ex-governor who straps himself to suspension bridges, can't be all bad.If your image of Miami is of tanned and beautiful models strolling Ocean Drive, I highly recommend this novel, just so you can find out how loony the &quot;American Riviera&quot; really is."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"I loved it. I thought Stormy Weather was going to be a yawn producer as I read the first chapter, but as the author started introducing more and more off the wall characters I found it hard to put down. The way he tied them all together for an ultimately happy ending was sensational. This is one I'll probably have to read again just to make sure I didn't miss anything."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"Carl Hiaasen, an investigative journalist for Florida, has written several funny, satirical crime stories, featuring an ex-governor of Florida and a State Highway Patrol trooper. This story centres around crimes and scams following adevastating hurricane.

This book did not disappoint!My father has been reading Mr. Hiaasen's books for years and years now. He recommended them to me and gave me Skinny Dip to read first. From the first page I was hooked! I have now read almost all of his books. He is so funny! The writing is some of the best I have ever had the pleasure of reading. Stormy Weather was one of my favorites. It had everything! From wild, thieving monkeys, to criminals, to con-artists, to gangsters, to the always present normal couple of characters. And of course you have to pay homage to \\"The Captain\\"!Bottom line is that this man is a genious and I will read ANYTHING he every writes!"},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"short review - a great summer read and a very good Carl book, which means Florida and odd characters."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"[...] I appreciate Carl Hiaasen's brand of humor. Like all of his books, Stormy Weather is satire at its best. It is dark at points, outrageous at others, and over-the-top. It is pure fun; more fun than my first roller coaster ride!Mr. Hiaasen has an active imagination which allows him to create delightfully memorable characters. He is consistent in this regard in all of his books. I haven't read one that has disappointed me yet and I have read at least six of them. There's no need for me to get into the plot. The story tells itself in an engaging way.In this troubled world we live in, it is nice to have an escape. This book did it for me. I trust it will do the same for you.Davis Aujourd'hui, author of \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude\\""},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"Last year, I readSkinny Dip, my first Hiaasen novel. I was really pleasantly surprised. I found it fun, interesting, quirky-- an excellent waste of time. I wanted to read something else by him and several people recommended Stormy Weather. It is meant to be classic Hiaasen, whatever that means.What classic Hiaasen meant for me, unfortunately, was that it read very much likeSkinny Dip. I can't help but think it a good sign when you feel that an author is formulaic after only two books.A well-meaning woman makes a bad marriage choice to a reasonably icky male. Disaster of one kind or another brings her into contact with a damaged but well-meaning loner who quickly reveals himself to be a better catch than the man that she actually married. Add to that basic plot a whole lot of character-based zaniness and the idea of Florida as a lens which sorts out the good from the bad, and it seems from these two books as though you have Hiassen in a nutshell.To be clear, there's nothing wrong with a good formula, providing that it delivers the entertainment value. Hiassen certainly does that-- no doubt about it. I enjoyed Stormy Weather, even if the enjoyment was dimmed by the comparison to Skinny Dip.By the way, it is well possible that I just picked an unfortunate two books with which to begin and that when I read a third I will see that the strong plot similarities were simply coincidence. I hope so. I've already gotNature Girlsitting on my shelf to be read, so I guess that I'm going to find out."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"This was the first Hiaasen book I ever read and I was immediately hooked. You don't have to be from Florida to appreciate this, but it doesn't hurt. Hiaasen will make you laugh and shake your head in disbelief in the same paragraph."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"This is as classic as a novel by Carl Hiaasen can get. The plot is evolved during and after south Florida gets hit by a hurricane with all the characters, the twists and humor that you would expect from Hiaasen.If you have not read one of his novels yet, I should note that Hiassen is an enviromentalist (who is a regular columnists for the Miami Herald) and and all his novels take place in Florida. Full of different (and sometimes extreme characters) and a unique humor/satire he is enjoyble to read. His novels are not exactly crime stories but rather about life in Florida that has a bit of everything.Enjoy it."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"Great characters, the book stays true to its genre without losing the element of surprise. Good summer read."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"this is the first hiaasen book that i read and i was impressed. most lines were witty and hiaasen is one natural satirist :) even though there are plenty of characters with intertwined lives, i never got lost and i believe almost all of them were given enough space for the character to evolve. i have acquired more of his books here in Manila and i can't wait to read them."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"Great sense of timing and humor. This was the first book of his I've read but I can't wait to buy the rest of his works. Keeps me up late at night giggling."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"Stormy Weather is one of Hiaasen's masterpieces. Hiaasen writes simultaneous stories in the one novel where the characters all cross paths at different times. Unethical and criminal characters get their comeuppance like in all his other novels but the setting in the aftermath of a hurricane just makes Stormy Weather a bit more realistic than his other novels. I was extremely tempted to not go to work once I had started this book because it is so hard to put down. My advice is to start reading this when you have a weekend free or something as once you start reading the first page you're addicted to the fast paced surreal storyline.In Stormy Weather a hurricane hits southern Florida wiping out trailer parks, houses and anything in its path. Looters and con artists are of course drawn like magnets trying to prosper from the victims, as are honeymooners Max and Bonny Lamb. Max drags his reluctant new bride to the devastation so he can get it all on film to impress his yuppie friends back in New York but disappears while following an escaped monkey. Ex governor now living in the wilderness Skeet knows where he is as he has taken him prisoner to teach him some lessons. Meanwhile a dishonest caravan salesman is planning on how to survive the vengeance of his customers who have lost their homes and their loved ones while con artist roofing contractors take deposits and never return to their victims until they rip off the wrong people.Other masterpiece level Hiaasen novels are Sick Puppy, Lucky you and Skinny Dip."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"Read his book &#34;Skinny Dip&#34; and loved it... wanted to try another.

Still, I plan to read his other books now because I do think he's funny and talented and certainly a good writer."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"This is my favorite of Mr Hiaasen's many novels. It has everything a fan of his gonzo crime drama-dies loves.

It's impossible to even say what style of story this is. Murder, mayhem, escaped exotic animals, an ex-governor, psychos, crazies, losers, criminals........they ALL abound in this absolutely hysterically disturbing book. I loved it, it was like nothing I've ever read before, and now, I can't wait to read the rest of his books! There's nothing else to say, except that, if you're looking for something completely different, Carl Hiaasen has written it!

More of an adventure although impossible in real life (mine, anyway)and I am sure the characters resemble real people living somewhere even as wacky as they were, but not in my unexciting suburban area. The humor comes from imagining the scenes as described and the predicaments each main character gets him/herself into as well as the thinking processes they exhibit. It was eating road kill that clouded the overall ambience..."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"I don't care what you say about L.A., South Florida (the east coast) is its own uniquely twisted universe. Other than the late Charles Willeford, no one captures this more accurately, vividly and hilariously than Carl Hiaasen. \\"Stormy Weather\\", written in 1995, is the zanier side of the truly horrific Hurricane Andrew, a vicious satire of the darker side of my beloved Sunshine State, a poke in the eye of the public servants and developers who built a world of match-stick homes and those who sough to profit from it. As we all know, \\"Andy\\" unceremoniously turned over a large \\"rock\\" called Dade County (now Miami-Dade) from under which and toward which all manner of predatory, unsavory, corrupt and colorful creatures, masquerading as humans, scurried and hurried in the thousands looking to pull the brass ring of easy money from a shocked and traumatized citizenry.Hiaasen's cast of folks in this novel is one of his better and more memorable ensembles. A semi-feral, road-kill-eating, swamp-dwelling, poison toad sweat (\\"raw DMT\\") smoking, Henry Miller-quoting ex-governor of the State known as \\"captain\\", a sexy brunette down on her luck from an unsuccessful campaign to seduce and blackmail a Kennedy clan member, a crooked-jawed, ex-con \\"Poster Boy for TMJ\\" named \\"Snapper\\", an obnoxious and obsessed advertising exec and his new bride caught up in the \\"adventure\\" of the hurricane disaster, a skull juggling ex-law student, two needy and yapping miniature dachshunds named \\"Donald and Marla,\\" an Asian scorpion named \\"Mortimer,\\" and other perfectly-believeable supporting characters of various eccentric and fetching attributes, come together by various twists of coincidence to turn a botched insurance scam, a bizarre abduction and natural catastrophe into high adventure and scathing satire at every turn.This is an irreverent, deftly imagined and executed novel, full of good writing, great dialog and sustained movement. If you want to know how to put a novel together seamlessly (as well as enjoy a great read), \\"Stormy Weather\\" fills the bill. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"One of Hiaasen's best yet.

Couldn't stop reading it until I had finished the novel, chuckling all the way."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"The narrative of Stormy Weather unfolds like a soap opera on LSD. In it, Carl Hiaasen skillfully interweaves several plot threads each riotously funny in its own right.With a hurricane ravaged Miami as backdrop, the author uses a large cast of colorfully bizarre characters to expertly lampoon life in South Florida.Found among the many subplots are the following:While on his honeymoon, New York ad man Max Lamb is abducted. Not by space aliens but by a scary hermit called Skink, who happens to be a former Florida governor.As she searches for her missing husband, Bonnie, Max's bride, meets and becomes attracted to Augustine Herrera. Augustine is one of the book's more normal characters. That is if you overlook the fact he enjoys juggling human skulls for relaxation.Two hapless con artists named Edie and Snapper take up residence in a stranger's hurricane damaged house with plans to collect the sizable insurance payoff.A corrupt building inspector named Avila is a devoted follower of Chango, a santeria god who seems to require increasingly exotic species of animals for sacrifice.And there's much, much more.Stormy Weather is great satire. Filled with the most outrageous dark humor imaginable, it just drips with cynicism. Another outstanding comic novel from the warped but nimble mind of Carl Hiaasen."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"I mean, I can't really give one of his books 5 stars, because somehow I think that accolade ought to be reserved for serious literary achievements, like Kavalier and Clay or Atonement. But, really, I love Hiaasen and just can't resist reading everything he writes. He's wacky, loony, impious, a total lunatic. I went to a book signing when Basket Case was released, and he's just as funny in person as he is on the printed page.Hiaasen is a full-speed ahead man when it comes to the use of similies; being a fellow author and a simile-lover myself, I treasure his gems and wish I could come up with even half as many that were as good as all of his, things like: 'She looked about as Latin as Goldie Hawn,' 'he blinked like a sleepy porch lizard,' ' he scratched at his Old Testament tattoos,' and 'he had about as much charisma as a bowl of cold oatmeal.'You gotta love it!"},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"Wacky characters with bizarre plots and twists of fate...and all with a moral.

The book recounts the fictional exploits of the depraved and zany in the aftermath of South Florida's worst recent hurricane. Hiaasen is able to capure the utter shambles that one's life becomes in the wake of the storm, but does so with incredible artistry and and humor that has become a Hiaasen trademark.

Stormy Weather's new characters - especially the women - combine extravagent avarice, self-interest and imagination in a way that's worryingly plausible and familiar - likeable even.Wet weather,dry humour."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"If a hurricane doesn't do enough damage, the human scum that grows on the surface of the resulting troubles will make it infinitely worse. Carl Hiaasen covers his disgust for such low lifes with this offbeat comic novel about what happens after the hurricane of the century roars through Florida just south of Miami.Storms bring out the best and the worst in people. If that intrigues you, this is your novel. If it disgusts you to think about how low people can stoop to take advantage of one another, skip this book.I normally love Carl Hiaasen's books, but this one was too dark for me.The book opens as a young couple is spending their honeymoon at Disney World. Already bored, the husband is excited about seeing the aftermath of the storm and talks his wife into heading to Miami. Once there, he pokes his video camera into everyone's misery and looks forward to sharing what he saw with his friends back in Manhattan. His new wife isn't so sure she's thrilled by what's going on.Then all of a sudden, it goes wrong. A small creature grabs the camera, the husband follows . . . and the comic tale begins.The book looks deeply into false sales practices for homes and mobile homes, fraud among building inspectors, crooked roof repairmen, political payoffs, crooked insurance adjusters, scam artists who prey on those who are suffering, robbers and looters. I felt overwhelmed by all of that corruption.There's a lot of violence in this book, of the most macabre sort. That also darkens the mood.Fortunately, Mr. Hiaasen leaves a little room for redemption. The new wife begins to see how she could improve her life and takes steps to do so. An environmentalist loves to see the storm's beauty and hopes that it will encourage people to leave Florida (that's a vain hope!). A lonely man finds love in a most unexpected way.Through satirical slaps at human nature, a few more of the guilty escape their just rewards . . . but do bear a few scars in the process.If you like to see criminals receive harsh treatment, this book has one of the most unusual punishments you can imagine in it.After you have finished enjoying the book (if that's how you experience it), I hope you will think about how you can protect your family and yourself from the corrupt practices that may be going on around you."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"I always enjoy Carl Hiaasen's books, and I always forget them about ten minutes after finishing. About halfway through this book I realized I had read it before, and it's not the first time that's happened with a Hiassen book. Anyway, this is a rambling tale full of nefarious characters. The fun comes mostly from the ways in which they get their comeuppance (or don't, a few get better than they deserve in the end).The story involves the wreckage left by a massive hurricane hitting Florida, and criminals who arrive to rip off the desperate families trying to recover afterwards, and the corrupt contractors and building inspectors responsible for many of the homes fairing so poorly in the storm. A semi-legal zoo is destroyed by the storm, releasing wild animals into the community (thus the monkey on the book jacket), and the scenes with these animals are, to me, the funniest in the book."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"His quirky characters remind me of Elmore Leonard (that's a GOOD thing). It gets a bit confusing sometimes, jumping from character to character, but overall, it serves up an enjoyable story."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"Certainly readable and entertaining, but falls below the usualstandard - not crazy enough, and too predictable. Plus, thehurricane itself barely makes an appearance. I hope that Hiassenputs a little more meat into the next pot-boiler."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"&quot;Stormy Weather&quot; is just plain wacky. Carl Hiaasen deftly casts a diverse group of characters whose only common bond is being in post-hurricane ravaged Florida. But this bond inescapably links these characters in a land of moral destitution and the book details their life changing and in some cases life ending experiences.This book walks the fine line between zany and bizarre; going just far enough to test the even the limits of fiction without going as far as insult. It keeps you laughing throughout the outlandish journey.I don't think I could stomach a steady diet of Hiaasen tales, but it hits the spot for those looking for a lite but entertaining snack. A very good story and inventive fiction.I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"In this comic mystery novel, Carl Hiaasen has created a cast of zany characters whose paths cross in the aftermath of a devastating Florida hurricane. Hiaasen masterfully blends a sharp wit with hints of social criticism in a writing style that is truly distinctive. As a Florida resident, I am most impressed with Hiaasen's ability to capture the essence of Florida's unique \\"culture\\" in his writing. Not to mention the crazy characters he creates and the wild situations in which he places them makes for some highly entertaining reading!"},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"Stormy Weather is right on par with the rest of Hiaasen&#8217;s works of Southwest Florida. As very-realistic fiction it can sometimes be difficult to determine whether the events taking place could actually have occurred or not. But, then sadly, the reader is returned is returned to the ever-present fact that these stories are completely fictional and could never occurred as the characters do something absolutely irrational. This is true of many Hiaasen novels and Stormy Weather is none the different, however it is not as prevalent in this novel as in say, Native Tongue, or Tourist Season, making this book slightly more readable than its predecessors.The redeeming factors of this book are of course the subject material. Set in the after-math of a nameless hurricane (though an astute reader will not the date of publication as following Andrew, as well as the author thanking Hugo, Donna and Andrew, among others), the book centers around a few con-artists trying to make a quick buck scamming insurance agencies and what-used-to-be-home owners in their frantic disheveled states of mind. Also thrown into the mix are a newlywed couple, the husband of which drives down to Miami to videotape the carnage for profit and is kidnapped by Skink (a returning character from previous books), a former governor who now chooses to live among the mangroves and . When his better half becomes disgusted with his behavior she is not so frightened by the situation as she falls in love with a local man who juggles human skulls for entertainment. Also returning from previous Hiaasen works is the character of FHP trooper, Jim Tile. Mix all these elements together with the massive corruption running rampant in South Florida&#8217;s government structures, a couple of prostitutes, the melee of African lions, Rhesus monkeys and other wild animals being set loose in post-Hurricane Miami, Santer&iacute;a deities along with a crucifixion and you have a formula for a fast-paced novel that will keep you flipping the pages.Why 4 stars?: I would have rated this book only a 3, but its redeeming factors include the return of Skink and the constant jumping between several different plot lines knowing that at one point they will meet up. However, the sex scenes and the comic violence begin to get a little wearing on me. This book is just as funny as any other Hiaasen book and fans will appreciate it, but it is definitely not for everybody."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"I was just introduced to Hiaasen's books this year when I finally bought Sick Puppy after much prodding from several people. I absolutely adored Sick Puppy and purchased Stormy Weather because I heard that the character of Skink also appeared in that book. While I enjoyed the Stormy Weather, it didn't impress me on the same level as Sick Puppy and it took me much longer to finish this book--it just didn't grab me. Skink is still one of the wackiest and coolest characters around and I hope to read more of his exploits some day. But the other characters in Stormy Weather just weren't people I cared to read about. Plus one of the things I loved about Sick Puppy is that it made me laugh out loud and I don't know that I laughed once during Stormy Weather (and perhaps it wasn't intended to be humorous). I would still take a chance on other Hiassen books, but I probably won't do so without strong recommendations from people I know."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"Hiassen has done it again! I'm in love with all of his books, even though I'm a bonafide thriller slut. I always laugh out loud, usually with tears rolling down my face when reading his stories. His characters are one of a kind. Where else can you read about a roadkill-eating ex-governor with a glass eye who licks deadly frogs to catch a buzz? I highly recommend this book, especially if you're down in the dumps and need a good chuckle."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"There are restaurants I go to and order whatever the 'Special' is because I know it will be the best thing available. It is the same for me with Mr. Hiaasen and his books; I have never read one I did not thoroughly enjoy, and this is simply the next fun one."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"I have read most of Carl Hiassen's books. Some are more entertaining than others. This one was ok. My favourite is still Sick Puppy."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"Nobody Beats Hiaasen for stories about Florida's overpopulation and endangered wildlife! Carl manages to keep all the characters central to the conclusion of the book which is quite a feat considering how many personalities are involved!"},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"It's particularly fun reading this book when you know southern Florida and the Keys. Truly classic characters. Very enjoyable book."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"The story was great to read interesting, comical, and eye opening. I really enjoyed reading it. Would have given it 5 stars but sometimes it would get confusing because it has so many characters. But every character is interesting and colorful."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"I've read almost every Hiassen book I could get my hands on, after my initiation with what I still think is Hiassen's top masterpiece of satire: \\"Skin Tight\\"Skin Tightand not one has disappointed.But in \\"Stormy Weather\\" Hiassen absolutely outdid himself with 1. his villain Snapper, and Snapper's fate in the end. 2. The relentless hilarity of the scenes at the hurricane site featuring Snapper and Edie, and 3. in the way he painted his female protagonist Edie...She is top contender for 1st prize in Hiassen's gallery of the 'lovable \\"bad girl\\" Her \\"type\\" is very effectively delivered to us in many of his other tales--this girl IS bad...she'll do just about anything it takes to get rich and famous..BUT she draws some lines in selling her soul, and when she joins the ranks of female vigilantes, and turns on her villain pals, look out! In this book's cool ex of this Hiassen signature plot twist, Edie's pal Snapper makes the huge mistake of trying to ride THIS vamp! Cause the designing girl may forgive and collude with the crooks for money, but cuts them into little pieces and feeds them to the crocodiles when they foolishly try to con her in a pathetic male predator sally driven by their grandiose ego! (another fave ex of this female 'antiheroine' is found in Skinny Dip\\"Skinny Dip) Edie is the Queen of these designing babes turned heroines! This book is a very good Hiassen meal!"},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"Stormy Weather was the first Hiaasen novel I read. I picked up a paperback copy at a remainder sale. Never heard the name of the guy and didn't expect much; but it was cheap, and so...Boy, was I wrong! Since then I have made sure that I read every Hiaasen in and out of print, and I'm about to catch up on some of his real old stuff. His writings opened up the world of the writers and the universe of that nook of America called 'Florida', which is about as whacky and demented as it comes. Actually, I've _been_ to Florida, though not down to the Keys; but it's amazing what you miss when you basically just pass through or dip in and out of it. No wonder Piers Anthony used it as the setting for a bunch his, firmly tongue-in-cheek, fantasy novels.Stormy Weather, to get back to the subject, piled on charcaters I'll never be likely to forget, from the skull-juggling Augustine to the simply impossible 'Skink'. A never-ending litany of ascerbically presented character sketches and Hiaasen's usual--entirely justified!--tirade and caricature of venal politicians, environmental rape and greed; plus some truly and honestly _stupid_ people.Fun and games and I never looked back. There are other 'Florida' writers I've come to like, especially James Hall and Laurence Shames. Depending on my mood, I sometimes like them better than Hiaasen, especially Laurence Shames. All three of them offer different perspectives on life in and beyond that strange place called 'Florida'. As I said, it depends on my mood. Hiaasen usually ends up at the top when I'm in a 'South Park' disposition; needing satire with heart. And I need some more of that now and soon and please!Till Noever, owlglass.com"},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"I guess Hiaasen's works do seem to sound alike; this one even appears to be a sort of sequel to &quot;Strip Tease&quot; as it includes the eccentric ex-governor Skink and his devoted State trouper pal Jim Tile, who are featured in that novel. Knowing this, however, I was looking for something with some bite to make me laugh and once again Hiaasen didn't disappoint me.The plot of &quot;Stormy Weather&quot; thoroughly lambasts developers, real estate and mobile home salesmen, and the governmental agencies that exist to &quot;regulate&quot; them. Hiassen is entirely cynical and savage in his depiction, which spares no group in its scathing satire. Ex-governor &quot;Skink&quot; again serves as the noble savage committed to a Quixotic effort to avenge trepidations against nature and basic human decency.Once you have read a few of Hiaasen's works, the initial shock value is diminished. Nonetheless this made me repeatedly laugh out loud, at one point in uncontrollable giggles.This isn't great literature, but if you have a sardonic sense of humor and want to be entertained, this is ideal. A perfect plane, beach, single dining in a restaurant book."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"I was introduced to this book two weeks before my finals for my degree. Needless to say I ignored it completely. For all of two minutes. A brief synopsis of the plot was all I needed to be intrigued and, without thought to the consequences, I plunged into the sordid, hilarious tale. I am pleased to have read it, although I would reccommend reading it at a less fraught time than I did, but do read it.Incidentally, if anyone cares, I actually passed the exams. Stormy Weather possibly prepared me better for tackling the philosophies of Jean-Paul Sartre than an evening of Nausea (La Naus&eacute;e) and Words (Les Mots) would have done."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"Do you like \\"crazy\\" in your books? Carl Hiaasen is one of a select company of writers that dishes up \\"crazy\\" all the way. The setting forStormy Weatheris southern Florida immediately after a devastating hurricane. Entire neighborhoods are wrecked, in some cases due to reckless disregard of building codes. Looters, rubberneckers and opportunists are drawn to Dade County in droves, showing the worst in human nature--but so hilariously.Hiaasen's cast of characters are all outrageous in one way or another, and their stories inevitably intersect:* Max and Bonnie Lamb, honeymooners from New York; their young marriage goes off the rails when Max is abducted while avidly making vacation videos of the destruction.* Skink, a one-eyed ex-governor of Florida who got offside with developers, quit his job, and went troppo; Skink abducts Max because he was outraged by the ad man's voyeurism.* Augustine Herrera, a skull-juggling coma survivor searching for his uncle's escaped exotic animal collection, rescues the stranded Bonnie Lamb and wins her over with his rough charm.* Snapper and Edie, a couple of grifters teaming up to commit insurance fraud, pick the wrong scammer to scam; their plan escalates wildly out of control, as you know from the beginning it will.* A spectacularly corrupt building inspector trying to do \\"damage control\\" by sacrificing animals to the Santeria god Chango; Avila is gored by a reluctant goat and later reinvents himself as a Cuban \\"rafter.\\"The action takes place in hotels and roofless houses, in a remote bivouac in the Keys, and in the post-apocalyptic city streets and highways. The characters inflict outrageous damage on each other, but in the end most of the \\"good guys\\" go on to rebuild new and better lives, while the \\"bad guys\\" come to fitting ends.Hiaasen has a killingly funny way of delivering wry, sarcastic paragraphs that cut to the quick of human nature. I listened to the audio, narrated by George Wilson whose gravelly rendition amped up the acerbic humor with every intonation. Read or listen, your choice, but if you like the work of Christopher Moore, Douglas Adams, or Kurt Vonnegut, you'll probably love this book. I certainly did.Linda Bulger, 2010"},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"I have read sooo many of his books, as he is my FAVORITE author. I am from the Florida Keys, which I am sure has a lot to do with my love of his writing. This is the one that ALWAYS stands out as the BEST. Its a MUST READ for Hiaasen lovers and newcomers alike. I have had to purchase this book more than once because I keep lending it out and that person lends it out to the next and poof! it's gone! I can read this book over and over still laugh out loud!"},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"I seldom find a book, much less an author, that I can't put down. Carl's plots and wacky characters make for great, fun, light reading that barrels along it's crooked path. I've become a real fan and highly recommend if you have a demented sense of humor and justice."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"As a hurricane hurtles through Florida, a handful of unusual people react in peculiar ways. Honeymooning Max Lamb eagerly videotapes the wreckage but is soon kidnapped by a reclusive ex-governor called Skink. Meanwhile two hustlers try to stage an insurance scam, and Max's new wife hunts for him with the help of a millionaire who juggles skulls. Book contains strong language, some violence, and some explicit descriptions of an adult nature. Even with all that, this is a humors tale with a strange sense of justice."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"Once again, Hiassen proves he is an amazing writer. Most thrillers need an intricate story to propel them forward to keep a reader turning pages.Hiaasen's story is rather straightforward, local Floridians dealing with the aftermath of a hurricane and the assorted riff-raff that arrives to separate them from their money.In the hands of another writer, it could have been very so-so. But Hiaasen's little nuances, excellent characterizations and dead-on dialog are almost guaranteed to keep readers laughing, guessing, and turning pages.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"Carl Hiaasen has delighted readers by skewering Florida institutions ranging from trophy bass tournaments to televangelism to cosmetic surgery. It is a killer hurricane that is the unlikely backdrop for \\"Stormy Weather\\". A host of talented writers - Dave Barry and Tim Dorsey among the best - feast on the seemingly endless stream of absurdity provided by Florida's uniquely bizarre mix of rednecks, lowlifes, shysters, snowbirds, and corrupt politicians. But none succeed in capturing Florida with the biting irony and black humor that Carl Hiaasen brings to the pages. \\"Stormy Weather\\" is another outstanding example of social satire at its best: the insufferably shallow New York advertising man, the terminally corrupt Miami code inspector, the low-life con artist and her criminal sidekick, the sleazy mobile-home salesman and his cheating wife. Back from Hiaasen's \\"Double Whammy\\" is the aberrant but lovable road-kill eating, swamp-loving \\"Skink\\", and black state trooper Jim Tile, as close to normal as one will find in a Hiaasen novel. Even the \\"hero\\" is wacky - a human skull-juggling proprietor of an exotic wildlife exhibit. In the wake of a massively destructive hurricane, \\"Stormy Weather\\" chronicles the fictional - but highly plausible - descent of the swindlers, scammers, and criminals to prey on the victims of the storm. If Hiaasen's usual complement of oddball characters is not enough, the cast is supplemented with packs of storm-liberated wild animals prowling the Miami suburbia. Hiaasen's brilliant expose of the dark side of human nature is never preachy, but whose caustic humor leaves the reader alternating between knowing grins and out-loud guffaws. In anticipation of the author's inevitably unique forms of justice that will be meted out to the miscreants, the pages fly. In part poignant, biting, bawdy but always funny, \\"Stormy Weather\\" is another fine example of Hiaasen's literary wit."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"dear sirs,excuse me, but why haven't you posted my review of Carl Hiaasen's Stormy Weather. I submitted it over a week ago.thank you,arik berglund (auggiebjorn@aol.com)"},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"One of the most enjoyable books I have read in quite some time.Hiaasen has taken an amazing cast of characters and woven them into a plot line that keeps you guessing and laughing at the same time. I was hooked after about 5 pages and couldn't put the book down. This was the first book by Hiaasen that i've read, but certainly not the last."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"One the seemingly ubiquitous South Florida crimeish writer set, Hiassen isn't too shabby. The idea for this book seems to have been to think up a bunch of characters (some quirky, some not), a bunch of odd situations occurring in the aftermath of a hurricane, and try and weave them all together. My favorite character died early on though, and some others were a tad too implausible for my taste. I would call it a crime book since most of the action seems to revolve around criminals and schemers trying to make money off the aftermath of the hurricane, and those in their way. Not a bad beach read, but not exactly challenging."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"This author was suggested to me because Hiaasen was supposed to be funny. To be fair it's probably rated poorly by me because it was very different than the stories I usually read. It had it's moments and it did keep me curious to end it.It wasn't very funny and it lacked substance. What was the point of everything?"},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"OK, so it's a readable story and I cracked the occasional wry grin at some of the bizarre scenarios, but where are the belly laughs that the hype promised me? Perhaps it's a cultural thing and Hiaasen's humour doesn't cross the Atlantic very well? The book seemed to be packed full of in-jokes that only Americans will understand and it made me feel like my friends were talking about a party to which I wasn't invited. Sorry, but for satire and a good laugh, give me a Tom Sharpe book any day!"},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"This book has an any thing goes idea to it.

Some parts got a little slow but I had my share of laughs. I would recamend this book to any one."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"Having read and enjoyed the author's young adult book Hoot, and looking for a light adult read, I picked up this book which has the reputation of being funny and light. Frankly, it was both of those things, but within a hundred pages, it became eminently easy to put down. I enjoy a diversion reading book periodically, and have some adult writers that meet those needs, Thomas Perry and Harold Adams to name two. This one didn't make it for me. It seemed to be a lot of: given a hurricane, one darn thing after another for a group of characters I didn't care enough about to see if they ever got tied together."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"Hiassen definitely has a knack for character development . He doesn't simply develop his characters, he paints them with so much detail, I could almost palpate their pulses. This book was more if a great ride than just a great read. Well paced and funny.

THe working out is more than half the fun. THis one isnt a good as Sick Puppy or Skinny Dip but still great fun."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"Carl Hiaasen's books fall largely in the domain of \\"if you've read one of them, you've read them all\\". This is especially true of the characterizations, but thankfully not the wacky story lines. And Hiaasen has a hiliarious way with words, which can sometimes be rather vulgar (yes, some folks might be offended).In Stormy Weather we have greedy out-of-towners and locals trying to make a fast buck after a hurricane wipes out half of Miami. Of course these folks are violent, crude, and more often than not do not get their way due to hilarious mishaps. Hiaasen is well-known for his hatred of crooked politicians, racists, polluters, and big business. And in Stormy Weather all these elements suffer rather badly, to no surprise.Bottom line: while it doesn't hold a candle to his classics (Skin Tight, Strip Tease), Stormy Weather stands firmly among Hiaasen's better works. Recommended."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"It's never very sunny in Hiaasen's Florida. But in this novel the post-hurricane landscape is littered with &quot;broken trees and utility poles, heaps of lumber and twisted metal,&quot; to say nothing of &quot;a typewriter and a tangle of golf clubs and a cedar hot tub, split in half like a coconut husk.&quot; No surprise, then, that the tempest has also shaken loose a platoon of the author's wackiest characters.Chief among them is Skink, the one-eyed former governor who appeared in two previous Hiaasen books. Energized by the storm (which he spends tied to a bridge), Skink emerges from the Everglades to kidnap one of Dade County's more offensive tourists, a honeymooning New York ad exec.Nearby, a nasty ex-con has joined forces with a gorgeous con artist in a plot to steal somebody else's home insurance. (This is not, to her credit, Edie Marsh's first choice for making money. She has spent the last six months in Palm Beach trying to sleep with a Kennedy.)It says a lot about Hiaasen's view of humanity that his most likable character is a guy with the &quot;perhaps unwholesomely exhilarating&quot; hobby of juggling human skulls. By book's end, our hero will add to his collection--but not before Hiaasen drags in a runaway bride, some storm-addled monkeys and a roof inspector who has never been known to climb a ladder.The author, a Miami Herald columnist whose book, Striptease, was made into a movie starring Demi Moore and Burt Reynolds, provides his characteristic incongruously happy ending. Despite Hiaasen's crusading tone (a Florida native, he sees evil lurking in the heart of every developer) and deadpan style (&quot;The death of Tony Torres did not go unnoticed by homicide detectives, crucifixions being rare even in Miami&quot;), there's something gently romantic about his writing.Raucous, scathing but never mean-spirited, Stormy Weather goes a long way toward securing Hiaasen's place as America's premier satirist."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"Few books have the comedic strength to make a reader laugh out loud. Kurt Vonnegut's &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot; is one, and Carl Hiassen's &quot;Stormy Weather&quot; is another.Powerful, lasting humor exists in the truth between the laughs. Both Vonnegut and Hiassen have the ability to hold up a mirror to our oftentimes jaded and opportunistic society; a mirror that reflects so brilliantly and accurately that we cannot help but laugh, and laugh hard.There are passages, images in this book that send me into giggles even now, a year after I closed the cover on this book.Hiassen is an astute, often hilariously angry observer that believes that human beings are capable of far better things than our everyday, moneygrubbing actions may indicate. Beneath Hiassen's social skepticism, there is a love for both Mother Nature, and the compassionate humanity that binds us uniquely together."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"I'm an environmentalist on the basis that I like clean air, water, etc., as opposed to being a watermelon environmentalist: green on the outside, communist red on the inside.I like Carl Hiaasen's books because the environmental message isn't preachy. Instead, he simply writes hysterically funny stories about the assorted unfortunate (and self-inflicted) fates of people who show up make a quick buck on Florida, at the cost of Florida.This book is a hilarious romp through post-Andrew South Florida. The bottom line is that hurricanes are nature's way of saying \\"Don't build here!\\" and people who move to South Florida to buy shoddily-constructed, never-inspected houses are simply getting what they deserve.Of course, not everyone is a dupe or a huckster. There are some actual decent people in his books, and their sterling qualities are the perfect foil for the dupes and hucksters that constitute the rest of local humanity.Hiaasen's genius is in his caricatures and how he plays them off against each other.Great book."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"I tend to read more 'highbrow literature' than beach books, and when I descend a tier or two, I usually find myself reading Elmore Leonard and Douglas Adams novels, which in my opinion, are a more than decent bridge between Haute Reading and Hedonistic Reading. (As an aside, I honestly can't think of any author who writes better dialogue than Leonard since Shakespeare.)However, I have discovered a third author (Hiaasen) to match Leonard and Adams, and now have a triumvirate of authors to bring with me on future vacations. I guess my discovery is a little late in the making, but two things have prevented me from reading Hiaasen in the past. Number one was the film &quot;Striptease.&quot; Number two was the marketing of Hiaasen's stories; someone at Knopf is convinced that Hiaasen's books should be packaged to resemble Caprisun drinks, and I have always, unfortunately, judged his books by their covers.&quot;Stormy Weather&quot; was my first Hiaasen read, and I'm not sure storytelling gets any better than this. One of the knocks against Hiaasen is that his characters are a little TOO zany; that the plots are too muddled with unbelievability. However, if I wanted to experience stories that are as 'real' as life itself, I would just go down to the grocery store and study the air-conditioned ennui of shoppers picking through the produce section.Hiaasen is a highly-intelligent humorist; indeed, as some have dubbed him, &quot;the Twain of the crime novel.&quot; He owns Florida's culture and underbelly unlike any other author, and he makes you believe that his Florida, in fact, IS Florida: a phallic-shaped, theme-park kingdom filled with Captain Ahab-like former governors roaming the Everglades; hideously-deformed malcontents who ne'er think twice of taking human life; insipid insurance and motor homes salesmen; busty, brainy vixens; and the occasional skull-juggling gentleman of independent means.His language is simple and easy-going, but the occasional reference to T.S. Eliot and Henry Miller lets the intelligent reader know there's a solid backbone beneath the pliant, palm tree prose.Stormy Weather itself is entertaining, but at the same time environmentally thought-provoking. And Hiaasen's character Skink (whom he brings back in later books) is his own personal vigilante. It is sad to think that Florida, such a beautiful state at one time, has become a Plastic Flamingo. And nothing can probably be done to stop, or even stunt, its destruction by human greed. But Skink does what he can, and so does his Creator.A great read; indeed, an imperative read for anyone interested in contemporary storytelling."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"This is the first of Hiaasen's book I read and it is enjoyable and fun,nothing serious or dark.A hurricane has torn across South Florida tearing up many homes and businesses while leaving many others unscathed. Some owners of homes and businesses are lucky, others are not. Crews from out of state, too many of these crews are incompetent and not to be trusted, come to South Florida hoping to get rich by repairing what is broken and there is much, houses missing roofs, walls tumbled down, windows smashed, interiors soaking and ruined.Vacations are ruined for many. One young couple, honeymooners, the husband wants to take videos of all the destruction in order to sell them The wife is against profiting against misery. Vicious animals have escaped from a wild animal farm and run wild killing people. Evil doers creep out of hiding determined to make more problems for the populations while attempting to cheat them plus make much money for themselves.One young man, who considers himself a big game hunter, angers a cape buffalo. The buffalo carries him around on one of his tusks. A strange way to go. Another bad guy is eaten by a lion. The owner of the animal farm doesn't know how to deal with these animals, this business has been left to him by an uncle who was bitten by a viper. The antics of the wild animals and the baddies is hysterical.It has been proven that a salesman of mobile homes has promised that these homes are safe and secure. Many senior citizens plus families bought these homnes to their horror. These people have lost everything. Some angry relatives are looking for fat Mr. Torres. He lied. His mobile homes are defective, but now are no more.A bad couple is trying to say that their home has been destroyed. The pair go looking for the largest, fanciest home they can find and declare themselves as owners. The woman is attractive but the man , nicknamed Snapper, because a lawman, Snapper is always in trouble with the law, broke his jaw. A doctor fixed it wrong leaving Snapper witha strangely aligned jaw which did nothing for his face.Avila is the inspector of the mobile home park. He could and should have gone to jail. He took money from contractors and very seldom went near these properties. He's in trouble so becomes involved in the Santeria religion and the god Chango which he feels will save him. He buys sacrificial animals. These animals don't want to be sacrificed so they take it out on Avila. The animals win. Avila has some loud women realtives in his life. They yell and curse at him especially his wife and mother-in-law.Skink comes across as a baddy. He has a glass eye which he enjoys taking out to horrify everyone. He kidnaps Max and puts a dog choke collar on him and leads him through the Everglades for several days. Skink was the governor of Florida but not for long. His way of governing was pretty far out. He hates the way his state is being treated by tourists and contractors. There is too much building and taking over by outsiders. Skink is a wild man, different, but in his own way good and good hearted. Max is just someplace he has no business being.Augustine has shelves full of human skulls which he juggles at times, a different hobby. Edie's ambition is to have sex with a Kennedy heir so she can extort money from that wealthy family. Snapper is truly evil.This is a raunchy, wild fun bunch, both human and animal. But fun to read. For a good escape plus a lot of laughs read the book.Plus the author sees to it that all evil doers get their just deserts. He writes like the journalist he once was."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"The cast of characters in this book are so odd and out there, I found myself wondering how the heck Carl was going to put them all together. The crazy one-eyed Everglades living former Governor, the skull juggling lost son, a maniac who is little more evil than Manson, a hot trailerpark chick who knows her only asset is her body and a newlywed who thinks about his job more than his new wife? Three-quarters into this book I couldn't figure out how they would all tie in together and how it would resolve. The storyline was wildly engaging and I must admit, I didn't like the ending but overall it was a fun ride. I enjoyed it enough to try another one of his books."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"A breezy read. Similar in tone to Elmore Leonard (one of my favorite \\"beach read\\" authors). Trippy, unpredictable plot, except that you know the bad guys are going to get it in the end. The question is: How?"},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"I love all of Carl Hiaison's books. Partly because he writes about the Florida I live in and love, even with all its quirks and crooks. His sense of humor matches mine so am always amused by the characters he writes about. Would it be so that we ever had a Governor with ethics such as Skink! The hurricane and the aftermath is much the same as Hurricane Andrew, when every cockroach from Florida and reprobates from other states came for the picking of anything they could get. Skink had the right idea. Even if you don't live in Florida, I think you will like this book and be able to compare it somewhat to where ever you live."},{"Title":"Stormy Weather","review":"THE SETUPA hurricane devastates South Florida.. Newlywed tourists Max and Bernie Lamb drive down from Disney World, because Max is obsessed with making home movies of the damage and devastation. Eddie Marsh who has been trolling for Kennedys in Palm Beach, teams up with ex-con Snapper (aka Lester Madox Parsons), to pull an insurance con. That's the setup.THE OTHER MAJOR CHARACTERSAvila - a former (crooked, of that's not a redundancy) Dade County building inspectorTony Torres - a crooked house trailer salesmanSkink (do not confuse with \\"Snapper\\") -aka Clinton Tyree - recluse ex-governor of FloridaJim Tile - a Florida Highway Patrolman, and friend of SkinkBrenda Roarke - policewoman, Jim Tile's girlfriendAugustine - an insurance-settlement-wealthy semi-retired guy, somewhat a young version of Skink.Ira Jackson - a NYC thug who had purchased a house trailer for his mother (killed in the storm) from Tony TorresFred Dove - property insurance adjuster, seduced by Eddie Marsh.HISTORICAL BACKGROUND\\"Stormy Weather\\" fairly accurately describes South Florida in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew in 1992--with the exception that the chaos and desperation are understated. Simply driving to friends or relatives (or trying to return home) was no easy matter with major highways full of trees, downed live electric lines, and no traffic lights. Whole subdivisions were inaccessible to ice-trucks and other relief when it finally came. The incredibly oppressive heat and humidity after the storm, for weeks without electricity are not described. For the few lucky who had generators, gasoline was hard to find, because the local gas stations were closed for lack of electricity to run the pumps. Dozens of fires were caused by overheated generators and many other deaths by related accidents. Much of the county was without water. As for the people, it's a numbers game, with a population of 5 million, there has to be (and are) thousands as insane as the characters in \\"Stormy Weather\\", and like California, South Florida has way more than its fair share of crazies.CAVEATS\\"Stormy Weather\\" is a slow roller-coaster ride--lacking clear buildup, climax, and resolution. Often slow--the end is welcome.\\"Stormy Weather\\" is not quite so surreal as most other adult Hiaasen novels, mostly because the real actual historic situation was surreal.VERDICTAn entertaining read, filled with bizarre characters."},{"Title":"Bottom Line Year Book 2006","review":"I obtained this book for a 30 day trial offer after receiving an invitation from Bottom Line. While some of the information is useful, much of it seems to be common knowledge or information available from reading other publications including financial, consumer and travel magazines and BottomLine Personal Magazine- or just by being a knowledgeable consumer. I thought that the flyer provided by Bottom Line trumpeting the amazing information was misleading to a sense. Example \\"say these magic words to get discount movie tickets- see page??\\" Turns out you can get a movie discount if you are a Senior- which I am NOT. In fact much of the information including the \\"freebies\\" is geared to seniors, in my case this was useless information. I also do not have kids or own a businesss-again stuff related to this is useless to me.Other information seems to be common sense- i.e bunching tax deductions, IRS audit triggers (i.e. don't forget to sign the return) using Costco to get the cheapest gasoline,(but you have to pay the membership fee) how to choose a good surgeon or dentist, car buying tips.If you don't normally read similar publications or don't consider yourself to be a knowledgeable investor or consumer, this may be a useful book. I will emphasize all of the \\"amazing\\" information implied by the advertising flyers that I get in the mail are not what they seem. If you are curious, consider ordering the book for the 30 day trial, noting what new useful information you can garner, and then sending it back after 30 days if you do not find it useful.

Washington called him the &quot;Poet Laureate of the Negro Race&quot;. Dunbar, the son of ex-slaves, grew up in Dayton, OH, where he was friendly with the Wright Brothers. He had a successful high school career--founding editor of the school paper and elected class president of the predominantly white school--but upon graduation, he was forced to work as an elevator operator. His second book of poetry was praised by William Dean Howells and by age 24, he was one of the most renowned Black literary figures in America.Dunbar wrote in two different styles. On the one hand, he wrote straightforward classic verse that was filled with racial pride:THE COLORED SOLDIERSIF the muse were mine to tempt it And my feeble voice were strong, If my tongue were trained to measures, I would sing a stirring song. I would sing a song heroic Of those noble sons of Ham, Of the gallant colored soldiers Who fought for Uncle Sam!In the early days you scorned them, And with many a flip and flout Said &quot;These battles are the white man's, And the whites will fight them out.&quot; Up the hills you fought and faltered, In the vales you strove and bled, While your ears still heard the thunder Of the foes' advancing tread.Then distress fell on the nation, And the flag was drooping low; Should the dust pollute your banner? No! the nation shouted, No! So when War, in savage triumph, Spread abroad his funeral pall-- Then you called the co]ored soldiers, And they answered to your call.And like hounds unleashed and eager For the life blood of the prey, Sprung they forth and bore them bravely In the thickest of the fray. And where'er the fight was hottest, Where the bullets fastest fell, There they pressed unblanched and fearless At the very mouth of hell.Ah, they rallied to the standard To uphold it by their might; None were stronger in the labors, None were braver in the fight. From the blazing breach of Wagner To the plains of Olustee, They were foremost in the fight Of the battles of the free.And at Pillow! God have mercy On the deeds committed there, An the souls of those poor victims Sent to Thee without a prayer. Let the fulness of Thy pity O'er the hot wrought spirits sway Of the gallant colored soldiers Who fell fighting on that day!Yes, the Blacks enjoy their freedom, And they won it dearly,too; For the life blood of their thousands Did the southern fields bedew. In the darkness of their bondage, In the depths of slavery's night, Their muskets flashed the dawning, And they fought their way to lightThey were comrades then and brothers, Are they more or less to-day? They were good to stop a bullet And to front the fearful fray. They were citizens and soldiers, When rebellion raised its head; And the traits that made them worthy,-- Ah! those virtues are not dead.They have shared your nightly vigils, They have shared your daily toil; And their blood with yours commingling Has enriched the Southern soil. They have met as fierce a foeman, And have been as brave and true.And their deeds shall find a record In the registry of Fame; For their blood has cleansed completely Every blot of Slavery's shame.So all honor and all glory To those noble sons of Ham-- The gallant colored soldiers Who fought for Uncle Sam!WE WEAR THE MASKWe wear the mask that grins and lies, It hides our cheeks and shades our eyes,-- This debt we pay to human guile; With torn and bleeding hearts we smile, And mouth with myriad subtleties.Why should the world be over-wise, In counting all our tears and sighs? Nay, let them only see us, while We wear the mask.We smile, but, O great Christ, our cries To thee from tortured souls arise. We sing, but oh the clay is vile Beneath our feet, and long the mile; But let the world dream other-wise, We wear the mask!But on the other hand, he was a master of dialect poems:AN ANTE-BELLUM SERMON.WE is gathahed hyeah, my brothahs, In dis howlin' wildaness, Fu' to speak some words of comfo't To each othah in distress. An' we chooses fu' ouah subjic' Dis--we 'll 'splain it by an' by; &quot;An' de Lawd said, 'Moses, Moses,' An' de man said, 'Hyeah am I.'&quot;Now ole Pher'oh, down in Egypt, Was de wuss man evah bo'n, An' he had de Hebrew chillun Down dah wukin' in his co'n; 'Twell de Lawd got tiahed o' his foolin', An' sez he: &quot;I 'll let him know-- Look hyeah, Moses, go tell Pher'oh Fu' to let dem chillun go.&quot;&quot;An' ef he refuse to do it, I will make him rue de houah,Fu' I 'll empty down on Egypt All de vials of my powah.&quot; Yes, he did--an' Pher'oh's ahmy Was n't wuth a ha'f a dime; Fu' de Lawd will he'p his chillun, You kin trust him evah time.An' yo' enemies may 'sail you In de back an' in de front; But de Lawd is all aroun' you, Fu' to ba' de battle's brunt.

But fu' feah some one mistakes me, I will pause right hyeah to say, Dat I 'm still a-preachin' ancient, I ain't talkin' 'bout to-day.But I tell you, fellah christuns, Things 'll happen mighty strange; Now, de Lawd done dis fu' Isrul, An' his ways don't nevah change, An' de love he showed to Isrul Was n't all on Isrul spent; Now don't run an' tell yo' mastahs Dat I 's preachin' discontent.'Cause I is n't; I 'se a-judgin' Bible people by deir ac's; I 'se a-givin' you de Scriptuah, I 'se a-handin' you de fac's. Cose ole Pher'oh b'lieved in slav'ry, But de Lawd he let him see, Dat de people he put bref in,-- Evah mothah's son was free.An' dahs othahs thinks lak Pher'oh, But dey calls de Scriptuah liar, Fu' de Bible says &quot;a servant Is a-worthy of his hire.&quot; An' you cain't git roun' nor thoo dat, An' you cain't git ovah it, Fu' whatevah place you git in, Dis hyeah Bible too 'll fit.So you see de Lawd's intention, Evah sence de worl' began, Was dat His almighty freedom Should belong to evah man, But I think it would be bettah, Ef I 'd pause agin to say, Dat I 'm talkin' 'bout ouah freedom In a Bibleistic way.But de Moses is a-comin', An' he 's comin', suah and fas' We kin hyeah his feet a-trompin', We kin hyeah his trumpit blas'. But I want to wa'n you people, Don't you git too brigity; An' don't you git to braggin' 'Bout dese things, you wait an' see.But when Moses wif his powah Comes an' sets us chillun free, We will praise de gracious Mastah Dat has gin us liberty; An' we 'll shout ouah halleluyahs, On dat mighty reck'nin' day, When we 'se reco'nised ez citiz'-- Huh uh! Chillun, let us pray!Inevitably, in a Reconstruction America that was both nostalgic and regionalist, his dialect poems were wildly popular &amp; tended to overshadow his more serious verse. As a result, he has always been a figure of some controversy in Black America; alternately dismissed for popularizing a derogatory stereotype of Blacks and hailed as a great literary figure. Dunbar captures this dichotomy in his own poem, The Poet:The PoetHe sang of life, serenely sweet, With , now ant then, a deeper note. From some high peak, nigh yet remote, He voiced the world's absorbing beat.He sang of love when earth was young, And Love, itself, was in his lays. But ah, the world, it turned to praise A jingle in a broken tongue.Given the perspective of 100 years, it seems to me that he deserves to be read by all Americans.GRADE: B+"},{"Title":"The Complete Poems of Paul Laurence Dunbar","review":"Dunbar's poetry is so good that it should be almost impossible to ruin a collection of his poems, yet somehow they've done it.Start with the table of contents and the index of first lines. The page numbers are apparently from an earlier edition of the book where the poems started on page 3. In the present edition, the poems begin on page 23, so the page numbers given start out 20 pages off. But each page contains a few extra lines, so that when you try to find the poem Sympathy (\\"I know what the caged bird feels, alas!\\") on page 102 and you think \\"well, let's add 20\\" and look on page 122, no, wrong again. It's on page 112. So if you need to find a certain poem, go to the page number they give you, read the name of a poem that is actually on that page, look that poem up in the index, and compare the page number given in the index with the page it is actually on. That will tell you approximately how many pages away your poem is. As another example, you will find We Wear The Mask on page 85, not page 71. (On the principle that even a stopped clock is right twice a day, the poems that appear on pages 184 to 186 actually are correct. Poems from page 187 on are on lower page numbers than the number given, until they are 4 pages off by the end of the book.)Typography? It appears to have been typed. With a typewriter. Remember typewriters? The titles of the poems are in capital letters, probably because typewriters didn't have boldface type. This compounds the pagination problem, because the titles do not stand out from the text. Sometimes the title of the poem is at the bottom of one page and the poem at the top of the next page.And they didn't bother to put the title of the book on the spine, so good luck finding it on a bookshelf.The phrase \\"High Quality\\" appears twice on the cover of this book. That's false advertising."},{"Title":"The Complete Poems of Paul Laurence Dunbar","review":"I have looked for this book of poems for a long time.

At times it was a struggle to read the poetry because the line breaks were so awkward. Page numbers are added INTO THE BODY OF THE POETRY ITSELF, smashed into the first word of a line. There are mistakes in the poetry due to either a poor OCR being used or because the editor wasn't paying attention.That makes me sad and mad; sad, because this poet has some truly wonderful things to say, and mad because I just expect a higher level of professionalism to be paid to our American authors and the words they've written.Truly, I'd give the author much higher marks, but I have to downgrade this edition as nearly unusable and quite unprofessional."},{"Title":"The Complete Poems of Paul Laurence Dunbar","review":"The poems of Paul Laurence Dunbar are classic and classy in nature.

I don't buy that.First, the good points: its introduction, scientific method coverage, population, community, and ecosystem ecology sections were very good. The scientific method coverage, in particular, took pains to define the scope of scientific discourse very precisely, and explicitly stated that other fields such as religion can also help us to know nature. I appreciated that.The community and ecosystem sections, in particular, seemed well-written. They didn't just state ideas; they described the studies that supported them and actively encouraged critical thinking about those studies and their results. In my class, we read those sections first, so I had high hopes for the textbook as a whole.The book covers a very broad set of topics, and some in surprisingly deep detail. It has a good index and glossary as well.Unfortunately, most of the book follows this pattern:Thing A performs function X. Thing B performs function Y. Thing C does Z. They fit together as A-B-C. See figure 8-23h.(repeat over and over, with different values of ABC, XYZ.)That is, very little explanation of why we believe this is the case, how we learned about it, how the scientific method was applied in the acquisition of this knowledge, or any disagreement among biologists as to the accuracy of the information. They did have very occasional sections on this, but entire chapters might be almost completely devoid of it. Almost never does the book cite its sources for facts either.As I was reading the chapters on cells -- which have amazingly intricate chemical properties spelled out -- I kept wondering: when and how did we manage to figure THIS out? It was almost never explained. It would have been so fascinating if it had been.Then there is the tendency to put out rather unsupportable statements, such as this little gem from page 595:\\"Composed of up to 100 billion intricately organized neurons, with a much larger number of supporting cells, the human brain is more powerful than the most sophisticated computer.\\" OK, thought-provoking, yes. But how can you scientifically evaluate the power of a computer and a brain on objective terms? I'm not sure I can evaluate the power of a computer on objective terms (the word \\"power\\" is just way too imprecise), let alone that of a brain. They cite no source of that, there is no discussion or background of it. It's just thrown out there, then discarded. I hate that. If you're going to say something that interesting, at least make a feeble attempt to back it up!They also have a habit of saying things are \\"almost always\\" true, such as on p. 383, where they say \\"Solar energy powers nearly all ecosystems.\\" But they rarely explain what the exceptions are, leaving you to wonder whether a given example is an exception or a rule. (OK, so it's more obvious here, but it happens elsewhere).They do have a number of helpful figures in the book, though they've probably gone overboard on the photos of athletes and things. Yes, muscles make us run. I get it already.This is an introductory textbook, so perhaps I am overly harsh here. But I've read other introductory textbooks that are more given to precise language, and don't have chapters that are just endless lists of definitions and functions, but explain how we got there. This book could have so easily been excellent."},{"Title":"Essential Biology with Physiology","review":"This is a good book for biology class - it had the CD and was in good shape.The book is easy to understand and relate to - IT is idenitcal to the UOP version that is required."},{"Title":"Essential Biology with Physiology","review":"Good educational book.

It has been a mystery until now. Dr. Joyce Henderson, author of the book Why African American Youth are Attracted to Non-Christian/Nontraditional Religions and Sects, gives us insight into some of the possible contributing factors. Henderson, who earned her doctorate degree in Ministry from Carolina University of Theology in 1997, has worked with children for thirty-two years at various Recreation Centers throughout the Los Angeles area. She has also held positions of instructor and Associate Pastor and is a Certified Marriage and Family Therapist.She conducted a study to determine the needs of Young African American youth. Twenty-eight mothers and 60 children between the ages of 5 through 19 were selected from congregations of several churches in the Watts and Compton area of Los Angeles. The interviews were conducted in the church schools, Church and home setting with or without the parents present.Now with that aside let's talk about the contents of the book. Written in ten chapters and beginning with the chapter on Methodology and ending with a Message to the Clergy and Church the book is very educational. Henderson devotes a chapter to explaining which religions are Christian and Non-Christian. The religions discussed here are Buddhism, Baha'I faith, Islamic, Jehovah Witness and Cults. Each of the religion's characteristics and beliefs are discussed along with the attractions for African American Youth. Most of the chapters contain written personal interviews with people of that particular faith or cult. Henderson's factual information on the different religions and practice was taken from newspaper clippings and interviews with the officials. She is objective in her writing and used the Holy Bible as a reference. She does not blame any religion as the cause but simply states the conclusion of her study and offers some suggestions.I enjoyed reading this book and would highly recommend it to Parents, Ministers, Sunday School Teachers, Youth Directors, and Communities. I now have a much better understanding of the many different religions and their attraction to African American youth.Reviewed by Dorothy Cooperwood"},{"Title":"Why African American Youth Are Attracted to Non-Christian/Non-Traditional Religions and Sects","review":"This book is truely a blessing to those who are interested in finding out why young African-American Youth are attracted to these religious sects. This book purports to study the causes that lead young African Americans from the Church into non-Christian groups.Included in the work are results from personal interviews, case studies and field surveys conducted by the author. A careful study of these non-Christian non-Traditional groups and sects enable us to view them in their variety and their different degrees of approach to genuine New Testament Christianity. Based upon the findings in the study, the author will suggest what local churches may do to better connect with this generation of youth and some positive steps towards evangelism. It is hoped that this book contributes to some understanding of non-Christians/non-Traditional religions and sects, help churches, parents and communities to prevent such a mass exodus, assist to reclaim and restore to us our prodigal sons and daughters to their rightful place as the children of God-in-Christ who have been granted life everlasting through the sacrifice for all of us by Jesus the Christ who paid our sins."},{"Title":"The Giving Marriage (Focus on the Family Marriage Series)","review":"Focus on the Family is the foremost Christian organization in the United States.

It definitely helped us to build a strong foundation and we would recommend this to any couple."},{"Title":"Portuguese (Brazilian) (Instant Conversation Portuguese (Brazillian))","review":"This audio only lanuguage tutorial is highly effective. The course is broken into sixteen 30 minute lessons. Each lesson gets progessivly more advanced moving from learning individual words, to phrases and finally complete sentences. I found the lesson length of 30 minutes ideal for learning on my commute to and from work each day. (It's not a good idea to drive an unfamiliar route while doing this course, you'll miss intersections!!)In addition to learning and repeating stock phrases you are challenged to put together phrases and sentences from words you have already learnt but in unique combinations not previously tried. This makes you 'think' about what you are going to say rather than repeat by rote. This mirrors what you'll be doing when communicating to someone on your travels. This approach is key to eventually 'thinking' in a foreign language.The pauses in the audio for you to respond can be rather short for the more unique and thought provoking phrases. As a beginner one still 'translates' before speaking. I'd like to see longer pauses for new material and shorter pauses for material you should know well. Pausing the CD manually is not appropriate while driving or doing some other activity.This course is a good primer and you will learn just enough to get around as a business visitor or tourist to Brazil. You will learn to count to 79, tell the time, ask basic questions about eating and drinking and locating hotels etc. It will not teach you enough to understand TV or radio or fast conversations. For that you will need to purchase Pimsleurs more extensive language program(s). I wish they had taught one to say 'talk more slowly please' in this course.This course gets you much further down the road of learning the language than the quick and simple version. I think this one is worth the extra bucks.I completed the course in about 20 days. At the age of 46 I am somewhat suprised I learnt the language so quickly - I was resigned to the fact that I was probably too old to learn a new language. Someone younger or sharper than I should be able to complete the course in 16 days or less. If I can learn Portuguese from this course so can you!!!It's a shame that a short phrase book is not included with the program, reading basic words is a requirement when visiting a foreign land. You will need to supplement this course with a phrase book. Note that it's important to complete this course before opening a phrase book. The sounds of the language are so different to what an English speaking person will expect from the written language, looking at the written word too early will encourage you to add a strong accent.I can thourougly recommend this course to anyone contemplating a trip to Brazil. In addition it's ideal if you are unsure if you want to fork out the money for the full course(s) and want to a trial run with this first. The full course(s) do include sections for reading Portuguese from provided words and phrases.5 Stars Pimsleur!! It works!!"},{"Title":"Portuguese (Brazilian) (Instant Conversation Portuguese (Brazillian))","review":"Unfortunately, in the Instant Conversation CD set the Pimsleur company duplicates the material contained in the Quick & Simple CD set.

But I did and I feel that I'm totally ready for my next trip to Brazil. I think this course is perfect for the vacationer that's traveling to Brazil. The 16-lesson series equips you with enough language to be sufficient for a short visit to Brazil. There is no substitute for hearing the corrrect pronounciation of words in the original dialect and that's one of the benefits of the course.My only issue with this method of learning is that you don't know how the words you're speaking look, which is important, because many of the words look nothing like they sound.

There is an international criminal court! And we Americans aren't supporting it! Now, is that because we Americans want to commit crimes and get away with them? The author of this article implies that it is. But I think it is more of a case of legitimate concerns that Americans and others would be accused of crimes by genuine criminals. And that the international criminal court would in fact support the thugs.Green claims that there is a valid concern that the ICC will be ineffective: its jurisdiction is limited to crimes committed either by a citizen or in the territory of a signatory state. The ICC could not prosecute leaders of non-signatory states. But Green points out that the United States could undo this flaw: this rule was put in to protect the United States in the first place.In addition, there is a risk of American servicemen being at risk of ICC prosecution. Green dismisses this on the grounds that we Americans could and would investigate such soldiers ourselves were they suspected of war crimes.I don't buy it.Let's look at an example of the international justice in action. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled on the Israeli separation barrier, even though its jurisdiction was seriously questioned, to say the least. So I figure the ICC could well rule against America even when it had no business even being involved. Not only that, the ICJ ruled against the barrier (in favor of the thugs who want that barrier removed so they can commit more murders!). That ruling opposes Israel's right to self-defense. It also shows an ICJ bias against Israel, and that leads me to suspect that there could easily be a similar, arbitrary, and unjust ICC bias against America. We could find our own land being called \\"occupied territory,\\" we could be accused of violating the rights of terrorists who attack us, and we could be found guilty of all sorts of war crimes if we ever tried to defend ourselves. So I disagree with Green. And since Green failed to even discuss such concerns, I think his article is pretty much meritless."},{"Title":"Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)","review":"For administrators who wish to have a greater control over Windows NT-based networks and were looking for a way to do it without having to learn a million different programming and scripting languages, the WMI is for you - and this is the perfect starting point.Designed and written for system administrators, the focus of this book is to introduce you to the WMI from a VBScript scripting perspective. Regardless of scripting experience, the authors guides the reader in both theory and hands-on scripting from the basics of the VBScript language (a full chapter introducing you to VBScript and scripting in general, which is completely skip-able if you are already familiar with VBScript) to the scripting WMI API, covering a healthy percentage of the WMI objects and their use in easy to understand scripts.The authors have written neither a recipe book of pre-created scripts, nor a true reference-only guide. If you are looking for the 2 minute answer, or are already proficient in the WMI, this isn't for you. Instead, the authors have written a text designed to give you a firm foundation of the WMI and the ability to quickly enhance your environment with no more than what they have provided, while still leaving room for you to confidently continue your learning of the WMI from other sources.This is the second WMI book I've read, and although this one did not come out first, I found it a much better starting point than the others.

I wish this was the first VBScript book I had read.This book was cleverly put together to provide and excellent book for people new or experienced with VBScript. It contains one chapter of VBScript which you can skip if you like, and tips throughout to explain VB Script specific functions which can be easily skipped if you know VBScript and are only concerned with WMI. I did review the VBScript chapter, and found it the best reading I've seen on the subject. This book together with a VBScript syntax reference (available from microsoft.com) are all you need to learn and apply VBScript, quickly.

It does not cover many of the classes available in WMI, and outside of VBScript provides no other access methods for WMI (any there are tons). The author basically misses the power of WMI by focusing on single tasks that can be in a one-off approach instead of looking of WMI as a whole and seeing its power in management across a large network or Enterprise.A good book for the one-off tasks that normally would take quite a bit of time; a not-so-good book for the programmer wanting to get into a deep understanding of WMI."},{"Title":"Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)","review":"I read everything I could find on the subject and STILL didn't know where to start.

In order to build a cogent thesis, Burrows takes on a broad range of topics, including pertinent biographical background of the key players, the legend and lore of Hewlett Packard - the company and the founders - and the arcane mechanics of proxy votes and corporate government. But while the subject matter risks could easily yield a pompous and boring analytical tome, the author injects exactly the right amount of intrigue, drama, treachery, and humor while capturing characters that are wholly believable in their flaws, foibles, and ultimate victory or defeat. The economy of Burrows' prose, sharpened by years of reporting for \\"Business Week\\", yields a tale that is a true page-turner with much more energy, excitement, and personality than the standard business fare.Any frequent \\"Business Week\\" reader knows that Burrows is no fan of Carly Fiorina. Consequently, the author was not granted official access to either Fiorina or HP officials (HP denies any connection, citing only \\"scheduling conflicts\\"). Notwithstanding, his portrayal of HP's embattled CEO is vivid and wholly believable. Fiorina, the marketer and master-of-spin with no prior CEO experience, is injected into the venerable but stumbling culture of Hewlett-Packard. A veteran of the politics and bureaucracy of AT&T; and Lucent, she is an unusual match for the techno-nerd culture of HP, where products trump hype and integrity and loyalty are revered. But while Burrows' criticism of Fiorina is biting and unrestrained, due credit is given to her tenacity, oratory skills, and relentless dedication to completing the acquisition at all costs. Walter Hewlett, who rises from a cocoon academic obscurity to fight-the-good-fight is treated much more charitably, but he only barely qualifies as the hero of the tale. While recognized for his honor and integrity in refusing to allow the proxy fight to deteriorate into personal attacks on Fiorina, his actions and judgment as a board member in the weeks and months prior to the planned merger's announcement are rightfully questioned. If there is a villain in the story, it is HP's board of directors. It is the board that passively watched while HP failed to capitalize on the rise of the Internet in the mid-late nineties, allowing HP to degenerate to a position of significance only in its printers. It was the board that initiated a bizarre, if not amateurish, CEO search leaving Fiorina as virtually the only real candidate for this high-profile job.Much is made of the demise of the celebrated \\"HP Way\\". But Burrows wisely resists the temptation to attribute all of the responsibility for this decline on Fiorina. While it is successfully argued that she failed to grasp the true significance of this unique culture, further alienating frustrated employees, by the time Fiorina arrived on the scene it was already in steep decline. What was once an honored tradition of mutual respect and pride in innovation had been replaced by a sense of entitlement and an excuse for sloth. It is unfortunate, Burrows notes, than in the age of Enron and WorldCom, with corporate America in desperate need of the principals and values that embodied the \\"HP Way\\", that there is little chance of resuscitation under Fiorina's reign.In summary, \\"Backfire\\" is a masterful portrayal of the rise-and-fall of an American icon, and a revealing expos&eacute; for the behind-the-scenes machinations of history's largest technology merger and ugliest proxy fight. It is a must read for anyone interested in the history of Silicon Valley, executive leadership, corporate governance, or corporate culture. In the subsequent dissections of the HP/Compaq post-merger failures (or, less likely, successes) that are sure to come over the next several years, Peter Burrows' \\"Backfire\\" will serve as a frequently quoted and pivotal reference point."},{"Title":"Backfire: Carly Fiorina's High-Stakes Battle for the Soul of Hewlett-Packard","review":"HP is a company in transition. For decades one of the fastest growing companies in history, it is now seen as a beleaguered giant, risk averse and unable to transform itself.This book situates the company's crisis in the context of the ascension of Carly Fiorina to the position of CEO and her brutal fight to acquire Compaq while changing the company.The origins of Hewlett-Packard have become the stuff of legend. During an electrical engineering class at Stanford in 1934, Bill Hewlett and David Packard began to formulate a vision for a company; their professor, Fred Terman, immediately recognized their talent and set about to mentor them. Four years later, in a rented garage with just $538, Hewlett and Packard, flipping a coin to decide whose name would come first, founded Hewlett-Packard. From the start, HP strove to create innovative technology products, predominantly in the instrumentation and measurement field. Their first big break came with the Disney company's purchase of an audio oscillator, which it used to fine tune the sound track for the experimental music film Fantasia. As the company grew, the founders articulated a series of objectives (\\"the HP Way\\"), which included the necessity to make a profit with a focus on innovation in the electronics field, but also an egalitarian culture that emphasized employee profit-sharing, career opportunities, and a contribution to the community.According to many employees, the HP Way helped to create an exceptional work environment, in which individual opinions mattered and strong personal relationships of trust grew along with professional engagement. Many HP employees spent their entire careers at the company. According to David Packard, HP sought to balance entrepreneurship against insubordination: if an employee chose to continue to develop a product on his own after it was officially terminated, he often would be allowed to do so within limits. Time and again, Packard found, such entrepreneurship resulted in breakthrough instruments, such as oscillator viewer screens, that generated millions of dollars in revenues. To maintain this entrepreneurial spirit, as profitable groups grew within HP they were allowed to function as near-autonomous divisions. This was particularly well suited to the booming electronic instrument business: with a few hundred thousand dollars, a small group could develop a product for a unique area of need and then sell it on their own. For decades, this structure worked. From 1958 to 1998, the company grew an average of 20.2 percent per year, a record that no other company has surpassed.As Burrows relates, during the late 1960s, HP began to develop computers and related product lines and technologies. This represented a major departure for the company, away from its core business of electronic instrumentation. While the move opened huge new areas of potential profit - from printers and personal computers to pocket calculators and specialized semiconductor processors - it vastly increased the complexity of the company. Not only did R&D; often require millions of dollars over decades to develop competitive product lines, but by the end of the 1990s there were over 80 quasi-independent businesses under the HP umbrella; often operating in separate geographical regions, each of these groups had its own sales force, its own engineers and designers, and its own software developers. By 1997, when HP began to miss its financial targets for the first time, many in the company began to fear that it was losing its way, that its structure had become wasteful, unwieldy, and worst of all, risk averse. Furthermore, after having invested so heavily in computers, HP executives recognized that the industry was becoming increasingly commoditized. In the opinion of industry observers, the moment had arrived to shake up the company.After a few attempts to transform the company from within, the HP board chose Carly Fiorina as the new CEO in 1999, an acknowledged high tech \\"rock star\\" who recently had headed sales at Lucent, the communications hardware giant that had spun off from the AT&T; breakup. From the start, she was a controversial presence in the company. For example, her specialty was marketing, which automatically branded her as an outsider in an engineering company. Moreover, as a media darling, the personal publicity she attracted made many longtime HP executives uncomfortable. However, others argued that she was bringing a fresh perspective on where the company should go, that she could gain an overview that few insiders had and would formulate a new strategic direction. In particular, Fiorina argued that with the unmatched breadth of its product lines, HP might somehow combine them into a more coherent whole, perhaps by focusing on the internet. Nonetheless, this vision of strategic synthesis remained to be defined in detail.So far so good. This background was extremely useful for me and covers to about 2004. But from this point, Burrows goes into excruciating detail about Fiorina's personality and style as well as adds several chapters on the civil war within the company that the acquisition of Compaq sparked. None of that interested me much, though this is the \\"intrigue\\" that many readers found most interesting. Then, the book ends as she obtains the acquisition, well short of the aftermath in which she was fired. So in addition to being too gossipy for me, it is already outdated.Burrows is a good journalist and covers a lot here in a better way than I have found elsewhere, but it is not very deep and glosses over many of the others issues that Fiorina was concerned about, such as the creation of synergies between the 83 largely independent businesses that make up the company.Recommended tepidly."},{"Title":"Backfire: Carly Fiorina's High-Stakes Battle for the Soul of Hewlett-Packard","review":"I enjoyed this book as it contained substantial original reporting that is not duplicative of the work that others have done. I would have liked to see more material concerning bottom line issues. The bottom line issue that has the most resonance for me is the Wall Street assessment, both now, and at the time of the merger, that HP's non-printing businesses have no value on the Street. In other words, if HP were to be bought by some other firm, the Wall Street consensus is that such an acquirer should simply eliminate the other businesses. HP's value is actually less as currently structured because eliminating these other businesses has closing costs associated with this shutdown activity.The clear implication here is that Walter Hewlett was absolutely correct in opposing this merger, since the result clearly is that 20 billion dollars was completely wasted, and precious time is still being lost on ineffective strategies to revive these businesses. With the benefit of hindsight we can say that Walter Hewlett should have been given more credit than he received, even from Burrows, for opposing this capital and job destruction, even in the face of Fiorina's personal attacks.This book should have pointed out that these at-risk businesses can still be saved, particularly the server and server-related businesses, with the appointment of proper management by the Board of Directors. What they need to be looking for this time is not someone whose picture has been on the cover of &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine, as was Carly's before she was hired, but someone with the knowledge and interest in saving HP. Carly not only does not have the engineering expertise, she simply creates the impression that she has no interest in HP's existing businesses, even printing, which she has left to wither on the vine in a new investment sense.HP has had a computer server business for over 25 years. It is a big market, roughly 50 billion yearly and rising. HP has 27%, but has failed to gain any share at all from the collapse of Sun Microsystems. Instead, customers are transfering to IBM and Dell, which should be a big wake-up call for the Board. Dell Computer is number one in market position for the key Linux server business, perhaps because of HP's totally insular and uninformed approach to this market. A lot of hard work by HP employees went into building a formerly successful server business, it is senseless to discard this potentially excellent business because Carly is more interested in trying to sell MP3s at Starbucks, something that will never generate much profit.I would have liked to have seen a clear statement in this book that if in the summer of 2004 if HP's non-printer businesses are still worth zero, that the HP Board of Directors needs hire a new CEO. Doubtless they prefer to have a charming dialogue with Carly about her boneheaded hipster ideas involving HP products in Starbucks rather than argue with some computer nerd about computer enterprise/service-provider product investments, but I would argue that being true to their responsibilities requires that they do the later, whether they like it or not. It would have been good for Burrows' book to say so."},{"Title":"Backfire: Carly Fiorina's High-Stakes Battle for the Soul of Hewlett-Packard","review":"The main weakness of this book was that its treatment of CEO Fiorina was far more favorable than the facts warrant. The controversy over the 20 billion dollar merger should have been foreseen by the Board of Directors. Certainly there was ample evidence at the time of the proposed merger that Carly Fiorina's ideas and actions were incompatible with her role as head of a major American company. Burrows should have detailed many more of these. For example, she invested millions of shareholder dollars in a radical feminist group and even set them up with office resources at HP. She donated over $100,000 of her personal funds to an eccentric socialist training camp in Los Altos Hills. This is clearly a businesswoman that simply does not have her head screwed on right for business. The businessman George Soros has been rightly condemned in the business community for analogous nutty actions on a larger scale but Burrows mostly gives Fiorina a free pass on such activity, although his account is certainly better than most.It has been nearly five years since Carly Fiorina took over HP and the bottom line result is that even after spending 20 billion on Compaq, the investment community values HP at less that half of what it was worth when she took over. Clearly, a much harder-hitting book from Burrows was warranted than what he produced, given the huge magnitude of the investor losses that have occurred since."},{"Title":"Backfire: Carly Fiorina's High-Stakes Battle for the Soul of Hewlett-Packard","review":"In addition to being a compelling, insightful account of the merger announcement and ensuing proxy fight, Backfire gives a wonderful glimpse into the heart and soul of the most powerful woman in American business. Especially when it comes to the Lucent anecdotes and the revealing moments after she first arrived at HP, Burrows provides a rich tapestry of insight and examples that allow you to truly get your mind around (and inside) what makes Carly tick.With a wealth of interview material to draw from obtained prior to the HP's decision to freeze him out, what this tome does without compromise is maintain its sense of impartial perspective -- a never wavering eye on the events of the past and present. No deal had to be struck and no compromises made in order to deliver this saga, and it is far more fascinating, honest, and revealing without those concessions."},{"Title":"Backfire: Carly Fiorina's High-Stakes Battle for the Soul of Hewlett-Packard","review":"This book gives us a better insight on what's going on at \\"the top.\\" Oh, those company layoffs.

BUT....It breaks my heart to find out the ridicules and bad treatment that Hewlett received. Come on, he is Hewlett!Here is a scene where Hewlett arrived with Neal at Steve Schatz office for his deposition.Steve Schatz, a former government prosecutor, wanted to prove that Hewlett wasn't the Jimmy Stewart character the press had made him out to be. ... Schatz let Hewlett know how he felt about him immediately, apologizing that the deposition was starting a few minutes late. \\"I hope you won't think that I had some nefarious rationale for it starting a few minutes late,\\" he said, a clear reference to Hewlett's claim that HP delayed the start of the shareholder vote so it could lean on Deutsche Bank. From there Schatz didn't hold back.At one point, HIS FACE INCHES AWAY FROM HEWLETT AND HIS FINGER JABBING THE AIR, Schatz asked: \\"Are you aware that your complaint accuses Hewlett-Packard of lying?\\" according to Hewlett and Steve Neal. The session was rife with mutual disdain, disrespect, and rudeness. Schatz fired away, and reloaded every few seconds. Schatz denied anything inappropriate.Read this book.

Why would a company with a suffering PC division want to buy a PC giant that was suffering even more, in a market where consumers have stopped buying PC's? &quot;Two garbage trucks colliding&quot;. And yet Burrows gives credence to Carly's abilities and talent and clearly offers both sides of the story.The best part of this book is the general business understanding it offers of mergers gone wrong. This is a prime example and well portrayed."},{"Title":"Backfire: Carly Fiorina's High-Stakes Battle for the Soul of Hewlett-Packard","review":"This book contained a lot of good material concerning the interaction of Carly Fiorina and her highest-level executives. However, Burrows' coverage of her impact on lower level managers in critical positions was inadequate. The failures of such managers can have major impacts on HP for potentially decades and thus deserve scrutiny. A good example prior to the Fiorina era was when HP lost over 60 points of market share in the technical workstation market in the 1980s which also led over time to a weakened server market position, due to lost technical and financial leverage. The current value of this loss may be as high as 10 billion dollars in revenue yearly.The keynote address by her Vice President for Linux at LinuxWorld yesterday illustrated well the huge risks HP is taking by having lower level executives like this VP adopt her approach. While this area is currently too small to register on the Board of Director's radar, critical market battles are currently being fought that will strongly influence HP financials for a long time. Carly Fiorina's bad influence was evident in VP Martin Fink's keynote address. This speech spent a lot of time promoting Linux, which customers can buy from many vendors, and virtually no time promoting HP's value-added. HP makes money whether it sells Linux or Windows-based machines. There is no real incentive to for HP to sell an HP-Linux machine instead of an HP-Windows machine, or vice versa.Why is HP's Martin Fink wasting valuable time in front of a huge audience promoting one side of an issue that is a don't care situation (with respect to Windows) and potentially a losing proposition (with respect to HP_UX) to HP financially? Note that HP has no time to waste in this market, the market leader at present, due to earlier HP missteps, is Dell Computer, not HP.What Martin Fink should have been promoting is why customers should buy HP Linux systems as opposed to IBM or Dell Linux systems, instead of arguing customers should buy Linux instead of other alternatives that HP also makes. Martin Fink's mistake yesterday is a typical Carly mistake, to get caught up in promoting what is fashionable, rather than what is best for HP. The lack of loyalty to HP implicit in his address has also been a familiar issue to Carly observers - that she is promoting herself far more than she promotes HP.The central theme of this example, the appalling deviation from business basics that Carly inspires in her team, is one that was deserving of much more attention in Burrows book. Corporate marketing resources need to be focussed on beating the competition, not on taking market share from one HP division and transferring it to another, or promoting the next job for some executive, whether that executive is Fink or Fiorina. It seemed yesterday that Martin Fink was promoting himself for some more senior Linux position at some other firm, which would explain his lack of HP advocacy, something Fiorina is thought to do in promoting herself for political office using her HP soapbox. It is also a good demonstration why the point of view prevalent on some unengaged Boards, that a CEO as just a public relations representative is adequate, is so misguided."},{"Title":"Backfire: Carly Fiorina's High-Stakes Battle for the Soul of Hewlett-Packard","review":"Peter Burrows offers insights into high level business, where personality matters more than economics, as he explores the mammoth HP-Compaq merger. Most mergers fail to make money or to produce the promised \\"synergies\\" so, he asks, why - other than ego - do CEOs pursue them? Though stylistically somewhat trite, this book successfully explores the HP Board's decision to approve the merger, with Walter B. Hewlett's vote in favor, and his subsequent lonely, ultimately quixotic battle against it. The most contentious issues in contemporary business are all here: shareholder rights and value vs. CEO power; employee-oriented cultures vs. \\"re-engineering;\\" corporate integrity vs. sharp practice; and the interesting spectacle of a ruthless, hard-headed female CEO pitted against a sensitive, cello-playing man. The author says Hewlett-Packard executives were told not to speak with him after he quoted merger critics in Business Week, so there is an inevitable Walter Hewlett bias.

Hewlett denied Burrows access and Fiorina granted more interview time, he would sing her praises. In one way, I can speculate to how Burrows empathizes with jr.

This is a hatchet job from beginning to end and not work the time it took to read it."},{"Title":"Backfire: Carly Fiorina's High-Stakes Battle for the Soul of Hewlett-Packard","review":"The merger of HP and Compaq has been the most controversial and reported business story in recent times. Built on the core ethical and business values of Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, from the humble beginnings at the garage in 1938, HP over the decades had grown up to a reputation of being one of the most admired and respected companies. The company provided an informal work environment where innovation became a way of life. Customers and employees had a strong emotional bond with this company and profits were a by-product of this long term relationship and trust. If I were to visit just one place in the United States, it would be 329, Addison Avenue. Enter 2001 and suddenly, a new CEO, a merger and a pitched battle between the Board and Walter Hewlett, the conscience keeper of the old guard.Not many companies have been spared by the mass mania of the dot com and internet boom of the 90's. Unfortunately, HP has also had its share of infection. Revenue growth, aggressiveness and a sales orientation became the new mantra in the rat race for achieving higher market valuation, as perceived by the analysts on Wall Street. We have witnessed scores of CEOs falling in line with and an easy prey to this myopic quarter chasing disease, that to call it a rat race might be defamatory of rats. This book is an excellent narration of HP's sad and painful transition in this era.I would not like to comment upon or take sides in the corporate battle and its outcome at HP. Today it is history and only of academic interest. The historian and the academic would know it better. But what would be interesting is to watch the direction for the new HP from now on. The book tends to give a feeling that the HP way is no longer relevant and the new leadership has shaken up the company and its culture. The concept of lifetime employment and entitlements for benefits is out. Compensation has been linked closely with performance and the new HP is ready to take off. As of now only one engine is &quot;printing&quot; enough power. Other engines are struggling to &quot;compute&quot;. Good Luck HP. You are &quot;Built to last&quot;.You should be forewarned that you might not be able to put down this book easily till you have reached the last page."},{"Title":"Backfire: Carly Fiorina's High-Stakes Battle for the Soul of Hewlett-Packard","review":"A surprisingly gripping story of what happened when the old-fashioned way of doing business met the &quot;new&quot; way. I don't normally follow tech topics, but picked this book up for a business ethics class. I was halfway through before I realized it. Burrows combines a lot of information into a driving narrative. The result is a very readable, very informative examination of modern business ethics, such as they are. The account of Fiorina's transformation from medieval scholar to calculating business executive is particularly chilling. I'll be following what becomes of HP with interest."},{"Title":"Backfire: Carly Fiorina's High-Stakes Battle for the Soul of Hewlett-Packard","review":"'Backfire' tells part of the tale of Carly Fiorina's tenure at HP - from 1999 through the court's decision upholding the acquisition of Compaq. However, ending the story at that point precludes any objective assessment of whether Fiorina and/or Compaq were good for HP - the author should have waiting several more years before undertaking the story. As written, the book primarily details the conflict between director Walter Hewitt (son of one of the founders) and Carly Fiorina over the Compaq acquisition. Hewitt opposed, while Fiorina proposed the action.Probably the only topic author Burrows 'clarifies' is that Carly's prior employment as a sales/marketing executive at Lucent had been controversial and lacked the overall responsibility considered preparation for the top job at HP. Lucent did poorly at new product development, and had to write off about $3.5 billion in AR due to Lucent's meeting demanding growth goals through financing customers that did not merit doing so. Meanwhile, HP had missed the PC and Internet technology shifts, and some board members thought the company needed a revolution, as well as stronger marketing and sales leadership. It is believed that had HP gone shopping for a new CEO a year later, Carly would not have been picked because by that time Lucent itself was floundering. Regardless, various concerns over leading HP insiders led the board to look outside, while HPs relatively poor strategic position and doddling an somewhat archaic methods (eg. a long multiple-choice assessment, as well as a multi-hour interview with a psychologist) turned off a number of outside contenders.Shortly after Carly took over HP spun off its original instrument business, calling it Agilent Technologies - an action initiated by her predecessor. This left it heavily dependent on PCs and notebooks.Carly set out to remake HP by collapsing its 83 independent businesses into a just a few units, also combining back-end design, manufacturing, and distribution into two units (printers, computing products) and front-end activities into two marketing/selling units - consumers, corporations. She also cut the number of ad agencies from dozens to two, and focused on building its brand - rather than individual products, created an incentive commission structure to reward sales (but not profitability), and consolidated procurement and computer systems. The Compaq acquisition and Agilent spinoff made HP even more reliant on PCs.Fiorina was forced out in 2005; at the time its shares commanded a P/E of 13X, vs. IBM and Dell at 17X and 26X. A 2/7/2005 Fortune article asserted that merging two losing companies (HP and Compaq) did not produce a financially fit business - the combined company did not come close to earning projected margins, and only its printer/ink business kept the company looking respectable. Fortune anticipated that part of the $14.5 billion in goodwill on its books after the $24 billion stock purchase would have to be written off.Her successor, Mark Hurd, cut, cut, and cut, then was fired for inappropriate personal behavior. Next came Leo Apotheker, fired for proposing selling off HP's computer business. Now Meg Whitman struggles with HP's problems."},{"Title":"Backfire: Carly Fiorina's High-Stakes Battle for the Soul of Hewlett-Packard","review":"This book talks about the original HP spirit and how Carly Fiorina's character does not fit with the HP culture.The company is definitely heading towards the wrong direction. Very soon, it will be remember as a company that a lot of people used to like to work at."},{"Title":"Backfire: Carly Fiorina's High-Stakes Battle for the Soul of Hewlett-Packard","review":"My major concern with this book is that it vastly understates the negative impacts any poor HP CEO, and in particular Carly Fiorina, can have. The negative impacts are not limited to HP shareholders, employees and customers, whom few people seem to care about. A few months ago Fiorina bought a 10,000 person Indian software firm, adding greatly to HP's huge investment in India. Inappropriate investments, HP and otherwise, are greatly resented in India, because it reinforces corruption in the culture that prevents improved living conditions for most Indians. Your Ronald Reagan dealt with the corrupt culture in the Soviet Union in a vastly superior way -- not by financially supporting corrupt bureaucrats and communist state governments (as Fiorina has done in India) but by dealing very sternly with these malfactors. Fiorina's investments have caused great harm in India. A few days ago Atal Vajpayee's government was voted out and the communists are going to call many of the shots in the new government. This is very, very bad for about a billion Indians.These potential international impacts should have been given attention in Burrows book. HP and a few other big US firms caused this senseless suffering in pursuit of corruption in India. The motivation for HP to outsource to India in the way they are doing it is certainly not cost savings (which don't really exist) -- the motivation is a combination of graft (doing business in India requires bribes, and once slush funds are created it is impossible to determine weather the bribes really go to Indian bureaucrats or whether American managers pocket most of the cash) and the desire of Carly to remove herself as far from actual production and productive people as possible. It is said she does not even use the company cafeteria because she could find herself too close to actual HP workers.I would hope in the future America would produce more great leaders like Ronald Reagan and find ways to keep harmful ditzy people like Carly Fiorina out of leadership positions. Burrows book would have been much better with a discussion of these international impacts."},{"Title":"Backfire: Carly Fiorina's High-Stakes Battle for the Soul of Hewlett-Packard","review":"Simply one of the best business books written in the last ten years.

I felt like I was a fly on the wall."},{"Title":"Backfire: Carly Fiorina's High-Stakes Battle for the Soul of Hewlett-Packard","review":"There are two sides to every merger and in the case of HP and Compaq Computer Corp., the competing sides weren't just the companies. They include the historians documenting it.Peter Burrows' Backfire paints Carly Fiorina as a brilliant marketer and communicator who stumbled into HP after one of the worst executive search jobs of all time by Christian Timbers. Her first two years was good idea after good idea followed by poor execution after poorer execution. The Business Week journalist implies the Compaq merger was primarily a way to deflect attention away from her inability to turn the company around after her first two years there.And then there is George Anders' competing book about the merger, Perfect Enough. With access to Carly Fiorina and her fellow board members and executives, it provides a fuller picture of the genesis of the computing deal. Explaining the frustration board members felt at the company's inability to keep up with competitors benefiting from the Internet boom such as Dell Computer Corp. or release a killer new product since the laser printer in the early 1980s, Anders stresses that the board members - and not just Fiorina-were seeking a radical makeover.Anders' more sympathetic account is fascinating at times such as its description of the complex relationship between Fiorina and David Packard's daughter Susan Packard-Orr. But, Burrows' book - unencumbered by any sense of loyalty to Fiorina, who snubbed the author - digs deeper into Fiorina's past by interviewing her ex-husband and childhood friends, thereby providing a much fuller picture of the executive, if not the entire organization.Taken together, the two books complement each other nicely. It remains to be seen if the same can be said for the merger."},{"Title":"Backfire: Carly Fiorina's High-Stakes Battle for the Soul of Hewlett-Packard","review":"Peter Burrows offers insights into high level business, where personality matters more than economics, as he explores the mammoth HP-Compaq merger.

Like a lot of reviews written by people of an evangelical faith he rates it with only &quot;one star&quot; because he disagrees with its contents on apriori religious grounds and hopes to discourage others from being contaminated by its contents (not because the book was written badly or researched badly or lacked interesting information - it is in fact, written well, researched fastidiously, and contains much interesting information not found in other such works).Predictably, the reviewer suggests a &quot;better&quot; book that agrees with his particular evangelical faith, like &quot;Why Christian Kids Leave the Fold.&quot; Such a &quot;review&quot; is both &quot;sad&quot; and &quot;not surprising,&quot; and says more about the reviewer than the book he has &quot;reviewed.&quot;To put what I said above in perspective, even having &quot;left the fold&quot; I, for instance, have not searched for books by Evangelical Christians to give them only &quot;one star&quot; and then suggest that readers would be better off reading &quot;Leaving the Fold&quot; instead.

Some have accused me and the other authors of this book of not having sincere conversions or not wanting to be \\"accountable\\" to a \\"creator.\\" Because no one, including these \\"know-it-all\\" accusers, can know the minds of the authors of this book, I will only speak for myself. My conversion and deconversion testimonies in this book are entirely SINCERE. I wanted salvation. I committed my life to Christ and I encouraged others to do so. However, after I read the Bible, and especially the false prophecies in Revelation and the countless contradictions in the Gospels, I realized that the claims of Christianity were false. Also, I could no longer swallow the irrational and far-fetched excuses that fill the \\"Christian apologetics\\" literature. As discussed in my essay, the arguments used by fundamentalists are no different than the feeble and subjective attempts by Mormons to defend their \\"scriptures.\\" The excuse-making of the \\"apologeticists\\" clearly violates the Principle of Parsimony (that is, \\"Ockham's Razor\\": a principle that now goes far beyond the embryonic thoughts of William of Ockham).I finally had the courage to stop lying to myself and admit that the claims of the Bible are wrong. Fundamentalism FAILED us. The authors of Babinski's book discovered alternatives, which they found to be more realistic, fulfilling and moral than Christian fundamentalism. At the same time, it's just so easy for fundamentalists to blame the victims of fundamentalism rather than be adults and responsibly admit that there are SERIOUS problems with fundamentalism and its interpretations of the Bible.My moral life has not changed since I left Christianity, so there's no evidence that I left because of any \\"love for the world.\\" Indeed, a person would have to be insane to turn down a REAL offer for eternal paradise. I would like nothing better than to have eternal life, but conclusive evidence (some of which is presented in this book) says it's an illusion.

Just some food for thought."},{"Title":"Leaving The Fold: Testimonies Of Former Fundamentalists","review":"A friend from college gave me an older copy of this book. I misplaced it during a move, but recently found it and am now partially through reading it.I think the dirtiest little secret in Fundamentalism is that so many of us do leave because of sin and hypocrisy, but it's not our own that forces us out. If anything, the desire for truth and a moral life that so many of us were taught (lipservice anyway) wasn't found within the ranks. Some of us have had to deal with the double whammies of corruption of church leadership and seeing more moral people outside the church than in it. We don't leave because we want to reject God and live a life of sin, but because we can't deal with the sin the church itself tolerates. Wherever we end up in our relationship to God is a painful part of that personal moral struggle.I'm a Fundamental Christian school graduate myself, so I've seen many of my classmates walk away from Fundamentalism. Our religious beliefs vary from reasonably conservative Christian to atheist, but we all share a concern for others and a recognition that something was terribly wrong that we couldn't fix. We had to get out.Ed, thank you for including the accounts of people who remained Christian as well as those who did not. Leaving Fundamentalism is not all-or-nothing involving matters of faith. Some people will find safety and peace just moving over a bit into a more moderate church. Some may really have to make a jump. Some people will definitely need to spend time finding their places. We don't have to sacrifice our morality to walk away. If anything, some of us only found it once we broke away."},{"Title":"Leaving The Fold: Testimonies Of Former Fundamentalists","review":"Leaving The Fold: Testimonies Of Former FundamentalistsI thoroughly enjoyed this book. Mostly because I could identify with so much of the personal experiences of the people who wrote in it. Ed Babinksi has collected various people's \\"testimonies\\" of their experience with fundamentalist Evangelical Christianity. From a review on Amazon, \\"33 former Christian fundamentalists explain how and why they first embraced, and later abandoned, that belief system. Of these, eight have become atheists, eight (including Babinski) agnostics, one a wiccan, and one a Zen Buddhist; the remainder have remained Christian\\". The ones who remained Christian still believe the major tenets of Christianity, they are just not so hard lined as they used to be. I don't like reading books that just slam Christianity and I don't believe that this is one of them. It is full of honest people who have honest questions and/or problems with the modern fundamentalist version of the Christian faith. The reasons that they each had for leaving the faith are varied but to me they all seem honest and I believe that they are truly seeking after what is true. Anyone who is doubting their faith or struggling with things that just don't seem right, I would recommend reading this book. It is very encouraging to see what other people have gone through as it can often feel like you are all alone being tormented by the doubts of your mind.I would also recommend this to Christians who are not doubting their faith but may know someone(like me) who either is doubting their faith or has left the faith for honest reasons. This will give you insight into what goes though a skeptics mind and should help you in dealing with such doubters. Hopefully it will give you more compassion and an understanding for someone who finds themselves in such a place which on most accounts is not something that you just choose to do. Changing your beliefs or leaving your faith all together is quite possibly one of the hardest things that an individual can do and it is not something that anyone chooses to do lightly.To read more of what Ed Babinski has written you can see his articles posted on infidels.org at this link or you can also go to his personal web page at http://www.edwardtbabinski.us/ .Jeffconsciencebound.com"},{"Title":"Leaving The Fold: Testimonies Of Former Fundamentalists","review":"This book is a breath of fresh air for someone who has been the victim of a psychologically abusive fundamentalist church.

While a few of the testimonies were a bit dry, I really enjoyed reading about these different people's experiences with Christianity as well is why they left. I could relate to a lot of what I read. Now I am hunting down a lot of the books that were written by the people interviewed for Leaving the Fold, and reading them as well. This is a great book to read if you're interested in why people leave the Christian religion - although I should really say the fundamentalist Christian religion, as several of the people in this book still consider themselves to be Christian, just Christians of a different sort. Both believers and nonbelievers should read this book. Nonbelievers will find validation of their belief system, an believers will understand what leads some people to reject their faith"},{"Title":"Leaving The Fold: Testimonies Of Former Fundamentalists","review":"According to fundamentalist reviewers like dave---f, the reasons people give for leaving the fold are nonsense. Let dave tell you the REAL reason they leave, i.e., because they \\"don't like being accountable to their Creator.\\" So if you want to read dave's book it's quite short, but if you want to read this book, written by people who give their first hand accounts of why they left, then you'll have to take a bit more time and effort to understand all the reasons they left.Dave---f mentions John Woodmorappe's book \\"Noah's Ark: A Feasibility Study\\" which he claims shows how fallacious and even dishonest all attacks on Noahs ark and the Biblical Flood are. Actually, Woodmorappe's book is full of \\"could be's\\" and \\"might be's\\" as a means of propping up the Biblical Flood story. And there are numerous in-depth critiques of his book on the web from far more qualified geologists than Woodmorappe. In fact there are plenty of critiques of \\"Flood geology\\" written by some of Dan's fellow evangelical Chrisians like Dan Wonderly, Alan Hayward, Hugh Ross, Glenn Morton, not to mention the American Scientific Affiliation that consists of evangelical Christians who are scientists. ...In fact many early Christian geologists are the ones who first rejected \\"Flood geology\\" based on the plain evidence of the rocks themselves (the strict divisions in the fossil record -- right down to even fossil fragments and microfossils being carefully separated, even the chalk and coal layers in England not mixing, not to metion the tracks left by live land animals, the nests of dinosaurs with hatched eggs intact inside the nest, meaning it took time to mate, build a nest, lay an egg, gestate the egg, have it hatch, and then on a layer above that, having the same things happen again, and even paleosols [fossilized soil horizons]). The revival of \\"Flood geology\\" is a recent phenomenon, spurred on during the early 1960s by Henry Morris's The Genesis Flood, a book with so many misunderstandings of the geological record (the photos of the Lewis Overthrust in that book aren't even of the Lewis Overthrust!) that even Morris's Institute for Creation Research and the staff geologists there like Steve Austin, have backed down from continuing to defend many arguments in that book, from the debunked Paluxy \\"man-tracks,\\" to the \\"human skull in coal,\\" even to the Lewis Moutain Overthrust, that ICR now accepts was an overthrust and not evidence against the geologic column.Dave---f adds his view that \\"Christianity hangs upon Genesis,\\" by which I suppose he means, \\"Genesis as I understand it.\\" But that is a matter best taken up with his fellow Christians who are old-earth and theistic evolutionists, who disagree with dave..."},{"Title":"Leaving The Fold: Testimonies Of Former Fundamentalists","review":"if you go back in the list of reviews here, you can read the author's own review of his book. its mainly a rebuttal to another person's review....reading the author's statements in that review is enough of a taste of his writing and wit to convince me to buy this book.Thanks, Ed.

From there, I found this book on Amazon. As a former Protestant who wandered through various denominations and versions of Christianity--who eventually refused to align with any Protestant group and wandered the Earth without any Church for a decade thereafter--I have to say, this book strikes me as something there could very well be a million of. No one has bothered to compile these stories of tragic loss of faith before, so similar to my own, probably simply because they are painful and speak mostly of only loss, I suppose. To dwell on the loss and not move on by creating a book such as this must be tough. However, I don't see this book as able to speak to Christianity's indefensiblity. I don't say that is Babinski's only point in writing the book, but let's face it, the guy is a \\"reverse-apologetist\\" who's main point in publishing is to undermine faith in Biblical Christianity. This book is definitely able to point up the giant holes in the defensibility of Fundamentalist Christianity and indeed probably of most Protestant, \\"sola Scriptura\\" type denominations, however. Nice job. After many years, by \\"chance\\" I became an aquaintance of someone of the Eastern Orthodox faith, which was new to me. I had always figured that Greek or Russian Orthodox folks were just some off, ethnic brand of Catholic. I researched, experienced first hand, read further up on, and was enlightened by my hard look with an open mind--a mind convinced that Western Christianity of any brand was in some way lacking. Everyone who takes an experience like the folks in this book have had--and there are legions upon legions of disappointed, previously faithful out there (you don't need credentials of any kind, you know)--and uses it to justify marginalizing Christianity in any way needs to try one more place before letting it all go. (Liberal Christianity, which most of the folks mentioned in this book seem to have embraced, is just a slippery slope out the door eventually altogether, we all know in our hearts.) There is another place to look where you can find what Fundamentalism offered but couldn't produce, what mainstream Protestantism wants to be but really just plain isn't, what Western Christianity--including most of all Catholicism, by the way--has lost. Orthodox Christianity has what these people found missing in their churches, and if you've read this book and are eyeing up a more liberal church--which you know is a jettisoning of your previous faith in the Bible--don't. Drop all previous prejudice and start over where it all began, with a truly Eastern approach to an Eastern religion (Christianity is not a Western religion at all, all that Greek notwithstanding). You will find a religion so much more full and complete--and full of ready answers and acknowledged mystery. You will need to swallow some pride, because it \\"looks\\" a lot like your antithesis (the Catholic Church), but it is not and in fact stands in strict opposition to it. But there is the place these people and the readers of this book who are affected in a direction away from Biblical Christianity need to go (if they weren't simply reading the book looking for a reason to drop religion altogether)."},{"Title":"Leaving The Fold: Testimonies Of Former Fundamentalists","review":"I highly recommend this book for all pastors, religious teachers, and others interested in religion. It illustrates the critical importance of apologetics as part of the training of all Christian youth. I have been a Methodist, Lutheran and other denominations in my almost 60 years of life and most of them never covered any area of apologetics in either Sunday school or during the regular church service. As a result young people are easily influenced by the distorted or wrong arguments espoused by atheists and agnostics. Typically one's religious beliefs are fairly well established when quite young and rarely do churches give their charges much information to enable them to deal with objections such as those raised in this book. No wonder more than half of all Christians leave the church as adults. In my family over 90% have left the church. The churches have no one to blame but themselves. The reasons those in this book gave for leaving Christianity could usually have been answered by a good apologetics class. Many boil down to the classic \\"where did Able get his wife\\" thus, they conclude, Darwinism must be the explanation of where we came from, therefore there is no God. I was also surprised at how frequently encountering Darwinism in school was a major, if not the major, reason why theism was rejected. As a whole public school and college were a major reason why many became atheists, agnostics, nominal Christians or cultural Christians. This supports the research that concludes government schools are not neutral, as the constitution requires, but clearly indoctrinate against theism and, especially, Christianity. Much is made out of the putative mistakes in the Bible yet Christianity teaches only the original autographs were inspired, not the copies, and we have none of the originals today (but most of the copies differ mostly in spelling). Thus we can have confidence in the scriptures we have today (but mistakes do exist)."},{"Title":"Leaving The Fold: Testimonies Of Former Fundamentalists","review":"The stories are interesting, but usually consist of little more than anecdotal evidence.And thats OK if you take it for what it is, but remember that when Christians give testimonies atheists invariably like to claim \\"anecdotal evidence is not evidence\\".So if these stories are being presented as an argument, and not simply a biographical account, they fail."},{"Title":"Leaving The Fold: Testimonies Of Former Fundamentalists","review":"Various reasons are given for leaving the faith. Some, for instance, clearly bought into humanistic ideas. Others fell into sin. However, most if not all of the authors in this anthology testify to once having &quot;gone up to the altar&quot; and &quot;feeling saved&quot;. Is it possible that they mistook an emotional or cultural experience for a real receiving of Christ as Savior? Or, as the Biblical Demas, did they simply fall in love with the world?"},{"Title":"Leaving The Fold: Testimonies Of Former Fundamentalists","review":"Writing rebuttals on the review section for your own book?

When many of Christ's disciples stopped following Him, He was not surprised. To the contrary; He gave the following challenge to the remaining disciples: &quot;Will you also go away?&quot; (John 6:67). The Lord never forces anyone to follow Him. Nor is it at all surprising that apostates can often find a fulfilling life without Him. After all, the Bible recognizes that sin is pleasurable (Hebrews 11:25)--that is, for a season. Finally, the book is woefully incomplete in that it totally ignores those who fall away for whatever reason but then return to active practice of the Faith. The book &quot;Why Christian Kids Leave the Faith&quot; is much more informative overall, and especially in regard to the latter issue. Most of those who fall away eventually come back."},{"Title":"Leaving The Fold: Testimonies Of Former Fundamentalists","review":"The essays in this book are yet more proof that people apostatize from their professed Christian faith because they don't like being accountable to their Creator. Then they find it easy to rationalize and pretend that their rejection of Christianity is because of 'evidence'.A case in point are the essays giving ... attacks on Noah's Flood and Ark as their 'reasons' for rejecting the Bible. John Woodmorappe's book \\"Noah's Ark: A Feasibility Study\\" shows how fallacious and even dishonest these attacks are. All the apostates can do is spout on about Ockham's razor (never mind that Ockham was a strong Christian) and fail to address the points or admit the many crass blunders.But a good thing to come out of this book is how Christianity hangs upon Genesis. It's significant that the many of the contributors are a virtual who's who of the amateurs active in the Internet anti-creationist world.

Just a Bad Day is entertaining and can help young children learn how to deal with negative feelings and situations.... I am glad I went ahead and bought it. This book hardly teaches terrible lessons. If you can think back to when you were a child, the incidents in this book are all valid reasons for having a bad day (although my kids love oatmeal and I don't think a little book like this is going to change their minds!).On the contrary, this book has some positive things to say. I know my kids indentify with the little Critter in this story (as they do in all the little Critter books) - what kid hasn't been upset by things out of their control - with a rainy day or a broken toy, or the annoying actions of a sibling? ...In identifying with Little Critter, children learn that they're not alone and that their feelings of boredom, frustration and anger are valid. And that negative feelings can quickly turn around and become positive And being able to laugh at the pictures shows kids how to find humour even in difficult situations, which is something that can be important to them while growing up and learning's life's lessons. We sit down as a family and read this book together - we even act out the situations, talk about how the Critter is feeling and discuss what positive things HE might do to improve his day (especially if you still don't like the idea of a new toy, a material object, being the reason for his day getting better) or how he can plan ahead to ensure that the next rainy day is good one...."},{"Title":"Just a bad day (Mercer Mayer's Little Critter book club)","review":"This is the only book I have ever actually thrown out!

The jokes are obvious, the humor & situations forced. I picked this up hoping for a pale shadow of the humor by other masters such as Terry Pratchett or Douglas Adams - and Gardner falls seriously short of this mark. He may be compared to the latter (and worst) efforts of Robert Aspirin - you know the ones I mean. There is no sparkling wit, startling plot developments or well-drawn characters with defined & consistent motivations. It's a parody of an oft-lampooned genre.His style is unremarkable, his storytelling facile & pedestrian.

In this book, the Trojan War era comes alive from the fight scenes, strategies and political turmoil to the countrysides of the Mediterranean area, its foods and customs and the inner court of Troy's elite. Seen through the eyes of a fictional Trojan youth, Helios, who winds up on both sides of the war, survives by his wits and the help of his eventual mentor Odysseus, we ride along on this fantastic chariot ride through the entire war, meeting Hector, Priam, Helen, Achilles, and many other 'famous' historical figures.Powell does a masterful job of interpreting the writings and molding a story that is both true to history and imaginative enough to take us into the minds and hearts of the people involved in the horror of the Trojan War.

It is hard to disagree with this assessment, since this tome is really that good and the research which went into it is nothing short of painstaking. George Ostrogorsky introduces his narrative with a thorough overview of the development of Byzantine studies from the sixteenth century onwards, followed by the history of the Empire proper by sections, each of which covers a specific historical period. In addition, each section is prefaced by an excellent bibliographical narrative of Byzantine sources which cover the period in question; these narratives put together provide the reader with a very instructive literary history of Byzantium. Ostrogorsky has a penchant for detail in both the text and the extensive footnotes accompanying it. But let the reader beware: this book is essentially a dry political and military history with some legal, theological, and economic history thrown in for good measure; even the literary history mentioned above limits itself to documents of historiographical value. The author did compensate for the lack of written coverage of the arts and architecture by including nice illustrations of Byzantine structures and artwork. Even as this revised edition was published almost 30 years ago, &quot;History of the Byzantine State&quot; remains a much-revered classic among Byzantinists."},{"Title":"History of the Byzantine State","review":"George Ostrogorsky's book covers all Byzantine history from Diocletian and Constantine to the fall of Constantinople in 1453. It is, moreover, intelligible and useful to the nonspecialist with only a broad historical background. Its particular value is that it imparts an understanding of the *process* of Byzantine history, especially in three key periods. First, the transformation of the decrepit East Roman Empire to a viable state able to withstand great adversities and heavy defeats. Second, the reinvigoration of that state after the iconoclast crisis and its rise to great power. Finally, the unintentionally suicidal policies adopted after the death of Basil II, which led to the breaking of Byzantium's back only fifty years later. Ostrogorsky's copious footnotes - happily, not endnotes - are especially useful because they cite many arguments and authors with which Ostrogorsky himself disagrees. Thus he provides easy access to views other than his own. There are a few minor irritants in the softcover edition, the absence of most of Ostrogorsky's excellent maps being the main one. There is also some little use of untranslated and untransliterated Greek. But neither deficiency adversely affects the book's overall value."},{"Title":"History of the Byzantine State","review":"Ostrogorsky has put together a good single-volume survey of the thousand years of Byzantium. The tale begins, standardly, with Diocletian and Constantine, and ends with the fall of Constantinople in 1453. He takes an omniscient view of Byzantium, focusing neither on the lives and deeds of the Emperors nor the cultural and religious developments, but telling a well-balanced narrative. In that it serves as a useful introduction. However, Ostrogorsky writes without any passion, and fails to humanize the major figures. There are, though, several excellent maps that put others to shame. In all, the book is worth owning for the factual narrative and great maps. If you are looking for an impassioned and entertaining story you should pick up John Julius Norwich instead."},{"Title":"History of the Byzantine State","review":"Ostrogorsky's History of the Byzantine State is an excellent book for the scholar, as well as the interested reader to use for any understanding of the history of the Byzantine Empire. Well written, concise, and thoroughly interesting, Ostrogorsky depicts the transition of a multi-cultural Late Roman Empire, to a smaller but more centralized and powerful Byzantine State, that became the cultural Renaissance for Eastern Europe and the Near East. Anyone wishing to expand his/her knowledge on this important time in history will not be disappointed to read this work"},{"Title":"History of the Byzantine State","review":"This book is a well presented overview of the political history of the Byzantine Empire. Therefore, it suffers from the same problems as most other political history books, it fails to take into account important non-political developments. For instance, the Plague of Justinian is not mentioned. One would thing that a sixty percent mortality rate in Constantinople would earn at least a passing glance. However, the author/publishers are not responsible for the woeful inadquecies of political history. The problem with the book lies in the bizarre lack of maps. (I have the Rutgers University Press, Fourth Paperback Printing, 1995.) There are only two maps (p. 289 and 521). They are both of the Balkans. There is not a single map of Anatolia in the entire book. Why would anyone publish a book in English for a western audience on the Byzantine Empire and not include a single map of Anatolia?"},{"Title":"History of the Byzantine State","review":"Ostrogorski's History of the Byzantine State does a great job describing the relationship between the state, the civil and military aristoracy and small holders.He starts this theme during the early tenth century and carries it forward to the end of the book. It is a story of how the state becomes less and less able to defend itself against the aristocracy.While other writers speak of Ostrogorski's lack of passion about Byzantium's last centuries, this is also an advantage because it allows him to focus on political and military causes of the Empire's decline after 1025.A few years ago I read Vassliev's two volume book on Byzantium and enjoyed it very much. In particular, those looking for a lengthy discussions of culture would do better with Vassilev.But it was only after reading Ostrogoski that I got a clear understanding of the political change after the death of Basil II (and the role of Psellus in them), the wars against Michael VIII after the recapture of Constantinople in 1261 and fourteenth century civil wars.In addition, this is a very well written book. In particular, Ostrogoski does a great job of starting his paragraphs with short, pithy topic sentences. He is also very good at drawing broad comparisons across Byzantine history (Vassilev, by contrast, tends to get caught up in details).In sum, while I am glad I read Vassilev first, Ostrogoski's book has given me a much stronger sense of the outlines of Byznatine history."},{"Title":"History of the Byzantine State","review":"\\"Roman political concepts, Greek culture, and the Christian faith were the main elements which determined Byzantine development. Without all three the Byzantine way of life would have been inconceivable. It was the integration of Hellenistic culture and the Christian religion within the Roman imperial framework that gave rise to that historical phenomenon which we know as the Byzantine Empire.\\" Thus begins the first paragraph of George Ostrogorsky's masterful narrative of Byzantine history. As this quotation demonstrates, Ostrogorsky's writing is a model of erudition, clarity, and efficiency. It would be hard to improve the quality of his prose, and he maintains this level of scholarship throughout the 500+ pages of main text. But the writing has a natural fluidity which carries the reader along rather effortlessly throughout the full span of East Roman/Byzantine history, from 284 A.D. (rise of Emperor Diocletian) to 1453 A.D. (fall of Constantinople to the Turks). Ostrogorsky gives this inherently rich and fascinating material the virtuoso treatment it deserves, and the reader is rewarded on every page by Ostrogorsky's efforts.Of course, readers of this English translation from the original German of the 3rd edition (1963) of Ostrogorsky's \\"History of the Byzantine State\\" owe an immense debt to Professor Joan M. Hussey, whose rendering of the German into English is a masterpiece in its own right. Moreover, through the collaboration of Professors Ostrogorsky and Hussey, the truly extensive references and footnotes have been brought up to date from the 1940 German 1st ed. to the 1967 time-frame of Hussey's 2nd English edition presented here. Of course, in the intervening 40+ years a veritable explosion in the fields of Late Antique and Byzantine studies has taken place, but Ostrogorky's mastery of the original sources, and the German, French, Italian, English, and Slavic secondary literature will not soon be replicated.\\"History of the Byzantine State\\" is a delight to read, and is divided into 8 main chapters. These chapters are respectively subdivided into numbered sections, and both chapters and sections are clearly titled, so that the breadth of Byzantine History is clear through a glance at the Table of Contents.Other reviewers have complained that Ostrogorsky's writing is dry and lacks a \\"human touch.\\" I found the opposite to be the case: \\"History of the Byzantine State\\" has a cogency and beauty of style, and is a model of articulate scholarship. And with such rich material as the myriad colorful historical human figures and locales which populate Byzantine history, it would be difficult to render this history in a boring fashion. Ostrogorsky's emphasis is the political narrative, but he does not ignore social and cultural aspects of Byzantium, and upon finishing his book the reader has a sense of a complete picture of Byzantine history and civilization. In the paperback version now standard the maps are incomplete, but this is easily remedied by consulting an historical atlas or the Internet."},{"Title":"History of the Byzantine State","review":"Recommended for anyone serious about understanding the Byzantine Empire in depth. A richly detailed examination of of both the topic and its historiography."},{"Title":"History of the Byzantine State","review":"This presents too much material to absorb. There are too many names, places, parties, and so on. But it is what I wanted: a sweep through the political history of the Byzantine Empire. Unfortunately, it doesn't have enough maps (just two of the Balkans late in the book), and it's very badly copy-edited."},{"Title":"History of the Byzantine State","review":"This book covers the whole history of the Byzantine state from aound 400 to its collapse in about 1400.The good part of the book is that in a compact way it covers the major political events over that 1000 year period. The not so good part is that it assumes knowledge about many peoples that contribute to the story.When I read \\"The Histories\\" by Herodus I had a terrible time getting through the part on the Scythians. That is because I had know idea who they were. I went to the Net and found a reference to them that was just a few paragraphs, that they were Indo-European, that they may have invented horseback riding, that their decendents still lived in the Cacus mountians. After that I was interested in them and had not trouble reading the material.I say this to point out the biggest drawback of this book. There is no mention of the ethnographic or linguistic relationships between the various groups. Today it is important that Serbs and Russians are enthnically close. This books doesn't give a hint of these kinds of relationships. That makes it more difficult to remember the information.However, it is still a valuable book to help understand the events that made the world the way that it is. It is scrupulous about its sources and there is no question that the information is as accurate as possible."},{"Title":"Concise English : Chinese Chinese, English Dictionary (Third Edition) (Mandarin Chinese Edition)","review":"A high-quality book.Just be sure to have your reading glasses or magnifying glass available!"},{"Title":"Concise English : Chinese Chinese, English Dictionary (Third Edition) (Mandarin Chinese Edition)","review":"Just as described and really useful for every beginner studying Chinese!You will need really good glasses to read some hanzi but really useful! ^^"},{"Title":"Tanka Tanka Skunk!","review":"My 2 and 3 year old love this book. They both pound out the rhythm as we read it and they get very excited about reading it faster and faster and trying to keep up with the rhythm. Not a great bed time story since it tends to get them riled up instead of calmed down. It's one of the few books in their collecton that I don't get bored reading over and over again. Like another reviewer I kept checking this out at the library and finally decided to buy it. The illustrations are large and easy to see and have helped my kids learn the names of different animals."},{"Title":"Tanka Tanka Skunk!","review":"A skunk named Skunk and an elephant named Tanka love rhythm and rhyme. Skunk and Tanka like to meet different animals like alligator and polar bear. They always make a rhythm with the animals' names by dividing the syllables into beats. Skunk and Tanka also make rhymes out of the animal names. The book is an amazing way to teach syllables. Webb uses rhyme as well as rhythm to emphasize the syllables in the names of animals most children know. The illustrations only add to the magic. The animals are cartoon structure with vibrant colors that catch the audience's eyes. It brings excitement and learning together as one. The classroom becomes full of educated musicians."},{"Title":"Tanka Tanka Skunk!","review":"I borrowed this book from the library for my 4 year old son to look at, and it was a success!

The current alternative is a volume such as this \\"Sourcebook and Index,&quot; compiled by Byron Hollinshead with introductory notes by Steven Mintz as a supplement to Joy Hakim's 10-volume A History of US series. Of course, this volume also works as a stand-along reference, providing a collection of great American documents, most of which are touched upon in your standard American history textbook. I have a strong affinity for primary documents, and this collection provides almost 100 of them in this collection of letters, declarations, proclamations, court decisions, laws, acts, speeches, the Constitution, and other writings, all arranged chronologically from \\"Magna Carta\\" through Ronald Reagan's 1988 speech at Moscow State University. The goal is to illuminate the experience of the diverse groups that make up American society, so that in addition to influential Presidential speeches that are scattered throughout this volume young readers will also find the voices and experiences of Native Americans, African Americans, immigrants, women, and many other groups represented as well.This sourcebook presents excerpts from many of the documents recommended on state frameworks and that support the National History Standards. At the beginning of each excerpt there is a note on where you can find the document or topic discussed in the series (e.g., John F. Kennedy's Inaugural Address does with Chapter 17, Book 10, \\"All the People\\"), a headnote that provides background on the document and discusses why it is important, the text if the document, and definitions in the margins that will help readers understand unfamiliar word or unusual meanings as well as identifying historical figures mentioned in the documents. I especially appreciate the later because having co-edited a collection of great speeches I was quite proud of the annotations we provided and Hollinshead and Mintz are doing something similar here. The focus is on helping young readers tease out a document's assumptions, uncover its meaning, and assess its historical significance. For example, there are only two lines from \\"Magna Carta\\" but the analysis emphasizes the ideas of preserving rights, obeying the law of the land, and extending rights to all citizens.By devoting an entire volume to such documents Hakim is able to get well beyond the few documents of state that often end up in the back of an American history textbook (i.e., the Declaration of Independence, U.S. Constitution, Bill of Rights, etc.). Here you will find the Articles of Confederation, the Homestead Act, and the Civil Rights Act. The Gettysburg Address is short enough to make its way into most textbooks but students will also find words from Lincoln's \\"House Divided,\\" debate with Stephen Douglas, and Second Inaugural Address. When the authors works in John Marshall Harlan's dissenting opinion in Plessy v. Ferguson you know that they have done their homework and gone beyond the obvious possibilities. There are easily a dozen other impressive additions, from John C. Calhoun's speech on the Compromise of 1850 and Franklin D. Roosevelt's message to Congress on \\"The Four Freedoms\\" to Thomas Jefferson's \\"Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom\\" and Martin Luther King, Jr's letter from Birmingham City Jail.Among the reasons why I would prefer a CD-Rom to a book in this matter is that you would not only be able to include many more documents, but you would also be able to provide them in their entirety. Even a relatively short speech such as Patrick Henry's \\"Give Me Liberty or Give Me Death!\\" is edited (and there is no reason you cannot either provide both complete and edited versions of the longer works and/or allow teachers to edit them themselves before making copies). However, I am well aware that my preference for primary documents may well be greater than your average student of American history. Even if you are not using Hakim's series, American history teachers can certainly use this volume to help expose their students to some of the most powerful words in our nation's history."},{"Title":"A History of US: Book 11: Sourcebook and Index","review":"These books are indispensible to any family that enjoys a great home library.

It is very though."},{"Title":"The Book of Love: Awaken Your Passion to be Your Higher Self","review":"If I could look beyond this book's Christian slant I might agree with some of what other reviewers are saying about it. In truth, the subtitle should be \\"Awaken your passion to be your Higher Christ - Self.\\" If you can overlook that and other references to God (assuming this is the Christian God since we already see the Christ influence) the messages in the book could be enlightening. I doubt that the author intentionally left out the other religions in the world, for if it were so it would imply that only those of Christ mind could find enlightenment.The basic ideas of this book are that there are four obstacles to love: The illusion of a special relationship (soulmates, relationship love, parental love), Anger, Guilt, and a lack of awareness. But love does not refer to what you think of in everyday life, for that kind of love, we are told, is simply our ego. It is fairy tale and selfish. Karen Bentley might call me unenlightened but I don't agree with this concept.According to Bentley, there are six spiritual tools you need to have to change your life: A strategy of Holiness, Forgiveness, Gratitude, The holy instant of peace, Communing with your higher self, and Praying. She goes on to explore and explain these tools in depth in a very easy to read tone, using anecdotes and numerous quotes from \\"A Course in Miracles.\\" Again, the text is full of Christian influence and doesn't need to be so, in my opinion. Enlightenment is available to every soul.The writing is well done, the tone is uplifting (though at times condemning of your humanness) and the basic premise of connecting with your higher self is positive. I can see Christians everywhere wanting a copy of \\"The Book of Love.\\" For what it is, the book is an appropriate, useful tool; it just isn't for everyone.Review by Heather Froeschl of www.BookReview.com"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Bob White.","review":"This is a wonderful book and I highly recommend it. Plus, unlike many of these Dover editions of Thornton Burgess' books, it has honest-to-god original Harrison Cady illustrations.Harrison Cady did two sets of drawings for this title:-- Published by Little, Brown, with 6 full-page grayscale illustrations.-- Published by Grosset & Dunlap, with 14 full-page line drawings, including line-drawing versions of all 6 original grayscale illustrations in the Little, Brown editions, plus many smaller line drawings.This Dover edition has the 6 grayscale illustrations from the Little, Brown edition. In the Little, Brown edition, they were on plates (higher quality paper), while in this Dover edition they are on the same paper as the text. That does affect the quality of the illustrations a bit, but they still look quite good. Kudos to Dover on getting it right for this title. And at such a low price!If you like these illustrations, I'd recommend finding a used copy of the Grosset & Dunlap edition too. Cady did those decades later, after he had grown as an artist. Even though the Grosset & Dunlap line drawings are simpler than the Little, Brown grayscale illustrations, they are more charming. On the other hand, the Little, Brown grayscale illustrations better show Cady's remarkable vision for Burgess' creatures."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Bob White.","review":"I grew up reading these books and so did my sons.

Someone said it wasn't, because he is too insensitive. I think his interpretation is acurately acted. Holmes is an intellect and is only caring if he is really deeply moved - or as a ploy. He is not by nature one to show what a caring person he is; but he is - and sometimes will show that if he thinks it really will make some difference. He is obsessed with thoughts, facts, data, music, and getting inside someone's skin. The showing of feeling is not big on his list, however the passion for his science is clear. So Brett being insensitive, on most occassions, jive's well with Doyle's Sherlock. Watson was, of course, the more feeling one.I read somewhere that Doyle wrote most of these stories while at the track, betting on horses. It is believable.

Not only is this great recreational reading, but it is very educational as well. Holmes is, in my opinion, the most fully developed person in all of fiction. After reading all the stories and novels thrice as I have, you come to understand what it takes to develop a character so real that many will attest that he actually existed. The stories are also great for the mind, as the reader continually tries to match wits with Holmes in each mystery. This collection contains both short reading (stories which can be read in 45 minutes) and involved novels. When buying this book, I suggest that you not have anything important to do for a few months, as it is impossible to put the book down.

With this set, you might as well have both books. But if you don't, I prefer the first over the second.I'll just state that part, if not most, of the second half could have been left unwritten. As one of the short stories says, Sherlock himself would write 'dry', actionless accounts, and this seems to have happened in \\"The Memoirs Of Sherlock Holmes.\\" This is somewhat remedied in a m\\"made for T.V.\\" series- starring Jeremy Brett- which makes any storyline changes seem light-handed."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"I ordered this from Glen the book seller. The company gave me excellent service, even emaining me to ensure I received the book. I would highly recommend this company for any book purchase."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"Got the book in a timely manner, and the book's condition was exactly as decribed."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"I've had this book since the '60's and my copy had long since lost the covers and was missing several pages. I ordered this new and was verypleased with condition. It was new, still sealed in srink wrap and was like getting an old friend back. Thank you. An excellent seller!"},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"I read the Adventures and the Memoirs when I was a kid and enjoyed them thoroughly. Here are the complete collection. I don't give it full marks because sometimes the opening pattern gets repetitive and uninteresting. In two short stories Doyle used the exact same opening (The Cardboard Box and The Resident Patient). Also at some point in the latter half of the book the stories become almost predictable from the beginning. The novels are much more interesting and exciting. I think the Hound of the Baskervilles is the best, followed closely by the Sign of Four and then a Study in Scarlet."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"I've been a Sherlockian since I was sixteen, and for a long time the only copies of the stories I had were battered, dog-eared paperbacks, riddled with typos, that made me wince every time I picked them up. But yay, now I have a Sherlock Holmes collection that I'm not ashamed to display on my bookshelf! I'm no serious book collector who HAS to have fancy leather-bound volumes, so to me this a lovely edition. The different short stories and novels are laid out in a very orderly manner, so they're easy to find. If you're a fan of the great detective, and you're sick of looking at your ugly old paperbacks, I'd get this edition. And if you're NOT a fan of Holmes, well... Get with it."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"Of all the memorable characters in literature, Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes is justly one of the most famous (rivaled by only a small handful of others). In the Complete Sherlock Holmes, you find this peculiar, proper, analytical, brilliant consulting detective. You also meet his equally famous boswell, Dr. Watson, and unforgettable criminals, plots and deductions. There are four novels and fifty-six short stories. Many of them are masterpieces. A few, especially some of the later works, are dated and disappointing (thus only four stars). But do not be too concerned. After you read this series, you will see why the pipe smoking genius of Baker Street has fans throughout the world. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"The stories of course are amazing. I think I'd rather buy a better quality copy next time. Perhaps I would even get each book separately. Don't get me wrong, I use these copies to read on the train for about two semesters, but they're just so big! And the one I used is falling apart, but don't take my word for it because I put it through hell.It comes with two books, the first of which is thicker than any textbook I've ever owned. I never actually got to open the second one because I ended up getting a tablet. If you weren't aware, I think all these books are public domain and the e-books are available for free on all the book stores apps.All in all, a decent set for the price. This was definitely a great deal before I got my tablet. But don't expect them to last very long and they're not very practical for everyday reading."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"Buy this if you like and want to read Sherlock Holmes! By the way, the typos that people keep talking about, aren't even typos. They're just spelled the British way. In Europe and Canada, some words are spelled differently."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"At first I was hesitant to buy this because it was a bit pricey, but I love this book! It is so pretty, and of course a great story. I really enjoyed the introduction. I learned a lot about the story. The text is a nice size, and the layout is very nicely designed. I will definitely be choosing the Barnes and Nobles edition of books from now on."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"I bought this as a present for my wife who enjoys Sherlock Homes stories on TV. She loves this book and recommends it for all Sherlock fans. Its handsome cover draws lots of compliments. It has the look of a collector's item."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"This book is of the finest quality. Given the length of the text it is inevitable that the pages be thin, however, they are not flimsy. The cover is beautiful and over all this book really does impress. I am so pleased with this purchase; it was a gift for my husband and he loves it."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"After watching the recent Sherlock Holmes movies and the PBS series, we decided it would be fun to have the complete works, the original version. LOL Anyway this book was exactly what we wanted. Great price, great value. Nice addition to the library.

They are very entertaining, and have a way of drawing you in like you are standing next to Dr. Watson. Great works of literature that should be read by more people."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"This collection contains all of the short stories (50+) and the four novels featuring Sherlock Holmes. I love Sir Arthur's writings so I really enjoyed this collection. I'm glad I have them for all time now.

Brand New in plastic wrap, split into two paperback compilations in hardbox, shipped promptly, couldn't be happier!"},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"Hullo.These are the best books I've bought in a while, certainly not a disappointment. Conan Doyle is actually a literary genius and his work never fails to draw you in. Perfect for those who have a bit of a soft spot for crime, drama and plots that never fail to suck you in.The books are in exceptionally good condition too, arrived within a few weeks of me ordering them (impressive because they were shipped from America)I'd recommend the books and the site for high quality and no disappointment."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"I recently began collecting the Barnes and Noble Leatherbound Classics, and \\"The Complete Sherlock Holmes\\" was one of the first volumes I purchased. I think it is of excellent quality. The cover is beautifully done, with renderings of Sherlock Holmes and various associated items etched into the leather in coordinating colors. I like the traditional attached ribbon bookmark. My only complaint is that the gilded-edged pages tend to wear quite easily; even from gentle handling while reading, the gold has come off in places along the bottom and side.The stories are excellent. I truly enjoyed every single one, and often found myself thinking, \\"Okay, this will be the last one for the night...\\" and then I had to read another. I did not find any major typos during my reading. All in all, a great value for the money spent."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"The book is beautiful, and I appreciate having the stories in one volume. That being said, there are numerous misspelled words. I stopped counting after twenty-five. A visually appealing edition, but is it really so hard to correct the obvious typos?"},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"I bought the Kindle addition. Of couse the stories are great and i would rate 5-star but the text is filled with type errors. One other reviewer wrote there are no typos, but there are many. I own a hard copy of all of stories so it is easy for me to check. I didn't notice it at first, probably because of the many Britsh words and usages, but now it has become quite annoying.Also someone wrote there is no index. There is but it isn't the easiest to get toThe text to speech is terrible.Like I said, great stories. The price is right but look for a differnt version."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"i wish there were more... the only flaw is that the book is not in chronological order so it's hard to know when watson's living with holmes and when he gets married... it's always fun to know how holmes figures out every detail"},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"This book was everything I was looking for in a Sherlock Holmes collection. Unlike other ebooks for sale, this one's properly formatted and laid out, full of illustrations and includes a wonderful forward. If you're a Holmes fan, this is the book to get! Nicely done, guys. Great work."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"I purchased this EXACT same copy for $20 @ Barnes & Noble last summer... it is definitely a handsome book, but not worth anything near the $110 list price on here! I doubt the cover is genuine leather and the embossing is already beginning to peel on my copy; even though I read it often, I was hoping it would stand up to wear and tear a little better than it has. There are also several typos and very annoying \\"fixes\\" to a few of the Canon inconsistencies, such as the changing of the dates in Wisteria Lodge from 1892 to 1895.This is a great starter for someone who wants to read the complete short stories/novels, and does spruce up the bookshelf, but not the greatest or most accurate version. Besides that, the small print was hellish on my eyes."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"You simply can't beat getting every Sherlock Holmes story ever written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle for this price. This is a fantastic choice."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"A must for the library of all Sherlock Holmes fans. A stellar performance by David Timson, reading of all episodes in this set."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"It is a very good idea to publish all Sherlock Holmes' adventures in asingle volume.Everyone who likes to read about solving crime mysteries in VictorianEngland will be delighted.I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"Containing 56 short stories and 4 full-length novels, _The Complete Sherlock Holmes_ is thick. But it is well worth the reading. Beginning with \\"A Study in Scarlet\\" and concluding with \\"The Final Problem\\", the short stories were what drew my closest attention. (The novel \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" was a treat as well.)One immediately understands why Doyle's characters have endured so long - the characters are brilliantly written, the methods of solving the cases vary, and the variety of cases themselves run the gamut from international conspiracies, (\\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\" is a personal favorite) to missing persons, (I recommend \\"The Greek Interpreter\\") to lost objects and murder. The brilliance of Doyle's writing is further underscored by the manner in which the cases are resolved - not every criminal goes to prison, and in some instances the mystery / crime is not what readers are initially led to believe. Read them piecemeal or as a whole, you will be equally rewarded with tales that are simply fun and entertaining.As a previous reviewer remarked, the typeface is a bit small, which can be a strain - especially considering the engrossing nature of the stories. Nonetheless they are remarkably entertaining. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"This book certainly has all of Conan Doyle's Holmes stories and is easily searchable. I have two complaints: 1: there are lots of textual errors in the copy and 2: Doyle's original maps and drawings have been left out. If you are only interested in reading the stories, then this book is a great deal. On the other hand, if you are a Holmes conisseur, I recommend you spend a little more money and get a better edition."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"In this volume you will find all of Conan Doyle's complete stories of Sherlock Holmes and four novels (or really novellas). Most of the stories will keep you guessing and are fun reads to boot. The four novellas are like lengthened short stories. The first parts of the detective stories featuring Holmes and Watson while the last part are usually back story to explain the motivation for the parties who either hired Holmes or were the criminals themselves. If you are looking for detailed characterization you should look elsewhere, but if you enjoy short interesting events-centered stories you will really enjoy this book. This is great reading for those who like the continuity of reading a long book, but don't have the time to invest in something long. I found the Kindle edition especially helpful with the table of contents feature. There are a few typos, but it did not detract from the reading experience."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"I love a good mystery and Sherlock Holmes very rarely lets me down. I purchased the complete collection and now it's a wonderful addition to my growing library. Fans of mystery already know how wonderful Sherlock Holmes already is, fans of great writing should check it out too!"},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"The adventures of Sherlock Holmes are as exiting as they are mysterious. This collection of them is nicely packaged into two volumes. The first volume of this collection contains \\"A Study in Scarlet\\", \\"The Sign of Four\\", \\"Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\\", \\"Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes\\", and \\"The Hound of Baskervilles\\". All of these parts contain many plot twists and ingenious observations by Sherlock Holmes. Alongside him is Dr. Watson who catalogues these accounts in first person. The books go through the introduction of Watson and Holmes, to the revealing of Holmes' drug addiction, ending with Watson's marriage, while solving what seems to be the smallest, least important crimes. These grow into the most insidious plots. This is a great read that could be read again and again. It is a must have in any collection."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"I have only one beef with this edition of the book. NO PICTURES! If your funds are severely limited, then buy this edition only. It's complete and contains all the original stories. You can't go wrong buying this edition.If you do have extra bucks to spare and you're a newbie to S.H., I'd highly recommend you first buy \\"The Original Illustrated Sherlock Holmes\\" by Castle Books, ISBN: 0-7858-1325-X. It contains all 356 original illustrations by Sidney Paget as they appeared in the Strand Magazine. These illustrations define the enduring image of Holmes and Watson as we have of them today. Even the popular PBS series by Jeremy Brett duplicates scenes from these illustrations. Unfortunately, Paget did not illustrate the first two novels of S.H. and died before he can illustrate the later adventures. But the illustrations will add much greater depth and enjoyment to these stories.When you're finally done with the illustrated edition and you're still aching for more S.H., then get this complete edition to complete the adventures.And if you're like me, being a British rebel (an American) and having no real knowledge and experience of what life in Victorian England was about, an entertaining reference book is \\"The Bedside, Bathtub and Armchair Companion to Sherlock Holmes\\" by Riley and McAllister, ISBN: 0-8264-1116-9.This book can be read alongside your reading of each story of S.H. It gives a capsule summary of each adventure and lists some oddities and descrepancies to each story without giving away the ending. Also, it contains chapters which explains the life and times of Holmes' era and explains such things as monetary equivelents, etc. For someone like me who doesn't know a crown from a farthing to a sovereign, it clears up many areas of cultural difference and ignorance. This greatly enhances my enjoyment and understanding of these stories.The only reason I gave this book 4 stars was because I couldn't give it 4.5 stars. I just couldn't give it 5 stars because of the missing illustrations. A book which advertises that it's the \\"complete\\" S.H. should be complete and include the illustrations as they appeared in the Strand Magazine as originally published."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"This is THE best collection of this kind of all time! Once you've read the first page, you need to finish it. Now you don't have to buy all the books, because all of Sherlock Holmes's most famous (and infamous) cases are in this stupendous example of literature."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"Conan Doyle's stories about the sleuth Sherlock Holmes are often said to be timeless. If one has the imagination to immerse oneself in the dark underbelly of London, as Holmes puts it, they are.Even so, I was most disappointed in the first section of the Kindle version, as it contained many typos, misspelled words and wrongly-chosen words. Examples (with the correct word given after) -- \\"during my tern of service in India\\" [TERM of service or TURN of service], \\"not to common type\\" [TOO common], \\"a statesman wit the honorable record\\" [WITH - this one occurs several times, not in context of a loutish fop abbreviating his words.](I bookmarked only 30 or so errors but there are likely more that I did not catch as I often read before bed, so would not be most alert or motivated to bookmark them. Admittedly, some may indeed be the British version of words, which the dictionary failed to define, but others are obviously incorrect.)As it is, it reads as completely illiterate, which I am sure Conan Doyle was not. Grammar and spelling fanatics (literate folk) such as myself will feel they are being driven insane by the inept editing. (Can you say, \\"Eats, Shoots, and Leaves?\\") Also, there is no table of contents for individual chapters which allows the reader to go to a particular story within the novel, which I found annoying. (I bookmarked the beginning of each as I went for future reference.)The errors mercifully seem to decrease in the chapters after \\"The Final Problem\\". If these are corrected by the publisher/Amazon, this would be a five star collection of Sherlock Holmes stories. As it stands, it is still worth the 99 cents to read these wonderful tales of deduction, which are written in a style which has never and never will be duplicated or matched.Amazon, please correct the typos and provide a cleaned-up version for your readers!"},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"Awesome collection of classic Sherlock Holmes... Great read aloud for my 12 year old. However, I had to put it down after 1-1/2 stories because the text is truly microscopic. Not so small to never be read, but a good week or two for eye resting is recommended between stories."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"I'm sure you've read enough about how spectacular and fun the book is, so I'll try to stick with the little things that make the book so appealing. While the 4 novels become a bit long, and the short stories just a tad predictable, there are so many barely noticeable features that make ACD such an outstanding author. He creates full characters in a matter of paragraphs (for example, Prof. Moriarity is mentioned in only one story, yet he seems like such a complete and important character). Several times, Watson, the narrator, mentions cases that he cannot disclose to the public. It seems like nothing but it makes Watson seem both more credible and more real. I guess I'm just rambling now. Buy this book, you'll be thrilled."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"I loved this series. As soon as I read one Sherlock Holmes Adventure I absolutely had to read them all. No other cunning detectives I have ever read of compare to the legendary sleuth mind of SH. You can follow Holmes and Watson from the time they meet, through Watson's marriage, Holmes' cocaine habits, the death of Moriarty, to Holmes' retirement. If you love good mysteries you won't be able to put these down. The only problem is that ACD didn't write more."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"Thanks so much! The book was an astounding price with great shipping and it arrived in good time. Would definitely do business again."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"This book is grand.

Has all of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's work and come in a cool hardback."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"I love Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, as only a true \\"Sherlockian\\" can. One can never read the Complete Collection too many times, as we learn more from each re-read. Although I have several complete hard-cover sets of Sherlock Holmes (and the complete Jeremy Brett CD versions of many), the Kindle turns out to be a perfect instrument for a perfect read of Holmes. It is much smaller and lighter than the hard cover versions, and one can curl up in bed or on a trans-Atlantic airline flight, and read one or more stories as one chooses. Watson is certainly a dear old friend and companion, and although somewhat stuffy, I enjoy spending my hours with him. And Holmes - what can one say to adequately capture THE supreme detective. I delight in him and his incisive and inductive mind more and more with every reading (although his Cocaine use still disturbs me). I can only say: Read It, Enjoy It, It never grows old."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"The Sherlock Holmes stories are thoroughly entertaining and perfect for that long summer vacation. Over the course of reading them, you will immerse yourself in Victorian London, get to know the moody and brilliant Homes as well as you would a dear friend, solve (more likely, watch Holmes solve) clever mysteries, and be taken away to a world that will soon become more familiar to you than your own neighborhood. I have read these stories several times in my life and am now doing so again this summer. For 12$, I can't imagine a better, more economic entertainment. Most of the stories are excellent. A few strain the tacit agreement with the reader because they deliberately set you up to think one way and then pull the rug out from under you as the conclusion goes in a different direction. But this is quibbling. If you are looking for entertainment with a just bit of tweaking of your intellect, the Holmes stories will more than reward your investment!"},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read!!!!

Probably the worst printed book I have ever purchased. Printed words so close to the binding you can barely read them. I will definitely stay away from Bantam Books in the future."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes, by Sir Arthur Conan DoyleThese 1,122 pages contain the authorized text of every Sherlock Holmes story ever written. The copyrights to these stories expired around 1972 so any writer can appropriate the characters in new fiction. Yet no one has been able to equal, let alone surpass, A.C. Doyle in world-wide popularity. Has anyone analyzed these stories to understand their wide-spread appeal? Erle Stanley Gardner and Agatha Christie wrote more novels but were not as popular. One reason is the short stories about Sherlock Holmes were more amenable to wide distribution as in school books on literature. (Chesterton's short stories had a religious bent.) Their classic restraint made them preferable to the stories of Hammett and Chandler. Novels written for 19th century adults often became stories for 20th century children (as Mark Twain). [One technical problem is that one volume is less handy than two or three volumes.]The introduction by Christopher Morley tells of his admiration for these stories. The character of Sherlock Holmes was inspired by the famous Dr. Joseph Bell of the Edinburgh Infirmary whose diagnostic skills startled his patients and pupils. The name \\"Holmes\\" was homage to Oliver Wendell Holmes who first warned about practices that caused \\"puerperal fever\\". \\"Sherlock\\" was a common Irish name, Doyle's strike against prejudice. Doyle often fought against unjust convictions and for his other beliefs. Chesterton's comment about \\"a man who believes in nothing winds up believing in anything\\" was aimed at Doyle. He went from a Catholic to an agnostic to a believer in a spirit world. Aging can affect a person's mind and beliefs.There are four novels and five collections of short stories. The novels are: \\"A Study in Scarlet\\", \\"The Sign of Four\\", \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\", and \\"The Valley of Fear\\". The short stories are the \\"Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\\" (12 stories), the \\"Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes\\" (11 stories), \\"The Return of Sherlock Holmes\\" (13 stories), \\"His Last Bow\\" (8 stories), and \\"The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes\\" (12 stories). There are probably more books about Sherlock Holmes than about A. C. Doyle. Aside from legal considerations, it is easier to handle finite fiction than complex real life. Has anyone written books about \\"Hercule Poirot\\" or \\"Perry Mason\\"? The \\"James Bond\\" series goes on in new novels and action films but they are not as popular as the originals. Even fictional characters have a life-span."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"It was a good collection but it has multiple typos: spelling, punctuations, and quotations. It is missing ten short stories: ALMOST THE ENTIRE CASEBOOK OF SHERLOCK HOLMES excluding \\"the mazarin stone\\" and \\"the problem of thor bridge.\\" Other than that it is a great read and if they ever revise it I will be the first to get it."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"A while ago I was in England for a professional Conference, and was able to find time to make a day trip to London. On this occasion I took the opportunity to visit the Sherlock Holmes \\"House\\" and Museum on 221-B Baker Street, directly across from Regent's Park. It is a charming place, well worth the time to any admirer of the great detective. In particular, there were sprinkled throughout the walls and furniture of the Museum's cramped rooms, many written allusions and souvenirs which referred to various characters and plots associated with Sir Authur Conan Doyle's supreme literary creation. Although I had read his Sherlock Holmes stories as a youngster, I had apparently retained shockingly little of this material, as said Museum references triggered only a fraction of my memory. But my shameful ignorance at least provided me an excuse to reread \\"The Complete Sherlock Holmes\\", in volumes I and II. The (standard) edition I used is older - 1960 from Doubleday & Company - but of course, these two volumes have surely never been out of print, at least in paperback form.It is almost universally acknowledged, I should think, that Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes body of work makes for fantastic reading. I will try here to provide a brief justification as to why.My particular edition contains a forward by Christopher Morley. In a way, the first words of his foreword are the most relevant: \\"It was unfair of Conan Doyle to say...that Dr. Watson had never shown a gleam of humor nor made a single joke.\\" This is quite the understatement; inasmuch as Dr. Watson is essentially his alter ego, Conan Doyle with his remark was clearly engaging in self-deprecation. But in fact, within Dr. Watson's highly polished and coherent narratives, a strong strain of understated hilarity is often present in Conan Doyle's stories. It is this light comic touch which, blended with Dr. Watson's manifest sense of decency, makes Conan Doyle's stories so comforting and enjoyable to the reader. If asked to list some clever and witty novelists of the Regency or Victorian era, one might rattle off the names of Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, and William Thackeray; Sir Authur Conan Doyle would probably not come immediately to her or his mind. But nothwithstanding the often serious nature of Sherlock Holmes' detective and crime fighting work, Conan Doyle's masterful sense of the ridiculous flares up again and again in his stories.For example, in the short story \\"A Case of Identity\\", Sherlock Holmes ventures the opinion that everyday real life is much more capable than fiction of producing \\"fascinating\\" or \\"artistic\\" events. Dr. Watson is unconvinced: \\"Let us put your [thinking] to a practical test (says Dr. Watson). Here is the first heading [of the newspaper] upon which I come. 'A husband's cruelty to his wife'. There is half a column of print, but I know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude.\\"Dr. Watson is mistaken: \\"Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument\\", says Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. \\"This is the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it. The husband was a teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average story teller\\".As another example, consider \\"The Adventure of the Dying Detective\\", in which Dr. Watson's mentions the eternal sufferings of Mrs. Hudson, the wellknown landlady of Sherlock Holmes: \\"...Not only was her first-floor flat invaded at all hours by throngs of singular and often undesirable characters but her remarkable lodger showed an eccentricity which must have sorely tried her patience. His incredible untidiness, his addiction to music at strange hours, his occasional revolver practice within doors, his weird and often malodorous scientific experiments, and the atmosphere of violence and danger which hung around him made him the very worst tenant in London\\".The novels and short stories contained in these volumes are replete with such charming dialogue and observations of the ridiculous. Of course, the old Sherlock Holmes television series, with the incomparable Jeremy Brett, are very faithful to the substance, dialogue and plot of Conan Doyle's stories, and are moreover a true joy to watch (especially, uncut as they are on DVD); but to gain a true appreciation of the richness and breadth of Conan Doyle's biting wit and literary cleverness, these stories must absolutely be read directly. Given the current drift of popular cinema and reality television - which is, to put it mildly, a tendency to rather visceral plot lines (when there are plot lines) - the effect of Conan Doyle's beautifully wrought stories upon the modern reader is arguably much more powerful today, than when they initially appeared in the late Victorian World."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"The Holmes stories span a period from 1880 to 1914 (though most of the stories are set before 1903 -- Conan Doyle wrote them starting in 1892 through 1925). It is interesting to compare the original stories with the Basil Rathbone movies (which most of us are familiar with -- only two of which were based in any great way on the stories).Based on the stories, I would say that Rathbone's portrayal was right on; whereas Nigel Bruce's Watson was perhaps a bit more bumbling than that depicted in the stories.Another discovery was the references to America in the stories. Two stand out in my memory: in \\"A Study in Scarlet\\" almost half the book is a story within a story about mormons in Utah around the time of Brigham Young (although he is not specifically mentioned, several senior \\"bishops\\" are). Another story's key clue was \\"KKK\\", and I'm thinking Ku Klux Klan -- but it couldn't be? But it actually was about the clan (in Florida in 1869) -- also an interesting explanation of the derivation of the name \\"Ku Klux Klan\\" is given by Holmes.My main reason for reading these (even though they are crackling good stories in their own right) was to get a picture from the background of the state of technology in the 1880s and 90s. Electric lighting does not appear much, nor do autos. On the other hand in one of the earliest stories reference is made to the fact that there was a telephone at Scotland Yard. Fast travel is always by train, and fast communications is always by telegraph. Cars do appear in a few of the later stories.Kindle formatting was adequate; the table of contents (of a very large compound book) was helpful."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"I read all the Sherlock Holmes stories when I was a young teen. It was great fun then, and I still enjoy reading things like how Watson discovers Holmes is unaware that the earth goes about the sun. Holmes says the knowledge is useless to him, and he will endevor to forget it, and he likens the mind to an attic wherein, upon reaching some fullness, something must be removed if something else is to be added. And the relative values of the items must be evaluated. The collection would be a nice gift instead of another video game or DVD."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"The first Sherlock Holmes book I ever read was given to me as a gift for my thirteenth birthday. It was a collection of the short stories, with a wonderful leather trim and gold leafing, and I thought it was fantastic. I read the first story, and was instantly hooked. Within a few days, I was disappointed with my wonderful new book because it was incomplete. I had devoured all of the selected stories, and was ready for more.Shortly thereafter, I purchased what purported to be the 'only complete Sherlock Holmes available', compiled by Christopher Morley. This became my favourite book. However, I have continued to collect editions of the Sherlock Holmes stories, and this is one of those collections. It does contain all the short stories and all the novels. It does not have illustrations or other commentary, and the print (in a double-column format) is rather small, but it is nonetheless a useful text for those who don't want to have a heavier book in their hands.The original stories, which appeared in The Strand magazine, were illustrated, by the great illustrator Sidney Paget.From the beginning introduction of Holmes and Watson to Holmes' gentle retirement to beekeepping on the southern coast of England, this book contains all the essential stories (none of the apocryphal, anecdotal, or tribute-written pieces are contained here). Holmes was often thought to be a real person, and Sherlockians the world over still search for 'evidence' to prove that he was. During his 'lifetime', the post office for the Baker Street area regularly received mail addressed to Holmes or Watson at 221B Baker Street. While such an address does not (and did not during the late Victorian era) exist, there is a business on the site that would be 221B, and they have dedicated a desk to Holmes, and strive to answer mail received in the great detective's name.Perhaps the two elements that made Holmes and Watson the world-renowned figures that they became are, first, the dominance of the British Empire globally at the time Conan Doyle was writing, which made English things sought-after, admired, and to be emulated, and secondly, the introduction of a method of detection hitherto unknown, both in the annals of detective stories (save perhaps in a proto-form in Poe and a few other obscure pieces of dubious literary merit) and in real life.Holmesian tales became required reading in the training of police and detectives in many parts of the world. It is still recommended even when it is not required.Holmes permeates other literature and venues as well. When Data on Star Trek: The Next Generation looks for images of Holmes, he is being guided by the descriptions in the stories as well as by the illustrations in The Strand. When the BBC produced Jeremy Brett's rendering of Holmes, the same holds true. When Basil Rathbone's films were cast, these illustrations and stories were uppermost in the directors' minds.So, pull some tobacco from your persian slipper, stoke your pipe, scratch out a tune on your violin, and re-enter the gas-lit world of the foggy London, where danger is afoot and one detective can always save the day."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"THE COMPLETE SHERLOCK HOLMES is an anthology of every Sherlock Holmes story ever written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. This single volume is an absolute treasure; it reveals to us one of the most influential and powerful characters conceived of in the history of literature. Holmes' many adventures manage to transcend the boundaries of the mystery genre and set their permanent mark on the fabric of Western society. The now cliche \\"Elementary, my dear Watson\\" reveals how both the sheer genius of Holmes and the unwavering loyalty of Watson have been forever integrated into our collective memory.If you have ever read Sherlock Holmes in your life and have enjoyed it, please pick up a copy of this book. Reading it again will merely add to your enjoyment. The astounding revelations and brilliant logic of Holmes never lose their novelty.If you have never read Sherlock Holmes, you have truly missed out on one of the memorable characters in English literature. I urge you to purchase this book immediately. You will not be disappointed.In summary, THE COMPLETE SHERLOCK HOLMES is a must buy for those who do not already own it. I give it my highest recommendation!"},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"&quot;The Complete Sherlock Holmes&quot;, written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyal, is one of the best books I've read. It's right up there with Stories like &quot;Great Expectations&quot;. My personal favorite of all the short stories is &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles.&quot; It is a real spine tingler, and kept me on the edge of my seat through the whole thing. If you like scary movies and books, this fits in that catagory perfectly."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"It was encouraging to see a complete Sherlock Holmes set on Kindle. But although it is readable, Kindle makes frequent mistakes about location and reverts to other books when moving from chapter to chapter in one selection. I gave up trying to read when it would inexplicably made a hyperspace leap to another unnamed book or short story and require careful searching to find the actual volume and page I had just been reading. This Kindle edition needs to be fixed or junked. It ain't worth even a buck as is."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"I just downloaded the Kindle version last night, and was a little perturbed once I reviewed the table of contents (yes, there is one!) and saw that the last couple short stories, which are from The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes, are the only 2 from that collection! There are 10 short stories MISSING from this \\"complete collection\\". I noticed in some older reviews that 56 short stories are referenced - is this a newer version that only has 46 short stories? I think it's an excellent price ($0.99) for MOST of the collection, but I've knocked off 2 stars for the blatant false advertisement of being the complete collection. Now I'm going to have to spend more just to get the rest of the Case-Book. Disappointing."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"In Sherlock Holmes, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle created one of the world's best known and (arguably) most fully realized literary characters. Since Doyle's death, there have been plenty of people writing knockoffs of his stories. But with rare exceptions (Nicholas Meyer comes to mind), most have not lived up to the high standards Doyle set in at least the best of his Holmes tales.This volume includes the complete canon of Doyle's original stories -- four novels and fifty-six short stories, from &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot; to &quot;His Last Bow.&quot; While there are a handful of cases that bore significantly on international affairs (e.g. &quot;The Bruce-Partington Plans&quot;), most of them are of interest simply because of that touch of the _outre_ that Holmes loved so much and that provided such stimulating material to the ideal reasoner.There are some clunkers in the canon, of course, but the vast majority of these stories -- especially the earliest ones -- are just brilliant. If you are reading them for the first time, I envy you; the sturdy Dr. John Watson is about to introduce you to a new world, a world of Victorian gaslight and Stradivarius violins, of hansom cabs and cries of &quot;The game's afoot!&quot;For in reading this volume you will find such classic tales as &quot;The Red-Headed League&quot; and &quot;The Man With The Twisted Lip&quot;; you will encounter the famous dog that did nothing in the night-time (&quot;Silver Blaze&quot;) and several versions of Holmes's favorite maxim (&quot;When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth&quot;); and you will meet one of the most fascinating and memorable characters ever to spring from the printed page: Holmes himself.Perhaps most importantly, you will catch a glimpse of the world as an ideal reasoner might see it -- not as a grab-bag of random atomic facts in which our own role is negligible, but as a vast interconnected whole in which each part bears some necessary relation to the rest, and in which the reasoned pursuit of justice in all matters great and small is the business of each and every one of us.Incidentally, the twentieth-century philosopher who presented that vision most consistently and cogently is, to my own mind, Brand Blanshard, and any Holmes readers who are interested in philosophy may enjoy investigating Blanshard's works as well."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"Back in the 1990s, I discovered the excellent Jeremy Brett filmed episodes of Sherlock Holmes...and that experience led me to the stories themselves. I then ended up reading all 56 short stories and 4 novels in short order.There's a reason the character of Sherlock Holmes is remembered, some 125 years after his debut!!!As one preface mentioned, Conan Doyle did not know how to write a dull sentence. Which is a very true statement. Virtually all of these stories are gripping ones, but even the lesser ones -- mainly the ones Conan Doyle wrote toward the end -- are so atmospheric, that your enjoyment is scarcely lessened.Read these tales!! You won't be disappointed!!!"},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"Every Holmes fan has more than one version of the Canon, and this should be among the collection as your standard 'reading copy.' Until I discovered this edition, my favorite reading version was the 1970s Ballantine editions (with great introductions ranging from Joe Gores to Ellery Queen to P.G. Wodehouse)--but sadly, that edition is out of print, and never contained the final two Conan Doyle books anyway. This oversized paperback aptly fills the modern role of a definitive edition.As for the stories themselves, you simply can't go wrong in rediscovering or reading Holmes for the first time. Sure, Conan Doyle's stories sometimes lacked an internal logic (my favorite tale, 'The Adventure of the Red-Headed League,&quot; is riddled with plot holes). But there's a reason these have remained as classics that have never gone out of popular fashion, over a hundred years since publication: they're entertaining, cleverly written, wonderfully detailed, and often edge-of-your-seat thrilling. Included are all 57 short stories (ideal for a quite hour in your armchair, or for a commute during which you can escape to Victorian London) and the four longer novels (the most popular of which is &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles,&quot; but don't pass up the sublime and underrated &quot;The Valley of Fear&quot;). This is the ideal book for a long vacation (especially to London!), and, if I were stranded on a desert island, this is the book I'd want most with me (well, after that 'How to Build an Island-Escaping Raft from Coconuts' book).If you haven't discovered Sherlock Holmes, this is the edition of his adventures to buy. If you read Conan Doyle long ago but haven't picked him up since, this is the edition to buy. If you've got several other Sherlock Holmes books on your shelf but want a single-volume complete edition, this is the edition to buy. As it's been said, 'There's no police like Holmes.'"},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"I find that most &quot;Complete Collections&quot; tend to be presentation copies meant to look pretty on bookshelves rather than to be read. Nothing wrong with this, unless you actually want to enjoy the stories.This set of the complete Sherlock Holmes is a highly readable and portable collection. The stories are split into two paperback novels, of the spinner-rack size, collected in a slim box. The type is standard size, so there is no loss in cramming them all into these two volumes. No frills here, just the stories.As to the content, of course all of Doyle's Sherlock Holmes tales are delicious. I look forward to enjoying old favorites, and discovering new gems in this complete collection."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"We all know that these are the best detective stories ever, so I'll contain my review to this book.It is the only one volume edition. The Holmes canon consists of four novels :Hound of the Baskervilles, Sign of Four, Study in Scarlet, and Valley of Fear, and five collections of short stories: Adventures of S.H., Memoirs of S.H., Return of S.H., His Last Bow, and Casebook of S.H. These are often published separately, but this Doubleday edition contains every one of them in one package.If you're really into measuring footprints and analyzing cigarette ash then this is the book you need."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"Of course it's good, it's Sherlock Holmes. This edition of the stories is particularly nice because it's not a cumbersome hardback behemoth of a book. It's portable. Sherlock Holmes is the greatest detective of all time. The stories are fast-paced, interesting, and at times humorous. Like any other collection of stories it's got a couple ones that aren't as good as the others, but in such a large collection, it's easy to overlook those. Holmes is an extremely fascinating character, and you will never tire of reading about him. Doyle's writing is no where near as boring as other Victorian writers. Forget all those goofy Basil Rathbone films and charicatures of a man in an ulster and deerstalker. This is the real thing."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"I loved reading this collection! However, there were so many typos that it was distracting: sometimes 2 to a standard page. The typos were not \\"old English\\" spellings, but were all typos that would not be picked up by a spell checker. For example, the word \\"know\\" was spelled as \\"now,\\" and \\"there\\" was spelled as \\"here.\\" I highly recommend the Sherlock Holmes series, but would get a different version. It would be worth the extra few cents to get a cleaner copy."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"When I was in 8th grade, I had to read &quot;Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; for class, and given the yawners we had been made to read otherwise, I wasn't looking forward to much from this. I expected another boring book by some dead English guy -- and boy was I shocked! It remains the best novel I've ever read, and I still return to it from time to time. After the PBS Holmes series with Jeremy Brett, I finally bit the bullet and bought the entire collection, and it still surprises me how great they are. If anyone out there is curious but afraid of being bored or wasting your money -- don't worry about that. Just get these stories and race through them and you'll be glad you did.Another comment that I have to make is Doyle's ability to write women characters. A lot of authors nowdays don't write good women -- they're either harpies, bimbos, or doormats. Doyle, this man from Edwardian England, writes people, sympathetic or otherwise, and his female characters are very real and very, very well done. There aren't many authors that cover everything -- sensitive characterization, awareness of people in this world who aren't just like them, an ability to put together a top notch plot, and the ability to write REALLY well. Doyle was one -- snag these stories and devour them as soon as you can!"},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"All the stories of Sherlock Holmes are crammed onto 472 pages (without the T of C), each page measuring 10.7&quot; by 7.5&quot;. My first impression, on opening the book, was that a gray mist had been sprayed on each page. Looking closer, I realized the gray stuff was the text. I will not subject myself to this sort of eye strain, and suggest you don't either.The previous edition was over 1,100 pages. The Amazon preview pages for this volume loaded so slowly I gave up trying to see them, and wasted my money on this illegible copy. Don't buy it, would be my recommendation. Try to find the earlier, green-covered book, with larger print and over twice as many pages."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"I love Sherlock Holmes, and thought this would be a great thing at a great price.Trouble is, it doesn't look all that great on the Kindle. They don't use typesetter's quotes (smart quotes), and so it looks more like an old DOS screen than a book, especially given how much dialog is in these books. Other books on the Kindle look a lot better.If you care about your ebooks looking like books, don't get this edition.I recommend this edition instead:The Complete Sherlock Holmes (Collection of all his adventures; 9 Volumes in one Book)"},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"I have known about Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson through T.V. and movies but I have never read the stories so one day I decided to buy a book with all of their stories. I saw a few different ones some were big or fancy or they were hardcover which made them a little expensive and I was only interested in the stories and not the book itself. Then I came across this cheap 2 book edition which comes in a thin case. The cases that Sherlock Holmes try to solve are usually intersting or odd and very few of them deal with murder. Sometimes it gets confusing with all the clues and information but that's not too big of a problem for me because I just get caught up in the story. Most of the stories are told from Dr. Watson's standpoint who unlike his T.V. counterpart isn't overweight and he doesn't get in the way of things but instead he is thin and quite the ladies man. Sherlock Holmes is also a very interesting character and is very intelligent but lacks simple knowledge in things that don't concern his profession, he takes cocaine and is at times full of himself.So if you're interested in reading all of Sherlock Holmes's stories at a cheap price then you should get this 2 volume edition."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"The Sherlock Holmes Canon, all of Conan Doyle's original stories, all in one volume... what can possibly be better? Fresh as they were the day they were written, a challgenge for every original thinker and logical reasoner... and shedding an interesting light on Victorian London in general. A must."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"This collection of stories about the famed detective Sherlock Holmes and his faithful \\"sidekick\\" Watson is truly a timeless classic. It is filled with intrigue, mystery, romance, vengeance and ,ultimately, murder. Its beautifully constructed plot and the whole motive of the murder, the clues and the amazing deductive powers of Sherlock Holmes will hardly fail to entertain you and keep you craving for more. Not only will you find crime and punishment on these pages, but also the unique world (the 19th century England) and personalities (cold-blooded Holmes and always left behind Watson) which Doyle has created.There is one downside to this marvellous classic. When you are done reading the book and there are no more adventures to consume you will feel nostalgic. One could only wish to relax in the comfort of an armchair in front of a fireplace while a rainstorm rages outside and Sherlock Holmes is patiently absorbing the details of another case, on No. 221B Baker Street"},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"This is the most engaging fiction I have ever read. It's disappointing to finish it all, because I don't know where to find anything better. The stories all have elements of the bizarre and incredible which make them all unique. Holmes is the most three dimensional character in fiction. The writing is ingenious: always easy to follow, but beautifully descriptive.The four novels are wonderful. For some reason, I don't feel as strongly about The Sign of Four, but the others are among the best writing ever. A Study in Scarlet has a cinematic sweep that spans two continents. The segment in historical Utah is some of my favorite of Doyle's writing ever, showing that he can be brilliant even without featuring Holmes and Watson. The Hound of the Baskervilles is a surreal self-contained nightmare, almost gothic in its gloomy, dark setting on the moor. The Valley of Fear again includes a backstory set in old America, featuring perhaps Doyle's singularly best story ever.If you are at all like me, you will not be able to put this down and you will treasure this forever."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"Reading Sherlock Holmes is like consuming a huge box of chocolates. You want to eat them all at once because they are so wonderful, yet you don't want to finish the box because there are no more after that. What a decision! Well...eat the whole box, wait a year and read them all again!We need more writers like Doyle. We have too many politically correct, bubble book softies who want to please society to make a fortune! This alters a person's writing and reduces it to mush. I like the classics because they are uncompromising, original and no where near politically correct. Sherlock Holmes stories are the best!"},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"It's amazing how many other books and films and stage performances are made about sherlock holmes, even today. one only needs to turn to these originals to understand the immense popularity of these victorian stories. most importantly, it is the characters who stand out and above. sherlock holmes and dr. john h. watson. what more can be said of them? they are simply the best! they are so real and consistant in character i can't believe they're fictional most of the time.i esp. admire that one and only sherlock holmes, justly described by his friend as &quot;the best and the wisest man... ever knew&quot;. may the spirit of the Canon live on!"},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"I give it a 4 star only because there is an occasional clunker story in here. Overall most of the stories are 5 stars if taken individually. ACD, along with a few other contemporaries, influenced an entire genre of authors.The plots are ingenious. The early-middle period is the best plotted/written of the series. The Adventures... are perfect in nearly every way. Nothing can reproduce the excitement of waiting for &quot;The Speckled Band&quot; in the night with Holmes and Watson, of wondering what it means that the dog did not bark in the nighttime, and trying to decode the dancing men. I was first introduced to Holmes and Watson via the Hound when I was in 4th grade, and have never looked back. It literally opened up a new world to me.In addition to the wonderful plots, the relationship between Holmes and Watson makes interesting reading. Beneath the gruff exterior, Holmes has much affection and even admiration for Watson. May we all have a relationship as close and endearing in our lifetimes.The game is afoot!"},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"This is a great book for sherlock fans!! All I can say is you gotta get it!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"I almost always like to hear or read people's narration of their past experiences and this book has exactly what i want. I found it difficult to put it down because of the suspense Dr.Watson provides through his interesting narrative. One drawback i may point out here is that Holmes says &quot;May you do us an honor of providing a detailed account of your most singular and most extroadinary event&quot;.(this might not be exactly what he says since he words it differently) I got very irratated after seeing it many times."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"Everyone who's ever muttered &quot;Elementary, my dear Watson&quot; (which, by the way, Holmes never actually says in so many words) should buy this extremely well-priced edition and read it through. It's not only jolly fun, but enlightening: the Hollywood stereotype of Holmes and Watson is a gross caricature of Conan Doyle's characters. Watson is an average man with an average intelligence, and the point of his being there is to serve as a foil for Holmes' vastly superior intellect; if he's depicted as a fool, the point is lost. Likewise, Holmes and Watson are about the same age and grow old together, whereas in the movies Watson often looks like Holmes' grandfather. And as for the usual film plots -- forget it; Conan Doyle came up with far more ingenious, fiendishly difficult mysteries than the scriptwriters ever conceived, and solved them far more plausibly. These stories are true classics, and should be on everyone's list of must-reads."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"Sherlock Holmes, the great consulting detective, hardly needs an introduction, nor do his stories need a synopsis. This hardcover edition of &quot;The Complete Sherlock Holmes&quot; contains all the original Sherlock Holmes short stories and novels published by Conan Doyle.As such, this book is the perfect compilation of a timeless classic, for both those re-reading these wonderful stories or those discovering them for the first time. In addition to this, I loved the cover art of this particular edition - it gives just the right impression and captures the ambience of the tales.The only negative comment I had (hence the 4 star rating) was with the actual presentation of the book. Unfortunately, the publishers have attempted to cram all the stories into a 480-page book. This has resulted in an oversized hardcover, with rather small font, and worst of all, newspaper-style columns on each page. Perhaps the intention was to emulate the original format of the stories as they appeared in The Strand in the late 1800s. Regardless, the book format is therefore slightly unwieldy because of its size and is a little hard to read.Despite this shortcoming, I'd recommend this classic collection to anyone and this edition is definitely worth the price."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"Artur Conan Doile's Sherlock Holmes is amazing. I enjoy following Holmes' deductions, made by his incredible mind, based upon the smallest details, not observed by anyone else, leaving Watson behind in his own conclusions.The whole book is based upon Watson's narrative of Holmes' crime solving career. Holmes and he travel to solve the cases which have been abandoned by government officials. Watson describes Holmes' investigations and observations, giving way to Holmes' powerful mind and being lost himself(in the deductions that is). It is incredible how the smallest details become the most important ones in solving an intricate case.The cases are told through the &quot;mist&quot; in Watson's mind. He is never able to keep up and follow Holms' deductive train of thoughts. He is usually left behind by Sherlock Holmes and the reader, of course.Sherlock Holmes can be viewed as a piece of a puzzle to make a perfect human. His calmness and mind trained in some aspects should be an example for many to follow. Disregard Holmes arrogance, coldness, and selfishness,add a few characteristics and you have an almost perfect human.In overall this book is a must read. It is full of adventure and intrigue. Personally, I enjoy this book because yu can actually try and solve the mystery yourself(with enough details given, that is.) Read this, you won't regret the tme you have spent on it."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"From our first encounter with Sherlock Holmes in Conan Doyle's introductory novel, A Study in Scarlet, we are fascinated by the uniqueness of Holmes' eccentric character and personality, his incredible intelligence and powers of observation in all things concerning the solving of difficult criminal cases, his total dedication to his craft, and the enormous resources of energy and determination he calls on to solve problems that baffle the best minds of the London police and Scotland Yard. Sherlock Holmes is a consulting detective. He is the court of last appeal when the police, government officials, and private citizens can find help nowhere else. What makes Holmes special is not only his vast knowledge related to crime and the master criminal, like the infamous Professor Moriarty, but also his incredible powers of observation and deduction, which he uses in every story and novel to the amazement of his friend and colleague Dr. Watson and the various police detectives who seek out his help to solve a difficult case.Conan Doyle is a fine write who wanted to turn his attention to other projects and so he decided to kill Holmes at a least meeting with Professor Moriarty at the Reichenbach Falls in the Alps in The Adventure of the Final Problem. As we might expect, Holmes is not so easily disposed of. The demand of the public for more stories prompted Conan Doyle to bring back his famous detective from what seemed like certain death.The late Jeremy Brett brought Holmes to life in the celebrated PBS series on Mystery. I recommend not only the Complete Stories and Novels, but also Brett's interpretation of the greatest of all fictional detectives."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"I won!t spend hours saying how marvelous these stories are, you can read all that in other reviews. All I want to say, is that if you start reading Sherlock Holmes stories, it will become a passion. It will give you a new way of thinking about a lot of things, and it will give yous something to do in your free time. It is also important to say here, that this unabridged edition is written in 19th century British english, and it!s really exciting to actually speak this language, because its special slang is like a landmark of the atmosphere of Victorian England. Also, you will be able to read books from great author (such as Dickens) that you thought you never would be able to understand. Sherlock Holmes is a hobby, a passion and a lifestyle"},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is remarkable; a literary genieus! you'll read for hours on end because once you start, you CAN'T stop. Sherlock Holmes is a genieus in his line but he does have a sense of humor. I have yet to find even 1 book that is more thrilling.

After a while, I'd forget what happened with the stories so it is always very fun to read them again. It is easy to read and suspenseful. I especially liked the long stories in there. They had some quite twisty and unexpected characters and endings. I'd recommend this to anyone that enjoys detective type of stories."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"Besides the obvious great things all of these stories contain, (deduction, cool cases, the cocaine) I think the best thing Conan Doyle provides is a fabulous charictor discription of Sherlock Holmes. He is, by far, one of the most complicated charictors ever portrayed...even though it gets a little monotonous when Watson says for the thousanth time: he was never known to betray emotion of any kind, but... A GREAT read, and a book that will entertain for years to come."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"Anyone not familiar with all of Doyle's Sherlock Holmes is truly missing out.

There were a few excellent choices but I selected Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes and bought the Barnes and Noble 2009 edition of The Complete Sherlock Holmes.Sir Aurthur Conan Doyle was an Scottish eye doctor who lived 1859-1930 and was a master story teller and INMO the creator of the best ever detective/mystery character Sherlock Holmes and sidekick/assistant Dr. Watson. Sir Aurthur Conan Doyle also wrote the epic \\"Lost World\\" and the Professor Challenger series ,and some horror and vampire stories and more. One of my favorite authors. What an imagination!All Doyle's Sherlock Holmes novels and short stories are excellent and we are told he really didn't want to write unless he put out superb quality in his characters and plots. Originally he only wanted to write at the most 3 stories about Sherlock Holmes and kill him off and write other novels but his works were greatly accepted and his publishers wanted MORE and MORE and were willing to pay Doyle more and more.His complete group of Sherlock Holmes novels and short stories collectively has been the second greatest read collection world wide of all time. Over 100 countries and many many languages these have been published in. Millions and millions published. Only the Bible has been read more!This 2009 edition by Barnes and Noble is leather bound and has a beautiful engraved front and back cover, faux gold edge paper and a gold colored place holder ribbon. Excellent quality. Its 1077 pages of great reading.Do yourself a favor, relax and slowly enjoy it. I used the stories as a mental exercise to see if I could solve the cases by the clues Doyle gives though Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. After a while you learn a little of how Sherlock's mind works in seeing the smallest clues that others find unimportant. After a few of the stories I was able to solve about 20% of the cases using the clues before 2/3s of the story was finished. Of course keep on reading the story. Just sheer enjoyment.My favorite was The Hound of the Baskervilles but ALL of the novels and short stories were 5 star.I liked that Sherlock Holmes never tried to make a big name of himself but gave Scotland Yard and other police agencies credit for the crimes he solved. Sherlock even declines knighthood and took many cases from poor people just because the case was interesting to him. Also Holmes solves some delicate international cases involving heads of state. All kinds of cases; some small and some huge in scope. Some cases he pockets huge multi thousand pound fees from some very rich and powerful people. Throughout most of Holmes 20 plus years as a private investigator , his friend Dr. Watson stays true as his best friend and helper. When Holmes was not on a case and using his fantastic brain power of deduction and reasoning he got very bored and injected himself numerous times with a 7% cocaine based serum. He was a part time drug addict for a while. Holmes battles the evil super smart, ultra villain Professor Moriarty. Later in life Holmes retires in the country in England as a bee keeper but still solves a few crimes.Sir Arthur Conan Doyle INMO created one of the most comprehensive, detailed characters in Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. The reader can really empathise with both these characters.There is A Study in Scarlet part 1 and 2, The Sign Of The Four, 12 stories in The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes, 11 stories in The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes, 13 stories in The Return of Sherlock Holmes, my favorite The Hound of the Baskervilles, The Valley of Fear Part 1 and 2, 8 stories in His Last Bow and 12 stories In The Case of Sherlock Holmes.Try solving the cases with the clues given...its a lot of fun and tickles the gray matter.This book proudly goes in our family library as the top detective/mystery book of all time and in the top 40 classics. Highest rating 5 stars plus. I liked this book so much, I plan to buy the Lost World and the Professor Challenger series and Doyle's Vampire and Supernatural collection."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"I purchased this item at Amazon for my Kindle.

It's interesting and a good read. I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"The seller shipped quite quickly, and I was pleased at how soon it came. Amazing book set, I would recommend to anyone that they should read all of Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes novels and short stories. Sir Doyle was very ahead of his time in writing these books; that being said, no murder mysteries written today can compare. I see so many young girls watching the Robert Downey Jr. Sherlock films, swooning over the actor himself with no knowledge of the root of the story. The closest adaption to these books that I have seen that actually manages to capture the raw emotion Sir Doyle put forth in his stories is the BBC series, Sherlock. Though this review isn't about the TV show, I still highly recommend it. All the same, if you're a reader and skipping these books, you're missing one of the greatest stories of all time. Holmes and Watson's amazing chemistry is, in part, why these stories are so beautifully emotional. Five stars is all I could give this set, but I'd give it more if I could."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"This book should be considered a required part of living. I was 11 when i first got into Sherlock Holmes, having found an old book in the attic, an original hardcover containing 4 stories and beautiful illustrations. I then pestered my mum for the omnibus of Sherlock Holmes which I read in 2 months (I was 11 after all) I didn't understand a lot of the words so i had my trusty pocket dictionary by my side. I couldn't ask my mum, she's a hairdresser. Even though i was on a little Spanish-speaking island called Tenerife, whenever I read the exciting tales of Holmes and his faithful friend Watson I was transported back to Victorian England and on the chase!Now I'm 18, having visited the Sherlock Holmes museum in London and read sir Arthur Conan Doyles' other works, including theatre plays and parodies I can consider myself a complete Connoisseur.If the only Holmes you know has been the televised version you don't know what you're missing. Get this book now!!!But I worn you, its addictive reading so you might get a few shoes thrown at you to snap you out of it."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"Anyone who is at least moderately interested in mystery stories should make an effort to make themself familiar with Sherlock Holmes. It is widely known that Holmes is one of the best fictional detectives ever, but it it surprising how many people have not actually read any of his stories. The Gramercy Books edtion of the Complete Sherlock Holmes (ISBN 0517220784) is probably the best deal as it is the cheapest hardcover edition I have been able to find (Holmes deserves hardcover). This is definitely a book that any self-respecting mystery lover will locate on his shelf. One small note is that the print is a little on the small side (newspaper size) and is in two columns, but this merely allows the book to avoid being an oversized monstrosity like some other editions are."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes, by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, has been one of the most enjoyable books I have read. The style of the book drew me in and held my attention throughout. Doyle created masterful characters in Sherlock Holmes and his friend Watson, who assisted Holmes in some of his cases. It is from the perspective of Watson that the book was written, supposedly his chronicles of the cases. There are 60 tales in the thousand-some pages of the book, each having a unique plot, and only similar through the style of the author. The author seemed to greatly like the word \`singular', which is a very prominent word in his character's vocabulary. However, the word is not so very prominent that is becomes too repetitive, and is overlaid between uses by mystery plots, which captivate the reader, and excellent writing.One of my favorite stories was A Study in Scarlet, Sherlock's debut. The tale begins by describing the events that connected Sherlock Holmes and Watson, and paints a portrait of Sherlock, his erratic habits, and his curious lifestyle. Doyle describes his characters very well, not leaving out details, yet still leaving some room for imagination: just the perfect mix of the two. A Study in Scarlet has the most complex and attracting plot of the Sherlock Holmes stories I have read, especially in the chain of events, which are so valued by Holmes, leading up to the climax. These events are illustrated in detail in the second part of the account, clearing up all the fine details which Sherlock or the reader couldn't capture.I would recommend this book to those who enjoy good writing, capital characters, and stories of complex design. However, I don't think The Complete Sherlock Holmes would be a good book for people who are bored without fast paced or action oriented reading, because the book sometimes takes its time to get where it's going. It's not quite Dickens or Shakespeare, but I thought it was excellent reading nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"If you are going to read mysteries, this is the place to start. Here are the deductions from cigarette ash, the impossible cases and the \\"elementary Watson's\\" that have become so famous. While the stories are anything but realistic, Doyle makes the impossible plausible and, despite all of the parodies and criticisms, the stories are actually passably believable. Of course, there is still plenty of suspension of disbelief, but if it was absolute realism that you wanted you wouldn't read this book in the first place. The short stories are fast paced and straightforward. The collection includes Doyle's forays into third person writing and stories told by Holmes himself, but neither is anywhere near as good as those narrated by Dr. Watson. The novels vary in quality. The Hound of the Baskervilles is, of course, the classic and A Study in Scarlet (in which Holmes and Watson make their first appearance) is good mostly as an introduction to the characters. It starts well enough, with Holmes doing what he does best, but there is a long story-within-the-story which drags on and on and is, of all things, extremely insulting to Mormons. It should also be noted that the narration can be very racist by modern standards, no worse than any contemporary writing but not much better. Still, this is a must-read for any serious mystery reader and most casual ones."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"This item was ordered for my son. He is still reading it and he says he enjoys reading this book very much. The stoies are real good and he is glad that I was able to fulfill his request and send him this book. The Complete Sherlock Holmes book is a Classic and I was vey glad that Amazon had this in stock. I am very pleased with Amazon's products and mailing service."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"I like to listen to audiobooks. I purchased these from an Amazon seller and considerably less than the regular price, and I got a fantastic bargain. It is good value at full retail price, and every price in between.I cannot really add much to the wonders of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's magnificent detective and works. They stand on their own merits, and should be read by everyone. I wish to review the audiobooks.We are talking 60 CD's here. Almost 73 hours. It is the unabridged version. I will not willingly listen or read anything else. I want to hear the author. I was a bit leery, because I was unfamiliar with David Timson, the narrator. This is not the price of a cup of coffee. No worries. He is excellent. He reads at a proper speed, so he is easily understood, without being too slow. As with all excellent readers, you forget the voice, you're listening to a book, with nothing between you and the words. There are violin interludes at appropriate moments, including at the beginning of the CD, and, perhaps, between chapters. Again, just the right amount. The speed is right for the time it was written. It moves forward, but there is time to listen to some gracious musical interludes. I have ripped many to listen on my mp3 player, and it is nice that the volume is low. Sometimes a CD is too loud for even the lowest setting pn my mp3 player.As far as I know, all the stories are here. I believe they are presented in order, which is nice. Starts with A Study in Scarlet and ends with The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes. All the discs are in one box, each disc in a separate thin cardboard envelope with no flap, but with a printed cover telling what number CD it is in the whole order, along with the title of the collection, if any, and a list of the tracks with titles. They sit in a sturdy box. Also included in the box is a 200 page 'booklet' the size of one of the CD envelopes. The first 70 pages list all the CD's and their tracks, including the title of the story(ies) on the CD. The next 100 pages consist of an analysis, discussion, slight blurb for each of the stories, written by David Timson. I've just read a few, and they add a lot to the stories, because they tend to tell what was going on at the time in Arthur Conan Doyle's life, among other things. Possible reasons why Doyle was not nice to Mormons, for example. Not only is Timson a good narrator, he knows his Sherlock, and it comes through in his reading, and also in the commentary in the booklet.So, a good listen, in good form, booklet is informative, and if you get this, you don't need any other Sherlock Holmes CD's."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"Had a searchable table of contents, quite a few spelling errors, but fantastic to have entire original works in one collection. great read, good short stories perfect for at night."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"Recently I had the pleasure of listening to an audio cd of The Complete Sherlock Holmes (Classics Fiction) by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and sold by: pbshopus through Amazon.com and read by David Timson. You can turn this on and sit back with closed eyes and you are almost there. His voice characterizations are a great addition to the stories. I would recommend this audio cd to any Sherlock Holmes fans, especially to anyone who has trouble reading or ageing eyes. If you have never read any Sherlock Holmes detective stories now would be a great time to start."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"I greatly enjoyed reading the short stories of Sherlock Holmes on the kindle.

Usually, collections like this are poorly put together with unnecessary frills and padding. Here we have nothing but pure gold.Anyone who likes mystery, or literature must read the cannon of Holmes. See the famous expressions like \\"the game is a foot\\", and \\"when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable must be the truth\\"... Most enjoyable to me are Holmes amazing observations -where he looks at someone and can tell what they had for breakfast, and where they were a week ago from the dust on their shoes. It's really a fun read!So, if you want to solve the mystery of what to read next, the answer is elementary my good friends... Buy this book!Relic113"},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"Anyone who has any interest in literature should read at least most of the original Sherlock Holmes stories. Not only are these great jigsaw puzzles that challenge the reader's imagination, but they collectively construct one of the greatest characters ever to be conceived. Holmes is far from the flat intellectual personality that one might imagine, or as he is sometimes portrayed on screen.Some of my favorites:The Red-headed LeagueThe Man with the Twisted LipThe Adventure of the Six NapoleonsThe Problem of Thor BridgeThis book does use a very small font (as others have mentioned), this didn't present any problems for me, but I can imagine how it would for others. There are also a few more typos than usual. But nevertheless, 5 stars as I enjoyed reading it and will probably read it several times more."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"These two volumes contain the complete collection of the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's adventures of the world's most famous super sleuth, Sherlock Holmes. For any mystery reader, the Sherlock Holmes stories are must-have classics, with a combination of excellent characterization and ruthless logic coming together in the enigmatic person of Holmes himself. Watson's analysis of Holmes is insightful: \\"Philosophy, astronomy, and politics were marked at zero...Botany variable, geology profound as regards the mudstains from any region within fifty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and crime records unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco.\\" What marks Holmes is his ability to perceive the extraordinary in the ordinary. To quote the man himself: \\"Life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent ... there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace ... The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it is to bring it home ... There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact.\\" Like Watson, we readers are frequently amazed at the logical deductions he produces, as Watson humbly confesses to Holmes, \\"When I hear you give your reasons, the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process.\\" Watson is often perplexed as we are: \\"I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque.\\" But perhaps what we enjoy most is the moment when Holmes sits in his chair to unravel the mystery for us.Altogether Doyle wrote four novel-length books featuring Holmes: \\"A Study in Scarlet\\"; \\"The Sign of Four\\"; \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\"; and \\"The Valley of Fear\\". But the greatest ever fictional detective especially acquired his legendary status through the 56 short stories starring Holmes, in which Doyle perfected the Holmes formula. Each story is written from the perspective of Holmes' side-kick, Dr. Watson, and can be read independently. It's in these short stories that Doyle excels.Originally written as five separate collections of about a dozen stories each, the best and most popular collection is the first, \\"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\\" (1892), which contains top classics like \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\", \\"The Red-headed League\\", \\"The Five Orange Pips\\", \\"The Blue Carbuncle\\", and the story universally regarded as the most popular short story in the entire Sherlock Holmes canon, \\"The Speckled Band\\". Although not quite as popular, the second and third collections are still very good. \\"The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes\\" (1893) has excellent stories like \\"Silver Blaze\\", \\"The Stock-broker's Clerk\\", and \\"The Musgrave Ritual\\". \\"The Return of Sherlock Holmes\\" (1905) is arguably even better, including favorites like \\"The Empty House\\", \\"The Dancing Men\\", \\"The Prioriy School\\", and \\"The Six Napoleons\\". The last two collections, \\"His Last Bow\\" (1917) and \\"The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes\\" (1927), did not quite live up to the same standards as their predecessors, but are still worth reading.The good news is that in these two volumes published by Bantam Classics you get the works - all the stories Doyle ever wrote about Holmes. As a reader who enjoys a good mystery story, this remains one of my favourites, and with over 1500 pages of reading, is a worthy addition to any personal library! Although written in the early 20th century, Holmes' incredible deductions and brilliant detective work is timeless, and will continue to amaze and entertain readers well into the 21st century.- GODLY GADFLY"},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"Sherlock Holmes. To be fair, he does not need a review. We all know what he does and how he does it. We all know The Hound of the Baskervilles, Dr. Watson, Mrs Hudson, Professor Moriarty and 221b Baker Street.Arthur Conan Doyle has laid down a being so perfect at his craft that no-one can ever better it. Many will moan at the unrealistic side of Holmes' cases or the fantastically ridiculous nature of many of the crimes, but that does not take away from the genius of Holmes. It is like saying that James Bond is not the best spy. Of course he is, the scrapes he finds himself in do not detract from his achievements.Why are the stories so good? It is down to the facts that you know exactly what Holmes has heard and you know that he has the answer, but you also know that you will never be exactly right in your deductions. You may have an idea as to the guilty, but you cannot say hand on heart that you are right and why you are right. If you do not believe me, read a couple of the short ones.This complete collection of the Holmes stories brings together the longer stories and the full length novel that is &quot;Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; with the numerous number of shorter stories that are completed in about 30 minutes. They provide an excellent curio to read before sleep and a serious challenge if you attempt to dissect the evidence and beat Holmes at his own game. I always like to chance my arm as to the villain, but, apart from a few good efforts, I tend to be way off. The enjoyment then comes from having Holmes explain it to you. A simple formula, really, but one which Conan Doyle uses often and refreshingly well.The beauty is that you know what you are getting with Holmes and the final solution to each problem seldom disappoints. The stories also provide an insight to the times; Holmes' use of cocaine, the acceptable opinions of the day and the people of London in Queen Victoria's time.This book is simply unbeatable."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"The volume is not a 1,000 page book as Amazon states and the text is not large as one of the reviewers states.

A complete Sherlock Holmes collection for less than a dollar would be a good value no matter what, but a large number of typographical errors started to become annoying.

One error was a completely missing section of a whole sentence. I have purchased the more expensive (relatively speaking) $3.25 version, and will see if it's better."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"The first book I bought for my Kindle was The Complete Sherlock Holmes Collection, with the original Sydney Paget illustrations. It was a bargain and I was quite pleased--until a few pages into the first story. The formatting broke down in places, with broken lines and poor pagination and images broken in half, and the \\"active table of contents\\" wasn't all that active. Many of the short story links lead to the first story in the collection, not to the short story itself.Not something I would have paid money for, had I known, especially considering that as a fan I already have every story on my bookshelf, with illustrations and everything. I simply wanted a Sherlock Holmes collection for my Kindle because I love the stories and because I thought it about as safe a buy as was imaginable.But how hard can it be? I've bought other Kindle books since, with proper formatting and working TOCs.This one, then, felt like a god-sent when I found it in a search, by accident. All of the illustrations are there, plus reader's notes for many of the stories, an introduction with more illustrations and background information, reverse links for easy navigation from every story, an actual TOC accessible directly from the Kindle's Go To menu option, ...And proper, beautiful formatting. Finally, a worthy version of the world's greatest detective stories for the Kindle. It's everything I wanted that first collection to be, and more, and at a bargain price.And the stories themselves?

There were several instances in the first few stories I read where a series of typos changed the meaning of the story, causing me to go back and re-read. The exact kind of irritating experience I don't want when I'm reading purely for pleasure. Why can't someone simply proofread and correct the Kindle version before it's published? I am sure they've sold a thousand Kindle versions of this book.

The font is not too small to read, and you get a complete collection."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"Anyone who passed by the Mystery section of the popular bookstores in the 70's & 80's saw this volume of Sherlock Holmes. Its prominent size and classic dust jacket stood out on the shelves like a bolder among pebbles. But for some reason I never bought the book. I guess I thought it would always be available. Then recently I got the itch to read the entire Sherlock Holmes series. The problem is that this book is no longer in print so, after reviewing the current available Holmes's offerings I decided to search for the \\"Old Standard\\" using Amazon's search service. So I purchased a good copy and it's like I found an old friend. True, there are no illustrations and the print is not particularly large (e.g. about this font size) but, the complete series is there and it's a joy to read. As far as I'm concerned, this volume of Sherlock Holmes is still the \\"Old Standard\\"."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"I was really impressed by the condition of such an old edition of the Complete Sherlock Holmes (1920s I think).

To pay only 99-cents for such a comprehensive and well done collection of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's seminal creation of detective fiction seems almost criminal! I LOVE this ebook collection!

This being the 2003 reprint, it features a foreword, and a charming little slip-box for your novels to inhabit when not being read. As you should be able to guess, this collection has everything Arthur Conan Doyle wrote featuring Holmes. Sadly, the original art from the Strand publications is not in the stories, which is a shame but, other than that, this is the best paperback version you are going to get!"},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"To a certain extent, the person of Sherlock Holmes has become part of our collective mental universe as Anglos and Americans. His careful detective work, brilliant deductions, and aphorisms \\"elementary, my dear Watson\\" \\"the mind is an attic\\" and so on, have penetrated the hearts and minds of generations of readers. He is as beloved a fictional character as any in Dickens, and maybe more so.As could be deduced from the above, I am a tremendous fan of Sherlock Holmes. I have read every single story and novel at least once, and many significantly more than once. For me, this is the book to buy, though, for the character of Dr. Moriarty is almost as fascinating as that of Sherlock Holmes, and he really only appears in the novels - there are allusions to him in some of the short stories, but not much more.As a closing note, this is the edition to buy! A poor translation or a \\"children's version\\" is annoying and grating. I must put an inferior version down and come back to the Bantam Classic! This is the edition to buy and read and re-read.PS The movie was significantly above average, though imperfect (the 2010 movie). It was a little more violent than it should have been, though the boxing scene was priceless. The plot was even more intricate and had more twists and turns than many of the stories. So, if a reader of this review has seen the movie but not read the book, rest assured that the original is even better!"},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"I wouldn't think twice about purchasing this set.

Beautiful writing, beautiful collection."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"Now, the stories of Sherlock Holmes is perhaps the greatest collection of exploits about a man that has ever been written. The good thing about this collection that is that it brings together a wide array of the stories---long and short. Answers to mysteries are brought to a conclusion to the reader in a cryptic manner that leaves the reader awed at the end. It is a style employed in Triple Agent Double Cross. The solutions are breath-taking and the descriptions and settings are very real to life. This is a great book."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"Let me guess, you want to get into Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes works - but you do not know where to start?You recognize \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" the most but realize it was written after a number of Holmes stories.... You do not want to start at the beginning because there are other more well-known Holmes stories you would like to get acquainted with first.... You have heard about the large number of Sherlock Holmes short stories and do not know which one to start with....Elementary, my dear reader - there is a simple solution to your dilemma: The Complete Sherlock Holmes: All 4 Novels and 56 Short Stories.You honestly cannot find a better deal than this: all 4 novels and 56 short stories featuring Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes in 2 chronological volumes for around $10.00. It is unbelievable - astounding, even!Arthur Conan Doyle is one of my favorite authors - and his Sherlock Holmes character (although Doyle himself would bore of the character and long for an end to writing about him) is one of my personal favorite characters of literature. Doyle's stories are suspenseful, funny, all-out entertaining and, of course, phenomenally written - the character of Sherlock Holmes is one of the most complex and fun to follow protagonists in the history of known literature.Unless you are a collector, there is no reason to try to assemble the works of Arthur Conan Doyle individually, piece by piece, when The Complete Sherlock Holmes offers you every story in two volumes for such a low price."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"The typeface is very small. This is a problem with buying books online; there is just no way to know if the font used is average-sized and readable -- or excruciatingly tiny and sure to bring on a case of eyestrain. These books are the latter.If microscopic print doesn't bother you, these two are a very nice set in a shelf-box. I'd love them - except I can't see them. Too bad, really.Since there is no preview that can inform a potential buyer as to font-size, I felt my review would focus on this, so as to alert those interested."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"The two books include all of Doyles' SH writings, which is good. The typeface is very small, however, in case your eyesight is not good."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"I love a good mystery but I especially love great writing. I have never read Dole's Sherlock Holmes stories before but I have enjoyed the old Sherlock Holmes movies. After seeing the recently released movie I decided to take a chance on reading the books, and I wasn't disapointed at all. The writing does still work in our present time. This was a great purchase."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"This review refers to the Complete Sherlock Holmes Audiobook Collection from Naxos Audiobooks read by David Timson.I cannot say enough good things about this collection! This is literally the best audiobook collection I have ever listened to and COMPLETELY work the money! Timson is an excellent reader. His voice turns Holmes, Watson and the minor characters into real people. Each story and subsection of story is interspersed with violin music. This collection comes with a detailed booklet filled with commentary.Even if you have read the Sherlock Holmes stories already, listening to them in this collection gives them new life and meaning. This is a MUST HAVE for any Holmes fan!"},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"I remember reading various Sherlock Holmes tales when I was a child and I had fond memories of the stories. I was not very interested in the genre of \\"mystery\\" as a child and the same is true now, except for Doyle's work. As an adult, though, I have never delved deeply into the material, thus I went to my local books store and picked up the complete works in an inexpensive leather bound edition. Now anyone who is a bibliophile will know that those \\"leather\\" editions they make of the classics in the major chain stores are nothing compared to a hand bound leather book. However, for a relatively low price this is a beautiful edition to pick up, as it only cost me twenty dollars. For over eleven hundred pages worth of stories, I would say that's quite a bargain.The complete works appears to be quite a daunting task. And it is, I am not a fast reader and it took me months to finish this. Doyle's material feels so much fuller to read as an adult than as a child. So if you ever grew up with the Young Adult versions of any of Doyle's then I highly recommend you delve into the full text. The stories have a much fuller feel than the ones I remember as a child. It is interesting to reflect that one of my favorites when I was younger was \\"The Hound of the Baskerville's\\". Upon reading the story in full, I found I didn't like it as much. In fact I wasn't as taken by Doyle's full novels very much. I think he sets them up in a strange way from what I'm used to. Basically each novel is setup into two parts. The first part has Sherlock trying to solve some mystery. By the end of this first section you usually find the culprit, but the second section is all the background past of the culprit. It's an interesting setup, but I found my interest wane without having Sherlock around. This is unfortunate, because the stories weren't bad, but they weren't what I wanted. At least that's the best I can explain.For me Doyle shined in the form of short stories. These were by far my favorite throughout the book and I simply couldn't get enough of them. Based on the fact that Doyle kept having to revive the Holmes character throughout his writing career, it would appear the general public was little different from myself. It's interesting to read these late 19th century stories and see them discuss things like science and realize how far things have come. For example it is constantly remarked that the size of ones head would determine a person's intelligence. This is totally false, but clearly seemed logical back then. In the 21st century it does wind up sounding quite amusing. One thing I must commend Doyle for is keeping superstitious nonsense or religious explanations out of any of the solutions. I think that's one of the reasons I liked a lot of the stories, they try to stick to logic and scientific reasoning (minus the ape serum story). It actually makes me wonder how much influence this type of work had on things like CSI.There is one flaw with this particular edition of the book. I found the editing to be extremely lazy. Now, I don't expect to get an eleven hundred page book and have it be typo free. Usually I'll come across one or two in any book I have. However, the nature of the typos in this edition, I feel, are quite inexcusable. For example when reading certain sections I will find the word \\"let\\". But that is not what is printed. Instead the symbol for British Pounds currency is displayed followed by the letter \\"t\\". This British Pounds symbol showed up numerous times, and not just in \\"let\\". The first time it was merely comical, the next four were quite annoying. These aren't the only typos I found and the typos are more numerous towards the end of the book. It is as if the book was edited for the first half only. I wouldn't say it was the worst editing I've ever seen, but it was frustrating whenever I ran into the problems, and no one likes their reading disrupted.Despite the typos, I still love this book. I like the edition and the attempt at an old world publication aesthetic. I think this really adds to the atmosphere of the text and its setting. Overall, I would recommend this edition, but beware of some frustrating typos here and there. They are decently easy to get over, since the content is so superb.4.5 out of 5"},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"Whether you've read any of the Sherlock Holmes stories or not, at only 10 bucks this collection is a must own for any fans of detective fiction.This edition is highly usable and highly readable - it's cheap, and it's also compact and easy to read. Breaking it into two reasonably small paperbacks makes it very convenient to take with you on a trip, for example. It's also an easy, convenient way to get all four novels and all the short stories. Sure it isn't a pretty hardcover edition that will look good on the bookshelf - this edition is meant to be read.If you're already a fan of Holmes and are debating whether to buy this collection, I'd highly recommend it. If you're not already a fan but like detective fiction in general, you may as well shell out the measly 10 bucks for one of the original (and still one of the best, in my opinion) examples of the genre."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"This is the best of the best when it comes to Sherlock Holmes. I am a long time fan Sir Arthur Conan Doyle; in fact he got me hooked on reading.

I LOVE the idea of moving away from paper media, but what the ****'s the point when publishers don't care enough to edit out the typos. I had read as far as the Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle in my print copy, so I started there. Everything seemed to be all right until I got into the Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes where all of a sudden the volume becomes plagued with typos to the extent that I've now opted to go back to reading the print version.What is it that makes publishers think readers reading on a digital device don't care about spelling?Navigating the content is easy enough, and I love the stories, but I can't justify a rating any higher than OK for a version that is so riddled with typos."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"I have never been a fan of mysteries... actually, save Sherlock Holmes, I never read them. Once I stumbled upon Sherlock and Watson in my grade ten English class, I knew that I was hooked for life. Very little of my passion for Conan Doyle is based on his ability to write a spine-tingling or comical or dramatic mystery ( although he does all with such remarkable precision and depth that I deem him no less than that of a genius ) I am basically drawn to Sherlock Holmes as a character. I think he possesses a certain allure.... he contains an almost ethereal and metaphysical presence at times and his powers of deduction are indeed out of this world. However he is extremely flawed, reminding us that even the best most intelligent beings on the earth have moments of misgiving. Sherlock Holmes is a cocaine- addict. He is rude, narcassistic, and incredibly sarcastic. Save himself, and his best friend Watson, he cares not about anyone in the world. He revolves around his world, and cases, not the people behind them, stimulate him. However there are remarkable stories where a bit of a heart shines through and proves him not a total automaton. Watson also casts an hypnotic power on the reader. He is not only a fine narrator ( Doyle's exceptional writing capablility shining through him ) yet, he is also a wonderful, loyal, witty friend and companion to Sherlock. Not at all the unintelligent foil many adaptations make the mistake of intending him to be. He is also flawed, a womanizer and a gambler, and someone who cannot understand his friend. It is Watson that holds us in the stories... we look to him for direction... As a classical literature nut, I strongly feel that everyone should be initiated to the canon. You cannot just read one or two stories.. you must read them all. You will find them so enthralling you may read them all in the span of two weeks ( as I did ) and return many times after to indulge yet again in the Victorian gas-lit era of 19th Century London."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"Sherlock Holmes, the great consulting detective, hardly needs an introduction, nor do his stories need a synopsis. This hardcover edition of &quot;The Complete Sherlock Holmes&quot; contains all the original Sherlock Holmes short stories and novels published by Conan Doyle.As such, this book is the perfect compilation of a timeless classic, for both those re-reading these wonderful stories or those discovering them for the first time. In addition to this, I loved the cover art of this particular edition - it gives just the right impression and captures the ambience of the tales.The only negative comment I had (hence the 4 star rating) was with the actual presentation of the book. Unfortunately, the publishers have attempted to cram all the stories into a 480-page book. This has resulted in an oversized hardcover, with rather small font, and worst of all, newspaper-style columns on each page. Perhaps the intention was to emulate the original format of the stories as they appeared in The Strand in the late 1800s. Regardless, the book format is therefore slightly unwieldy because of its size and is a little hard to read.Despite this shortcoming, I'd recommend this classic collection to anyone and this edition is definitely worth the price."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"The book would be one of my favorites but I can hardly read it!I have perfect 20/20 vision but reading this book is very difficult to read!

I discovered him when I was seven, a bit too young, but I enjoyed his tales greatly for years and considered myself something of an expert by the time I was eleven (my brother and I would play Holmes trivia games.) I became deeply obsessed with Holmes at age 13, and at almost 21 he's still my favourite fictional character all in all. And yet, I can't quite consider him fictional. I was fortunate enough to visit the Reichenbach Falls in Switzerland last month and I felt as though I were visiting a place where something real and of great importance involving Holmes had taken place. I had the same feeling repeatedly when I visited London a few years ago and walked in Holmes's footsteps. Why is he so real to me and many others? You have to read the stories to find out. The legend of Sherlock Holmes has taken on dimensions far beyond the original tales, and some people, like Jeremy Brett (an actor) and Laurie King (an author) have done marvelous things with him, but Doyle's originals are the real thing. The stories are marvelous, charming, frightening, often improbable but almost always compelling. Read stories like &quot;The Red-Headed League,&quot; &quot;The Speckled Band,&quot; &quot;The Norwood Builder&quot; and &quot;The Devil's Foot&quot; for both character and plot. Professor Moriarty is truly spine-chilling, and Watson is wonderful, the kind of friend everyone wants: incredibly supportive, helpful, and quite intelligent (NOT dumb, except occasionally when compared with Holmes!) But Holmes sits in the spotlight. He's completely unforgettable; brilliant, hard to get along with, adorably untidy (at least his room) and eccentric. Somehow, you have to love him though he wouldn't be an easy friend. And the one-liners! &quot;The game is afoot;&quot; &quot;The curious incident of the dog who did nothing in the night-time;&quot; &quot;Watson, you may not be luminous in yourself, but you are a conductor of light.&quot; I won't say that these are the greatest works of literature ever, or that they are the most profound. But there's something about Holmes that has captured the imagination of millions ever since he was created, and I don't think it was just a fluke. A reviewer said of Vikram Seth's Suitable Boy that &quot;it will keep you company for the rest of your life.&quot; The same is entirely, gloriously true of The Complete Sherlock Holmes."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"this is a great book on the kindle. i was reading reviews prior to buying this and one reviewer, rather close to the top at the time i am writing this, claims that the kindle edition has no \\"table of contents\\" making the book difficult to read, or as he/she puts it, \\"jump to a short story baised on title\\" anyways after buying it despite this percived flaw, it took me a whole 30 seconds to find the table of contents, so in a unusual whim i decided to share the secret with you. first go the the home page which displays all your books. second highlight the book in question. third scroll right once using the arrow D-pad thing. fourth scroll down to the \\"go to location\\" tab. lastly select the \\"table of contents\\" option from the following menu.

Poor Conan Doyle! Brainy but sensitive, lazy and energetic, detective and thief(in a couple of cases), this mass of contradictions (holmes) is truly THE DETECTIVE par excellence. I got this complete work in november and I have read all the stories about 20 times without getting bored, and I am still at it. I cannot say enough about the great holmes in such a short space as this, so I stop here.

When I read the first story- A Study in Scarlet, which is a classic in itself, I was simply fascinated. Many of the stories have minimum violence and are solved with the simplest ease by the Master. His deductions are drawn from what seems to us as obvious, but we could never dream of ever ataining such high powers of observation. I conclude, saying that these are THE greatest mystery stories I've ever read. It is a true masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"Not just for mystery buffs, this book pleases readers of all types. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's writing is rapidly paced and quick witted, never dull. Often, it is the characters' humour more than the suspense itself that keeps me reading. The short stories are light and entertaining, and the longer ones are thorough and satisfying. As I read, I find myself trying to put the pieces of the puzzle together, only to be outwitted in the end by the master detective. Not only does Doyle tell a good story, but he also paints a good picture of life in the 19th century, rather like Dickins, but far less depressing. A definite read for a lazy day."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"What could be better than a complete set of Sherlock Holmes stories? This set is recommened for every Sherlock Holmes fan."},{"Title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","review":"I've always been a fan of Sherlock Holmes ever since I read The Hound of the Baskervilles as a child, so this book is a real godsend. Being able to read story after story so easily, you become immersed in a world of dimly lit gas lamps, shadowy motives and events, and the quest for understanding.Conan Doyle's strength is perhaps in his participation in the Victorian (and Modern) desire for answers in the face of increasing doubt and confusion. He shows that answers to mysteries are never quite solvable by reason and rationality. Rather, the key to solving a mystery is by inevitably stumbling upon the solution, and then making it look as if one arrived at it through orderly reasoning.All and all, this collection should be read again and again and again.

This story takes place in England, as many of her books do, and I find the British terms she uses intriging.The main reason that I am so enthralled with her books and especially this one, is her delightful depiction of children in her writing. She developes all of her charactors with warmth, gentleness and total realism so that the reader feels they are drawn into the story themselves."},{"Title":"Wedding Bells for Beatrice","review":"This was one of my favorite Betty Neels' romances. Beatrice and Gijs were two of my favorite characters. Even though he made up his mind about her being Mrs Right, she had him pegged as Mr Annoying. They were adorable. Loved the part where, within Gijs' hearing, her best and oldest friend Derek asked her what size she wore. Of course she was affronted. Then, especially because he was so good at it and to make her more annoyed, Gijs said he could probably guess. By the ending, she realized he was Mr Right after all."},{"Title":"Wedding Bells for Beatrice","review":"I enjoyed this book. It is refreshing old school elegance. Betty Neels is my favorite author and enjoy the way she wrote her stories. This one us great for Margaret gets hers early in the book."},{"Title":"Wedding Bells for Beatrice","review":"Well, sort of. Yes, the hero is a doctor (who drives a Bentley) from Holland. Yes, we travel from England to Holland and back on the hovercraft. Yes, the heroine goes to Holland to work and sees the hero. Yes, there's a Big Misunderstanding. Yes, they have coffee or tea on every other page. Yes, there's an annoying boyfriend. Yes, there's.... Hmm. Well, perhaps it is pretty much like the other Neels books that we love.BUT, the heroine is not a poor, mousy young girl! Beatrice is a career girl, competent and confident in her work. She's 28 or so, not barely out of school and almost young enough to be the hero's daughter, like some of Neels' heroines are. She dresses well, not in a dress made from curtains (see the excellent An Independent Woman) or clothes that are shabby.Gijs (I kept wondering how to pronounce his name, and I must admit it was a distraction!) comes off rather stiff, aloof, and annoying. I didn't like him much at the beginning, and barely warmed to him by the end of the book. He turns his nose up at small talk, preferring to speak plainly, he says. Yet, despite having fallen in love with her, he never lets on or hints about how he feels. He is, however, nice to Beatrice, watching over her with care, even if he is aloof in his manner. There's a couple of little hints about how he feels, but for the most part he's unreadable. I would have liked him better had he not been quite so stiff and, dare I say it, dull.Still, I enjoyed this book very much. There's plenty of action: she travels to Holland, there's parties, dancing, dinners, families, shopping, bad weather, medical conferences, scenic drives...lots of stuff to keep the story moving along. We don't see many children in Neel's books, but this one has a darling little girl. Most of it is told from the heroine's point of view, and there are a few chuckles along the way."},{"Title":"Blade For Barter Vol 1 (v. 1)","review":"This book is entertaining, and has has a lot of potential. The story, set in a world that's a bizzare blend of modern-day US and feudal Japan, is fast-paced, intriguing, and delightfully original - a young samurai, the last one who remembers the way of Bushido, struggles to make ends meet in a world where Samurai are unionized, lazy, and corrupt.The art, while very cartoony, is also very underrated - the wealth of little details generously sprinkled throughout the book testifies to the amount of work and dedication that went into making the story (see if you can spot a homeless Uncle Sam lookalike begging for money on the street)The only initial drawback is the format - like Japanese manga, Blade for Barter is meant to be read right-to-left. However, that takes very little time to adjust to, and stops being an issue farily quickly.Overall, a really fun read. Looking forward to volume 2."},{"Title":"Blade For Barter Vol 1 (v. 1)","review":"One of the newbies in American manga, Seven Seas started out doing graphic novels in the right-to-left format. Meaning, that their books are being printed in the same fashion as regular translated Japanese manga. Whether this is trying to cash in on the current hype of manga, or an attempt to confuse potential buyers into thinking its an actual manga remains to be seen.Blade For Barter is done as an all-ages action/comedy. In it, Ryusuke Washington is a freelance samurai(or ronin). He lives in the city of New Edo, which takes place in an alternate reality where modern day mixes with feudal Japan. Always looking for new work, Ryusuke hears about a job opening of an inhouse samurai for a big time corporation. After going through Super Mario-type efforts to make the interview, he looses his oppurtunity when he refuses to join the shifty Samurai Union.Afterwards, he gets a new pet dog named Hachiko who he saved from being run over previously. However, his new neighbor and business rival, the sexy(?)ninja girl Macadameia, causes immeadiate friction for Ryusuke's pet. Then, some local restaraunt owners hire both of them to find some bandits who've beem eating and running with their meals. They only way to stop them is for Ryusuke and Macadamia to pretend to join the ranks of the bill-avoiding thieves.The art style by illustrator Hai!(yes, that's his name)is very similar to those from the One Piece manga series. The story usually paces out like it too, with fast action and quick dialogue. Writer Jason DeAngelis originally started out as a translator for manga like Berserk. Together, they pull off a reasonably interesting graphic novel"},{"Title":"Heathcliff Gone Fishin","review":"When I first strated reading Heatcliff, I was really young.

Born in 1911, he was educated in philosophy at the University of Cairo and spent most of his life as a civil servant . While he seldom travelled abroad, he was strongly inlfuenced by the likes of men like Proust, Balzac, Dickens, and Camus. He won the Nobel Prize in 1988.&quot;The Time and the Place and Other Stories&quot; is a great place to begin if you've never read anything by Mahfouz and a welcome slice of his short fiction if you're only familiar with his novels. One is struck by the variety of the stories collected here. Written between 1962 and 1989, they incapsulate Mahfouz's concern with everything from political injustice to the downfall of families to loneliness and death and the anguished world-weariness that merges gradually, in many characters, into mysticism.The Borgesean &quot;The Man and the Other Man&quot; (even the title is Borgesean) is a dark political allegory about a murderer stalking his victim; at the end, though, he finds himself woven into a labyrinthine nightmare of his own creation. In contrast to this tale's surrealism, &quot;The Answer is No&quot; is a realistic, outspokenly &quot;feminist&quot; tale about a resolute young woman who scorns the advances of an old tutor of hers and seeks to avoid love in order to devote her life to teaching, &quot;persuading herself that happiness is not confined to love and motherhood. Never has she regretted her firm decision.&quot; Side by side with these are stories like the title-piece, a semi-fantastic tale about a man who digs up an ancient parchment in his garden which leads him, in a bizarre (but, in retrospect, hilarious) ending, into trouble with the law, and &quot;The Empty Caf&eacute;&quot;, about an old teacher &quot;cursed by a long life&quot; who has seen all his friends and now his wife die and is left, at last, alone, shipwrecked at the end of his days in an age that is not his. Alongside these are the folktale-ish &quot;The Conjurer Made Off With the Dish&quot; and the mystical &quot;Zaabalawi&quot;, Mahfouz's most famous story, about a man hunting for an elusive healer-sheikh.I thought a few of the stories were a flop (for instance, &quot;The Tavern of the Black Cat&quot;, in which a man walks into a caf&eacute; and, for no reason I could catch, refuses to let anyone leave; the jumbled up ending left me with the impression that Mahfouz just couldn't pull it off.) Otherwise, there's no reason why this book should be out of print. It's worth finding. 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Time and the Place and Other Stories","review":"This is a collection of twenty short-stories by Naguib Mahfouz, a Nobel Prize-winning author who is considered the most famous author of modern Egypt. These stories were written between 1962 and 1988, and include (according to the introduction) his \\"best and blackest,\\" written in the aftermath of Egypt's humiliating loss to Israel in the 1967 war.Although all but one of the stories is set in Cairo, Mahfouz is more concerned with capturing pieces of humanity -- with all its emotions, fears, weaknesses and failures -- than with the city that forms the backdrop. Those pieces of humanity sometimes trump the narrative arc, as in \\"The Conjurer Made Off With the Dish\\" or \\"Blessed Night,\\" which have little in the way of plot and are carried entirely in the heads and through the eyes of their protagonists. The writer plays with the supernatural (as in \\"Zaabalawi\\" or \\"The Time and the Place\\"), unsolveable crimes (\\"By a Person Unknown\\"), predatory government functionaries (\\"The Norwegian Rat\\"), merciless justice officials (\\"Fear\\" and \\"His Majesty\\") and especially time as a conspirator (\\"Half a Day,\\" \\"A Long Term Plan,\\" \\"The Wasteland,\\" \\"The Time and the Place\\") to create a sense of alienation and utter powerlessness in the face of a capricious universe. There are flashes of brightness (\\"The Norwegian Rat\\" comes closest to being funny, and \\"Conjurer\\" captures some of the sweetness of childhood lived with diminished fear of consequences). But above all, the pervading pessimism reflects a writer produced by the Egypt of Mahfouz' day, complete with a sense of all-consuming poverty, a useless or oppressive government, dehumanization, the arbitrariness of fate.I recommend this book to fans of all literature, and especially of the exotic. The reader needs little if any background knowledge of Egypt or the Middle East, although of course it would help. The point is that even though Cairo's dusty streets may be distant, the raw emotions Mahfouz captures are universal."},{"Title":"Christ: A Crisis in the Life of Christ","review":"Treating Christ as God Incarnate, this book is a sequel to the author's God: a Biography, which showed how God developed in the course of the Old Testament. In this book He finds that He needs to change still further. As brilliant as its predecessor. The way the author alerts the reader to the tiniest nuances of language in the New Testament is masterly. The two books make you forget that the books of the Bible were actually all written by different people and over a huge span of time. Miles' approach makes the entire Bible appear as if it had been conceived as one seamless work of literature. Historically that is nonsense, of course; but even so it is a rewarding and stimulating way to read the Bible."},{"Title":"Christ: A Crisis in the Life of Christ","review":"Call me whatever you wish, but here's my take on Jack's take: Forget all this New Testament as literature stuff; it's a ruse. This former Jesuit and long-time scriptural scholar has an agenda. He wants you to know that \\"Jesus\\" (=whoever= he was; no one who wrote about him ever met the guy) and his Three Big Ideas never stood a chance. What did he \\"die\\" for? To teach us the new and different ideas of \\"love,\\" \\"forgiveness\\" and something else?A something else that is very much there in the four gospels, but which has been smoke-bombed and conveniently ignored ever since because it does not support the interests of later institution-building authoritarians with their own agendas.Jesus was teaching =radical acceptance=, a concept that was big a few centuries earlier in southern Asia when Siddartha Gautama was out and about. Jesus (or -- once again -- whoever he was) had to come up with something completely different: The \\"god\\" of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses and all the rest had breached his own covenant. The messiah the Jews had been waiting for wasn't coming.The god who had (ostensibly) destroyed the armies of the most powerful empire on earth on the shores of the Red Sea 1500 years earlier was long gone. That god had lead the Israelites across the Jordan into Canaan a half century later, routinely smited those in the way of his chosen people, and saw to it that for the next 850 years, the faithful would have dominion over all enemies.But the faithful were human, and finally that god (according to his Tanakh biographers, wink, wink) claimed to be so pissed off at the Israelites for all their \\"iniquities\\" that -- in Jack's version -- he said, \\"I'm really sick of you bozos, so s*r*w you all and the horses you road in on.\\" And he marched in one invader after another to trample on Israel for the next 2700 years. By 1941, \\"god\\" was really taking it out his chosen ones. If that's a loving, forgiving, accepting god, well...So this Jesus comes along and says, \\"Forget all this Moses redux, messiah-leading-you-out-of-bondage baloney. God has had a change of heart. He's decided to stop being p****d off at you for being sinners, and, even though he's not either going -- or maybe even =able= -- to free you from the Romans, he's sent me to give you a better deal: eternal (after-) life in a heaven free of Romans, Greeks, Persians, Assyrians, Babylonians (and everyone else you haven't even heard of yet). Hey! Howabout that?\\"And then he added, \\"Now... all you gotta do is turn your will and your lives over to me and my boys, and you're set for all eternity.\\"Well, there has to be some reason why it all \\"took off\\" the way it did, and I know this much: For those under the yoke of oppression with nowhere else to turn, and moreover those normalized by the standards of the time to see any good myth as hopeful fact, it must have sounded pretty good.But then Jesus died (or ascended, or left, or whatever), four guys who never met him pulled together four surprisingly similar accounts of three brief periods of his life (but none of the rest), and Peter and Paul took over. And by 150 AD or thereabouts, some guy named John (not the gospel writer) was knocking out stuff like Revelations, a book you've really got to read first-hand to appreciate.But let me continue: 150 years further down the line in 313 AD, things were getting really shakey in the Roman Empire. Constantine needed all the friends he could get to help him in the face of all the invasions from every direction. No political dummy, he legitimizes the previously tolerated but illegal RCC. And within very short order, everyone who has a vested interest from within and without has made political alliances to agree to manipulate the masses for the sake of their own financial gain.Interestingly enough, when Mohamed of Mecca came along another 250 years down the road, he wrote =another= nifty version of the authoritarian, legalistic, Talmudic view of things... and wasted no time setting himself up as the very messiah to his people that Jesus was supposed to have been to his... but wasn't. (That Mohamed was no dope. He'd heard the story, and he wasn't about to repeat it.) He went for institutionalised authoritarianism from the git.Because love, forgiveness and radical acceptance =are= terrific ideas, but it's really hard to make a profit on them."},{"Title":"Christ: A Crisis in the Life of Christ","review":"This is a brave write, most people who trully believe in Christ would never think of crossing the lines so boldly. The fact that God could be imperfect and admit imperfection has caused us to fail, needing the sacrifice of the Lamb of God. This book covers the bases quite extensively, Jack is more than well versed, from the way he writes, he has a super clear understanding of the way each book in the Bible was meant to be interpreted by it's original writers. That was accomplished by a great deal of research, very evident in this very strongly supported book. I am happy with it, brings a new twist of reality that is faith strengthening.I want to recommend another good book that uses finger print writing style (Of Moses ect.) to get the crisis straight, also of Christ's true purpose, SB 1 or God By Karl Mark Maddox"},{"Title":"Christ: A Crisis in the Life of Christ","review":"The author seems to be angry at God and it is shown by his very low opinion of God. His characterizations of God and His motives are far from Biblical truth. He attributes God as having been \\"lured (by Satan)...into torturing the innocent Job.\\" (p. 32). It is clear that Mr. Miles' lacks an understanding of certain basic hermeneutic and exegetical principles."},{"Title":"Christ: A Crisis in the Life of Christ","review":"I loved this book and I came here to find more books similar in style to Mile's book. Miles' analyzes the life of Christ and why God allowed Christ to be crucified. Or, since Christ was God, why Christ allowed himself to be crucified! Israel is under rule by the Romans and is awaiting the Messiah--however when the Messiah comes, He brings a new covenant with the Lord. Instead of guaranteeing Israel victory over its enemies, God breaks this promise and instead delivers the entire world victory over death!"},{"Title":"Christ: A Crisis in the Life of Christ","review":"No doubt Miles is a gifted author. The book has a great story line to work with, but it lacks the authority to bring clarity to the subject. I much more enjoyed \\"Jesus The Christ\\" by James Talmage."},{"Title":"Christ: A Crisis in the Life of Christ","review":"how can a book which starts out from the premise God has made a mistake bring anyone into closer contact with Christ? all the other inspiring and illuminating statements of Christ and God and truth just don't seem satisfying. i couldn't understand the basis for the premise we are re-established to God because God felt guilty. my understanding remains we are transformed by influence of divine love."},{"Title":"Christ: A Crisis in the Life of Christ","review":"The author presents a God that fails in His goal to protect Israel from Rome and so He is forced to develop a posture of weakness to try and humiliate those that are strong. His parody is to try and show that there is no God, only mans attempt to bring together actual events alongside the continued presence of God in the world.This book fails as a serious investigation, and as for literary entertainment - making jokes of serious moral issues just plain doesn&#8217;t work. To name a few problems: The author ignores many events in the Bible and in others suggests subtleties that are clearly out of line; all to suit his needs. He follows a strict literal interpretation ignoring historical and cultural context, and uses the Gospel of John as representative of all Synoptic Gospels. The one point the author makes is repeated throughout the book. It reminds me of a painter that starts off with a bright color and ends up painting the entire canvas in the same color.Jesus Christ&#8217;s ideas are provocative, because they represent a painful leap that man undertook to accept a further advancement in moral development. In our attempt to understand God it helps to keep in mind the Old Testament words: &#8220;My thoughts are not your thoughts&#8221;. We may find that Jesus&#8217; ideas are not so new if we search to find the &#8220;still, small voice&#8221; of God in the Old Testament."},{"Title":"Christ: A Crisis in the Life of Christ","review":"After reading this monumental epic one can only come to the conclusion that Christianity is a lie.The fairy tale is exposed beautifully here, Jack Miles has done a wonderful job of picking apart the lie, who could possibly believe in the resurection after reading this essay?This should be required reading in public schools."},{"Title":"Christ: A Crisis in the Life of Christ","review":"God is a sinner, according to Jack Miles, the author of God: A Biography and Christ: A Crisis in the Life of God. And God atones for His sins by dying on a cross.Balderdash in the most reekest form!First off, God (or whatever name you prefer) cannot sin. Sin is defined as a transgression against the laws of conduct laid out by man who tried to deduce what God might desire, not the other way around.Second, whatever man thinks is godly is wrong. With God, there is no right or wrong. With man, right and wrong are relative concepts. For example, it is wrong to murder your neighbor in peacetime, but it is a fantastic right thing to do during war. And, the Old Testament is full of God (READ: human interpretation) demanding that His people kill everything alive that opposed His people.Third, no person can judge whether an act attributed to God is right or wrong. We held a convention in Berlin while the wall was still in place. Many people questioned why God allowed the Holocaust to occur. I declared that it was done according to the Will of God. Talk about lines in the sand being formed! My argument merely stated that as long as God has given man a free will-even to the point where man decides to destroy himself-all things that happen in this world are according to God's Will. It does not matter that we think the Holocaust was terribly wrong. It was an object lesson to the rest of us and for future generations. But it was not wrong in God's eyes. He took care of those souls.Now the Christian religion has evolved to a state of belief that Christians should be living a good life here on Earth. They were never promised that by God or Christ. Many preachers have become millionaires simply because they co-opted the Word and made people believe that way. If you believe and are godly, you will be rich. If you are not rich, then you need to believe more. Now, pass me that collection plate for my good-er, godly-advice.Lastly, Jack Miles obviously does not have a clue as to how the Bible was put together. With the exceptions of the two accounts of David and Solomon's reigns-one to glorify, and the other to show political condemnation-the Old Testament was borrowed from older traditions and more ancient myths. You might just as well use the Arabian Nights as the basis for making the Bible.The God that appears in the Pentateuch is not the same God throughout the Old Testament. When the Israelites were languishing in captivity under Babylon and Assyrian whips, their religion was in danger of being swept aside by the religions of their captors. These Israelites merely borrowed myths and tales of the times that referred to the acts of various gods and made them their own.This God of the Old Testament was as loving as Mammu, the goddess who helped Enki create the first humans, as sneaky as Enki who saved mankind from the great inundation, as angry as Enlil who loved to see mankind be utterly destroyed, as blood-thirsty as Inanna who delighted in using humans to destroy civilizations and cultures, and finally as cunning and underhanded as Marduk, in whom we can find strong traces of the historical-yet mythological-Satan.The \\"I am\\" who allegedly spoke to Abraham and Moses is poorly represented in the Bible. You really have to look for Him to find Him. He is the small voice that spoke to Elijah.The Christ was merely a covenant between God and man. It was not to atone any sins of God but of man. Under all the other covenants God made with mankind, mankind could not live up to their side of the bargain. Christ was, in essence, a \\"free pass out of jail card.\\" Mankind does not have to do anything except believe. The rest takes care of itself.And guess what? Mankind cannot even do that one simple thing. Instead, it wants to believe along the lines of Jack Miles, bringing God down to our stinking level, that we have to work for our release from this hell we call life."},{"Title":"Christ: A Crisis in the Life of Christ","review":"Jack Miles won a Pulitzer Prize for his book God: A Biography, so he has to be taken seriously as a writer. And his Ph.D. in NE languages from Harvard indicates he's no dummy either. Yet maybe it's his years as a Jesuit that impinge on this text and suggest that it's an impartial historical look at the life of Jesus. We get a clue as early as page 18 when he asks the question: \\"...why God the Father saw fit to proceed in this way, choosing to experience human death as God the Son.\\" OK. So it's going to be a very religious look at the historical Jesus. I can live with that. But Miles seems to have invented his own theology as well. Here's some examples...\\"All four of the Gospels initially began with Jesus, as a grown man, being baptized in the Jordan River by John the Baptist (p. 18).\\" - Duh! Matthew and Luke begin with birth narratives. You don't get to John in Matthew and Luke until the third chapter. Moreover, in the Gospel of John, John the Baptist does not baptise Jesus.\\"...on Christmas Day in the year One, God became a Jew (p. 84).\\" By this, Miles claims that Jesus was born on Christmas Day in 1 AD. In fact, 6 BC is a better date and Christmas Day is simply the Christian theft of the birth date of the pagan Sun God Mithra.Putting these errors aside, Miles does have some interesting things to say. His discussion of the meaning of illness and the use of sacrifice are very informative. There are paragraphs and pages which are truly unsurpassed in biblical studies, such as when he questions the differences between Yahweh and Jesus in their self-definition, or when he notices Jesus' apparent goal-less wandering through towns, healing whomever encounters him, taking disciples from whomever he runs into, etc.Yet the work as a whole suffers from Miles tendency to float from one gospel to another (mostly John and Luke) as if they were telling the same story, often without pause to refer back to his references. Moreover, he fails to deal with the issue of redaction, which surely must make any interpretation of the Gospel of John radically different from the Gospel of Mark. Moreover, Miles makes interesting and profound points, but they seem to be isolated to a particular issue, and rarely does he attempt to go further than mere elucidation. Of course, this he does at a level that far exceeds the efforts of others, so perhaps he should be forgiven his trespasses.Another problem with this book is that rather than a focus on Jesus, the author often reverts back to the discussion of God which was the subject of his first book. By making Jesus \\"God Incarnate\\", Miles has opened to door to keep discussing the theme from his first book. And this discussion is not without its flaws. Miles' thesis is that the OT God has decided to change the nature of his agreement with the Jews to now extend to all peoples (again the Jesuit in Miles is surfacing here), and in doing so, he decides to suffer (as Jesus) since he is aware that his new covenant will bring suffering to his old believers (the Jews). His theory seems to revolve around the OT God's inability to keep up, and hence the new covenant is easier on God, even if it means a little suffering for his faithful Jews. Yet the reader has to wonder what finite God is this who breaks all the old rules for the sake of convenience.This book is not an easy read, and beginning students who plod their way through it will find a reward, however high the price to be paid. But for scholars, this is a veritable gold mine, with large nuggests at every depth."},{"Title":"Christ: A Crisis in the Life of Christ","review":"&quot;In what follows, the text of the New Testament will be considered rather as if it were a stained-glass window. That is, it will be looked at and appreciated as a work of art, rather than seen through in an attempt to discover the historical events that lie behind it.&quot; [p.13]To those whose profession is to either inflate or deflate the gospels as a representation of actual history, this literary critique of the gospel account of Jesus' life may appear to be asking all of the wrong questions. But while the historical scholars duke it out over whether the gospels can be treated as history, the meaning of the gospels, in the broader context of the relationship between God and the Jewish people (and, later by extension, to the rest of the world). After five centuries since the promise of a restoration of the kingdom was first offered and no hope of it yet being fulfilled, a redefinition of the relationship was in order.The gospels portray a redefinition of this relationship in ways that shocked the conscience of the average Jew. Not only would God come down in the form of a man (something that hadn't been done since the days of the early patriarchs), he would come not to conquer the world, but to re-enact the Passover, only this time, God would play a completely different role: the Sacrificial Lamb. The literary methods highlighted by Miles depict a story in which Jesus reveals only a little at a time, sometimes speaking in parables and other cryptic language, in order to pique the curiosity of his audience so that they can fully appreciate what he said at the right time.As with his earlier book, God: A Biography, Miles looks at the text without the theological gloss of later religious commentators, and analyzes the text solely for its dramatic and literary value. Miles expressly makes the point that in the gospels, everything is mentioned for a reason. For example, Miles points out that the Devil's temptation of Jesus indicates more is implied than just an interaction between the Son of God and his archenemy. The Devil's questions and tests resemble those that a people who had been waiting a long time for God to restore them would ask. The post hoc theological worldview and the misplaced emphasis on the need for historical authenticity have dulled this edge of this passage.Miles closes the book with a defense of the literary criticism method of analyzing the gospels, which he admits is the exception rather than the rule in the historical-critical vs. Christian apologetic debate. While the paucity of helpful archaeological data does little to help solve (or refute) the historical meaning that orthodox Christianity has made the primary focus, Miles' literary method gives us an evenhanded glimpse of what the message in the gospels must have been like to the original audience, which bears much more fruitful meaning, at least to the question of why people would dedicate their lives to Jesus Christ even when they were not relying on a historical record of an actual event."},{"Title":"Christ: A Crisis in the Life of Christ","review":"For anyone interested in the life of Christ (God Incarnate), whether Born-Again Christian, Muslim, Mormon, or Catholic this book should be read for its beautiful and fascinating research into the life of this extraordinary God-man. I have read so many books that present Jesus as a figment of the author's own imagination. Jack Miles doesn't gloss over anything that Jesus said or did, he presents the gospels almost verbatim and explores his relationship to human beings courageously and boldly. His chapter on the sexuality of the Son of God was quite shocking and reads to much into the story of Jesus and the woman at the well. I felt that this chapter was brave but not insightful; whether or not Jesus had premarital sex, and if he will have a wife in the heavenly kingdom is unfounded. He was tempted in all ways as we are but without sin, this would seemt o include sexual relations outside of marriage, which Christ so highly esteemed and commanded.This book did open my eyes and opened my heart to see Christ in a way that I had never done before. I learned many new things from this magnificent work, though I do not agree with some of his speculations, I do find his insights engaging and worth heavy consideration. This book should win a Pulitzer Prize like his first book did. A very interesting book indeed!"},{"Title":"Christ: A Crisis in the Life of Christ","review":"Jack Miles really explored Jesus Christ as a person in a fresh and interesting way in this book. I believe both Christians and unbelievers can read this book with an open mind and come away having investigated a real Jesus not caught up in the dogmatic religious views as if Jesus never lived in a real time and place and had human experiences both bad and good. Miles does a great job breaking down the scriptures and examining them for what took place and eaximing Jesus as a real flesh and blood person in great detail.He uses the gospels as if they were 100% true to examine Christ as literary character. It was an enlightening read."},{"Title":"Christ: A Crisis in the Life of Christ","review":"Although I can't necessarily say that I agree with the author's main premise that God made a mistake and is trying to correct it, I can say that some of the exegesis and original plays on perspective concerning certain passages and stories in the Bible are borderline brilliant. For instance, the woman at the well story that I've read dozens of times is looked at from the perspective of the woman in a flirtatious setting, showing the wiles of Christ. The author basically sticks to the basic premise of redemption from a Christian perspective, but through the perspective of God, or at least his perception of how God thinks. His approach is certainly unique among the books I've read and most of the methods and logic that drives the ultimate conclusion made by the author is at least to some degree understandable, regardless of my disagreement. If nothing else, this book is challenging and well worth the time. This is a book I will likely read again at a future date."},{"Title":"Christ: A Crisis in the Life of Christ","review":"A new and exciting look at the scriptures and their true meaning of Jesus' role in God's relationship with mankind. It will challenge your thinking and understanding of the role of Jesus' in the New Testament."},{"Title":"Christ: A Crisis in the Life of Christ","review":"I read Jack Miles' God, a Biography several months ago and was so impressed by it that I immediately ordered Christ. I found it equally impressive.Though Miles wrote Christ as a literary interpretation of the Bible, it must also be understood as theology. Miles writes, \\"The changing of the mind of God is the great subject, the epic argument, of the Christian Bible (p.244).\\" This is a modern, theological conception of God that is opposed by two thousand years of belief in a God who must be changeless because God is perfect. Yet how can anybody read the atrocities that the Bible claims that God committed, and see that radical difference in the racist, vengeful God of Moses, and the forgiving Christ and seriously maintain that these are the same God? I detested this God so perfervidly that I became an atheist while still a boy. If this God actually exists and is our father, then the Bible is an epic of God's horrible parenting. He can hardly complain that his children have all become neurotic juvenile delinquents.However, whether or not God actually exists, there is overwhelming evidence that suggests that he exists as an archetype within the mind of humankind. So the Bible can best be understood as the evolution of God within the mind of humankind. Hence, the Bible can best be understood as an epic of God overcoming his own self-ignorance. According to Miles, Christ died on the cross to demonstrate that God would subject himself, without retaliation, to the same hate and cruelty to which his children were subjected - not because \\"He died for our sins.\\" This is a unique interpretation of the crucifixion that would never have occurred to me. Whether this is \\"true\\" or not, this is, at least, a God that we can respect, and even love."},{"Title":"Christ: A Crisis in the Life of Christ","review":"Miles serves up a stimulating literary analysis of the New Testament as a literary unity, in contrast to textual and historical critical analysis. This is a Christology, but not a classical philosophical construct. Rather Miles focuses on the biblical text to discover the personality of Jesus and the concept of Christ we find in the writings of his followers in the New Testament texts.Miles builds on a historical perspective on the growing understanding of God through history that brings us to the time of Jesus, referencing the biblical texts of the Tanakh (Old Testament). That full story is developed in Miles' previous volume God: A Biography.Here he investigates how this biblical portrayal of God with its radical declarations of the meaning of Jesus the Messiah created troubling questions for the more rationally and philosophically oriented worldview into which Christianity moved. How can God be incarnate?The conflict starts in the disparity between the Jesus of the Gospels, with whom his followers lived, and the growing conviction among his followers that this Jesus was a personality beyond time. Paul states, for instance, \\"God was in Christ\\" (2 Cor 5:19). What did this mean? Simply put, the basic question is How God could become human. This is the core conundrim for both followers and distractors of the new faith.Various conflicting answers to these troubling questions gradually arose out of the philosophical maelstrom of the Mediterranean world where Christian faith finally took deep root. We are treated to a astute and competent display of the conceptual conflicts that develop, the philosophical crisis the Miles refers to.The title of the volume indicates the focus of the study. Miles examines the picture that we can actually perceive from the text itself, reading the books that make up the library collection of the New Testament, in sequence.Casual readers will be surprised to see how the actual picture in the text differ from a composite view that draws a single picture from the various glimpses of the various texts, a process which tends to be guided by our preconceptions. When Miles actually looks at what the text says, the picture that unfolds refreshingly differs in some way from most of the \\"received\\" or \\"normative\\" views.He investigates how the term \\"Christ\\" is used as a reference or title to the living Jesus and again is used to refer to the eternal entity identified with the \\"Word of God\\" in John's gospel or the risen Jesus. Some keen, challenging insights arise on the meaning of the Incarnation in the composite story of the New Testament writers."},{"Title":"Christ: A Crisis in the Life of Christ","review":"I appreciated Jack Miles writing about the life of Christ, especially how he places it in the context of the times and places of Christ. Miles provides a keen perspective on Christ that sees and hears as if from the audiences Christ spoke to and the culture in which he lived.Miles' vast knowledge of all things Biblical certainly offers readers a panorama of the Jewish history and religion into which Christ was born. This provides great background for the gospel story that Miles narrates throughout this book.Miles' opinions provide perspective that I didn't always agree with and occasionally, though rarely, his tone seems to be cynical of the gospels; however, I was comfortable and pleased with the overall way he treats the gospel narrative and explains and connects events. He often digresses to discussing Old Testament or Jewish history and relating it to the gospels. This is interesting although he sometimes seems to get off track before returning to the life of Christ.I think he successfully emphasizes and conveys the radical message that Christ preached and lived and how it seems to conflict with the Jewish expectations for Messiah. Miles shows why Jesus did what he did and the outcome of his death and resurrection on Jews and Gentiles for all time.I think those interested in the Bible and the life of Christ will enjoy and appreciate this book.Shakespeare On Spirituality: Life-Changing Wisdom from Shakespeare's Plays"},{"Title":"Christ: A Crisis in the Life of Christ","review":"I tried to read this same author's \\"God: A Biography\\" and for some reason found it heavy going ... but this seemed much shorter, and in fact I couldn't put it down.As someone who preaches, I appreciate the talent that Miles has to take scripture and ask \\"why did it happen this way, and not some other way?\\" His insight into what it really meant for Jesus to die for our sins, and in some sense to atone for them, and why his father asked Jesus to suffer, is a brilliant perspective on a subject that can so easily be reduced to pious platitudes. God's relationship with us isn't a simple thing sometimes, and the usual explanations just often won't do.I don't think you need to hold this to a standard of orthodox theology (which isn't its goal), but instead to a standard of whether it is a resource helpful for someone trying to come to terms with some of scripture's contradictions. I liked it a lot."},{"Title":"Christ: A Crisis in the Life of Christ","review":"How seriously can we take this book - not very. Although the author presents the material in research fashion, with footnotes referring to biblical translations, the book is largely just the thoughts of Mr. Miles and I am not sure if he is fooling himself or trying to fool his readers. The first clue is his first footnote: \\"Translations of biblical citations are my own, except when otherwise indicated.\\" What about the hundreds of years of research by biblical scholars one might ask? This vast expanse of information is rarely referred to by Mr. Miles. With that out of the way Mr Miles can write as he pleases.Look at Mr Miles analysis of one section of biblical text (Luke 7:36-50 when the woman of bad name cried and washed Jesus' feet with oil and dried them with her hair): &quot;A woman weeping for an unknown reason attracts all eyes to herself. If while she weeps she begins to undress (the meaning in this culture, of letting down her hair), her behavior becomes obscene, an obscene demonstration. But of what? Jesus interprets her action, quite apart from what it may say about her relationship to him, as a statement about Simon.&quot;Mr Miles states that \\"God has been taken neither as the object of religious belief nor as the topic in ancient history but as the central character in a work of literature.\\"I would agree with Mr Miles not to take this book as serious research, but I would state it differently: This is modern fad spun in trickster like fashion to represent the past."},{"Title":"Christ: A Crisis in the Life of Christ","review":"Miles' book attempts to interpret the Gospels through formal literary criticism. Rather than attaching historical study to the Gospels' message, Miles treats Jesus and his message purely through the text, and comes to a startling conclusion -- that Jesus' death was necessary because God failed to deliver on God's promise to the Israelites, and needed a way to triumph on a metaphysical level.Whether or not one agrees with Miles' premise, he writes brilliantly and understandably. Recent Biblical scholarship gets bogged down in dry-as-dust unintelligible &quot;academicese.&quot; Miles understands the principles of clear and succint writing while still advancing complicated theories. I recommend this one for anyone seeking to stretch their understanding of what we have received as Scripture, as well as those interested in literature and how it relates to the Bible. Like him or not, read Miles to get your brain working."},{"Title":"Christ: A Crisis in the Life of Christ","review":"Jack Miles, author of the Pulitzer Prize - winning *God -a Biogaphy* has written an excellent literary analysis of Christ in the New Testament.What is the &quot;crisis&quot; referred to in the title? The crisis is that God has not delivered his Chosen People from 500 years of oppression. How does God solve this problem? Answer: God/Christ commits sacred suicide. This is Miles' provocative conclusion from his stirictly literary analysis the Christian Bible. How does Miles arrive at the conclusion? You, dear reader, should read the book in order to appreciate how he develops his plot and arrives at his conclusion. And believe me, there is a plot!A caution is in order. Miles writes and studies Christ from a strictly literary point of view. He is not interested in the historical Jesus. If one reads this only to learn about the fundamentalist Jesus, the traditional Christian Jesus, or the historical Jesus, then this book will not satisfy! If on the other hand, you want to experience a great Biblical reading adventure, then buy and read this book!I also would recommend that a reader, who is unfamiliar with literary critism and postmodernism, study and read Miles' appendices. &quot;Appendix I&quot; deals with the biblical canon and &quot;Appendix II&quot; deals with the history of critcal analysis of the Bible (e.g. historical criticism, canonical criticism, literary critcism)and how to appreciate the Bible as art.I did not always agree with the author, but I enjoyed how he told the story of Christ. As a postmodern Christian, I will not privilege my reading over his.Have fun reading *Christ: a Crisis in the Life of God*!"},{"Title":"Christ: A Crisis in the Life of Christ","review":"By Miles' own admission, his approach is strictly literary and he has even coined the term \\"theography\\" to more properly describe his approach. Miles attempted in his first book to view the character of God in the Tanakh (the Jewish version of the Old Testament, which is in a different order than in the Bible that Christians use) as one would view a character in any literary work. God goes through doubt, conflict, remorse, even depression in Miles' reading of the Jewish scriptures, ending in an uneasy peace and a centuries-long silence. It is almost as if God is trying to figure out what the hell he's going to do next.In the \\"sequel,\\" Christ: A Crisis in the Life of God, God breaks his silence. God had promised his chosen nation, Israel, that he would return them to their homeland out of exile and demolish their enemies with glorious military victory. This was the currency of the day for gods, and Jehovah was not one to be one-upped. However, the crisis in the title deals with the fact that God does not keep his promise. Being the creator of the universe, one does not suspect that he can not keep it, so the only other option is that he chooses not to. Indeed, a Nazi-equivalent holocaust will soon strike his people and his nation. God not only will go back on his promise--he will do so in spades. But why? The answer to this question is to be found in reading the whole book, and a synopsis cannot do it justice, but in a phrase: he has thought of a better way.God comes to earth, in the form of a baby, turning his sublime Self into the ridiculous humiliation of an infant being born with all that blood and pain, entering the world to the smell of manger droppings -- the Lord of Hosts, completely dependent on the world just to stay alive. And it is just that dependence that is the point God (and Miles) is trying to make. God doesn't just want to kick military butt for his people, he wants to win a greater victory--he wants to conquer Satan, which means he wants to conquer pain, sorrow, shame and, ultimately, death itself. God wants to identify with his people by becoming a person. And not only that, he wants to suffer the most horrific, humiliating death imaginable so that he can relate to all of his children, not just Israel.Miles does Christians an immense favor by starting his book with the reminder that the Crucifixion is supposed to be one of the most disgusting scenes imaginable. While it has been sanitized in most popular religious artwork (even to the point of calling the day we commemorate it \\"Good\\" Friday), the truth of the matter is that God is butchered like a lamb who, unlike a lamb, walks into his death with full knowledge of what is happening to him. The French subtitle of the work is \\"The Suicide of the Son of God\\" drawing attention to what some recent French theologians in an Appendix call Suicide Theology. The purpose again is to shock, not for the sake of shocking, but to re-create what the disciples must have been going through to see their God going through the death of a criminal.Speaking of the Jews of the time, much attention is given these days to what is called \\"the Historical Jesus.\\" While much of this scholarship and research may be valuable, the more and more we try to track this misty figure down, the more diminishing seem the returns. One wonders what the actual effect would be if we were to have a documentary of the life of Christ filmed in living Technicolor. Would it increase our faith? Or would it disappoint? The reactionary reaction to the radical re-thinking of Jesus of History is to focus on the Christ of faith. Whereas conjecture and history are the guides of the former, the church and tradition are the guides of the latter. Doctrine and dogma, rule and questions are eschewed in exchange for the comfort of faith. This is the Christianity that most people are familiar with, yet, as Jaroslav Pelikan in Jesus Through The Centuries has shown so cogently, there is no one Christianity that you can point to; no Christ of faith that exists, but many Christs. No matter on either side of the debate, Miles says, what we have is a book (a series of books, actually) that shows a third way (as genius often does), leaving the two bickering schools in his literary dust.In an Appendix to his work, Miles compares the two schools to people who try to see through a rose window in a cathedral, one school trying to remove the stain, the other trying to stain everything. Miles prefers to look at the window: the Gospel story, taken as a whole. The work of art this is the Bible is, after all, what captured the imagination of the world. Neither the Jesus of History nor the Christ of Faith is nearly as worthy of our attention as the character Jesus Christ of the Bible.Miles writes that he was first inspired to write his two books by Bach's brilliant masterwork St. Matthew's Passion. Which brings us back to the half-facetious title of this review. Is Jack a saint? Perhaps. Perhaps not, but he is, in my estimation, performing as important a translation job as did St. Jerome back a thousand and a half years ago. By bringing the story (and both of the contending schools must remember that this faith has always been based on storytelling) of Jesus Christ back into focus, Miles has given us a Newer Testament: something fresh, despite the age of the story, something creative despite the re-hashing of familiar scenes, something that can truly bring the Spirit of God as close to us as our breath."},{"Title":"Christ: A Crisis in the Life of Christ","review":"I suppose that readers who finished Miles' prior book, \\"God: A Biography\\" will be equally captivated by this new title - a sequel of sorts. But if this is your first exposure to Miles' \\"literary God\\" you might find, as I did, that your interest waxes, but quickly wanes.The unusual approach he takes to his rather unique protagonist is really fascinating at first, but after a while it just wears out its welcome - a 30,000-word, tightly-edited piece in \\"The New Yorker\\" would have served the central idea better. While there is certainly a different artistic sensibility at work here, reading this book was something akin to watching \\"Rocky\\", then \\"Rocky II\\" and \\"III\\" all in a row. A relatively powerful theme and a stylistically new framework beats you up through repetition in too many guises. Imagine \\"Brother, Where Art Thou II\\"Its hard to figure out who would enjoy this book end-to-end, as obviously quite a few have. A deeply and more traditionally Christian readership will be simply appalled by the diminishment of the central elements of their faith to historico-literary plot requirements. An agnostic, humanist or simply atheist readership will be put off by Miles' clear deep faith in the underlying reality of the story. I suppose \\"lit crit\\" types could enjoy it, but by eschewing the academic dryness of their genre, this book also steps outside their focus and stands as an implicit criticism of the emptiness of that approach.The idea is intriguing enough at first take - to treat the biblical \\"God\\" as a literary character. Trace his (no Goddess here!) ups and downs from the perspective of how his collective authorship struggled to recreate a protagonist consistent with their culture's own diminishment and the failure of earlier \`chapters' to come true - eventually turning to the plot \\"twists\\" of the New Testament and the new character in the story, Christ.But that collectivity or authorship was a source of one of my itching complaints that eventually had to be scratched. Why not just attribute the twists and turns of the main characters of this God story to the unusual fact that it was written over hundreds of years, and by authors in the thrall of faith and a belief that earlier \\"drafts\\" were holy writ ? That is, why not follow the more traditional analyses that consider either the theological or the historical growth and change of the idea of God ? Admittedly these have often been dryer than Sinai dust, but that only suggests that the real accomplishment of Miles is to tell the story a lot more engagingly - the David McCullough of a different era.After all - how many literary characters have been created thus, by dozens of authors over centuries ? It seems hardly the same thing as traditional character-based literary analysis - tracing the development in David Copperfield's or Silas Marner's personae over several hundred pages. Furthermore, Miles' tracings are rather sweeping. By the time I got to the chapter exploring the plumbing of Christ's sexuality I was at about the same point I would be if a similar book were exploring Huck Finn's unstated masturbatory life! Unless lit crit is your field, such tracings can hardly hold your interest as much as the stories themselves. Eventually the distinctiveness of the approach loses its freshness and starts to seem silly. A frankly good-old-fashioned fiction such as Mailer's or Saramago's is ultimately more satisfying."},{"Title":"Christ: A Crisis in the Life of Christ","review":"Pulitzer prize winning author Jack Miles, who wrote &quot;God: A Biography&quot;, has finished in this work what he started in the other: a biographical analysis of God that developes both his character and characteristics throughout the writings of the old and new testaments. Written from a literary critic's perspective, Miles makes its clear from the beginning that his is not a historical or theological exegesis---something some reviewers have been in error to have expected. As such, Miles freely allows his character to to go where the literature of the bible takes him and to evolve plotwise from expectant creator, to general and ogre, to finally a loving father..The outstanding contribution of Mile's book is the way it traces God's role from Israel's defender, to Israel's punisher, to finally the impotent (in this world) suffering servant who crucifies himself just before the entire country is about to be crucified along with him in the 70 AD and 135 AD rebellions against Rome. One can clearly see the changing motifs of the biblical writers as promise after promise in the bible fails to materialize and they are forced to literarily justify these failings in order to protect the integrity of their god. In the end, God's power is shifted to the next world and away from this one, in much the same way that Paul's theology shifted the second coming from this world to the next when it became obvious that it wasnt going to happen within his lifetime (read 1st Cor, 7:29). Miles, true to his committment to not render historical or theological conclusions, never explicitly says this, but it is obvious to anyone carefully reading the text.I highly recommend this book for the reasons stated above, and would add that works such as Mile's go far towards the prospect of clarifying humanity's relationship with what Freud called the &quot;hysteria&quot; that humans feel when they, unlike any other animal on the planet (to our present knowledge), comprehend that their own life has an end.."},{"Title":"Christ: A Crisis in the Life of Christ","review":"This is a work of vast erudition, and its extremely clever author deserves the benefit of the doubt from his readers. Many reviewers of both this book and the author's previous book on the Tanakh (aka God: A Biography) evidently assume that there is something whimsical, shallow and capricious--even blasphemous--about Miles' meditation on the evolving character within history of the God of the Old Testament, and in this book, of God Incarnate as he is revealed in the New Testament. On the contrary, while highly original and beautifully written, to a Nietzchean level which is capable of glossing over weak or even dangerous arguments with lovely and sometimes thrilling prose--this book is in fact fundamentally grounded in some of the most recent, and exciting works of Biblical scholarship written in the last decade or so.Before questioning the author's intentions, it might be wise to read two splendid commentaries on the New Testament, Moloney's commentary on the Gospel of John and Byrne's commentary on Romans, both published as part of the Catholic &quot;Sacra Pagina&quot; series and available on Amazon. These commentaries address the profound harmonies between Judaism and Christianity, and provide plenty of objective buttressing for the arguments put forward in a very readable and thought-provoking way by Miles.It is true that the idea which Miles may consider the keynote of his thesis--his revision of the doctrine of atonement--will be rejected by believing Christians, and there is certainly nothing in the above-mentioned commentaries that supports Miles on that point. But this is a clearly demarcated part of his thesis, and the close and fascinating reading of the New Testament, principally the Gospel of John, that emerges from Miles' analysis follows the Scripture closely and is unrelated to Miles' unnecessarily provocative original contribution to the doctrine of atonement.Often Miles adopts a rhetorical strategy that seems to distance himself from Christian belief, but this is generally a pose which allows him to maintain his scholarly credentials while taking the Scripture at face value. It might also be useful to read Leo Strauss's &quot;Persecution and the Art of Writing&quot; in order to understand Miles' strategy of creating enough intellectual elbow-room amidst the aridity and reductionism of historical Biblical criticism in order to propose his creative and generally reverent ideas.Enjoy Miles's dazzling intellectual performance, but take him seriously as well. This is a very stimulating work that has an important place in the evolving reconciliation between Christianity and Judaism. One does not have to agree with everything in it to enjoy many benefits from Miles' thinking. It is a splendid and humane work of the religious imagination."},{"Title":"Christ: A Crisis in the Life of Christ","review":"Mr. Miles drives past the Jesus Seminarians, the historical Jesus freaks, and the Q gospel talking heads, toiling away with their picks and shovels, and says let's look at the gospels (primarily the Gospel of John) in a different way...as a piece of literature, a sort of historical novel, and see if that allows us to gain a better understanding of the main character, God.That literary (not to be confused with literal) approach gives the reader a real sense of freedom from the heavy wet blankets of theological reverence (...God does not make mistakes!) and biblical historocity (...did this really happen?...can we attribute that saying directly to Jesus?), and allows him or her to reflect on the radical difference between God as presented in the Old Testament and God as presented incarnate as Jesus Christ.How does one reconcile the God that appeared to Joshua, with sword drawn, as the Commander of Lord's Hosts, \\"the divine warrior in person,\\" ready to lead the victorious assault on Israel's enemies in the battle of Jerico, with the God who delivered the Sermon on the Mount? How does God go from promising to crush Israel's enemies and restore a great, powerful and independent Israel, to being the God who declares victory by saying, \\"Take heart, I have conquered the world\\" just before he surrenders himself to be crucified by the hated Roman conqerers of Israel? Mr. Miles, accepting the gospel premise that Jesus is God, taking the stories in the bible at face value, weaves in the context of the times, first century Jewish culture, and God's previous covenant and history with Israel, and provides some elegant and provocative answers.Christ: A Crisis in the Life of God is enlightening, thought provoking, provocative, blah, blah blah. I recommend it because it is such a refreshing and challenging approach to this subject. Literary perspective or not, make no mistake about it, Mr. Miles is quite serious about the underlying moral theology that is the message of the gospels. It's just that he presents the subject in such a facinating way, he makes it fun to just sit back and go for the ride.Give yourself a treat, read this book."},{"Title":"Christ: A Crisis in the Life of Christ","review":"Miles' earlier work on a desert people's god, \\"God: A Biography,\\" focused on a deity new at the job. Miles' portrayal depicted a god learning the role. He's inconsistent, breaks promises, commits genocide and grows increasingly dictatorial. At one point, a single man challenges him, winning a moral victory which clearly disturbs this irrational spirit. Finally, like an elderly curmudgeon, the deity simply withdraws from those he wishes to worship him.According to Miles, after a long span of time the god has learned remorse. He has subjected his followers to a succession of invasions and dispersals. Israel becomes a client state of the Assyrians, Babylon, Greece, and now, Rome. As with many aged, powerful men, the god has reflected on his own actions and decided some positive actions are in order. He doesn't consider his career a failure, but discerns humanity's course isn't following its destined path. Genocide and other manifestations of his power are no longer the answer. A new course is necessary, so he becomes the Incarnation - a deity housed in a human body.Miles portrayal of Christ's life shows how poorly this deity understands his creation. After all, as a god with neither peers nor serious challengers, he fails to understand human characteristics. Throughout the account, Christ is ambivalent in his assigned role. He shifts from expressing his divinity to being but a man, confused and perplexed by the role forced on him. He doesn't question his fate, knowing, at least in his adult life, that he is to be sacrificed. He understands the need for his role, but anticipates the pain as any of us would.Miles relates how uncertainty leads to ambivalence in the behaviour of this Incarnation. Repelling followers at first, he begins gathering adherents, but, they too, are confused. Mostly Jews, his recruits think his mission is to restore Israel as promised. When they fail to understand his claim to a wider mission, they fail to comprehend. How can this \\"messiah\\" claim to redeem Israel when he offers succor to strangers and enemies? When he dies in such squalid circumstances, a social criminal, the distress among his followers is intense. Miles notes the significance of such a death, describing it as \\"a huge and horrifying surprise\\". Christ has not imparted his knowledge of the finale, leaving his followers confused and adrift. Even the resurrection seems hardly worthy of notice. There's no grandeur, no powerful declarations, little drama. The meaning of it all must be derived over time until the deity's original intention can be imparted to others. The result is not the god's accomplishment, but the people who had faith in the idea and imparted it to others.Miles' account is full of inconsistencies and elf-contradictions. These are not author's faults, however, resulting instead from the material he consults and brings to our view. The Incarnation is as inconsistent as his \\"father,\\" which isn't surprising given his previous career. Christ asserts the teachings of the Prophets foretell his coming, yet the god Miles portrays seems to know nothing of \\"love\\" in those days, particularly love of all humanity. The god's focus, promises and failures, are for Israel alone. How then, does this deity in its human incarnation, expect anyone to believe his new identity? Miles concludes that the act of sacrifice is self-explanatory needing no further elaboration.Miles postscripts the story with a literary analysis of its telling. One interesting facet is the Bible's use of irony. Irony uses or \\"double meaning, or reversal of meaning. . . and will not stoop to explanation.\\" He suggests that in this case, long-standing practices are suddenly reversed, then there is a place for irony in religion. He admits to the novelty of the concept, but argues that it fits the Judeo-Christian story. It's a compelling and challenging idea, but then, so is this book."},{"Title":"Christ: A Crisis in the Life of Christ","review":"It's my good fortune to have spent about a year in India over the course of the last three years, and I've often hosted first time visitors. Conversations invariably move to an overview of Hinduism, a religion that is quite foreign to Westerners. Almost without fail my guests have voiced the belief that Hinduism is all myth, and not to be taken very seriously. I've taken to asking these folks what makes Hinduism more a myth, or fiction, or literary construct than Christianity, and, to no surprise, they've failed to come up with an answer. I'm sure if any of these folks had been dyed in the wool Christians I would have heard something about the revealed word of God, etc., etc., but they've been open-minded enough to ponder the questions and the implications of judging another's belief system based on their own.With both, \\"God, a Biography,\\" and \\"Christ: A Crisis in the Life of God,\\" Jack Miles has opened the field of discourse by presenting the Primogenitor as a literary character rather than a factual being; and Christ as the same, regardless of his historical reality. He has asked Christians to look at their God in much the same way we look at \\"foreign\\" Gods. Was Krishna born on July 19, 3228 BCE, in Gokula, India? Will he return at the end of the current age to usher in a time of peacefulness? Was Jesus born on December 25th, 1 CE. Will he return to judge the living and the dead? To Hindu's Krishna walked, talked, made love, performed miracles. To Christians Christ did the same (except, perhaps, made love.) How much credence we give to any story depends on our orientation, but regardless of belief, the stories themselves are wonderful.One reason they're wonderful is they are rich in metaphor, and it's the metaphor that Mr. Miles explores to great effect. Who can deny the beauty of an infant, and the idea of an infant knowingly giving love? Who can deny the power in the story of God admitting an error and sacrificing himself in an attempt at rectification?Mr. Miles's success is that he opens the metaphor, and forces us to think.Although I'm not a huge fan of Mr. Miles literary style - in fact, I find it a bit stilted - what he has to say more than adequately compensates for the difficulty style presents.Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Christ: A Crisis in the Life of Christ","review":"Except to grant you the courage to endure whatever atrocities lie in wait, and prepare your place in heaven. Forget about help from God here on earth. Whether collectively, such as freeing his enslaved nation, or righting wrongs perpetrated by evildoers in power--much less answering prayers for personal trivia such as good health or a good job.A good job?\\" Blessed are the Poo-BoY. \\"Courage, yes. Hope? No way, Jacob.Like his previous work 'God: A Biography' in which the author takes the Tanakh, or Old Testament, under scrutiny as a work of literature, without asserting or denying the objective truth of what is written, but focusing on the narrative drama to see where The Character is going as He changes from act to act; The author has a free hand to indulge in back door theology. After all, he's just examining a work of art for its own sake. And Jack Miles does so brilliantly. This is a first rate work of--well, all sorts of things, backdoor theology not excluded.Here's the Prologue: In the original Tanakh, the order of the books which have come to be known to Christianity as 'The Old Testament' was different: The Book of Job was towards the end.After Job, God in effect, shuts up. ( See 'Answer to Job ' by C.G Jung which Miles, somewhat naughtily, fails to credit) God never appears on stage again. He's quoted, but that's about it.The Israelites make do with their own sagacity in The Book of Ruth but God is nowhere to be found. That's one clue.More important, as the new play begins with God Incarnate, around 30 years old, making his first public appearance-----God has failed to keep His promise.Once upon a time, He delivered his chosen people out of Egypt--wiping out a lot of Egyptians in the process--the start of His career as warrior. A few centuries later, however, his chosen suffer utter defeat at the hands of Assyria and Babylon.Nevertheless he tells them via Jeremiah, Isaiah, Daniel and co. that they were being punished for their sins ( Assyria and Babylon being merely His instruments) but then, to quote Miles:\\" Soon, he said, he would wreak havoc against their new enemies, the same spectacular havoc that he had wreaked in Egypt, ravishing the landscape, laying waste to the flaura and fauna, decimating the human population and so forth. They would be victorious, and grateful, and--a matter obsessively on his mind--the world would know beyond doubt that he was Lord. \\"Didn't happen. In fact, sitting at the feet of John the Baptist, and elsewhere, Israel's \\"prisoners of hope\\" must now contend that in fact, NOTHING has happenned for 500 years.Other than Israel being handed down as a war prize to the Persians, then The Greeks of Alexander, and now, to the worst oppresor of all--The Romans.So God decides to become fully human, without ceasing to be The Lord, and, knowing full well the disaster that will destroy Jerusalem and kill over a million Jews in the revolts of 70 and 135 A.D (C.E for the politically correct) decides He must get Himself crucified and triumph over death itself--a terrible curse which He had pronounced on mankind for a minor offence. Miles agrees with Albert Camus: God had to suffer because He knew that He Himself was not altogether innocent.A spectacular read which is, to use Miles favorite adjective, ironic.It's ironic that this book is, in so many essentials, thouroughly \\"orthodox.\\" Yes, of course, Jesus is God. This is a work of art and The Gospel of John wouldn't make dramatic sense, let alone stand as a masterpiece of irony, unless one accepts that this pacifist, this Lamb, is the same Being who punished Israelites complaining of hunger with a plague of snakes which killed thousands and ordered genocide against the Amalekites.An awesome tale.Ironically, (sorry, Jack) the author has created his own literary work of art."},{"Title":"602 Reasons to Be Ticked Off","review":"I wrote a longer review on this book a while back,but for some reason it was not posted.I really didn't enjoy it at all and had a hard time wading through it,but I did.This book is so self -centered that it lacked any humor.

The people who enjoy Saxon Math products seem to be highly educated themselves and tend to value a traditional mathematics education as the foundation for success in life, especially if they rely heavily upon mathematics in their professional lives. The people who don't like it seem to have arguments like, \\"it's boring\\" or \\"it's not fair.\\" You can't put on a clown suit every day and make everything fun all the time. Like or not, there is much repetition and memorization of facts in order to do well in math. The only way to succeed in high school or college math is to get the facts down really well at the elementary level. It's that simple. Saxon Math is great at taking each concept, introducing it in depth, and then compounding on it throughout the book so it isn't forgotten. I assure you, there's no distortion of facts. This is not \\"fuzzy math!\\" I work with my daughter every day on the assignments. I don't give her the book to work alone; therefore, I am able to work quickly through it with her and skip problem sets that she has mastered well. For the person who thought five minutes is not enough time to do 100 problems, well, you are right. In the beginning, it is quite challenging for a child to do even 40 in five minutes. The beauty of it is that by doing it day after day, the repetition and memorization will make it easier. My daughter could only do 42 division problems in five minutes two months ago, but today she got 98 correct. It was a victory! These worksheets are meant to challenge the child, not to defeat them. Children who get frustrated by them just need to keep working through it. The frustration comes because they don't have their facts memorized yet! So teach them, and keep teaching them. If you make excuses for your child and say \\"it's too hard\\" or \\"it's not fair\\" then you are making them believe they cannot accomplish the task, and that's not fair! To keep things interesting or fun, play math games, do math crossword puzzles, play Suduko, paint your geometric shapes, bake something fun when learning measurements, do fun math programs on the computer, or count jelly beans and eat them! You can always supplement a good solid course like Saxon Math with these things and have a well-rounded program that teaches all of the fundamentals."},{"Title":"Math 54: An Incremental Development (Homeschool Math 5/4)","review":"This book can be used to teach introductory mathematics to elementary level students, whether in a formal classroom or in a home school setting. The print is large and clear, there are many diagrams and most concepts are explained in more than one way.There are 120 lessons, starting with the basics of addition and going through all of the basic arithmetic operations and their many uses. Whole numbers, decimal numbers and fractions are covered, including word problems. Each lesson starts with a short one or two page section of new material, which is then following by a two-part problem section. The first part is a set of problems over the section and the second is a collection of problems using concepts covered to that point. The order of presentation is sound, nothing is introduced before all the appropriate preliminaries have been examined.If you are looking for a textbook for elementary school mathematics or are searching for additional challenges for your child, then this book will serve your purposes."},{"Title":"Math 54: An Incremental Development (Homeschool Math 5/4)","review":"Excellent math program for homeschooling students. I have used various other titles and found the Saxon math program to be the best for all 3 of my children. The best part is the step by step approach to learning. Each day, a new topic is introduced as well as a review of all the previous topics. Students retain more and do better on achievement tests. For example, when studying fractions, you learn a little at a time and always review from before. You don't just do fractions for a chapter and never see them again until your annual achievement test."},{"Title":"Math 54: An Incremental Development (Homeschool Math 5/4)","review":"I'm an engineer with 2 college degrees and a professional engineering license, so I knew what my kid needed to learn. When I went through my education, we learned the great names in math, like Pythagoras, Newton, and Euler, who had made great discoveries contributing to the field. I noted that my kid's name was not among them, so I decided that it was probably best to leave the discoveries to those people, while my kid simply took advantage of the discoveries and had the material taught to him. I knew that it wouldn't be a lot of \\"fun\\", but I wasn't particularly interested in trying to make math fun - I have enough common sense to know that kids are learning little, if anything, if they are having a lot of fun.Other than Singapore Math, Saxon is the only method left in the United States that still uses the \\"Direct Instruction\\" method (memorizing times tables, etc.), as opposed to the \\"Discovery\\" method (where kids can spend 2 weeks coming up with different ways to solve 8 times 7). Direct Instruction is the traditional way to learn math, and I still haven't seen any data show why we, as a country, abandoned it (other than having our math scores drop to the bottom of the world).While our child is not a genius, he was able to complete this book, plus the next 3 books prior to Algebra 1/2 in just over a year (and well before the material covered in school).

Those terms are used in conjunction with word problems, which is completetely acceptable. Who ever did words problems where they expliciltly tell you add this or subtract that. So the book is actually teaching the concept that when you see word problems with phrases like,\\"some more\\" it's going to be an addition problem.

I have, however, been unhappy with my daughter's mathematics curriculum at school which seems to focus on the mechanics of math rather than problem-solving/logic. I believe the mechanics of math as well as problem-solving/logic are critical to understanding math. The Saxon book is divided into Lessons and each lesson is divided into Warm-Up, New Concepts, Lesson Practice and Mixed Practice. We typically only do the Mental Math section of the Warm-Up because I think mental math is very important. I might introduce the concept explanation as one of many explanations because I do not think Saxon necessarily does the best job of describing concepts. Lesson Practice section is limited. Even if your child learns very quickly, I would recommend introducing problems from other book sources. I do like the Mixed Problem Set in each chapter because it allows me to pull certain problems for reviewing material while still moving forward. I do not think the Saxon Math book has the best organization of topics and I do not proceed sequentially through the book. I determine the order and I use the book as a reference or as another source for problems. I also use Singapore Mathematics for better explanation of concepts/word problems and Spectrum Math for practice in the mechanics of math.

Do NOT under any circumstances force your child into this method of 'learning' math, as it will doom them to slow, painful understanding of what should be a very enjoyable subject and will leave them unprepared to deal with higher math concepts. Saxon's misguided and experimental method of teaching math concepts is a spell of doom to any student who wants to then move on to an understanding of the principles and properties of math, or to apply them in science or engineering. Arithmetic has been around since the Arabians, and many brilliant people have figured out over thousands of years the easiest and most effective way to teach the subject.

In language that managed the delicate trick of being exquisitely clear and uncompromisingly evangelistic, Berkeley described how a computer works, step by step, instruction by instruction. Employing numerous diagrams, and painstakingly explaining every underlying concept (like \\"binary\\" or \\"register\\" or \\"input/output\\") as if it had never been explained before, Berkeley demonstrated how it was possible to move digital information from one \\"place\\" to another -- and how a set of on/off switches, if wired correctly, could perform operations on that information, handling such extraordinary feats as the addition of two plus two.Berkeley walked the walk. He built his own computer, Simon, considered by some historians to be the first \\"personal computer,\\" and documented the process in a series of 13 articles for Radio Electronics magazine and also in this book. Simon was so simple and so small in fact that it could be built to fill up only four cubic feet, cost less than $1000, could be carried in one hand, and was expandable. It may seem that a simple model of a mechanical brain like Simon was of no great practical use. On the contrary, Simon had the same use in instruction as a set of simple chemical experiments had: to stimulate thinking and understanding, and to produce training and skill. By 1959, over 400 Simon plans had been sold. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants a very clear description of the world's first personal computer."},{"Title":"Giant brains; or, Machines that think","review":"This 1949 book introduced the public to \\"mechanical brains\\". Edmund C. Berkeley wrote a book that every one can read. [A \\"computer\\" then was the person who used a slide-rule or other computational device.] Berkeley graduated from Harvard College in 1930, became an actuary for a life insurance company, served in the USNR at the Harvard Computation Laboratory and worked on the Aiken Mark II Relay Calculator. Later he was part of the team that bought the UNIVAC, a large-scale automatic computer. Since 1948 he operated his own consulting business handling information and computing.The 'Preface' says the use of mechanical brains is as great an advance as printing over writing for labor savings (p.vii). He will compare four of these machines. You don't have to read the entire book, only what seems interesting. You could skip some sections (p.viii). Chapter 1 explains these machines are similar to what a brain would be if it were hardware instead of flesh and nerves. Thinking in the human brain is done by storing information and then referencing to it by learning and remembering (p.2). Nerve cells operate like a relay or on-off switch (p.3). The behavior that is thinking can be done by a machine; it is defined on page 5. But they can't do certain things which wild animals can (p.8). Machines excel in processing numbers and solving problems that could not be done by humans. Berkeley suggests that in the future computers will know what is in libraries and tell you where to find certain information (p.9).The abacus was the first calculating machine and is used all over Asia (p.19). Modern calculating machines are the dial telephone and the fire-control instrument to control a gun (p.19). Chapter 3 describes a simple relay computer. Chapter 4 tells about punch-card calculating machines (nine types). Berkeley describes the four computers in use then. The MIT Differential Analyzer was an analogue machine (like those used for fire-control of guns) used to solve differential equations (Chapter 5). Harvard's IBM Automatic Sequence-Controlled Calculator used switches and relays to calculate with an accuracy of 23 digits. Punched cards and tapes provided input and output, electric typewriters displayed results (p.97). Paper tape controlled it (Chapter 6).The Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia built the ENIAC (Chapter 7). It used electronic tubes for calculating, and made relay computers obsolete. John W. Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert Jr. are credited as the inventors. It could calculate \\"a very wide class of problems\\" (p.114). A 6SN7 radio tube contained a decimal number, ten tubes for the ten digits (p.119). The ENIAC used stored instruction as proposed by John W. Neumann (p.124). Human error delays setting the machine for a new problem. Chapter 8 describes the Bell Laboratories' General-Purpose Relay Calculator which was 99.999,999,999% reliable. George R. Stibitz proposed using telephone switching equipment to do multiplications and divisions automatically. Relays would remember and calculate numbers. A special purpose computing machine tested the accuracy of instruments used to control guns (p.131). It used the biquinary system, like the abacus (p.133). Seven relays were needed for each decimal digit. This machine can run unattended (p.142). Chapter 10 tells of new devices for storing information, programming the machine, reliability, and auxiliary devices. Chapter 11 imagines what computers could do in the future. Some of these came true, some may not be cost-effective. Chapter 12 speculates on the eventual results from thinking machines. Controversy leads to thought."},{"Title":"Just and Painful: A Case for the Corporal Punishment of Criminals","review":"I often used this as a reference in the intro to CJ course I taught a few years ago. Most students found the idea of physical punishment very disturbing. Therein lies its promise of success. All living organisms seem to seek to avoid electric shock. Electricity can be carefully monitored and meted. It is cheap and effective. Criminals might be blase and boastful about the time in prison or jail saying that they \\"could do it standing on their head,\\" but few would be bragging about the time they wet their pants and soiled their underwear when they were shocked for a mugging. Would they invite their friends to see it? Ten cents worth of electricity would do what $40,000 worth of incarceration would not."},{"Title":"Just and Painful: A Case for the Corporal Punishment of Criminals","review":"I read this book in law school. The author rejects the whipping post, and instead, recommends administering electric shock to criminals as punishment for crime. What good is that? Shocking someone months after the bad act is committed is not going to create any bad associations or cure any misbehavior."},{"Title":"Just and Painful: A Case for the Corporal Punishment of Criminals","review":"&quot;Pleasure is the absence of pain&quot; was how one philosopher phrased it, I don't remember who it was, as I was looking out the window at a jaybird when my boy, who has a PHD, was talking it up. Now, I don't know how much shocking or flogging or punching jailbirds will stop them doing their plainfaced bad deeds, but it sure will make a lot US out here feel GOOD. WE didn't get put in prison. Tailgating and backstabbing and firing people because you don't like them and all the mean stuff we enjoy doing out here ain't illegal, and we ain't got CAUGHT at the stuff that IS. YET. Put this corporate punishment on TV, where we can all watch it. Who knows if that fellow DID the stuff they say he did, or whether YOU did it and didn't get CAUGHT, but you can GUARANTEE that you'll FEEL GOOD because it's happening to SOMEONE ELSE.That is my two cents.Review by O. J. Haney."},{"Title":"The complete nonsense of Edward Lear","review":"I was given this book by my father when I was seven years old and was thoroughly enchanted by it, and remain so to this day. The Owl and the Pussy Cat has passed into children's lore - many people know the rhyme through the song (was it Burl Ives?) or through new illustrated versions of it. They know the limericks (or at least the form, if not the rather esoteric content - the old man with the Beard, for instance, and the lady with the excessively long chin whohad it made sharpand purchased a harpand played several tunes with her chin).But do they know of The Dong with the Luminous Nose, or the Pobble Who Has No Toes, or the short history of Violet, Slingsby, Guy, and Lionel? Or the illustrated botanical alphabet with such plants as the ManyPeeplia Upsidedownia (you'd have to see the drawing!) It would be impossible to say how many times I read, re-read, and enjoyed this book as a child and an adult, including the rather touching, affectionate introduction to the man himself.Please, please buy this book.
