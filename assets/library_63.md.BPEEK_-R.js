You don't HAVE to read them in order, but this is the first one, and sets up some of the parameters for future books (relationships between characters, mostly).One of my favorite things is that the author doesn't inundate you with details about how the future looks different than the present, she unfolds the details a few at a time with appropriate spacing. None of it feels like you are reading a long description of an unfamiliar world.The mystery in this book is good and left me guessing. Because there is some sex in the book, I wouldn't recommend it for anyone under 16 (just a general guideline, obviously).I recommend this series if you like mysteries, a strong female lead character, stories set in the future, or well written books."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I special ordered because a friend had recommended this in order to understand the whole series.

And happily so, darnnit. I had heard of this great love story between Eve & Roarke and have been piqued ever since, but a long series did NOT excite me and 30+ books is definitely a commitment! But a friend had the series to borrow so, I thought that was better. And halfway through reading I was looking for the books to the best of my frugal ability, because I Knew I was hooked! Eve is not a typical heroine; Her story is gut-wrenching but without pity as the woman can take care of herself just fine. Meeting a man like Roarke was definitely not in the agenda, and she has to cope with her steely rules as an officer against pure, raw passion. This first book in the series definitely set the tone for the ones that follow- not for the weak as the heroine is a top homicide detective. If there wasn't any romance, it'd be hard for me to swallow. But OH, there is so no worries there! I can't wait to go through the series to see how their relationship develops, as well as read the intriguing mysteries that Eve Dallas will have to solve along the way.

Let me just say that the reader is THE BEST reader I have ever heard on audio. Roarke's Irish voice is amazing and she brings life to all the characters.

From the very first page, this book held my interest and I could not put it down. It kept me up way past midnight and I enjoyed every second.The story is set in 2058 New York City. Guns are relics of the past and so it is a surprise when a high class prostitute and grand daughter of a senator is found shot to death by a .38. Det. Eve Dallas is assigned as lead investigator and soon the body count starts to rise. There are many suspects, and Eve takes a particular interest in Roarke, a tall, dark and handsome millionaire. As the mystery grows, so does their romance and Eve must battle with her desire for Roarke and her duty to solve the case.This was my first introduction to Nora Roberts (aka JD Robb) and now I'm asking myself what took me so long! The writing is superb and she's a master at mixing HOT, steamy romance with mystery and suspense. Eve is a tough, complex, vulnerable and respectable heroine, and I found her to be a layered and deep character, unlike some of the perfunctory, one-dimensional heroines in other novels. And I can already tell that there's more to Roarke as well. This is the first book in the series and if it is any indication of what's to come, I can't wait to read more. Great read!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Just got acquainted with JD Robb books and her great character, Eve Dallas. They are terrific! Then, had to get the first one.

He came off as a smug, smothering, creep. As the saying goes, money doesn't buy manners.Eve and her universe felt very real, making her a compassionate character. I'll probably check out other entries in this series, just to see what she's up to. Overall, this was a fairly enjoyable read. It was a bit slow in a few spots, but other than that, flowed well.

This is the first book where Eve meets Roarke.. GREAT !"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Naked in death starts out a really great series! Nora Roberts writes these under the name of JD ROBB. I did just start this series as I read everything I can get my hands on from Nora. If you are a new reader, you do need to start with this book and work your way through. I didn't start here first and she really builds the characters through each story that if you don't start from the beginning you miss a lot. I went back and am now starting from the beginning. This series is not Nora's romance format. Of course there is romance in there! This series is a mystery style. It takes place in NYC in the year 2058. When people do travel &quot; off planet&quot; and prostitution is legal. Your car drives you and you have &quot; auto chefs &quot; in house, car , even your office. The way ROBB writes about the future this is truly believable. Lt. Eve Dallas is a tough woman. She is strong, independent, and she truly fights and believes in her job as homicide detective. In this book she finds her main suspect a billionaire name Roarke. He is very charming, Irish, has lived a little on the edge, rich, and good-looking! Eve has now found her match. Roarke didn't have the ideal childhood either and they make the most wonderful couple. This is an excellent series, and keeps you entertained and you don't want to put the book down. Robb does a great job in making the who done it a total surprise! I highly recommend this entire series you will truly be delighted It is awesome!!!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"The \\"...in Death\\" series starts with Naked in Death a futuristic series set in New York City in the year 2058. The star of the series is Lt.

He's Irish, gorgeous, and very charming.This series is written by Nora Roberts under the name J.D. Robb. Don't confuse the romance novels usually written by Ms. Roberts with this series.

Eve and Roarke are the hottest couple in print today. I love the mystery but I love the romance even more. These two are so hot I'm surprised the book doesn't go up into flames in my hands. I have reread Naked In Death at least three times and it never gets old. The whole series is great but start with Naked and go in order because it's better that way. Roarke is the ideal lover. Rich, powerful, dangerous, sexy and totally in love with Eve Dallas. Now that is one lucky woman! Eve is a great heroine. She is smart, brave, independent and loyal. At the same time she has a past that makes her vulnerable, too. She is a real person not some flat character. I can not wait for Loyalty In Death to come out. The only bad thing is I finish them so fast. Keep writing about Eve and Roarke, Nora Roberts. Your fans will be forever grateful."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"\\"Naked In Death\\" is the first book in J. D. Robb's Eve Dallas mystery series. I have been hearing positive things about these books for a long time, and now, after reading this terrific novel, I understand why.New York City, 2058 CE, are the time and setting of \\"Naked in Death.\\" Robot drones and voice activated machines do menial work, i.e., clean house, serve meals; there is a total ban on guns, (the police use lasers); major improvements have been made in medicine and technology, with advancements in genetics (and strong genetic control); airbuses for public transportation have replaced subways; tele-links replace telephones - it's not a \\"brave new world,\\" yet...but there are definite pluses midway into the 21st century. Minor armed skirmishes have taken place between China and the US, and France had another revolution which lasted for a few years. The overpopulated world has more limited resources - real coffee is rare and way too expensive, as is beef and other fresh meat. Robb has not written a sci-fi series, however. Far enough into the future to make the storyline more interesting, 2058's world is still easily recognizable.Lieutenant Eve Dallas of the NYPSD is called to a murder scene where a young licensed companion, (a legalized prostitute ), has been brutally murdered with an antique handgun from the 20th century. The victim, Sharon DeBlass, is from a very prominent family - her grandfather is a US senator. An angry man who preaches morality and leads an ultra conservative branch of his party, the senator would like to totally suppress the case, and perhaps even run the investigation himself. According to friends and relatives, Ms. DeBlass apparently chose her career not only because she liked sex, she did not need the money, but because she was rebelling against her family and strict upbringing. A note was found under her body with the printed words, \\"ONE OF SIX.\\" So, was the perpetrator a serial killer warning that there were to be five more murders? One of the prime suspects is a sexy Irish billionaire named Roarke. We never learn whether this is his first or last name. Perhaps if one is a billionaire, especially a tall, dark and handsome, with an Irish brogue, billionaire, it doesn't matter. He is quickly cleared of suspicion, and he and Eve embark on a stormy, intense romance - but not before murder #2 occurs.Eve, although a tough cop who made Lieutenant before the age of 30, is also very vulnerable. She doesn't remember the early years of her life, but knows that she was sexually, physically and emotionally abused by her father, then abandoned at age eight and left to the mercies of Children's Services. She has made her work her life, and letting Roarke get close to her is a first.Happiness is discovering another excellent series - and from what I have read, this looks like a winner! The writing is tight, as is the plot - an excellent and complex mystery. I really like the characters, Eve, definitely, Roarke - who lives up to his description, Feeney, Eve's partner, and Eve's chanteuse friend Mavis. I can't wait to pick-up book two, \\"Glory In Death.\\"JANA"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I went through the novel fairly quickly, and as long as you're looking for a fairly quick and easy read, you'll be fine. The characters are entertaining enough, the author has a knack for visual descriptions and the plot's not bad. Most of the new technology in the book is pretty appropriate - it gives us a bit of a sci-fi feel without giving Eve too much of an edge over what any cop would have now. (eg. They have a ridiculously responsive voice-recognition system yet Eve's car is a wheezing wreck.)As for Roarke, the incredibly rich love interest, it felt as if the author was forcing his sex appeal at times. I found myself trying to find out Eve's powerful attraction to him, besides the physical. He forces himself into her life multiple times, going so far as to break into her appartment. His excuse *every* time is his concern over Eve, which gets a little thin after a while - as another reviewer mentioned, for someone as prickly as she's written she takes it fairly placidly. It's hard to beleive Eve wouldn't be fed up with it after a while. Roarke's just not as interesting as the author wants us to find him.But all in all, it's a decent book. The murder culprit didn't really surprise me but it was still fun reading up to the mystery's revelation. I'm going to try a few more books in the series just to see where it goes.If you're in an airport surrounded by Tom Clancy and Anne Rice and thinking they just aren't your thing, you could do a lot worse than Naked in Death."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Naked in Death is the first of several titles in this terrific series and I highly recommend you read the books in order. (If not, it can get confusing trying to understand progressive storylines and relationships.) Set in the not too distant future, the main character Eve Dallas is a tough NY city cop investigating the murder of a female licensed companion (prostitution is now legalized). Complicating her investigation, is her growing attraction to the prime murder suspect - the enigmatic, handsome billionaire Roarke.The book has something for everyone: murder mystery and action, romance and a healthy dose of comedy thrown in to keep things from getting too heavy. Robb's fleshing out of vivid and likeable secondary characters adds to the book's appeal. Makes for great beach reading and you'll want to continue the series to learn more about what happens next to Ms. Dallas and company."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"For the sake of variety, I needed something to read in between David Baldacci novels, and this promised mystery, suspense, action, and the like. Needless to say, it delivered none of this, but instead bore me to death for 160-some pages before I gave up, threw the book against the wall and went back to reading worthy authors.Let's go over the many problems here, starting with the main character, I think her name is Eve but honestly I don't remember. She's this by-the-book, uptight, unkempt cop who cares nothing for the standards or modern society or beauty, and yet somehow manages to be beautiful enough that EVERY male character introduced first tries to hit on her. This is so cliche and doesn't make any sense. Second, we have Roarke or whatever his name is. He's a multi-millionaire with everything he could ever want, and every women in the world wants him, yet somehow he finds Eve to be the one that he can't live without.The mystery is really just a sub-plot to a horrible romance novel, but even it isn't very good. Some guy decides it'd be fun to go off popping 6 hookers, which apparently is legal in the future, which brings me to my next point. This is supposed to be futuristic, and to compensate JD Robb invented some lame new stuff to make it seem so, like laser-guns and finger print supressing spray. However, it just so happens that our killer is an \\"old schooler\\" who uses guns instead of lasers, so in reality, it's not REALLY a futuristic mystery.Even so, the investigation doesn't take long to deteriorate into a bunch of faux romance and unneeded sex scenes. After the third one, literally back to back to back, followed by the cheesy dialogue \\"Stopping a police officer from leaving is a crime, I could arrest you,\\" and then \\"You weren't wearing you badge when it happened, or anything else for what matter.\\"Seriously??? Skip over this book, it's garbage. 2 stars for whatever the ending might have been."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"The book Naked In Death, by J.D. Robb is the first book of a futuristic series, taking place in New York City in the year 2058. Lt. Eve Dallas, a cop for 10 years, has dedicated all of her energy and most of her time toward bringing justice to those who are murdered and finding their ruthless killers. Eve has been put on a code five-murder investigation. One of the murder suspects is a suductive Irish billionaire, Roarke. Eve finds herself in a situation that she has never been in before. She has fallen in love. This causes a great deal of confusion and mixed feelings. Dallas is constantly jumping through hoops trying to get one step closer to cracking the case. She has to meet with the senator, interview suspects, go through testing, and deal with personal problems. Naked In Death is one of the best books that I have ever read. It fascinated me to learn that a female played the role of a very well respected homicide dective. The book is full of mystery and romance, which makes it a definite page-turner. It moves at a fast pace leaving no space for boredom. I strongly advise everyone who loves romance entwined in suspence to read this inviting novel."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I love this book so much! Ever since I discovered this series I have been rereading them over and over again. From Naked in Death to Loyalty in Death, I have enjoyed all 9 of these books (plus one short story), but Naked in Death is by far my favorite. Eve Dallas is such a strong, capable woman, and Roarke is sexy, rich, and so sweet. This murder-mystery/romance is steamy, surprising, and a keeper."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"The &quot;..in Death&quot; series was one of the best series I've ever read. Kudos to Nora Roberts, aka J.D. Robb. The first book in this series &quot;Naked in Death&quot; is about a serial killer who had offed three prostitutes with no apparent connections, except for a drop-dead gorgeous billionare named Roarke. When Eve Dallas (the female protagonist of the story) went to investigate this connection she finds herself in a situation she has never faced before and is terrified of, she finds herself falling in love. What I most enjoyed about this book was the fact that it portrayed relationships soo acurately. It was filled with fear of being overly-dependant on each other, and many other emotions that other authors just never get to. It's always the protagonist meeting his/her &quot;soulmate&quot; and fighting evil together. Not with Eve Dallas and Roarke, these were two very down to earth characters, thats what kept me reading. I plan to read all nine books in the series, you should too. I promise, this series will not disappoint."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"It doesn't matter how many times I've read it (going on half a dozen or more now), I just can't put it down! Every time a new one comes out, it seems to feed that Eve/Roarke fix for a little while but it's comforting to know I can always go back to the beginning to re-live how it it all started."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"The futuristic setting of J.D. Robb's (Nora Roberts') \\"In Death\\" books kept me from starting this series, despite being an avid Roberts reader for years (lots of years). I've never been a fan of novels set in the future. As it turns out, I was remarkably short-sighted.With the proven ability to write taut romantic thrillers, Roberts (Robb) adds an intriguing layer to her storytelling and peppers this solid police procedural with glimpses of the advancements in society and technology in the year Eve Dallas and Roarke live in (2053)...and even more intriguing, the things that haven't changed - most importantly, human nature in all its horror and glory. It's a strong book with very interesting characters, and while you find out more about Eve than you do about Roarke, who remains a bit of an enigma at this point, there's a solid start to an enticing, heartwarming relationship.All in all, I'm glad I finally got around to starting the much touted In Death series and while the futuristic aspects will never be my favorite thing, I truly enjoyed the start of the series and am looking forward to more. 4.5 Stars."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"For years I have avoided this series like it was the plague. I am not a Nora Roberts fan. I've never really found anything enjoyable about her books and feared that these books would leave me feeling the same way. However, when I became involved with an online bookclub, everyone was raving about this series so I figured to take the chance and ordered Naked in Death. I am so glad that I did. I absolutely adored this book and have already gotten the next three in the series. I cannot believe I waited so long to try this series.Naked in Death tells the story of Lieutenant Eve Dallas in the year 2058 (something that was at first a little difficult to get used to). Eve is investigating a high profile murder of the granddaughter of a US Senator. The book is full of a number of twists and turns that will leave you guessing until the very end. However, one of the best parts of the book is the introduction of Roarke. He is so strong and sexy. He'd definitely be one of those book characters I'd like to meet in real life (I'm sure hubby would love to hear that...lol)."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Call me bi-curious. No, not in that way. I'm talking in the way of romance books.I'm a red-blooded American male. I write mysteries, I read mysteries, SF, thrillers, history, food tomes, almost everything but romance books. Up until now, I've always thought of romance books as trite throwaways that contain a couple of good sex scenes. Read those and forget about the rest of the book.But something happened about a month ago: I actually noticed, really, for the first time, how many romance books there actually are in a bookstore. Hundreds. Thousands? And, for the first time, my countenance faltered. I realized that I might actually be up to read a romance. But which one? I asked a fellow writer who she liked and, among the names was Nora Roberts. I know Nora Roberts just like people who don't read horror stories knows Stephen King. I went the local library, picked up a few Nora Roberts books, but none of them really caught my attention.Then I remembered J.D. Robb. I knew that Roberts wrote stories as Robb so I checked them out. And I found my beachhead in the field of romance books. Lead character is a police detective. I'm writing a book about a female lead detective. Stories take place in 2059. Hmm, that sounds like SF. I like SF. The books are characterized as romantic suspense. I like suspense. My first novel was a suspense novel. And I'm a romantic. What's not to like? I verified which book was the first in the series, Naked in Death, checked out the audiobook from the library, and inserted the CD.The first disc was not even halfway through before I was hooked. And not just mild interest but hook, line, and sinker. I was all in. The book has a nice pace, not slow at all. Since the book was written in 1995, it is interesting to note some of the futuristic discrepancies but just as cool to note the stuff Roberts got right. Eve Dallas, the lead character, carries around a device that will surely be what the iPhone is going to be: the all-in-one gadget that basically does everything. I also appreciated the more mundane aspects of 2059 NYC: cars that don't fly. Sure, I want my flying car. Who doesn't? But we're probably not going to get there in 50 years.Back to the story: Eve Dallas must investigate the murders of a licensed companion, a prostitute, who just happens to be the granddaughter of a prominent US Senator. It was pretty interesting to read this book, with legalized prostitution, during the week NY governor Eliot Spitzer resigned for being with one. Roberts really let us readers get into Eve's head and thoughts. I found myself being mad when she was and happy when she was. I'll admit the POV shifts that frequent this book is not the style in which I write. It was annoying at first but then I got used to it.The story was great. But what about the romance? This was a romance book after all. Rourke, the all-everything Irish guy who starts as a suspect and becomes Eve's lover, is the kind of guy, I'll admit, seems to inhabit romance books. Now, I'm saying this purely from a stereotypical standpoint. But, hey, the first romance book I read has one of \\"those\\" guys in it. How's a regular guy supposed to compete with that? Anyway, the romantic aspects of the novel seemed even, believable. Even the sex scene--there's one main one, with intimate details--was good and hot. I give a hat tip to Ms. Roberts in the many ways to describe sexual intercourse without using actual physical words.The final testament to reading Naked in Death is this: I have already checked out the second book, Glory in Death, on audio. I can't wait to start.(taken from [..])"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"After 20+ books over 10+ years, I decided it was high time to go back to where it all began -- NAKED IN DEATH.Here, author J.D. Robb (aka best-selling author Nora Roberts) introduces us to NYPSD Lieutenant Eve Dallas, a force in her own right, and one of the trickiest cases yet. The granddaughter of a Senator has been brutally murdered, and the perpetrator promises that five more bodies are to follow. As Eve races against the clock to save more women from dying, she also must contend with her own feelings for Roarke, a self-made billionaire who early on is a suspect in the murders.If you haven't read any of the \\"...IN DEATH\\" books, I highly recommend them to anyone who enjoys romantic suspense. The mystery and the romance are evenly balanced, Eve and Roarke are definitely intriguing characters, and the story just never gets old.Going back to this first story in the series after having been a fan so long, I was grateful to be reminded of the meaning behind the gray button, how Galahad came into the picture, and how Somerset's attitude has been the same from the beginning.NAKED IN DEATH is a winner, and you'll be happy to know that when you finish reading it, there are 24 more stories already published in the series. Happy Reading!!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I have read several of the books in the \\"In Death\\" series, specifically the later installments and for a while, have intended to read the beginning to see how the series evolved. \\"Naked in Death\\" was a wonderful building block for a series that I have grown to love. This books starts the evolution of the passionate relationship between Eve and Roarke. We see their acceptance of each other and their desire to find in each other something that they desire. They are willing to risk their hearts for love.We are introduced to other characters that appear frequently in later installments, but who I had no idea of how they joined the cast of a well developed series. It also explains that when we first meet Eve, she has hidden her secret in her subconscious and has no idea the impact that it would have on her future. We meet Mavis (Eve's best friend who is not yet the hip \\"Vid\\" star yet, but whose career is on the rise); Dr. Mira, who is pushing Eve to remember a past that she has chosen not to remember; Charles Monroe, a licensed companion (i.e., high class prostitute) who is later the love of Louise's life (Louise being one of her dearest friends). Sideline...I never would have known that Charles hit on Eve first, in a million years, called her Lieutenant \\"Sugar Pants\\" and even offered to give her a \\"freebie\\". [For those who follow the series, you will find that extremely surprising.] And finally, we meet the ever present Feenie, Eve's mentor and father figure (He even treats Roarke like a father who is dating his daughter. It is cute and they eventually come to an understanding). We see Summerset and how his relationship with Eve evolved, and find out how she comes into possession of Galahad, the peculiar cat, that is throughout every novel in the series. And most of all, we see Eve evolve into the woman that she becomes in \\"Innocent in Death\\".I guess I should mention the whole murder angle in the story. Eve is out to determine who is killing licensed LCs with antiquated weapons. The first victim is the granddaughter of a well connected Senator. On top of that, the man that Eve finds irresistable is a suspect. However, following her heart and believing in someone for the first time, is not easy. Unprepared for love, Eve navigates unchartered waters.I do intend to read a few of the others because I know that Peabody and McNab have to make their appearances in the next book or two because I see her in Immitation in Death.

I have alrady listened to or read all of this series that has been published but am purchasing them on CD now so I can listen to them again. You will love the characters that are in all of these books. Eve Dallas is a police office who is very dedicated to her job, her love interest is Roarke, a multi-millionare you will fall in love with; then there is Peabody, her assistant who wants to be a detective, and Summerset, Roarke's butler. This issue covers murders due to illegal substances.

Highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"In order to fully understand the series, you must start at the beginning. Learn how Eve and Roarke meet, and how he wins his reluctant cop. She does not make it easy for him and he is not used to having to pursue, (although he is very good at it.) Eve must trust her judgement and puts her carreer on the line to find a murderer, while tring to clear Roarke who has been set up. This book introduces us to several charactors that we will see later in the series.

I read every book in the In Death series and could not put them down. I was happy to find this series after all these years so I didn't have to wait for the next one to become available.

The character of Eve Dallas is becoming one of my heros, as she is not only strong, but quick witted and a force of her own.

Eve Dallas, reminiscent of the hard-boiled detectives of fiction in the fifties, exhibits the bravery and assertiveness we all would like to possess to blow back on the slackers and con artists who clutter our paths, bulldoze through obstacles that keep us from doing our jobs, and grab onto the promise of a deep emotional relationship even when logic says it's a bad bet. In this first installment, readers get to watch the crass, callus, self-sufficient cop struggle with surfacing memories of a terrifying childhood while navigating the political minefield of a sensitive case as it shockingly unfolds. And we get to see the beginning of her relationship with Roarke, a capricious and mystifying foil for her by-the-book stubbornness. An immensely enjoyable book - sit back, relax and enjoy this one!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Recommended by a book reader on another site, Interesting story line and plot, set in the future with all the electronic gizmos and gadgets. Keeps you turning the page, trying to figure out who Roarke is. Tidbits of Eve Dallas coming out slowly, parts of the story slowing down to a crawl then picking up again. I wanted to read the last three pages half way through the story but didn't. Enjoyable and worth the time to read it... love Eve Dallas attitude.. not impressed with the wealthy folks she has to come into contact with. Loved her excitement over a real cup of coffee. As for Roarke... secrets to be uncovered."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"No.#1 Naked IDEve Dallas is a New York police lieutenant hunting for a ruthless killer.

But passion and seduction have rules of their own, and it's up to Eve to take a chance in the arms of a man she knows nothing about - except the addictive hunger of needing his touch.Well I Started Reading \\"Big Jack\\" then \\"Fantasy in death\\" then book 11 to 17 then I ordered 1 thur 7 I love Relationship Between Eve & Roarke and wanted to See How they met and Got Together And I WASN'T Disappointed....Not at All!!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I have most of the recent In Death books but am having a hard time finding the older ones.

I knew what to expect because I have read all of the latest books by J D Robb."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I purchased this book for my sister to encourage her to start reading the series if she likes the material. I am hoping she does because Robb's [Roberts'] Eve Dallas and her husband, manservant, earnest and capable detective understudy and her geek cop sleek manboy, whacky songstress and straight fashion designer, dynomite/weird cosmotolgist, her police mentor, her serene police profiler/psychiatrist friend, her erstwhile newscaster, and her cat have all come together for my entertainment and appreciation. And Eve, from a troubled and horrific past, is one hell of a crime fighter, a good cop with attitude. And like Temperance in the TV series \\"Bones\\", she is befuddled and dazed by her being loved by friends she had never had before and thought she would ever have [or need].The love between her and Roarke is charming and fun, touching as they support one another through recall of their wretched, nightmare childhoods amid present day crime. Its progress is interesting, poignant, and laugh-provoking enjoyment. Murder is the subject of each new book, but the interaction, growth, strength, care, loving, pride, honor, humor, skills and interaction between characters which is written with wit, charm and smooth humor is the reason to come back for more.If you like TV's Beckett in \\"Castle\\" you are going to love Dallas even more.In short, it is one of those sets of books in series that keeps you wanting to come back for more and sincerely appreciate Ms. Robb's [Roberts'] ability to recreate events in the future New York [and enjoyment here in the future Maine].Do this thing, you will not regret it."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I am and have been a huge Nora Roberts fan for many years. Despite this, I have never read any of her J. D. Robb books because I was not into science fiction as I imagined futuristic books would be. I was finally convinced to try her after reading \\"Hot Rocks\\" and the J.D. Robb sequell, \\"Big Jack\\". I enjoyed \\"Big Jack\\" so much that I looked around for the other J. D.

I love this series and frankly, I like the in Death series better than the Nora Roberts romance books. This series has romance, a great female lead, a great male lead, and some of the best mystery writing I have yet to enjoy. To top it off, since I have waited so long, there are plenty of books in the series to keep me busy for a long time . . . I am addicted to these books and cannot wait to start the next one."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"As a lover of contemporary romantic suspense novels, I had to give \\"Naked in Death\\" a try. Of course, I've heard of Roarke and I was anxious to meet him as well. =)That being said, I just wasn't as engrossed in this book as I thought I would be. Roarke had very little stage time, and I was really hoping to get into his head more. The writer goes \\"into his head\\" very little, and the developing relationship between the hero and heroine just wasn't very believable.Roarke is, of course, written to be The Perfect Romantic Hero. He's obscenely gorgeous, clever, sexy, strong, indescribably wealthy, very masculine and alpha, old-fashioned, gentlemanly, extremely intelligent, sensitive, gentle, sensual... hmmm..... He was just too good to be true. He doesn't have a fault, not even one. And I was having a hard time seeing him as a believable character.Eve Dallas is ok as a heroine. She's a little too tough and cold to impress me. I've never been into female heroines who are too masculine and Eve just crosses that line for me. Descriptions of her messy haircuts and crass manners were just a turn off to me. And the idea that Roarke fell for her the way he did, for no real reason, is just strange.It's obvious why Eve is into him (what woman wouldn't be?) simply because he's The Perfect Romantic Hero but I never clearly saw why he was into her.The suspense part of the novel was just ok too. The mystery wasn't too hard to figure out.I actually liked the futuristic time setting, but it alone wasn't enough to tempt me into another novel. I might revisit the series one day, but I'm sated for now. I got to meet Roarke and he was everything the ladies says he was- a drool-worthy macho sexy perfect man... but I need more than a two dimensional character to draw me in. I just didn't get attached to Eve and Roarke the way I wanted to."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I've never been to big on mysteries.

I also enjoyed the occasional shifts in perspective. Unfortunately, I don't see much of that newer books (and maybe why I seem to have a preference for older ones). The author handled the shifts in perspective beautifully; I never had any doubt whose perspective I was getting and the insight made me feel like an insider. It wasn't overused, either, just slipped in here and there where it was helpful.Eve was a great heroine, tough enough and vulnerable enough, just like her love interest. The violence was a little graphic for me, but certainly within the expected bounds of the police procedural genre. I'll definitely be picking up the next one in the series."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"What an amazing series of books.

Eve Dallas is a strong main character, yet doesn't overpower the rest of the gang. Roarke is so mysterious that I am anxious to see what he's up to next. I am glad that Eve finally warmed up to him rather than dragging out that story line like a washed out soap-opera. They make a great team.Good story line, fast paced, and fun to read. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys murder-mysteries."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I love all of Nora Roberts books and was curious about this type of book for her, writing as JD Robb. Needless to say she doesn't let you down. I've read the entire series so far and have enjoyed each book. I'm now collecting the audioooks and listen to them at work or where ever.

Juggleing her personal and work life Eve is involved with a heavy and complex murder mystery while trying to push away the love of her life, Roarke. I also read Betrayal of Death which was another great book by Roberts."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"The mystery genre is no stranger to continuing series. As always, it is always best to start with Book 1. &quot;Naked in Death&quot; marks the debut of the NYPD detective Eve Dallas. J.D. Robb (though the book covers now proudly proclaim that best-selling author Nora Roberts is the name behind the pseudonym) takes readers into the near, but quite different, future. There is a ban on handguns, prostitution is legal, and (perhaps most disturbingly) coffee is very hard to come by. But no need to worry in 2058, there is still plenty of mayhem and murder. The &quot;In Death&quot; series is billed as &quot;romantic/suspense&quot; and soon our hard-nosed heroine finds herself tracking down a serial killer and, less successfully so, fending off a lady killer - and one of the primary suspects - the charmingly confident billionaire, Roarke.For those readers (myself included) who might be put off that this is written by a romance author, there is no real need to worry. While there is some steaminess in the bedroom, it takes a secondary role to the mystery/suspense part. However, one minor issue I had (and perhaps this is a holdover from the romance genre) was Eve Dallas's duality - she is a tough, competent, hard boiled cop but all too often seems to be saved (and easily seduced) by Roarke. It would have been nice if this otherwise independent woman was not so prone to having the &quot;white knight&quot; ride to the rescue time and time again.Nevertheless, &quot;Naked in Death&quot; satisfied my need for a quick and entertaining read. I plan on continuing onto the next novel, &quot;Glory In Death.&quot; Just a warning for those new to &quot;In Death&quot; series, avoid reading the critical blurbs at the front of this book as they contain some plot &quot;spoilers&quot; for novels later in the series."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Really good mystery story. Easy to read sicence fiction written by Nora Roberts under the name of J D Robb. I reccomend it to all Nora Roberts fans as well as all mystery fans."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I have read every one of J.D.Robb's mystery series with Lt. Eve Dallas &amp; her gorgeous Irish rogue husband, Roarke. I loved every one of them and am looking forward to the latest installment in this terrific series. If you are looking for mystery, excitement and some steamy love scenes, this is a great series to read! I could not put any of these books down! Even though I've never read any of Nora Roberts other books, I would highly recommend you read these books. Mystery fans will love her futuristic view of New York. Enjoy them all!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I must say that I love all of the books in this series. I started with the latest one, Judgement in Death, and then went back to the first one. There is a basic outline that is similar (if not the same) in each book in this series, but there are twists and turns in each book that leave you wondering who the real killer actually is. Also, along with the mystery there is a little romance thrown in. From start to finish of each book, characters are developed and you get more insight into how each one thinks as well as how other characters view each other. Each book in the series in a good read and each one had me captivated wanting to read and read all day because I didn't want to put the book down. So, if you like mystery, romance, and kind of miss your favorite characters when there's only one book to read about them, this is a good series for you."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"1st. of what I hope will be a long lived series!

Eve must fight her way through to find a killer, deal with growing attraction to said rogue. It's so fun watching them deal with this &quot;Grand Passion&quot; neither expects nor wants. Nice and Spicy, Great mystery, real page tuner. This book has made me go and look for Nora Roberts books, she makes romance interesting, and never more so than here."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I really enjoyed this book. When I bought the first one, I also bought #'s 2,3, and 8 from the used book store I deal with. I was told at that time that all of that series is very good. After reading # 1, I immediately called and told them to save 4,5,6 and 7 for me. I had NO doubts that I would enjoy ALL OF THEM. The only quirp I had with this one is that every house Eve went into was spotless (NOTHING out of order).Be sure to read this book. It is excellent."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Nora Roberts has done it again, weaving a fantastic story, with endearing characters.This is one of two series that I consistently re-read because there will never be another series quite like this one.Roberts creates a world 50 years in the future. One futuristic enough for those who like to travel forward, but still grounded in the \\"real\\" world. Roberts is a word painter, her words create a such incredible characters and descriptions that while reading I am I feel like I am standing in New York with airbusses flying overhead.Each book in this series delves deeper and deeper into the lives of the characters, where when a reader like me picks up a new book, I feel like I am catching up with old friends, not just reading a story. Their lives and how they love is a beautiful story and I'm sorry for the reviewer who said that Eve was weak, because Eve is one of the strongest characters I've read in a long time, and just because she leans on the man in her life doesn't make her weak, in my opinion that makes her stronger. Knowing that she can't handle everything on her own. It takes a stronger person to admit that than it does to try and do it all on your own, and I praise Roberts for enough foresight to know her characters before even beginning writing a book. This will always be a #1 recommendation for me. I've gotten 3 friends addicted to this series, because as I said at the beginning there will never be another."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Naked in Death is such a good book!

I give J.D Robb a heartfelt thank you for writing the books in this series."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Nakes in Death is gutsy, tough, gritty and brilliant. Seldom is the mixture of suspense and romance as wonderfully done as in this book. We also get to see the &quot;toys&quot; we might use in sixty years. I bought this and devoured it in one day. Eve and Roarke are engaging characters, and thankfully, there are just more and more books about them."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"This is the 1st book in a long running series. You will be hooked!In this book we meet Lt. Eve Dallas of the New York Police and Security Department. The year is 2058. I am a huge Nora Roberts fan and I have to admit I put off reading this book for a long time because the futuristic theme frightened me off. I am not a fan of futuristic or Sci-Fi. I have to say I was more than pleasantly surprised with this story. Lt. Dallas is trying to find a serial killer when the name Roarke keeps coming up in her investigation. Roarke is a handsome multi billionaire from Ireland with what appears to be virtually no past. While all the clues keep leading back to him something just doesn't fit. Eve's gut says he is not the killer.This is a fast past suspense book with a red hot romance. You will not want to put it down and you will want to read more about all the characters created in this book."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Eve Dallas was a New York police lieutenant who was very good at her job - sometimes too good. She never told anyone how she had nightmares about all of the victims that she was too late to save and she refused to open up to the psychiatrists at the office. Her last case, where a father hacked up his young daughter into little pieces, continued to haunt her, but, before she had a chance to go in for testing, she was called to work on a priority case with political ramifications. Turns out an expensive, high-class prostitute was murdered, shot three times with an old gun. The catch was that the prostitute was the granddaughter of a US senator who wanted the killer caught and the case filed away so that he could concentrate on his political agenda. Lucky for the victim, Eve doesn't give into political pressure...Eve starts will the prostitute's clients, of which there are many, and find herself questioning Roarke, a mysterious Irish billionaire who had dinner with the victim the night before she died. Its true that Eve feels an instant physical attraction to Roarke, but she refuses to act on it - she is a professional and she doesn't get involved with suspects. Pushing her gut instincts about Roarke aside, Eve tries to be objective in her investigation, but the evidence keeps piling up against Roarke. When two more prostitutes are killed in rapid succession, Eve is under pressure to bring the killer in. With her career on the line, political pressure from the senator and her superiors, Eve cannot afford to get involved with someone like Roarke. But how can she ignore the man who makes her feel for the first time in years...?Naked in Death is the first in J.D. Robb/Nora Robert's new In Death series starring Eve Dallas as a police detective. The mystery was made fresh and new by the author's futuristic setting, where prostitution is legalized and pleasure workers are licensed professionals, guns are obsolete and food is reproduced in a machine, but still familiar and bearing many of the traits that we see in our world today. I was entertained by the author's attention to detail, such as Eve's problems with her car's heater and addiction to real coffee (which is hideously expensive). I also really liked the characters - Eve was really tough, but she had lots of weaknesses to keep her human and likeable. I am interested in learning more about her past and seeing where her relationship goes with Roarke. Roarke was also a great character with a mysterious past, which I assume will be illuminated throughout the series. He is rich, knows exactly what he wants and isn't afraid to go out and get it, but he is still insecure. The mystery was also well written and thought out with plenty of little subplots and red herrings thrown in to keep the reader guessing, however, if you are paying close attention, there are enough clues for you to figure out who killed the women. Well written, detailed with a solid plot and well-drawn characters, Naked in Death is definitely worth your time to read!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"This book, the first in J. D. Robb's &quot;In Death&quot; series, is a futuristic mystery set in New York and featuring police lieutenant Eve Dallas. &quot;Naked in Death&quot; grabbed my attention from the first page and didn't let go until the last. This series is addictive.Our detective, Eve, is tough, focused, and just too cool for words. She's a fascinating character; she has some real human weaknesses and vulnerabilities, but she also has an awesome amount of will and determination. She made the book for me.This book is action-packed and inventive -- and sexy! The main suspect/love interest, Roarke, is a wonderful foil to Eve, with his sensuality, charm, and equally strong will; he's also very, very hot. The sexual tension between these two just sizzles off the page.My only gripe about the writing: I didn't like the way the author keeps switching pov's in the same scene. One minute we're seeing through the eyes of one character, a few sentences later through another. I found it slightly disorienting.But that's a minor complaint. It certainly didn't stop me from reading -- and loving -- the entire series!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I heard so much about the In Death series by J.D Robb, so i figured I should read the first to see what it is all about. I have to say...the whole future thing really threw me off. I like Eve as a character, her backround was so sad, and the book was slightly disturbing but all in all I liked it.Roarke is a very sexy hero, or suspect...however you want to say, as he is one of the main suspects in the murder investigation. I liked the slow building relationship between Eve and Roarke, I might even read the next one just to see where it might go."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Hate that I'm 16 years late finally jumping on the band wagon, but I'm on board nonetheless :)This was a wonderful roller coaster ride of mystery, sensuality, and insight.Loved it.On to the next one....(followers of this series are also on indeath.net)"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Saturated with sexual child abuse and somewhat graphic crime scenes, this story was hard to take at times but was still well-written and contained enjoyable characters. The villain was obvious early on and the Jetsons-like setting took a while to get used to. Audible narrator was quite good. All-in-all, don't know if I would want to experience it again."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"What can I say about NAKED IN DEATH that hasn't been said already? Well obviously I don't need to go into the plot because that's been done to DEATH (ha) I will say though that because so many people recommended this book to me and because my friend eventually gave me a copy I did feel somewhat obligated to read it. Robb's Death series is 30 books long (and counting) which is somewhat daunting when starting a new series, so a part of me really didn't want to get hooked on this and for the first hundred pages or so I can honestly say that I didn't.But then something happened, or I should say someone happened. Someone in the form of a charming, mysterious and utterly addictive Irish billionaire and murder suspect named Roarke. Yes, damn his sweet button carrying self but my new literary boyfriend saved this book because quite frankly detective Eve Dallas on her own isn't very likable and I'm also not really a fan of the police procedurals. It's the sweetness, romance, patience and delicious mystery of Roarke that will keep me coming back.I also had a hard time understanding why Robb chose to set this in the future (sort of) I say sort of because she never went all the way with her future aspect. Sure she mentions in passing a few cool gadgets (an autochef would really come in handy) and theres flying cars, robot servants, off world business meetings and plenty of clever new cop toys but except for the legalized prostitution and gun prohibition it's still the New York we know of today. I just feel that if Robb was going to go for the whole future angle then she should have gone all the way or just not bothered because her BladeRunneresque vision was gimmicky and rather pointless to the story. But that's just my opinion.Of course theres a lot to like here too; obviously Robb's (Nora Roberts) writing is top notch and she spins a well planned, easy to read, dark mystery here. Her characters have also been completely fleshed out, in particular Eve. Who although crass, hands off and by the book has enough flaws and skeletons in the closet that you can't help but sympathize with her and hope she loosens up a bit and lets a certain someone in. Which brings me back to Roarke. Maybe this quote describes him best, Cheers!\\"You got a button fetish Roarke?\\"\\"I've been carrying this around like a schoolboy carries a lock of his sweetheart's hair.\\" Her eyes came back to his, and something sweet moved through her. Sweeter yet as she could see he was embarrassed.\\"That's weird.\\"\\"I thought so, myself.\\" But he slipped the button back in his pocket.\\"Do you know what else I think, Eve?\\"\\"I don't have a clue.\\"\\"I think I'm in love with you.\\"*Sigh* Yeah so I'm starting book 2 GLORY IN DEATH as we speak"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I enjoyed this book from start to finish. Robb/Roberts offers great characters, a credible vision of the future and law enforcement, a tightly woven mystery--and a murderer I didn't suspect. You can't ask for more than that in a good novel. I'm very glad there are many more books in this series."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I'm making my way through the In Death series by J.D. Robb (aka Nora Roberts) and figured I should start writing reviews for each one as I finish. I want to start off saying it's so refreshing to see a series with a strong feminine lead. I've been a loyal fan to the Janet Evanovich Stephanie Plum series, and after being disappointed over and over by the stories and characters I knew I needed a new, strong series with a kick a** female. Eve Dallas is that female. She's a NYPD cop in the year 2058. While I'm not usually into sci-fi/futuristic novels, I found this totally believable and fascinating. She's independent, smart, and has very little tolerance for B.S. While working a murder case, she meets Roarke, the male lead. He's smart, rich, sexy, a little dangerous, and had an Irish accent (basically the perfect man). Their romance is incredible. I'm currently reading Rapture in Death (4th book in the series), and love how the characters are developing, and growing together (which is something sadly lacking from Evanovich's Plum series). Naked In Death is thrilling, sexy, and exciting. It touches on mature topics, so I'd keep this from the younger age groups, but is a great read."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I resisted reading this series because it's futuristic. That genre simply never appealed to me. However, people kept talking about the awesome J.D. Robb so I caved. It was suggested to me that I read this series in order, so I have. I've read Naked in Death three times now.The characters are interesting--conflicted and compelling. Eve and Roarke are well thought out and draw a reader into their world. A world that's not so different from our present existence. Kudos to Ms. Robb for creating an interesting environment that's fascinating but still believable. The crime is hideous and seems impossible to solve, even though the suspect list is short.Naked in Death is a good, solid read. As this series progresses, however, the characters deepen and many more noteworthy and loveable characters emerge.If you haven't read the 'in Death' series, you're denying yourself hours of entertainment and enjoyment. Take the advice I was given, though, and read them in order.Shelley Dawn, author ofSweet, Sweet JessieandDark Nights"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Review courtesy of Sizzling Hot BooksI was feeling slightly down the other day, and I needed a book to pick me up.

I love the relationship between Roarke and Eve.Before this series I was not a fan of futuristic novels, but J.D. Robb does a wonderful job creating a believable future world with a romantic twist.

Eve Dallas is tough as nails, but Roarke is her soft spot. The relationship is steamy, which the perfect match to her steel personality. Before meeting Roarke, Eve was by the book and wouldn't risk her job for anyone. She believed that if she wasn't a cop then she was nothing. In Naked in Death Eve risks her badge when it comes to Roarke, she knows he is innocent and has to prove it.Multi-billionaire Roarke is tasty. He is a top specimen of a man, that will have you panting. I loved how Roarke was with Eve. Before they met each other they both thought their lives were complete. Eve didn't believe cops should marry, and Roarke had relationships with women but never let one as close as Eve.Both to Eve's dismay and delight the murder investigation throws her and Roarke together almost daily. As Eve eliminates him as a suspect, she is drawn to Roarke, and their relationship really starts to heat up. The murderer is somewhat surprising and the first time I read it I didn't catch on until close to the end.No matter how many times I read Naked in Death , I am always rapped up in the story. Naked in Death is an instantly likable, full of action novel that has enough for both mystery and romance lovers. Naked in Death will keep you guessing right until the very end."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Just love all of JD Robb/Nora Roberts in death series. I highly recommend to all readers. Once I started reading Naked in Death, which is the first in death series, I cannot stop. Had to purchase all 30+ books including mini series/short stories related to in death series. You will not get tired of reading books. I started reading series when I got my Kindle in April and I have read every single series at least 4 times. Just can't get enough of Eve and Rourke and don't get tired or re-reading.JD Robb is very good. Series has all, romance, mystery and comedy. Just hope that JD Robb will consider giving Eve and Rourke child/ren of thier own. Make character deal with issues working parents deal with nowadays. I can just imagine how funny series with be with trying to deal with a child. As it is now, whenever Rourke mentions children, Eve panics."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"It took me years to begin reading this series after being asked to do so by others. I couldn't have been more surprised!!! Couldn't put the book down and promptly ordered the rest in ebook format. It was so addictive that I finished the series in two months. However, I keep coming back to the first. This is a sexy, mysterious and interesting read. You cannot help but love the main characters, Lt. Eve Dallas and Roarke. You'll also appreciate the secondary characters that are added throughout the series. Love this series and it was well worth the wait."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Nora Roberts writing as J.D Robb? I've always been curious considering I'm a huge fan of her romance novels...and let me say YES, YES, YES! I was a little hesitant considering I do like a little \\"love\\" in my books; I didn't want to read just an ordinary mystery...blah, blah, blah, and I wasn't let down. \\"Naked in Death\\" is smokin' hot! Nora always takes you to where she wants you to be. Whether it's to the middle of the ocean, or in this case to the year 2058. Everything feels so real and different yet so very believable...almost as if she's lived in that time.There's no lack in characters either. Lieutenant Eve Dallas is a spicy, cold and brilliant detective that must find the seriel killer that's knocking off prostitutes (LoL! No pun intended...well okay, just a little), and Roarke is a multi-billionaire busineess man that's on the short list of suspects....Sparks literally fly off the pages the instant these two meet...and with all of Nora's known for moments you aren't let down.If you're like me and are a little hesitant on starting this 38 *still choking* book series, let me just say...if every book is anything like this first one then these books are worth their weight in gold."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"This, the first book of the futuristic \\"In Death\\" series, finds Eve Dallas trying to track down a possible serial killer that targets prostitutes. In her search for the killer, Eve meets the intriguing, sexy, rich Roarke, who also happens to be a suspect. Roarke stirs feelings in Eve that she didn't even realize was possible. Will Eve be able to act on her feelings without compromising her case?Oh no. I think I've found a new \\"guilty pleasure\\" series. This book roped me in right away and didn't let go until I finished. Even though I felt the story was rather predictable, I couldn't stop reading. I was worried going in that the futuristic setting would make the book too sci-fi for me to enjoy, but it didn't. I actually found that aspect of the book to be rather interesting. I've read other books by Nora Roberts in the past, but I think this one is her best of all the ones I've read. I'm looking forward to the second installment in the series."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Nora Roberts (writing as J.D. Robb) never fails to amaze & deliver. These are captivating and exciting romance/mystery/suspense stories. However, the best part of these books is the relationship between Eve and Roarke. They are a dynamic, passionate and sensational couple. I've gone through half of the series after being introduced to them last year and can't wait to finish the rest of them."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I can't remember who recommended this series to me, but I'm thankful they did. This is different from what I'm used to - a series that follows the same two characters forever just didn't sound that exciting to me. But throw in a perpetually hot romance, a strong relationship in spite of (and because of) obstacles, a cast of wonderfully quirky secondary characters, and how can a girl resist? It was absolutely worth my time to get to know these characters (they've become my friends!), and to keep visiting them with each book in the series (working my way through it). A word of advice to newcomers - start the series with this one (Naked in Death). If you jump in the middle of the series, you very likely won't enjoy it and will wonder what all the hype is. Just start at the beginning, and get carried away like the rest of us. :) Oh, and the audiobooks are great, too! The same reader is used throughout (so far)."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Having read about a half dozen Roberts books of very mixed quality, this is definately my favorite so far. It starts out with the murder of a prostitute, who also happens to be the granddaughter of a conservative senator. The killer has left a note, \\"One of Six\\", suggesting a serial killer. Eve Dallas is on the case, and more bodies pop up. While investigating the case, Dallas falls in love with a mysterious businessman known only as Roarke.This time, Roberts doesn't waste any time on irrelevant subplots. The story starts from page one and keeps its pace throughout. The romance does not feel gratuitous as in some romantic suspense novels; it's well connected to the main plot. \\"Naked in Death\\" is a quick, entertaining read for romance and (non-romance) mystery readers alike."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"30+ dollars for a set of CD's that my wife would have to swap and keep track of......no way.This title was on ONE (1) MP3 Cd, and was easily copied (no copy protection) to my wife's MP3 player and she was listeing to the entire book at night as she worked.

Great summer read."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"It all starts right here with Eve, Roarke, Mavis and the rest of the \\"In Death\\" family. The cases are serious and this one leads her right to a love she would have never imagined could belong to her. Roarke is absolutely to die for. And, I don't know of anyone out there who doesn't want a gourmet cup of coffee after this book either."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I love this series... you must read it to understand. It's all about a homicide detective named Lt. Eve Dallas and how she goes about solving a case which always seems imposibble to solve at first."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I discovered this series with \\"Divided in Death,\\" and the first time I read that book, I had a lot of quibbles with it. As I mention ad nauseam, I go back about 45 years with speculative fiction, a category that the Eve Dallas series can fit into quite nicely. After a second read, the book began to make more sense to me, and I decided to read the series from the beginning.\\"Naked in Death\\" is, indeed, the beginning, the first book by Nora Roberts as J.D. Robb, featuring Lieutenant Eve Dallas and billionaire Roarke (he uses the single name only). The publisher bills these books as \\"romantic suspense\\" or \\"romantic mystery.\\" I would dub them, police procedural / police action / rocky relationship / semi-speculative fiction, with more than a touch of explicit sex. I guess I'm getting old, but if you're not up for some heavy sex action between Dallas and Roarke, you had better steer clear of this series.Roberts/Robb has set the series in NYC, beginning in 2058. Prostitutes are now Licensed Companions, and after the terrors of the Urban Wars in the early 21st century, NYPD is now the New York Police and Security Department. Guns have been banned, but they somehow still managed to be used in the commission of crimes. Our Lieutenant is a ten-year vet of the force, having pulled herself up from a childhood of physical and sexual abuse, which she remembers only dimly at first. She was found broken and bloody in Dallas, Texas, and thus the social agencies named her with something less than cleverness (shades of Sam Francisco from \\"Alien Nation.\\"). Dallas joined the Police Academy as soon as she was old enough, and by the time of this story is considered a top Homicide investigator at the aptly named Cop Central.I highly recommend that any interested reader start with the first volume, and (if you stick with the series) continue in the order of publishing. Roberts/Robb develops her characters and situations as she goes, including the ups and downs of commitment-phobic Eve and commitment-determined Roarke. After I had read the first few books, the things that bothered me about \\"Divided in Death\\" became more clear.I believe this series is an attempt to fuse the romance, action and SF genres, and I think it is doing a good job of it. Give the first one a try: you might just decide to stay."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"If you like sex, murder and a really good mystery, the 'In Death' Series is a one of a kind. This series is a must-have for anyone who likes to solve a good mystery and enjoy a really juicy story. Here we have Eve Dallas, a Homocide cop for the NYPD. Her character is so real and compelling you can't help but fall in love with her, even with her rough-around the edges, no-nonsense attitude. She's tough, strong and deadly and out to save New York from the sickos of the world, on and off planet. Set in the midst of a futuristic world in the year 2058, our story begins when a dead woman's body is found, along with a piece of evidence that leads Eve Dallas to the powerful and darkly sexy Roarke, an Irish billionare who is the richest man on and off the planet, literally. They find themselves thrown together by fate, unwillingly, when more eveidence and leads bring them closer together. The chemistry between these two is hot and spicy enough to make you steamy beneath your collar the entire story. So keep a fan handy! You're gonna need it.This book was the beginning of a wonderful series that I proudly own all of the books to so far(except for one, Orgin in Death) and strongly suggest to anyone tired of the same fluff and nonsense, grab this book and prepare yourself for the ride of your life!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I pick up two of these books because Nora Roberts is the author of these futuristic books. I enjoyed them so much I have purchased twelve and is looking forward to getting all of these books in this series. You will fall in love with Rourke and Eve."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Nearly a decade ago, Nora Roberts' alter ego J.D. Robb introduced a series with an interesting combination of genres. More than just an old-fashioned romance, it is a romance with a twist: It's a futuristic murder mystery too. And the damsel in distress is tough-as-nails Lt. Eve Dallas. NAKED IN DEATH is the first in a stream of more than a dozen tales involving the steamy/steely lieutenant.In J.D. Robb's future world --- the world in another five decades --- there are myriad changes, as one would expect, but she suggests that human nature will remain what it has always been, and will continue to be: flawed.The murder that gets the story rolling isn't committed with a fancy techno-weapon, but an old-fashioned, messy handgun. While banned in the future, they are legally collectible. Multi-billionaire Roarke has an enviable collection of them. Naturally, the detectives question him immediately. But would a man with the wherewithal and wit to achieve Roarke's position be so cocky as to callously toss the murder weapon down next to the body and figure he can escape police scrutiny? He comes under even more suspicion when it is learned the victim's building security tapes have been tampered with. Roarke is an unequaled expert in the field. To complicate matters, the victim is the granddaughter of powerful Senator de Blass, an ill-tempered politician screaming for justice and decency --- and the capture of the person who killed his precious Sharon.Then a second body turns up, the setting a mirror image of the first. This involves another \\"licensed companion\\" (the euphemistic term applied in 2058 to a prostitute). And another antique gun is casually dropped at the scene. When a third \\"companion\\" is found in identical circumstances, the powerful senator cranks up the heat on the already-overworked detectives. Eve fears her job may be in jeopardy without a quick capture of the murderer.The investigation throws Roarke and Lt. Dallas together almost daily, much to her dismay --- and occasional delight. As Eve eliminates him as a viable suspect, she finds herself drawn to the man. Against her will and her better judgment, she surrenders to her own desires. The pair vibrates with electricity that says this attraction is more than just sexual.The series, starting with NAKED IN DEATH, is instantly likable, readable and full of enough action to satisfy all but the most intellectual of readers. Bedroom scenes come often enough for the romance lovers among the mystery buffs. And a bagful of twists will keep you guessing, right to the very end.--- Reviewed by Kate Ayers"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I loved this book! The action and romance makes this a page turner! I cant wait to get my hands on the rest of the series!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Norah Roberts, writing as J.D. Robb, has once again proved herself to be a gifted wordsmith. With 'Naked in Death', the first book of the 'In Death Series', the reader is immediately led into the scene and the action, and introduced to the primary characters. Front of stage, with star billing, is Lieutenant Eve Dallas of the New York Police Department. Eve, a product of a fractured childhood and of her time, is committed to her job of protecting the public. Uneasy about building relationships, she is, nevertheless, intensely loyal to her few friends.Set in the future, circa 2060, there are new systems of transport, new governments - even off planet, new weapons - guns are banned. But the reader is not overwhelmed by these, they are ancillary to the plot and don't challenge reality as we know it.The hook that catches the reader's attention is the intensity of the relationships and the speed of the action, and is likely to appeal to both sexes.Crime is interwoven with romance in such a way that the reader is mesmorised and it is impossible to put the book down.Having read the first in the series, it will become imperative to read them all.I'm certainly hooked.JudyC."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"As a fan of Nora Roberts (aka J.

Eve is a Homiside lieutenant in NYPD and she's seen and been through some serious stuff. Eve has been alone in her life battered and abused and her only focus is her work!Eve is the kind of heroine that I like, she is collected, she is responsible for her life and actions, she is persistant and she doesn't yield to anyone (well almost to anyone).While the story evolves we see different aspects of Eve's life, we meet her colleagues, we find out what happened during her childhood and we meet the one person who is meant to bring her world down brick by painfully well-build brick Roarke!I really loved the slight futuristic world he characters live in, the world were coffee doesn't exists anymore (and Eve can be totally bribed by a cup) and the world were a billionaire can built a resort in another planet.The story was evolving almost at 70% and I didn't have a clue as to who might be the murderer but the constant references to Eve's past narrowed the criminals by two.This is a good book, one that will make you feel frustrated and angry, one that will make you feel anxious and the kind of book that will make you laugh out loud at the same time."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"a cop ,a rich man, love. murder, crazy friends once u start reading it whill transfer u to different time and place...,"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"A believable futuristic romantic murder mystery with Eve Dallas in the center of it all.

I give it 4 stars as the sex scenes could have been toned down a bit and left a little to the imagination!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"In 2003ish I stumbled across a few of these and was immediately addicted. Over the space of a few years I finally collected them all, and I have been buying them as they come out since then. This is the first book in the series, and I first read it back in 2005 - and I haven't read it since. I forgot how much I enjoyed it. If you're just getting into this series I highly recommend reading them in order, as characters are introduced and gain importance as the series progresses and I feel you get more from it if you meet the characters and see their progression rather than starting with them later on.This series is set in the future, but it's not really all that futuristic - some of the laws are different (i.e. prostitution is legal, guns are illegal, \\"professional mothers\\" exist etc), and some of the technology is obviously a bit different, but it's easy to forget it's set in the future. I honestly enjoy that aspect; it's amusing to me to think how expensive coffee and steak (etc) might be in the future, and so on. Essentially these are your run of the mill murder mysteries; if you like Grafton, Paretsky, O'Shaughnessy, etc etc you'll enjoy these. The only thing that gets old is the sex, which starts to wear thin later in the series (at least for me), but JD Robb is Nora Roberts, and I assume she can't help it and/or wants to hold her original fan base's interest. Either way it's easy to get past it if you enjoy the stories, which I do.She really develops the characters over time, and adds new ones as she goes - the stories don't get stale even later in the series. We see the characters grow individually and together, and it's really enjoyable. Yes, sometimes they seem a bit repetitive and/or over done, but so do most mystery series with the same protagonist. It was a delight to reread the introduction of several of my favorite characters, although I have to admit that one character (Charles Monroe) does not really jive with his later appearances in the books. However, that really is a minor detail.If you enjoy murder mysteries and series where you can follow the growth of the characters, this series is for you. It remains one of my favorites 20+ books later (nearly 30 now, I think); I always look forward to a new book being released and I am thrilled to finally have a chance to reread some of the older ones. I thoroughly enjoyed rereading this one."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Have not read any books published in the name of Nora Roberts, but certainly will after this! As J D Robb, Ms Roberts writes with wit and style and this work is an excellent amalgam of suspense, mystery and romance set in a futuristic time frame. Eve Dallas is a no nonsense sassy detective and Roarke is the proverbial bad boy made (in this case, exceptionally) good, handsome, caring and clever. The plot is nicely twisted and humour througout is irreverent and appealing.

I can't wait to read the rest!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Lieutenant Eve Dallas should be on leave. Having just tied up a case that resulted in the death of a child, and Eve shooting the murderer, all she needs now is rest and recuperation. But there's no such luck for Lieutenant Dallas when a high-profile politician's granddaughter is murdered. The case is complicated by Sharon DeBlass's profession - high-class escort - and a note left beneath the body promising \`ONE OF SIX'.The case is made all the more baffling for the murder weapon used - an old-fashioned Smith & Wesson gun; an archaic museum piece since the gun-ban was initiated, but also a vital clue since only the wealthiest of collector's can now afford such a relic.Eve's investigations lead her to Rourke, an Irish-born millionaire living in New York who had close ties to Ms DeBlass's family and an interest in bygone weaponry. But upon meeting the dark-haired, whiskey-tongued Roarke, Eve is convinced he's no murderer. Or at least, she hopes he's not - otherwise this attraction and fevered wanting she feels would be a problem for both of them ...\`Naked in Death' is the first book in Nora Robert's (writing as JD Robb) \`In Death' romantic crime-thriller series, which began in 1995. The series is currently thirty-three books deep, with a 34th book scheduled for 2012, and it's entirely likely that the series will continue well beyond that ...I really didn't want to like this book. Oh, sure, I'd had this series recommended to me time and time again and was assured that I'd love them. People would utter the name \`Roarke' with almost biblical reverence and be positively horrified if I dared admit to never having read a single one of JD Robb's books. But still, I really didn't want to like this book, because liking this book would mean reading the series. A series that, as of 2012, will have 34 books to its credit. I knew if I read one and got hooked, I'd have to read them all (and my to-be-read pile is toppling as is!). So, like I said, I really didn't want to like this book ... but damned if Roarke & Robb didn't reel me in, hook, line and sinker.Robb's \`In Death' series is set in the future, in the year 2058. Inter-planetary travel is now possible, food is delivered by AutoChef, books come on discs (paperbacks are now viewed in museums), guns have been banned for a number of years and prostitution is legalized and regulated. These are just a few of the subtle futuristic scene-setters that are casually dropped throughout the book, and I quite liked that the sci-fi aspect was very low-key. Robb doesn't pull focus to the futuristic setting so much as she integrates it into the story, which I was pleased about since the future-setting had me a little irked when I read it in the blurb. I'm still not 100% sure why the book had to be set in the future, except that things like the antiquity of the murder weapon (a standard issue Smith & Wesson) and legalized prostitution leaked into the murder investigation and put an interesting spin on the crime.The real draw-card of the book (and I suppose, the series) is the characters of Eve and Roarke. Eve Dallas is a tough cop with a black past. On paper she sounds like a stereotype, but Robb has written Eve with many sides. She's stubborn and perceptive, tough but feminine. She's very much a lone wolf, but with inner scars that have her yearning for company and understanding. I liked Eve instantly; when we meet her she's coming off the tail-end of a child murder which resulted in Eve killing a deranged criminal. She's in a very fragile state of mind, but the instant she sees Sharon DeBlass's butchered body, she's on board this new murder investigation and wholly committed. I liked that she was so dedicated to the dead - Eve really sees this job as showing respect to those victims, and getting them justice in death.Because of Eve's rather fragile psyche when the book begins, she is utterly railroaded by murder suspect Roarke. Just \`Roarke' - a millionaire enigma with a criminal past but high-society presence. Roarke is painfully handsome, with an Irish lilt and a sharp mind. As much as Eve is amazed at her instant attraction to Roarke, he is even more shocked at his fascination with her. As Roark admits, he doesn't have much love for cops, but Eve with her awful shag haircut, whisky hair and sorrowful eyes has him lulled and lustful.As promised, Roarke is incredible. Even better is his and Eve's instant attraction and coupling. This is, obviously, one of the reasons Robb's series is so beloved. Unlike practically every other crime series with a dash of romance, Robb's will-they-or-won't-they is put to bed early on, instantaneous and highly flammable. The real interest of the series will come from how Eve and Roarke will cope with their sudden and unexpected presence in one another's lives.I know that Nora Roberts's forte is romance - as evidenced by the dark and dashing Roarke, and his simmering romance with Eve. So I wasn't overly shocked or too disappointed to read that the criminal side of things in \`Naked in Death' aren't quite on par with other crime books. The \`whodunit' mystery is wrapped up in a fairly obvious, if disturbing way. Eve's investigation is more paint-by-numbers than harrowing thriller. Fair enough, I wasn't expecting Karin Slaughter-levels of criminality. Clearly the focus of the \`In Death' series is the romance between Eve and Roarke, it's crime-lite romance-centric, and since I knew that going in, I wasn't baffled or annoyed by the lack."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"What more could you want in a great book.

For a book under the Romance genre, I was pleased to find that this book had a forward moving plot with good guys and bad guys and twists in the story. This was more a glorified police procedural than a drippy romance. That I liked. But I found Dallas, our cop, to be a bit too hard around the edges. Too much swearing and trying to be a male-wanna-be. Please Ms Roberts/Robb ... for those of us who are strong women, please don't portray the need for profanity and extreme rudeness as methods to get ahead in this world. Her &quot;character&quot; would be unbecoming in either a man *or* a woman.

That's it. That's actually alot, when there's nothing out there to read for someone who likes romance and action. But the whole \\"In Death\\" series is good only for the frequent smirks you get from a really good smart ass comment. AS usual, Roberts has created an allegedly \\"strong\\" woman character who 1) Allows the hero to do whatever the heck he wants 2) Can't deal with a stressful situation without having an attack of the vapors and 3) emotes all over the place with the slightest provocation. Roberts has never created a strong female character. Amusing, yes. Strong, resilient, mature....No way! I read her because she can piece a story together, and 99.9% of the other published authors cannot. But I always end up angry at myself. I'm a romance book lover, contantly looking for readable books, and failing so very often that I have to lower my standards sometimes if I want to indulge my love of the written word. And the pity of it is, Roberts could no doubt do much better in this regard. She can write. She just chooses to write about ninnies."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"As is my way, I leave the plot recap to others. It takes too much time, especially when I have so many other important things to address. I read this book at the prompting of a friend, after I had recommended a book to her. This, she said, was a great series. Hm... I won't disabuse her of the opinion of the series, as I haven't read any other books in it. But this book was, unfortunately, just average. And, also unfortunately, too predictable. And involved waaaay too many odors. I'm not sure WHY there were so many odors, but it definitely stood out to me (and I appear, of course, to be the only one to notice).As is also my way, I must give examples:The bottle of scent on the dresser was exclusive, and smelled, after a quick sniff, like expensive sex.The air smelled of flowers and pampered flesh.The quiet sound of birdsong and breezes sweetened the air.\\"She...\\" He gestured grandly. \\"Exuded sex as others might exude an expensive perfume.\\"\\"She drew people to her...\\" He searched for a suitable metaphor, used the corner of the scarf again. \\"Like an exotic and fragrant flower.\\"Slickly handsome in a black silk robe, and smelling seductively of sex, Charles smiled engagingly.The discomfort helped distract her from the misery of headstones and the smell of cold, fresh earth.The steam rising from her cup smelled like heaven.She hated to admit even to herself that the tobacco smelled enticing. (and in the same section, though not about smell, was THIS winner -- \\"The tobacco burned expensively between his long, elegant fingers.\\" How does expensive burn?)Mavis Freestone whirled in, a jangle of bracelets, a puff of scent.But Eve had already scented it, already - despite herself - begun to smile.And just a few lines later: Eve brought the bag to her face and sniffed deep.She could smell it, as ripe and sour as the vegetable hash that was today's special.From the smell that had greeted her outside, someone had died out there recently, or the recycle trucks hadn't been through in the last week.Her guide was silent on the ride up and exuded a discreet whiff of sensible scent that matched her sensible shoes and neat, sleek coif.There as a sharp, spicy scent from a bank of dianthus, blooming in shades of rose and vivid purple.However glorious the scent, they failed to stir her appetite.\\"I'm going to follow my nose.\\"So far her nose was just fine.She could smell them: water, bad fish, and old sweat.The room smelled of blood, of urine, of burned food.It was, as she'd suspected, floral in scent and flavor.The scent of brewed flowers lingered in the air.It was foolish to be susceptible to his hands over hers, the press of his body, the smell of him.Thoughtfully he blew out a fragrant stream of smoke.A room filled with violence, the smell of gunsmoke still stinking the air, and weapons still within reach.She could smell flowers and felt the give of carpet under her feet.\\"I'm going to enjoy smelling my soap on you.\\" (Oh, and this line: \\"...that had an orgasm shivering through her like gold.\\" -- how does gold shiver????)From another fount he drew pale green soap that smelled of wild forests.You knew this time, she thought, how it would feel, how she'd look, how the blood would smell.She leaned closer, looked into Joe's surprised and staring eyes, sniffed the pie.Hetta Finestein opened her door with a puff of lavender sachet and the yeasty smell of homemade bread.\\"Don't you so much as sniff this custard pie.\\"A short time later, Eve was in the kitchen, watching the cat sniff with delicate disdain at a bowl of food she'd unearthed...Unable to resist, she swung by the bench, leaned close enough to smell sour vomit.\\"He either knew it or smelled it.\\"She didn't feel awkward climbing back into her clothes with the scent of him clinging to her.She could smell his breath on her face, sweet, like candy.and finally:\\"It's tea, a whiff of whiskey.\\"WOW! That's a lot of focus on aroma, don't you think? Perhaps Ms. Robb/Roberts could start using another sense? (Or scent? ha!)On another note, I figured out the \\"whodunit\\" part by page 60. The \\"gadgets\\" were barely more technical than what's available now, except for the flying cars. Although they DID promise me flying cars! ;) The dialogue was decent and I did laugh a couple of times. While I don't think the use of \\"the f-word\\", as another reviewer put it, was excessive, it was more than twice as someone else claimed.I agree that Eve was NOT the strong, assertive person she was described as. On the other hand, I don't think Roarke was as terrible as some people seem to think. It would take a guy like him to get through to a girl like her. The sex was a lot for such a short book, but I don't really mind that. They were about a 5 on a 1-10 scale of hot, though. Would have preferred something a bit more... sensual.As a forensic science/crime wonk, I was terribly frustrated, if not downright disappointed, with the deduction and investigation side of the story. The mistakes in plot, the steps of the investigation in general, were basic. For example, Roarke is one of those uber-security conscious people, right (I mean, he owns a security company)? Well, did no one think that perhaps his property might have video surveillance that could provide him an alibi? Or that perhaps talking with the victim's family was kind of important and should happen before page 100?I've been assured that the series gets MUCH better as it moves on, and I hope that's the case. If it DOESN'T get better I would be concerned for the taste of these 5 star reviewers. There IS potential here, but really only if Robb/Roberts can do better with the mystery and investigative aspects of her story. Otherwise no matter how decent the writing, or even if I learned to like the characters a lot more, I would get extremely irritated with the books.Now if only the rest of the series isn't as focused on odors...Edited because someone pointed out that I didn't give enough examples of the forensic/investigative problems that I had with the book. Basically, I know that when someone is shot they don't go flying backwards (which was mentioned twice). I know that if you put paint all over your body, even when your skin can't \\"breathe\\" (which I didn't include in my \\"aroma\\" references), you won't suffocate. Mythbusters has shown that both of these ideas are false. :)I also caught SEVERAL bad editing mistakes (Eve was called \\"Even\\" in one spot, for example). With the clout that Nora Roberts must have, SURELY she could have a better editor by now."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Naked in death was the best book I ever read.

It was excellent; I wanted to call in sick to work just so I could stay at home and read! Great reading for these long Ohio winters!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Robb kicks this book off with a bang, and finishes with a flourish. If you are looking for a great mystery, detective thriller, or even a surprising romance, look no further. You will find all of that an more in the story of Eve, a police dectective, who is asked to solve the mystery surrounding the deaths of professional companions (or prostitutes). The book is set in the future, but you will not be distracted by a lot of descriptive prose that adds nothing to the story. Instead, the plot moves steadily forward, uncovering details and suspects along the way.I found Eve's character very believable. She is a hard worker and is devoted to solving her case. She doesn't let her personal feelings get in the way, usually, which is why she is so suprised when she begins to fall for one of the primary suspects. Her conflict is very real and adds a lot of suspense to the storyline. As the plot and characters unfold, you will begin to draw your own conclusions as to who the real murderer is, but you will need to wait until the very end for he or she to be revealed.Not a long or tedious book. Easy to read and a lot of fun. You will want to have the next one ready to go when you finish. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I first picked up a J.D. Robb book because I was bored and it looked interesting. Within the month I owned the entire series, and both my mother and I were eagerly waiting for the newest title. The characters are interesting, the stories are full of twists and turns, yet believable (for example, there are no surprise characters that pop up in the last chapter to become the killer) and the books are refreshingly different from other series and even from each other. Ms. Robb writes a different type of story in each book, which is great for avid mystery fans."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"This is one of those books, that is fairly enjoyable, and then when the climax comes you realize this is just a way for the author to cram down his political correctness and anti-whitey propaganda down your throat.Another weakness is that the male protagonist is wealthy beyond belief, incredibly attractive, incredibly tall and lithe, and incredibly sensitive and intelligent. Think 'female victorian pseudo porn' with an lefty world view.I will skip JD Robb's other books."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I could only get through 10 pages and had to put this book down.

The author seemed to spend most of her time describing various sexual acts and not enough plotting. It appears to be lazily written, with things such as naming the futuristic weapon &#34;a weapon&#34;. I desperately tried to enjoy this book, but did not. Two stars is a bit generous."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I have long been aware of the commercial success of author Nora Roberts but the storylines and writing style (a genre often characterized as romantic suspense with apparent emphasis on the romance) have never tempted me to read any of her work. However, I happened to pick up a copy of volume #21 (depending on how you count anthology inclusions) in the .... IN DEATH series written under the pen name J.D. Robb and was immediately intrigued by its premise of a futuristic police procedural series (the year is 2058) with a strong central character (Detective Lieutenant Eve Dallas) who had a continuing romantic interest (the mysterious Irish billionaire Roarke). I have long enjoyed the Spenser series by Robert Parker and the ensemble cast of Ed McBain's 87th Precinct novels; the reward of finding another such series to enjoy would only be increased by some speculation thrown into the mix regarding the future direction of science in the aid of police work as well speculation concerning the evolution of New York City, an area very familiar to me. I was immediately hooked by SURVIVOR IN DEATH and despite some minor criticisms gave it a five star review (3/30/2005). I read ORIGIN IN DEATH, the next book in the series, as soon as it was released and also enjoyed it sufficiently to rate it five stars as well (7/26/2005). As with other series which I have enjoyed, I then decided to read some of the earlier books to fill in the backstory and see how the characters have evolved. From my perspective, there is good news and bad news in that regard.Among the positives were a plot which was somewhat interesting; the aspects of the book that could be described as a police procedural were quite well done. Second, the story obviously familiarized me with the initial confrontation between Dallas and Roarke that developed into their current relationship. Third, I was pleased to discover that several of the characters whom I had met were an integral part of the series since it's initial installment- these include the irrepressible Mavis Freestone, electronics specialist Feeney, the psychologist Dr. Mira, Roarke's man Summerset and Captain Whitney. Fourth, I chose to listen to the audio CD and Susan Ericksen's narration was extremely well done. (Although one disconcerting note was having a female narrator, appropriately chosen to reflect the gender of the main character, reading detailed and very graphic descriptions of the mutilated bodies of the killer's female victims.) Finally, a lot of the futuristic touches were realistic enough to add a lot of fun and yet helped the author to develop the story and Lt. Dallas to solve the crimes.Among the negative aspects, I did not particularly enjoy the depiction in such graphic detail of the violence and the great deal of sexual content (with regard to the crimes themselves and also other details of the basic plot, Dallas and Roarke's relationship, and the lives of many of the characters in the book). However, my primary criticism is that this initial story in the series is clearly a transition novel which has two relatively serious flaws. In Robb's effort to establish Roarke and Dallas as the main characters of a continuing series, she rushes them into a relationship whose slower development would have added immeasurably to the story. Second, in what appears to be an attempt to attract the fans of Nora Roberts to her new series, she blends two genres both of which suffer as a result. There are scenes of passion much more suitable for a Harlequin romance than a police procedural, and they mean that the flow of the detective story is also disrupted unnecessarily. In addition, the personal conflicts which both Roarke and Eve face as their out-of-character (for both of them) relationship develops can't really be adequately addressed given the constraints of the author's other objectives.The plot is very simple: a conservative Senator's daughter is murdered and her body left in a pose which suggests that the killer is both meticulous and wants attention. And the note found next to the body suggests that great urgency attaches to a rapid solution of the crime; the note reads ominously 1 OF 6. The publicity is particularly unwelcome because the victim's occupation is \\"licensed companion\\"; a choice which despite its legality by the mid-twenty first century has still caused her well known family considerable embarrassment. The political pressure on the police quickly intensifies as subsequent murders occur and clues seem to link the mysterious Roarke to the crimes. Nevertheless, while the eventual outcome of the investigation is gradually foreshadowed, there are enough surprising details to keep the story interesting.If you plan to read the series, I strongly suggest starting with this book even though it was inferior to the two later books which I have read. The later books include details concerning the mysteries of Roarke's and Dallas' childhood backgrounds and the impact on their individual lives which provide a context that I would have preferred to have gradually unfold as I completed the series in the sequence which the author intended, rather than be in the possession of subsequently revealed knowledge which influenced my reaction to this story. And certainly, if you want a romance/detective story then read this book. However, if you only plan to sample a few stories in the series, then I strongly suggest that you skip this book and concentrate on some of the later novels, including either of the two which I mention at the beginning of this review. The characters and their relationships are much more developed as the series progresses and the plots are also more complex. Meanwhile, I plan to continue to pursue the dual goal of reading each of the new releases as they occur while gradually filling in my knowledge of Dallas' past cases.Tucker Andersen"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"A cop in 2058 New York? Bring on the gadgets! Eve Dallas is a good character, and if Ms. Roberts wasn't a romance novelist this could have been a heck of a series. But since she is, she brings in Roarke, the mysterious Daniel Day-Lewis clone Irish billionaire (yeah, I bet New York street cops run into them EVERY day), who proceeds to promptly destroy any credibility Ms. Roberts had going with the story. As much as I hate to admit it, I've read every book in the series (before I gave up reading romance and &quot;romantic suspense&quot; in disgust). All you'll get is futuristic gadgetry combined with mundane murders and pedestrian sex scenes. Hey, Nora, just a bit of advice--even the most in-love couples don't have mind-blowing sex every time. Bottom line--Nora Roberts fans will and do adore this series, others beware!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I was running out of books to check out and try when I happened upon the mystery section of the bookstore I go to. I don't usually go for mystery novels, but after reading some reviews of J.D. Robb's (aka Nora Roberts) books here on Amazon, I decided to give Ms. Robb's book a try.I know I've said that mystery novels are not really my cup of tea, romance is not even remotely in the same ballpark. I always picture romance novels as thin paperbacks with half-naked, beautiful people on the covers. I was surprised to know that I was hooked on Ms. Robb's Naked In Death novel from the first chapter all the way to the end. I enjoyed the perfect blend of crime-mystery and sexy romance from her novel's two main characters.NYPSD Lt. Eve Dallas is one of the better female characters I've ever had the chance to read. Eve is both a tough-as-nails police detective and also very feminine though she would be the last person to think so. Its this duality in her personality that attracts rogue Irish bilionaire Roarke (the cool characters always can get away with using just a single name) to Eve. The attraction seems very unusual at first, especially since Roarke can get and have any woman he wishes, but as the story progresses some hints as to why he's attracted comes out in the open.The mystery part of the novel is very well-done, even though Roarke being a suspect in the beginning seems like a convenient way to get the two characters together. The heat from their initial meeting shows that Ms. Robb can write scenes of romance and conflict and make both look very steamy. I don't know which I enjoyed reading more, the scenes where Eve and Roarke finally have sex or their constant baiting each other to react, but both were written with enough heat and chemistry to make the book a must-read.Ms. Robb's first novel in her In Death series, Naked In Death, is a wonderful and fun novel. It should appeal to others who are not just romance novel readers. The scenes of romance and sensual, steamy sex is a big bonus. The novel overall is engaging and well-written for other genre fans to enjoy."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I bought 20+ books in this series not knowing much about them but after reading all the reviews thought they would be terrific. I found this book to be slow and not as futuristic as I was hoping for, although there is a lot of sex and sex crimes. I have started the second book and find myself putting it down looking for something else to read. Looks like it will take me a long time to get through all those books I purchased."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"In my experience, romance writers that turn suspense haven't turned out all that great. I took a chance on the In Death series and I am so glad I did. This book hooked me from the first page!Taking place in 2058, Lt. Eve Dallas thought she has seen everything in her profession as a cop. When Eve is put on a case for a murder victim, what is shocking is how the victim is killed. Only the very wealthy can afford to collect antique weapons, which include any type of gun. Gun's were banned around 2020, and are very expensive to aquire. This helps her narrow down her suspects. All the evidence soon points to Roarke, a billionaire. Eve is soon drawn into a case that hits too close to home, laying her emotions bare. Soon the desire flowing between her and Roarke is too much to deny and Eve finds herself in a relationship with her prime suspect.The outcome of the book is surprising, but not shocking. The relationship between Eve and Roarke is intense and emotional. Due to both their pasts, they have a hard time opening up to anyone, but find that with each other, they might be able to. Again, this was a great book and I look foward to reading the rest in the series."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I knew I'd love this book because I pretty much love anything written by Nora Roberts (aka JD Robb) but this surprised me. Science Fiction, romance, mystery -- well, those are my favorite genres by one of my favorite authors. Now, I just have to figure out how I can afford ALL the others!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"With NAKED IN DEATH, author J.D. Robb (better known to the world as Nora Roberts) introduces tough-as-nails New York City Homicide detective Lieutenant Eve Dallas. A serial killer announces his intent via a note left at a grisly murder scene: one of six. It is Eve&#65533;s job to stop this madman from achieving his ultimate goal. Her prime suspect for the first murder? Roarke, an Irish multimillionaire who was the first victim&#65533;s date the night she was killed. True to fashion in the romantic-suspense genre, Eve is mysteriously drawn to Roarke the instant she lays eyes on him -- in a computer-generated photo, no less. Roarke is equally captivated by the determined detective -- to the extent that he keeps a button that fell from her suit jacket during their first meeting.Can these two strong-willed people find their way to each other and solve the case? The answer is a resoundingly obvious yes, but the way their relationship is born and plays out is infinitely satisfying. These two are constantly in the public eye, Roarke for his business dealings and social whirl, and Eve for the prominence of her cases, and it is interesting to see how they manage their relationship. Eve has her dark side, too, in that she has vague memories of an extremely sadistic, drunken, abusive father. Her unwillingness to let anyone into that part of her life is matched by Roarke&#65533;s determination to not be shut out.Perhaps not to other readers, but to me, the murderer practically jumped off the pages the second I encountered his character. The fact that the mystery was so obvious despite the feeling I got that Robb was trying to keep readers in suspense was offset by the sheer imagination of the world Eve lives in. Yes, she&#65533;s a cop trying to solve a series of murders -- but she&#65533;s a cop trying to solve a series of murders in the year 2058. This little twist opens up a whole new sense of wonder: at how much is different yet how much remains the same. Little things, or seemingly little things, have changed, making the world vastly different: cars have vertical lift, humans live much longer due to the invention of the cancer vaccine, real coffee is hard to come by due to the destruction of the tropical forests, the basics of crime forensics are exceptionally advanced, and people have colonized other planets. Still, so much remains the same, including the unending capacity for human cruelty and the intricacies of man-woman relationships.The world of Eve Dallas was a fascinating place to visit, and I have quickly become addicted to this series. Highly recommended for Nora Roberts fans as well as romantic suspense fans and even people just looking for something slightly different than what they normally read."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I really love this series, the first three are my favorites because it is the beginning of the relationship between Eve Dallas and Rourke.

She thus created Eve Dallas, a detective with the NYPD 2050, and Roarke, the richest man on earth, who rose from obscure Irish poverty. Further, the author made Roarke a murder suspect, Eve the detective and the rest became history. This duo is still going strong in this continuing series, which wins readers from both the romance and mystery genres daily. In fact, Roarke usually wins the best romance hero category every time there is a polling of readers for favorite heroes. Eve and Roarke together often win Best Couple. Many women readers have even successfully passed these books onto their husbands for bedside reading. I've read this one and the three that follow it. I have another 4 or so in my to-be-read stack. In a way, the duo remind me of Nick and Nora Charles but set in future day, even more decadent and dissolute New York City. Even though she uses the name Robb for these books, everyone knows it is bestselling romance author Nora Roberts who writes them."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"_Naked in Death_ is the first book in J.D. Robb's In Death series. It's set in New York City in 2058, and it's main character is Lt. Eve Dallas, a homicide investigator with a troubled past. One of the main suspects in her investigation is Roarke, a darkly seductive Irish billionaire who seems to own just about everything in the free world. I'm not generally a fan of Nora Roberts' mainstream romance books, and I read _Naked in Death_ because I was intrigued by the idea of a female homicide detective working in a futuristic atmosphere. This book has both gritty mystery and very satisfying romance-I think both mystery and romance fans won't be disappointed-and both Eve and Roarke are memorable characters."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Eve is one incredibly tough and sexy police lieutenant in NY City and I want her to move to Virginia and have my baby. Eve won't back down from anyone and she has everything this male dreams about...smarts, strength, looks, and is an animal in the bedroom in two very sexy scenes without being pornagraphic. Nora Roberts is an incredible writer and really makes you feel for the characters and root for Eve. This was my first book in the series and I can't wait to join the sexy lady cop as she kicks butt in the other books."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"After reading reviews I decided to buy and was not disappointed. I am not a pro reviewer. I have no fancy words to describe this book only to say that it is exciting, interesting, grabs your imagination and doesn't let go till the last page is read. Thanks to all who recommended this!!!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"From the first book to the most recent, I am still hooked. Go past the fact that this is a futuristic NYC. The gadgets are only secondary to the romance and the mysteries that have to be solved. I have told friends about these books and hooked them too. J.D. Robb aka Nora Roberts has a hit series on her hands. Her writing ability makes her characters real and enjoyable. Order and enjoy every one of them. You have my word that this is a series worth getting hooked on!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I just finished the first four books in the series, and I've enjoyed them all. Nora Roberts has created some wonderful characters in this series. Eve is great--a dedicated cop who is haunted by her past; prickly, wary, a loyal friend to those few she calls friend, and surprised she's in love with Roarke. HE is gorgeous (I keep seeing Pierce Brosnan), rich, shady, totally dedicated to Eve, and indulges her shamelessly despite her protests. Peabody is a refreshing addition to the cast of characters. The stories are great, the bad guys not TOO easy to figure out, and the characters have depth and believability, as well as suprising flashes of humor that leaves the reader chuckling delightedly. Keep 'em coming, J.D. Robb!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"&quot;Naked in Death&quot; is the first book in J. D. Robb's &quot;In Death&quot; series and it starts the series off with style! We are introduced to Eve, the independent and no-nonsense cop and Roarke, the charismatic billionaire who sweeps Eve off her feet.The mystery/suspense elements are exciting and well thought out. Eve is investigating the disturbing murders of female licensed companions (prostitution is legal in the year 2058) and Roarke is her main suspect! These two meet as a result of her investigation, and as Eve gets to know Roarke, she becomes quite sure that he is not a cold-blooded killer. Eve cannot resist the lure of this mysterious and sexy man and they soon end up in the midst of a passionate romance.The romance elements of this book blend perfectly with the murder mystery elements, to provide the reader with a wonderfully imaginative, provocative and thrilling story. The futuristic setting is completely believable, and provides an intriguing backdrop for the story without detracting from it.The main characters, Eve and Roarke are both complex and well-developed, and the dynamics of their rocky relationship will keep readers turning pages.This is a truly great read and I am quite sure that readers everywhere will want to read more of Eve and Roarke after finishing this first instalment. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Nora Roberts has long been one of my favorite romance authors. I especially enjoy her Irish trilogies. Having recently read her new novel, Angels Fall, I finally decided to go back and read some of her books written under the pseudonym of J. D. Robb. A friend recommended this series, so I jumped into the first in her \\"death\\" series.NAKED IN DEATH was really good; I couldn't put it down. This series is not true romance; it's more of a romantic mystery, which only adds to the intrigue for me. What makes it so different is that it takes place in the year 2058 and there are many innovative new concepts, such as \\"off-planet travel,\\" to name just one. I leave the rest for you to discover and enjoy.Of course, her main character, Lieutenant Eve Dallas, is a strong, independent woman ... just the way I like my heroines. And her Irish hero (what else?), a billionaire named Roarke, is more than a match for Eve. They make a fascinating, intriguing couple.I don't know how Nora manages to come up with \\"winners\\" each and every time she writes a book, but she does. What a remarkable talent and a remarkable author! I look forward to reading all the books in this series as well as her entire body of works."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I have loved Nora Roberts for years, and rejoice when I see a new series come out. I chanced upon one of the Lieutentant Eve Dallas stories a few months ago, and when I realized it was one of a series, I started an immediate search to start at the beginning and read them in order. To watch the development of the characters, the blooming of the love story, to see how Eve finds out about her past, little by little, is fascinating. I have fallen in love with Eve and Roarke, and all the other wonderful characters in the series, and since they are hard to find anywhere but on Amazon (or perhaps in a local library), I am buying them a few at a time. The interesting thing is that as I am reading them, I am finding more and more women who are also reading them, and these books were written several years ago! Why did it take us so long to discover them? I think they are Nora Roberts at her best. I recommend the series highly to anyone who is a fan of romance, crime and passion."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"The book started with a bang, and Eve Dallas is an engrossing, attractive protagonist. By the time I had finished the first 50 pages, I had ordered the next two in the series. By the time I finished the book, I was regretting it. Where shall I start? Eve finally gets around to interviewing the parents of the first victim by page 130, and even then, it's an afterthought. Ridiculous. The majority of murders are committed by friends or family. Even if the parents aren't suspects, they might well have valuable information. Second, the killer slips videos of the first two murders into Eve's apartment. Does she increase security? Change the locks? Ask for a police guard? No. She goes to sleep. Baloney. Third, the Chief of Police, who is obviously crooked, makes Eve deny any link between the two murders. This is patently absurd, and the media immediately picks up on it. Fourth, Roarke is an arrogant ass, and Eve, a woman who is depicted as not letting herself be pushed around, constantly lets him get away with it. At one point, he breaks into her apartment and calmly lights up a cigarette. This may seem trivial, but non-smokers really, really hate it when they can't get away from cigarettes, and a non-smoker would never allow somebody to smoke in their apartment. It's not \\"strong.\\" It's not \\"masculine.\\" It's obnoxious. Eve and Roarke's entire relationship seems unreal. He's a cardboard cutout of the Irish rogue who can only be reformed by the love of a good woman and she winds up looking like an idiot for putting up with his garbage for more than an instant."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I started out reading Portrait in Death, decided to read a few more, and now I'm hooked. My husband got me the ones that I was missing for christmas, so I read Naked In Death and I loved it. I don't even want to think about what it's going to be like when I finish the whole In Death series.."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I started reading the Eve Dallas novels about 4 books into the series, and was hooked right away. Just had to find out how it all started and Naked in Death is the debut novel for the series. It's classic JD Robb aka Nora Roberts - with a great plot that develops well, the characters are real (despite the futuristic period setting, which provides an interesting foil for Eve's turmoil and angst) It's good to start with this book first, because JD Robb really fleshes out the characters and creates more intense plots subsequently in the series. Even if you've read her later books, Naked In Death makes for excellent reading and provides you with the background to Eve and Roarke's relationship."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I was impressed. I liked the futurist world Roberts created. The new technology and moral beliefs of the public was basically plausible. The protagonist, Eve, was realistic and well rounded. I thought Riley was a bit flat. He didn't show the tarnish of his stated upbringing, but perhaps future books will show this. Just to give a base line, Eve is a detective, Riley is a suspect for multiple murders. The murderer plans to kill a total of six legal prostitutes and is accomplishing it one per week. It is up to Eve to catch the bad guy before he kills again.My only problem with this book was the ending. I predicted it (including the bad guy) the moment he was introduced in the story. Granted, I read alot, so it is easier for me to predict endings, but I still prefer to be surprised and look for that great author that keeps me guessing. I didn't find it here, but I still found liked it and plan to read more."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I wasn't sure I'd like a \\"futuristic\\" type novel, even though the alter ego of one of my favorite authors, Nora Roberts, was writing it. Writing as J.D. Robb, she has definitely changed my mind about this genre. Naked in Death was impossible for me to put down until the last page was read!J.D. Robb introduces us to Eve Dallas, a tough New York police lieutenant who has always relied on herself in all situations and has never let anyone get close to her personally. Eve Dallas is one of the best homicide detectives that New York Security and Police Department (NYSPD) has to offer - she's smart, gutsy, and holds nothing back when trying to solve a case.In this first book of the series, a ruthless serial killer is murdering licensed companions (the term used for prostitutes in the year 2058). It's Dallas' job to find the murderer and stop him/her before another killing. Oh what a tangled web the reader is tangled in with a variety of characters that are so vivid you actually feel as if you know them personally.Roarke, a multi-billionaire, is of Irish decent, drop dead gorgeous, smart and just the right combination of charisma and attitude to attract Dallas. Even when the first murder victim links Roarke as a possible suspect.The colorful support cast will have you smiling and shaking your head. They range from the talented lounge singer who has become Dallas' best friend, to the obnoxious senator who rules the senate and his family with an iron fist, to Dallas' partner who reminds me of a Basset Hound with droopy eyes and a penchant for sugared almonds. Ah yes, they are quite a bunch of characters, full of antics that will have you laughing out loud.As Dallas is trying to solve these crimes, she falls in love with Roarke. She hopes she can prove his innocence, but knows that if he is the murderer her job always comes first and she would have to arrest him even while her heart is breaking. Sound like she's a sap? No way! She's never been in love before, so not only is it a new experience, it's also an emotion that has her confused and at times irritable. Even experiencing the sentiment for the first time, she's still tough as nails.The book has a great combination of romance, mystery and even science fiction. I love the AutoChef that cooks up meals at the touch of a finger and the automobiles that are able to go from road to sky at the flip of a switch. How about the airbuses that cruise through the city skies full of tourists? And guns have been outlawed so police use stunners that have various settings from a mild shock to the \\"termination\\" setting.Ok, sounds strange, but it is absolutely wonderful. J.D. Robb, AKA Nora Roberts, is the best when it comes to blending the genres and you won't be disappointed with this series. I highly suggest this book if you love mystery, intrigue and romance. I'd also strongly recommend that you have a copy of Glory in Death on hand so you can finish this book and pick up the next in the series. You'll be hooked!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"As someone who probably owns at least 200 unabridged audio titles, many of them by Brilliance Audio, I heartily recommend both this company and this narrator. Although I have heard the Recorded Books version of Naked In Death, I find this version much preferable. I must also admit to doing a victory dance around the desk when I saw that this version was coming out. I hope they get around to UNabridged (abridged versions are already out) of all the titles in this series. Ericksen has a good grasp of how to keep the voices distinct, a fine grasp of accents, and that indefinable energy that keeps one listening all the way through. As to the storyline itself - if J.D. Robb is on the cover, I'm there in line on the first day of release!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"In 2058, the United States has outlawed guns, legalized postitution (Liscensed Companions), and tried to genetically eliminate negative emotions and behavior. Eve Dallas is the top homicide detective in Manhattan and has dedicated her life to her career to try and escape a horrible and painful past. When a murdered Liscensed Companion (LC) turns out to be a high powered senator's grand-daughter, she is up to her eyeballs in red tape and politics. When the killer promises that 5 more will die, she knows she must hurry and find the murderer.Roarke is on the short list of suspects. He is the richest man in the world, owns the building the LC was murdered in, and owns the company that handles the security for the building. He also has a collection of antique, outlawed guns, one of which was used as the murder weapon. When he swears his innocence, Eve finds herself believing him, but does not know if it is her top notch cop instincts, or the intense attraction she feels for Roarke. Together, Eve and Roarke must fight mistrust and a deadly serial killer intent on destroying them both.This was a great start to was is sure to be a fabulous series. NAKED IN DEATH is a high paced, sexy thriller. It is sure to interest romance and mystery readers alike. But beware, this is one that will keep you up ALL night, because you just cannot put it down. At just over 300 pages, I finished this one in a day and a half. Definitely recommended!!!JBoguepaper-and-lace.comSpecializing in paranormal romance and fiction."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the book \\"Naked In Death\\". Honestly I have to say I was skeptical at first, I'm not to much into the futuristic books, but this grabbed me from the first page and didn't let me go till it was over. Actually it has me wanting to go and read Glory In Death to keep the series going in my mind. The story is about a fearless detective named Eve Dallas. She's self sufficient, she's in control and her whole world gets turned upside down literally when the Senator's Granddaughter gets murdered. Going through all the channels as Detective Dallas has to do she finds herself confronted with a man, a suspect. But not just any man...a man named Rourke. From the moment they meet the chemistry runs over! You will see just how important a little bit of love can help to ending a long streak of violence and brutality that not only is involved in the case, but also involved all they way back to Eve's childhood! If your a fan of Nora Roberts...pick this one up. If J D Robb is new to you, then do yourself a favor and read this book. This is one series, I plan on reading the whole way through!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"WOW I started this book and finished in a day. I couldn't put it down!! Thihs is a must read series."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"This is the first book in the \\"In Death\\" series --- if you like romantic suspense, I can't recommend any other book more highly. This book is probably my favorite popular fiction paperback type novel, and I read alot of paperback fiction! Also, one of the things that makes this series great is the development of the characters / supporting characters over the course of the books, so I would recommend reading them in order if you are interested in the series. (be forewarned that these books have a 'darker' quality than straight romance)."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"After reading Seduction in Death, I got the urge to read NAKED IN DEATH again. This is a fantastic, in every sense of the word, mystery series. Mostly all the players are introduced in this first book. I am glad I began at the beginning. Eve Dallas is our fiesty detective heroine, braving thru personal and professional hurdles. She investigates everyone in her search for the killer and finally gets around to Roarke as a suspect. Eve is relentless and dedicated and this attracts Roarke fiercely.Their first meeting and subsequent confrontations are superbly written by Nora. I enjoyed it more the second time because I knew where it was going. You know almost from the beginning who the real murderer is but the voyage to the end is great.All the other characters are keenly written (Charles and Summerset are particular favorites) but they are all developed so well, you just cannot wait to get to the next installment. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Loved this book. Fast read. You will fall in live with the characters.

I love the twist and turns, thinking I know who did it, but was so surprised when I read who it was. This is a very enjoyable book, one that you will have trouble putting down."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Oh Boy!!

Eve Dallas is a homicide cop with a personal dark secret for which the gradual exploration and discovery adds an interesting layer to the current mystery. The first seven books are all fast paced action, including an ongoing hot romance with an ultra rich good looking ex criminal who can't get her out of his thoughts. Although I normally only read \\"serious\\" SciFi, needless to say I enjoyed this first story so much, I downloaded the next and the next and am now on book 20. Highly recommended for a Kindle read during travel or breaks, or sitting quietly engrossed after a hard day's work."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I usually like murder mysteries and thrillers, and I often like romances, but I thought this book was not very satisfying in either category. The mystery didn't have enough thrill and plot-twist. The romance was too abstract."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I've read all the In Death books and novellas and this is still my absolute favorite and one I re-read over and over. I was drawn in from the beginning and was riveted by the story and the romance. The characters were intriguing, the mystery complex. I wanted to know more about them. I had never read any romantic thrillers and picked this one up on a lark and I am so glad I did. I found a whole new world and genre to explore. I have tried a few of Nora Roberts other books, and I appreciate her writing skills, but this series is what I will continue to read and enjoy first and foremost."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Roarke is an amazingly hot hero.

It is nice to 'get to know' the characters and all their interactions. Makes for a more interesting book if you are already aware of the players."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"It took a while but I finally backtracked and read the first \\"In Death\\" book, \\"Naked in Death\\". J.D. Robb aka Nora Roberts is such a gifted writer that each book can stand alone. That said, I'm glad I finally read the first book which introduced all the main characters and how they became connected to Eve Dallas, especially Roarke....The first time I read about Eve Dallas was in \\"Remember When\\" which I didn't find particularly interesting. It was too way out there for my liking after reading so many Nora Roberts books. But I slowly started reading the \\"In Death\\" series and now I feel I know Dallas and I appreciate the fact that she has problems stemming from her scarred childhood and applies her psyche to the murder victims she cares so deeply about. She and Roarke are both abuse survivors and truly complete each other filling the void both endure. That special connection binds them together and their love is pure joy to the reader. Of course, it doesn't hurt that he's incredibly easy on the eyes, rich beyond comprehension and just a little left of center legally.All in all, I've come to appreciate the \\"In Death\\" series and I find the plots and twists in the stories very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Really, I can't believe I waited so long to try out this series. It was a great book and I love that it takes place in the near future. The characters felt real and I really connected with Eve. She is a tough, don't-mess-with-me-or-I-will-zap-you-good detective whose deep belief in the justice she seeks for all of evil's victims has given her a likeable vulnerability. Not to mention the mysterious and elusive Roarke who is dead sexy with a bit of a bad boy attitude.The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars was because I found the plot easy to figure out. I won't say it was predicable, because it wasn't completely obvious. I think I have just spent too much time reading mystery novels that I can recognize the patterns the author has hidden through out the story.I really liked this book and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the mystery thiller genre. Did I mention this was a true page turner? I look forward to reading the rest of the books in this series."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I felt some closure upon reading \\"the beginning\\" of the Eve Dallas saga! I am a big fan of the audio book as I spend a great deal of time on the road in 1/2 hour to hour spurts. I started with the print versions but really enjoy the audio. This cd did not have the characters/voices developed as the future ones did but that could be expected. I always felt something missing by not knowing where Nora Roberts/JD Robb initiated the lives of her characters. I am comfortable with that now and will continue to listen to all the cds as they continue!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I really love this series, but I was stupid and started at like book 20. I had never heard of the In Death Series, so I just picked up one that looked really good. I was hooked and always meant to go back to the beginning. I was thrilled when I finally got a library card and they had the entire series. Being the first in the series doesn't make any less than the rest. It was great to finally understand how somethings come into play later on. Although, I did miss some of the characters that appear later. I love Eve and Roarke. They are such an interesting couple even from the beginning. I will continue reading them in order now just to catch all the stuff I missed!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Delighted to have this book!! Great read for J.D. Robb fans. I missed her earlier books when I began to read the \\"In Death Books\\" so I am starting at the beginning where Eve & Roarke met. Just bought books 1 thru five. All were a great read. Hope to purchase # 6 thru 10 of this series. Aline Jones/Alabama"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Just finished reading Naked in Death and now that I have, I'm not sure why I waited so long to start this series. I won't recap the plot etc., as I'm reviewer #199, but the characters of Eve and Roarke are well fleshed out in the introductory book and you can tell that there is a lot of room for character development and growth.The book takes place about fifty or sixty years in the future, but Robb does not go overboard with the science fiction aspects. The futuristic aspects are so well integrated into the story that you accept them easily without the jar of strangeness that sometimes permeates books that try to seem sci-fi or paranormal and are not well written.If you've been curious about the In Death series, I'd start right here at the beginning."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I've seen these books in the stores and had no idea what they were about. I've read some Nora Roberts, but i didn't follow her. I think that will change now under J.D. Robb. Eve is cool, and i've read characters like her but i see that this book was first published in 1995 when i was 7 or 8. I didn't realize right away that the story takes place in the mid 21st century. And how cool it is i can see a great imagination from the author. Weird that prostitution is legal lol. There are disturbing elements with the characters especially Eve when she has that nightmare near the end sad. And finding the real killer in the end. Roakre is sexy and mysterious, but filthy rich. I guess rich guys with the somewhat poor girl like Eve are interesting. I got alot of catching up to do i can't believe how many books are in this series."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"This book got me hooked on Dallas and Roarke. The way the book is written, you can picture everything. Great book and series. Looking at our newest technology, I can see that a lot of the \\"gadgets\\" J.D. Robb writes about in 2056 and on will come to pass."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Thanks to the posters on Amazon's Fantasy Forums, I got introduced to Eve Dallas. She was recommended by more than one poster as one of the best heroines in fantasy. Okay, technically Robb's novels are mysteries with a science fiction angle.Eve Dallas is a cop in the near future. She's tough, but she's got a tender side that manifests in nightmares over a case gone bad. She thinks she's off the streets and headed to get a Psych referral when she gets a top security case. It seems, the daughter of a US Senator has been killed in a brutal and sexual manner. When she arrives on the scene, she realizes the victim is one in six.\\"Naked\\" is a great start to the series. It's well-written. Robb really knows how to hook a reader. I like Eve Dallas and her world. I feel strong sympathy for the victims, particularly the second girl, Lola.My reasons for not giving this book 5 stars is my objection to Dallas sleeping with a suspect during the course of the investigation and the fact that I figured out the murderer pretty quickly in the game. Knowing 'whodunit' didn't stop me from reading the rest to find out how he got caught. I spoke to a reader further down the series than I am and was told the mystery element improves as the stories go on. I'm looking forward to that!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I didn't think I'd like it, but it wasn't bad. A friend wanted me to give it a try, because the Eve Dallas books are her favorite series. Nora Roberts/JD Robb is a talented writer in that she develops likable characters, manages a dynamic plot, and paces it successfully enough to create a page-turner. She's a best-seller for those very reasons.The things I didn't like about the book are as follows:- I'm very annoyed by shifting points of view. I want a consistent narrator within scenes, not what he feels, what she thinks, what he wants, what she wants, etc. Sometimes Roberts was switching between three characters in three paragraphs.- Despite the fact that this is a futuristic thriller, we only know that it's futuristic because she tells us. There is no futuristic ambiance, there is no proposal for challenging inventions or lifestyle changes other than standard near-future sci-fi tropes. It seems that the risks of futuristic forecasting were too challenging, so her murder used the motives of present-day killers - the familiar which took the potency away from the futuristic setting.When I need a quick read for entertainment only, I'd consider reading another. I hope in subsequent books, Roberts and Eve Dallas don't fear the future, but embrace it.- CV Rick"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"This book introduces the reader to the world of Eve Dallas, Futuristic police detective living on a war-torn planet Earth.

Writing as JD Robb, she didn't let me down. In Eve Dallas she has again created a wonderful female lead with all the flaws and passions of modern women, I love that her characters aren't dumb. I also love her enigmatic leading men. JD (Nora) writes in a seductive and lyrical manner with strong storylines and characters of depth, this novel had me rushing to buy the rest of the series, so I could follow Eve and Roarke on their escapades. Well done JD Robb, this was a page turner."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Nora Roberts has once again outdone herself in the Eve Dallas series! Sometimes her books seem rushed and cookie-cutter type writing, but she always hits the mark as J.D. Robb. I own every one and re-read them from time to time. In this installment, Eve Dallas looses none of her edge, her husband, Roarke, is ever sexy, and the future's gadgets are all (as Eve's best friend would say)&quot;mag&quot;. The pace is fast and the story is good. I invite everyone who likes Romance with wonderful doses of adventure to read ALL of the J.D. Robb books!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"First book in series. Very good story. Takes place in the future which makes it a little different from other detective stories."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Nothing new in this story, fast read. J..D. probably cranked this out on a weekend. Last one I will read from this author."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Naked in Death is another success for J.D. Robb. The continuing saga between Eve and Roarke never loses it's interest. It's amazing how possible this story could be. I can never wait for the next installment. J.D Robb (Nora Roberts) is an excellent author who never disappoints!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Love the book! Well written, has suspense and romance. You fall in love with all her main characters especially lieutenant Eve."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I have never read a book by Nora Roberts....and of course J.D. Robb is her pin name...but I've never really enjoyed the straight up romance novels....even though I read them from time to time. I liked this book though because we do have that element of romance but it was mixed in with the whole futuristic crime drama. The thing with these kind of books is I always, always know who did it from the moment they enter the scene. I just find it so obvious, but I do like the journey of getting there, especially with all the twists and turns that get thrown in. I hated all the typos, this book has been out sense...1995 you'd think they would have gone through and fixed a few of them...and there are some obvious ones, and they just take you out of the moment. I liked Roarke, I know a lot of people don't like that alpha male great at everything type of guy, but I like the chemistry between Roarke and Eve. Eve is the type of girl that doesn't need a man and Roarke is the type who isn't used to the word no...So, it was fun to see them open up. I will have to get more of these books soon, because I flew through this one, I didn't want to put it down."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Love the J.D. Robb books. I think they would make a great movie or tv series. This is the eighth time I have read this book. I have read every one in the series at least once and most multiple times. Eve Dallas is my hero."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I had avoided this series after trying some of Nora Roberts romances. As a result, I didn't even know this series took place in the future until I started reading it. It's a fairly conservative view of the future not a lot of fantastical star trek elements in this one. The main character was interesting, as was the mystery. I might read more of these, although after reading the blurb for the second book, I'm not in a hurry to read it."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"From the moment I started to read until the very end, this novel kept my complete attention!!! I simply LOVE J.D. Robbs writing!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I could not remember the first book nor find it from JD Robb. I am having so much fun reading the 1st one again when Roark met Dallas. I have all her books but this one so I am really enjoying it."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I would recommend this series to anybody who loves getting involved with the characters in a book. I've read this book a few times now and am glad to get it on my Kindle so I don't have to worry about the spine falling apart!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"This book is one of the first ones she wrote. Very good- I loved it! And again I passed it on to one of my coworkers that is reading JD Robb as well."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I first read this 10 yrs. Ago and have read every book in this series. So I'm starting over. This is one of her best series ever. Love these books."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"This is the first book that introduces you to the slightly futuristic world of Eve Dallas - NYPSD (NYPD to us) homocide detective.

Exceptional writing and I can't wait to read more!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"J D Robb as always wrote a great book. Lt. Eve Dallas and Roarke are always intriguing in everything they do.

These are a must read and never get old!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"This bood kept me guessing the whole time. I love Rourke!!!! He is so sexy!!! the chemistry between him and Eve is seering!!! Keep them coming!! I CAN'T GET ENOUGH!!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"All of Robb's books are a must have in my Library. I can hardly wait for her next book to release!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"i enjoyed Naked in death. In terms of what it promises and delivers there is very good congruence. The characters were stereotypical and the plot predictable, but then again I wasn't looking for a challenging read. The one thing I don't understand is why the book is set in a 'science fiction' future that isn't really that much of science fiction? There was not any new technology introduced to solve the case, really, and the science fiction part felt gimmicky, as if the author isn't aware of what the genre really should offer. Instead of contributing to the plot, characters or storytelling, the clumsy attempts to incorporate the science fiction distracted from the writing."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I picked up this book because I was looking for something light to read and Sabrina from About Happy Books mentioned it as one of her favorite series. I'd never read anything by Nora Roberts and this was more of a mystery series so I thought it'd be a fun read. All I knew going in was that it was about a female police officer and her husband.Once I read the synopsis and started the book I realized it was also somewhat science fiction because it's set in the future. Also, in the first book, Eve and Roarke haven't met and certainly aren't married. But my knowing they marry later on in the series wasn't exactly a spoiler as it's obvious he's the main male character and they'll end up together.As far as readability and entertainment value, this book is perfect if you're looking for light, escapist reading. I liked the extra element the futuristic setting added and it made it more interesting than if I chose to read a novel set in present day. The book also had a bit of a formulaic feel to it, almost like I was watching one of those hour long cop shows, which is nice when you want something familiar.However my biggest problem with the book was the portrayal of the two main characters. I've seen several people claiming that Eve is a strong heroine but I couldn't agree with that. Yes, she's a police officer who is physically strong and capable of protecting herself. But she's also emotionally closed off from people, doesn't let others in, has problems sleeping, and doesn't seem to want any help overcoming her traumatic past. Plus she lets Roarke bully her and doesn't stand up for herself when he ignores her wishes.And many tout Roarke as the perfect guy who's so charming and romantic but I found him to be inconsiderate and abusive. He tells Eve what to do and, if she refuses, uses physical force to make her do what he wants, often under the guise of it being what's best for her. In one scene they're about to become intimate and Eve pulls back, saying, \\"This isn't going to happen.\\" \\"The hell it isn't,\\" he says back. A few sentences later, Eve observes that he's unlike the men who negotiate when they want something. Instead, he just takes what he wants.In another scene he commands her to sit down and \\"in a sudden fury, he [takes] her shoulders, [and pushes] her into a chair.\\" Later, he offers her a drink but she refuses because she's on duty. He cuts her off with a \\"vicious eruption\\" and commands her to, \\"Drink, goddamn it, or I'll pour it into you.\\"And on two occasions he lets himself into her apartment building without her permission. He even indicates that he's explored her apartment but didn't go into her bedroom and his decision was based on \\"not so much respect for her privacy as it was the challenge she presented that provoked him to discover her from the woman alone rather than her surroundings.\\"So it was scenes and dialogue like that which put me off both characters, Roarke for treating Eve so badly and Eve for just letting him do it. I don't know how they end up falling in love or how so many readers claim Roarke is romantic and the perfect guy. Just because he's rich and handsome doesn't mean he should be able to get away with all that he does.I finished the book hoping it'd get better or there would be some explanation for all the things I disliked. Unfortunately that didn't happen and while I liked solving the mystery behind the crimes, I wasn't sad when the book ended. I don't plan on reading any further in the series (the 35th book was recently released) because it's just not for me."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"This is a very good protective cover for your Kindle. It remains in place while ou are reading and prevents damage from drops and knocks."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I just finished my first J.D. Robb (Nora Roberts) book and am I hooked.

I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO READING THE OTERS IN THE SERIES &amp; AS WITH ALL HER OTHER BOOKS, THEY WLL BE SUPERB AS WELL!!!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I could complain about the stereotypical junk in this book. The \\"tough as nails\\" cop that \\"truly cares\\", vacillating between steely eyed stares and crying \\"oh the humanity\\" at the violence she sees. And I could go on and on about how every man in the book is either a complete evil jerk except for two: Her assistant, who is ok because he does whatever she tells him to, and mister perfect, the billionaire who chases her around like a lost puppy.But let's move on to why I'm really writing. The money. At one point in the story it's a big deal that a guy spent $25,000 four times to shell out $100,000. That's a lot of money!In 1995.But the story takes place in 2058. Assuming 4% inflation per year that's about $2100 a time. Not really the \\"smoking gun\\" the characters make it sound like. This changes it from \\"that's more money than he makes in a year!\\" to \\"that's enough money to buy a decent used car!\\""},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"The book started off ok but then the reader discovers that Eve, the main character, is plagued by a very violent crime involving a little girl. Without giving too much away, I just found myself as a reader having a hard time getting past this point. It seems to me that the crime involving this child was ultra violent and something that did not need to be fictionalized for a book. Nora Roberts is a creative person who could have come up with a myriad of crimes that could have been just as effective in terms of a catalyst for a novel and a main character."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"While I love all the \\"In Death\\" books, this one is probably my favorite. It is really great for people who love mysterys, female leads but find that some books don't keep their attention. This series will have you up at four in the morning angry that the stores aren't open so you can get the next one. It will please everyone. For those who like romance there is a great story between Eve and Rorke and the promise for more to come, while those who aren't into the relationship aspect it will seem the romance part flies by because the story of them getting together adds more depth to the charactors. This book will satisfy everyone."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"The first book of the &quot;...In Death&quot; series is great. The whole series is wonderful. Well crafted with a sharp cast of characters and plots that are thick and scenes that are tense. These are page turners, and &quot;Naked In Death&quot; is sure to get you hooked. The premise may detour some readers, but don't let it. Yes, it is set in 2058, but it is not Sci-Fi. It's barely the future at all! There are some nifty gadgets, sure, but they are not so far-fetched as to be unrelatable. Robb does an excellent job of creating a past (our future) for her characters and their country. Very believable and interesting. Legalized prostitution? Kinda. A gun ban? Yep. Wealth and Politics? Some things never change. See what happens when you mix them all together. Eve Dallas is a tough detective and an intriguing protagonist. You'll laugh, I promise, and you'll be sucked into the story from the first murder."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I think this was a wonderful first book to an exciting series.I started with this book and the next thing I know I've finished all the books in this 8+ book series.I am holding on to my seat for the next book by J.D.Robb."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"My main complaint about this book (or series) is that the futuristic setting adds little; in fact, Nora Roberts' sci-fi elements seem to come more from The Jetsons than from current projections of the coming century. (For example -- flying cars and extensive space travel/colonization are both staples of old-style sci-fi, but are very unlikely to occure in the next half century). Eve Dallas could have been written in the present day and it would have worked as well.But speaking of Eve, I'm afraid she's about as stereotypical as they come. She's sharp as a tack; she's tough as nails; she's so dedicated to her job that she pays no attention to her personal appearance -- yet she's so gorgeous and sexy that every man she meets wants her. She's her own person -- except when she meets Roarke, then she seems more than willing to subjugate herself to him (but that's okay, because she's doing so voluntarily, you see -- she's still her own person and still in control of the situation. Because she's tough and capable... hmm, I'm starting to repeat myself). Even her name is hokey: \\"Eve\\" = pure woman, sexy; \\"Dallas\\" = tough, streetwise, perfect cop name.Then there's the writing style; I found it distracting that it's written in third person with insight into Eve's mind -- yet it slips from time to time into Roarke's mind.All this makes it sound as if I hate the book and the series. I don't, I think they're reasonably entertaining. You just can't take it very seriously."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"It's such a delight when you find an author who brings a novel perspective to old tales, especially when you can share them with your spouse! J. D. Robb's Lt. Eve Dallas is just such a series.The writing is fast, fluent & funny; the characters are feisty & interesting, & the source of the stories, murder & mayhem, have a different twist as they are set in 2058 in the dire straits of a future America, primarily in New York City & East Washington, (DC no longer exists), & a few off-world locations.The IN DEATH series crosses several genres: Police Drama, Romance, Suspense & Science Fiction. J. D. Robb has extrapolated the trends she sees today into a world where the chasm between the \\"haves\\" & \\"have-nots\\" is the difference between real coffee & the slop offered by Auto-Chefs. Where transportation & living quarters are space age as are the tools, toys & drugs, music, mores & fashion. Where the laws & politics will have you despairing & giggling, in the same paragraph.Rebeccasreads highly recommends the IN DEATH series as thoughtful, engaging & tasty reading candy"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"THIS WAS MY FIRST BOOK BY J D ROBB AKA NORA ROBERTS AND I CANNOT WAIT TO GET MY HANDS ON THE NEXT BOOK. EVE AND ROARKE ARE A GREAT COUPLE AND I LIKE THE IDEA OF GETTING TO KNOW THE CHARACTERS IN THE BOOKS TO FOLLOW. GOOD MYSTERY AND HARD TO PUT DOWN. THE FUTURISTIC PART ADDS TO IT BUT IT DOES NOT TAKE AWAY FROM THE MYSTERY, JUST ADDS ANOTHER ELEMENT TO THE STORY."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"After hearing such great things about the &quot;In Death&quot; series by Roberts AKA Robb, I finally bit the bullet and purchased the unabridged audio version. Well, I guess I was expecting a bit more than her normal romance novels, because I found the 'suspense and mystery' rather lacking. Eve was a nice enough character if a tad predictable... (Hard-boiled tomboyish female cop who can't dress, can't cut her hair and is so messed up she can't sleep at night...Oh... And lets not forget the disdain of doctors and shrinks...Hmmmm... This is probably the most overused cop stereotype around). Enter Roarke, the supposed chief 'suspect.' This is where the novel became hokey. After establishing the fact that Eve is tough, hard-nosed and without mercy, she instantly falls head over heels for an Irish &quot;Bill Gates&quot; despite the fact that he is so pushy arrogant and annoying I wanted to scream... Oh...And lets not forget to have sex, during the middle of a gruesome murder investigation. Yeah right.While this story started out okay, it quickly got bogged down with a silly romance between Eve and Roarke which should have cost her her badge. I wish Eve at LEAST had the dignity and restraint to refuse involvement with Roarke until this investigation was over. No such luck. Silly.I found Naked to be an average read with momentary elements of brilliance. What ruined it for me was Roarke, who was too superhuman to be believed, and the 'mystery' which wasn't really much of a mystery at all."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"NAKED IN DEATH is a high paced, sexy thriller and it is sure to interest romance and mystery readers alike. This is a very fast paced who done it story. It is the first in the \\"Death series\\" by this author and I have already ordered the rest of the series.The relationship between Eve and Roarke is the backbone of this series. When they're together, sparks fly. Highly intelligent and strong-willed, they're also vulnerable, both with a dark past that they haven't completely overcome.This futuristic series gets better with each book. The plots are totally believable. This is a MUST READ!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I loved this book! I was reluctant to start this series because I'd tried to read a couple romantic suspense novels by Nora Roberts and hadn't liked them enough to finish them. I figured this would turn out to be the same. However, I couldn't put this book down. Because this is a series, the pace of the development of the characters is slower and more realistic than in the romance novels Nora Roberts usually writes. It never felt like the relationship developing between Roarke and Eve was forced or tacked on. I know some people often feel that the mystery element of the In Death books is fairly predictable, but, for the most part, I don't feel that way. I'm not a regular mystery reader, so that may be part of it, but the mystery in Naked in Death did keep me guessing. It wasn't, however, just the mystery in this book that kept me reading - Roarke and Eve's relationship is interesting, and both characters have things about them and their pasts that the author only hints at in this book."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"from the nora roberts i love. because of all the hype surrounding this book by all those i know that read and love nora roberts, i was expecting something wonderful, but didnt really find it. the story itself is good, but i found myself confused at times as to what was going on and why things were included. eve is a spunky cop with a major attitude. roarke is a well to do who seems far out of eves league, but thru the magic of writting, they end up together trying to solve this case. i will more than likely read the following books in this series because i have them, but if i only had this one in my to be read pile, i doubt i would pick up the next in the series."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I have read a few of the death books out of order and am now trying to read them in order.

My first In Death book was given to me in 2011 and started in the middle of the series. I was intrigued enough in the how and why of Dallas and Roarke's meeting to go back and start at the beginning. And because with all of the interaction between so many of the main characters it's fun to find out how the relationships began and why they continue to evolve. I've already picked up the next several books in the series and am certain I will find them as enjoyable as the first. Great job of writing J. D. Robb."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I really like Eve, the heroine in the \\"In Death\\" series. She was very smart, fearless and dedicated to fighting crime. Having suffered sexual abuses in her past, she had built a fortress around her emotions and the author was effective in portraying her that way, reflected in the way she spoke and handled situations. Chemistry between Eve and Roarke was great and Roarke was so sweet and patient with Eve. The crime in this book was quite dark."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"This is the first in a series of books that I just love to read... and read and read.

Eve and Roarke are great together."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I'm starting to read th J.D.Robb series and they are wonderful. Finally a series that lets you grow with the characters. Sometimes when you finish a book you ask your self I wonder what they are doing now? Eve and Roarke are such an special couple, Eve working through the emotional mine field of marriage and a loving relationship with her demanding career Roarke being supportive and loving her just the way she is. Though J.D Robbs has made Roarke a man of means through the books that the greatest wealth Eve receives from him is the emotional and loving understanding he gives her. The other charaters i.e like Peabody ,Maris just adds the story lines that you can't wait for the next book to come along and see how they are doing and hope that Eve finally gets over her nightmares of her childhood. I have always enjoyed Nora Roberts Books and as J.D Robbs she is now on my list of books that are to keep and to read over and over again. If you in to a romance with a good who done it this is the author for you. I promise if you read one of these books you'll look around for the next one!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Naked in Death is a fun, sexy and thrilling beginning to a great series that combines the romance, witty dialogue, strong characters, and neo-futuristic whodunit into one book.

I love mystery novels but there are always parts of them I get bored with; to technical or repetitive. But, this series is not only attention-getting it keeps it till the last page.

Its a buy you won't regreat."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Nora Roberts has done it again, this futuristic series is so fun! All you huge Nora Roberts fans out there, JD Robb is just as good! Would recommend reading the series in order, as it helps you to understand the characters better, but not necessary. There's an introduction that gives you some background on the book before it! Great buy!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I've read many of Nora Roberts other books but had never gotten around to starting the &quot;in Death&quot; series. As soon as I picked it up I was hooked. I love the switch on focus from romance to mystery. Besides the great story line the details of how the future has a lot of the same problems we have today were great. The point where Eve Dallas' Autochef burnt her toast was a high point for me. I really enjoyed the chracter of Eve Dallas because it's not often you read of female cops and her constant professional attitude was great. Would recomend this series to any Nora Roberts fans."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Why I Read this Book: The In Death series is the #1 series that gets recommended to me the most. I had not read anything by Nora Roberts so I wasn't exactly sure what to expect. But all this talk about the infamous Roarke and his relationship with Eve got me curious. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy Naked in Death as much as I had hoped.What I Liked: The futuristic elements were interesting. The book is set in 2058 (the book was first written in 1995 so it was originally a 60+ years look into the future). Most people drink fake coffee since the real stuff is hard to come by and is quite expensive. Same goes with flowers. Guns are outlawed and prostitution is legal.I love crime solving reads and TV shows and I enjoyed it in Naked in Death. I don't know what it is about forensics but it fascinates me. The suspect in this book wasn't the obvious choice and I liked that it wasn't predictable; it was a bit complex of a case. There was a personal, yet sad, connection for Eve with this case. It made sense why she was so affected by this particular case.What I Didn't Like: I wasn't buying the Eve/Roarke relationship. It was a big disappointment for me. Roarke came on really strong and Eve was so resistant. I wasn't feeling the connection or the attraction, especially from Eve's POV. The relationship felt extremely one sided. Roarke seems to be more of a guy with connections than a lover. And Roarke was a little too carefree about things. Hopefully in the next book I'll feel more of a connection between them. I don't know how it going to work out for Eve and Roarke. Actually, I know the end result because I inadvertently saw a spoiler when I was reading about the author on Wikipedia but I don't know how it gets to that point.I wasn't expecting such a dark read with grim subject matter. Naked in Death for those with a weak stomach. There was rape, child abuse, and incest. *shivers*Overall Impression: With all the recommendations I got for this series, I had set the bar kind of high and unfortunately Naked in Death didn't quite meet my expectations. Now don't get me wrong, I liked the book. I enjoyed reading it. But I didn't LOVE it. I know I'm in the minority by saying that; this seems to be a favorite series among readers. I had heard about the infamous and sexy Roarke but I just didn't see it. I'm still undecided in regards to this series. I'll give it one, maybe 2 more books, before deciding to continue on or throw in the towel. I have to admit that I find long series, especially one 30+ books deep, a bit daunting."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"So, I finally broke down and read the first \\"In Death\\" book by Nora Roberts. Seems like every romance site on the web just LOVES these books (and Nora Roberts in general) so I thought I'd give it a try when I saw a used copy at my local (and FABULOUS) bookstore. Especially since I'm now committed to the Summer of SFR.I'd tried one Nora Roberts book before (Carnal Innocence) and I watched 3 out of the 4 TV movies that were adaptations of her work last year on Lifetime. And I must say I have noticed a pervasive trend towards incest and rape in her work. Really graphic, really horrifying. More often than not, it's more than I would want to sign up for. I knew the In Death books continued this theme (like a LOT), but I figured if I totally loved the characters I might want to put up with it.So, what was my final verdict you ask? Well, Naked in Death was actually pretty good. I enjoyed it more than Carnal Innocence for sure.Fair warning: the In Death books are so famous and have been out for so long, that I'm not really worrying about spoilers as far as the romantic relationship goes.Naked in Death is the first in the massive In Death series starring Eve Dallas and her (eventual) husband Roarke (you know, like Madonna). Eve is a police lieutenant with a dark and mysterious past, and an almost religious devotion to serving the Law. The series is set in a near-future world where prostitutes are legal, real coffee is extremely rare, and all firearms have been banned.So, when a dead prostitute is found brutally gunned down in her own apartment, Eve goes looking for a man rich enough to own such an expensive and prized antique as a handgun-- and ruthless enough to use it on an unarmed naked woman. Someone like the multi-millionaire Roarke. As Eve pursues leads in the case, she finds herself drawn against all her good sense to the searingly handsome and preternaturally charming Roarke-- even though he's still a suspect.I liked the hero, Rourke, a lot. He had great banter with Eve. He really is a prototypical, Alpha-male sex-bomb. I loved that he keeps Eve's button as a souvenir. That was adorable, and it was a lovely character touch when he sent Eve coffee instead of flowers. I totally wouldn't mind a tumble on that big floating bed of his.He makes for a VERY attractive and charming hero. He's obviously one of the reasons this series is so popular.Oddly enough, his all-around awesomeness was actually a bit of a problem for me at times. It was one of those cases where he was so rich, so handsome (almost ridiculously so in both cases), he could have any woman he wanted, so why was he with the police detective who's not that pretty and kept pushing him away?I guess I'm not a fan of the 'She's the only woman who's ever said no to him, which makes him fall for her' trope. That wasn't exactly the case here, but it was close enough to bother me a little. It just felt like they were Roarke's feelings for Eve moved at warp-speed, and I didn't necessarily see the justification for that in their interactions.Also, there was a bit too much police procedural for me at times, which made the plot lag. The humor was great, though. Really funny at parts. I did like the banter between Rourke and the heroine, Eve, and the secondary characters were fairly well-drawn and interesting-- especially Eve's boss and her partner. The writing itself was really smooth too.One aspect of the book that really shone for me was the near future world-building. It was excellent, subtle, with some clever touches like the handgun ban and the value of real coffee. I also thought the logistics of widespread legalized prostitution were well-thought out and convincing. I also liked how the concept of space stations and space travel was so subtly alluded to, it was as commonplace as the coffee.I knew going into this that it would be a fairly violent book and, as expected, there was lots of the disturbing stuff here. Incest. LOTS of rape. Children being killed horribly. And I know from reviews the rest of the series has more of the same. So, ultimately, although this book really was very good, I don't think I want to sign up for thirty more books of that.Overall, Naked in Death is a really solid book. Great characters, engaging plot, well-written with great world-building. I can totally see why Nora Roberts sells so many books. And yet, unfortunately, the violence is such I just can't see myself becoming a big fan of hers or reading any of the other In Death books (or even re-reading NID).But, if you think you can handle the levels of violence and gore in this series I do highly recommend it for the writing and the characters.Grade: B+"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"After reading the glowing reviews for this book, I was eager to read it. Unfortunately, from the beginning I realized that it was not, for me, going to live up to the hype at all. I kept thinking something drastic would happen to make it worthy of its 4.5 star rating, but it never did.I found the \\"cop with the tough exterior and painful past, who just needs someone to break through her shell\\" to be very cliche.I felt that it was incredibly cheesy in parts and on more than one occassion, I found myself rolling my eyes and saying \\"oh, please.\\"Not only that, but I found some glaring typos. Bad editor!Lastly, the sometimes graphic pedophilia and incest, added for shock value, did not make the book better. It works great for a writer like Stephen King, but not as well for Robb.I give it three stars because it did sort of keep my interest, but I still found it mediocre. Sorry!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"\\"Naked in death\\" is the 1st book in J.D.Robb's \\"In death series\\". The action takes place in N. York (USA), in the year 2058. Obviously, many things are different (more technology, some weapons are outlawed, prostitution is legal), but others are not. One of the things that doesn't change is that even in the future there are murderers, and policemen to take them to jail.Our main character is Lt. Eve Dallas, a homicide detective in Manhattan very good at her job of \\"standing for the dead\\", and who dedicates herself totally to her job in order to avoid her past. She is also averse to having a meaningful relationship with anybody, because she doesn't want to be vulnerable again.However, one of her criminal investigations (the gruesome murder of a licenced companion, who happens to be related to a very powerful senator) leads her to a suspect that she cannot help but being attracted to. That is Roarke, a stunningly handsome billionaire with a shady past, who is the main suspect in her criminal case. The victim knew him, was murdered in one of his buildings, with a weapon he could have had access to (he has a collection of antique guns). She tries to maintain objectivity, but Roarke won't allow her to do that, as he is also incredibly attracted to this stubborn detective with one weakness: real coffe.What will happen? Will Eve be able to stop the murderer, who has promised to kill 5 more licenced companions? And is Roarke innocent? The answers to this and a lot more can be found in this book. I'm rather sure you will love it, because it has both mystery and romance, an intelligent plot and characters you end up delighting in.

Not one that I would ever reread or one that makes me want to read the next one in the series. It could have interested me except for two things. One: there's lots of graphic sex and a description of sexual child abuse that I found very disturbing. Two: the writer has an agenda. The bad guys are \\"Conservatives\\" who want to give everyone guns, stop prostitution, and take everyone back to the horrible 21st century by forcing their \\"morality\\" on everyone. This was repeated over and over again in the book. Eve keeps going on and on about how horrible it was when everyone had guns, and people were shot by guns, and how violent guns are, and how much better everything is now that no one is allowed to have a gun. Oddly enough, she is a homicide cop whose last case was a horrific child murder done with a knife. But knives are okay.

The writing is competent, the characterizations sharp, the future world rang true and the mystery was involved. Yet, after the first couple of chapters, I had to force myself to turn the pages. This is a gritty &quot;real-life&quot; kind of mystery with lots of gorey descriptions and profanity. The romance is very background to the story and has almost no development. The characters actually only meet a handful of times during the story and most of their time together involves sex. The mystery wansn't bad, but I found it hard to get past the unbelievableness of Roarke as a suspect. I mean this guy is the richest man in the Universe which should have made him untouchable, plus he has no real connection to the murders. To make matters worse, we find out at the very beginning of the book that he is not the murder, so the edge that should have been their is missing and our brillant heroine comes off as a giant dope for suspecting him. I guess, I was expecting more tension, with all kinds of subtle clues being dropped that it is him, while the heorine is torn by her attraction to him and her fear that she will be his next victim. Hey that sounds like a good plot, maybe I'll go write it.

No real coffee unless you were rich because our generation [give or take a decade] destroyed all the rain forests? No guns for Americans? Figures. This book not only proves that theory wrong - criminals don't follow laws & they will ALWAYS have guns - it goes to show that if the female victims had weapons [and proper training] they could have defended themselves & wouldn't have to rely on cops who get there too late with THEIR guns to save them. [Why do you think no other country in modern times has tried to take over America? Because they know many Americans have weapons!]In 2058: -Females are referred to as sir.-Eve runs after disembarking from a shuttle because she's in a hurry & a computor yells at her - in public - and tells her - a grown woman - not to run.-A cold bottle or glass of Pepsi is refreshing but a 'tube' of Pepsi sounds disgusting.-A yellow light flashes on the wall of Eve's parking spot at her home, a warning to her [and everyone else passing by] that her payment on the space is late. If the light turns red, a barricade engages.-Sending 'real roses' was considered 'old-fashioned etiquette.'And last but not least- Senator DeBlass is a Right Wing Conservative Republican - meaning, he's evil for any number of reasons. Truthfully, Roarke would more likely be a Conservative, too.There's a group DeBlass helps fund called 'Moral Values,' and the liberals here call it an 'extremist group,' but as we know, liberals are intolerant if your opinion differs from theirs.Eve & her coworkers refer to the people of East Washington as 'paranoid since the terrorist hit.' Feeney says, \\"Couple dozen legislators get whacked, and they never forget it.\\" My question is, \\"Why would they forget something so horrific?\\"As for Eve & Roarke, I don't think they were compatable at all. He was the epitome of elegance & class and she was quite the opposite. Their differences could have been a good thing, but Eve was too unlikable. Roarke deserved better, frankly, than to have a foul-mouthed, standoffish, crude woman who chopped her own hair rather than get a quick professional cut and didn't care one iota about her overall appearance. Clothes didn't have to be expensive to look nice! Did she think 'acting like a man' to use the cliche, was the only way she could fit in? Roarke was proof that not all men act that way.I don't think I could read even one more of this series if Eve is the main character."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"In New York there's a lieutenant name Eve Dallas that's unique in her line of work with years of experience and she's paired up with a former partner name Feeney.

There's about a billion books out in the series. What if I ended up loving it? Then I have to commit myself to buying those billion books just to catch up! But after hearing such glowing things about this series from most of my Goodreads friends--especially about Roarke--I had to finally bight the bullet and get the first book.Now that I've finished it I don't know whether to cheer or comfort my wallet. I think I'm going to have to run to the bookstore and swoop up a bunch of the next books in the series so I can get my glom on.I didn't connect with Roarke the way that most readers seem to, but I expect it comes with time. The relationship and attraction in this book develops pretty quickly--faster than I expected or wanted--but I can't say I expected any different seeing as this isn't actually a Romance series. Most of the focus was on the case with the romance as the side story. Luckily, I know there's plenty of time in this series for the author to develop their relationship.It's no hardship for me to watch their relationship develop over the course of the books since I know that they are together and the author didn't throw any retarded love triangles in there. So I'm willing to be patient and won't complain about the lack of a lot of depth to the relationship and characters yet.It was odd for me to read a book so similar, yet different, from Nora Roberts's usual style. The characterization, interactions, feel to the developing relationship, and writing felt the same, but the focus wasn't on the romance. I liked it. It's nice to find a new series by this author that I can glut myself on. I was a little nervous that her style would be completely different under the pseudonym, but it wasn't where it counted.The details about all the little futuristic gizmos weren't really explained in depth. Everything was mentioned matter-of-factly like talking to someone already familiar with the technology and world. I think some will dislike that, but I honestly preferred it. I don't mind if authors want to explain, but a detailed explanation about how the spray that seals in oils and fingerprints works is not something I personally need to know. The way it was all presented worked for me.The case (and Eve's background) really tugged at my heartstrings. I thought it was handled well by the author, but I still feel helplessly enraged to know stuff like that happens constantly.I really enjoyed seeing our timeframe discussed and researched for the case. It was fun to see the differences between that time and this one and it provided a nice opportunity for me to see where their culture differed without huge infodumps.Now to go get my hands on Glory in Death..."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I see that a lot of readers have fallen head over heels for this book, which is a part of my reason for writing.While this book is a fine way of spending a few hours of your time if you have nothing better to do, I was desperately hoping for more depth to the characters.

AS JD Robb, she writes a futuristic mystery/suspense series featuring Lieutenant Eve Dallas and billionaire Roarke.Naked in Death is the first in the series- it takes place many years into the future (2058). It is fascinating to see how much things have advanced- the future is full of technology, rules/regulations, legalized prostitution and contraband luxuries. But even with all these advancements, there is still murder.Eve is investigating a serial killing and she finds out that she is falling for one of the main suspects, Roarke. The serial killer is targeting prostitutes and using outlawed guns to make his point. The investigation is complicated by the fact that one of the victims is connected to a very influential political family. That family, and Eve herself, have secrets to keep hidden--secrets that have to be uncovered to stop the killerNaked in Death introduces Eve and Roarke and their complex relationship. As a couple, they are compelling and have definate chemistry. Despite the killings and Eve's past, they manage to begin their relationship which will progress in the books that follow and continue the series.The plot of the book is fast paced. The ending conclusion and revelation of the murderer comes as a surprise. Naked in Death is a great start to the Death series."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Naked in Death is the first in a series set in 2058. The security is more sophisticated; droids take care of the mundane tasks, interplanetary travel is the norm, etc; however, murder still has to be solved one clue at a time. The new heroine is Lt. Eve Dallas and the murder of a \\"licensed\\" prostitute is a code five which means that she must keep her findings classified.The first prostitute to die is the granddaughter of a high profile senator...the whole family is high profile and self important. The second and third prostitutes to die are apparently less important and not related to each other. EXCEPT that the killer leaves notes saying l of 6, 2 of 6, 3 or 6, etc. One of the suspects is Roarke, the richest, and of course, most handsome men in the world. It's an unlikely alliance, but Eve and Roarke become involved leading the way to future books. The suspense is good to the end with a surpise killer.

What is it worth?An upscale prostitute Sharon DeBlass has been murdered the 20th century way. With a hand gun (they use lasers now) and with venomous intent. Sharon isn't just any prostitute; she is the granddaughter of Senator DeBlass who thinks he is as moral as they come. But is he?Roarke, wealthy entrepreneur extraordinaire, is smart and savvy and is a suspect in the case. He has an eye for Eve who tries to go by the book, but can he get past her defenses and her past?I have been meaning to read this series for years and got an opportunity to listen to the book on CD, read by Susan Ericksen. Ms. Ericksen does a convincing job with each of the characters. To me, the plot felt mainstream and I didn't find anything new there, but then the book was written over a decade ago and may have been a new market to some. The romance between Roarke and Eve was okay to bring depth to Eve's character, but it wasn't one of the better romances that I have read. Let's hope they get better in the latter books in the series. The story does contain violence and talks about rape, incest and child abuse, so be prepared for that.Overall I found the story to be fairly interesting, but not outstanding.

Robb (aka Nora Roberts) is an excellent introduction to the world of 2058 and NYPSD homicide Detective-Lieutenant Eve Dallas. New York has changed a lot in the future, at once more permissive (prostitution is legal) and repressive (pregnancy is regulated by the state). But these differences are only a backdrop to the quite interesting story of Dallas' search for a serial killer and her burgeoning relationship with Irish billionaire (and murder suspect) Roarke. Eve is a very interesting character, a very effective investigator, focused totally on the job. She has a dark past behind her that she has chosen to do her best to ignore and suppress. Roarke is fun, a man who raised himself from the gutter with not totally legal tactics to become very powerful. He retains a slightly disdainful opinion of the law and really wants thaw the icy Lieutenant.

Bravo!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Damn! I wish I hadn't done that! \\"Naked in Death\\" is the first in JD Robb's popular Death series which is now almost two dozen novels strong ... and I loved it! My pocketbook will protest and my bookshelves will be groaning under the ever increasing load as I begin the quest to accumulate the rest of the series.Eve Dallas is a lieutenant in the New York City Police Department. The story is set in 2058 - a future near enough to be entirely recognizable but far enough away that Robb can postulate some very interesting technological and cultural developments - guns have been banned; prostitution is legal and completely regulated; cars have an auto-pilot setting; VR simulations have advanced to a heart-stopping, palm-sweating, gut-wrenching reality that is light years beyond the technology we know of today; smoking is almost a thing of the past; police weaponry consists only of lasers and high powered stun guns with handguns firing real bullets available only in museums and private collections; and, would you believe it, recreational \\"hotels\\" for the &uuml;ber-wealthy are actually in continuous orbit above the earth!The murder, on the other hand, is one we are, sadly, all too familiar with - the violent, gruesome, almost ritualistic slaying of a sex trade worker, now known by the euphemism \\"licenced companion\\", which is only the first of an intended series by a serial killer. He left behind a note ... \\"ONE OF SIX\\"! This particular licenced companion, Sharon DeBlass, just happened to be the grand-daughter of a US Senator and you might well imagine the political pressure that is being brought to bear on Dallas and NYPD to solve the case. When the investigation points in the direction of Roarke, a self-made reclusive billionaire, the heat and passion in the novel is turned up a notch as Dallas finds herself in the unenviable position of falling for a man who just might be the killer she's looking for!I don't think I can give Robb top marks for the plot - the solution is just a little too predictable and can be seen a fair distance from the end of the novel. But \\"Naked in Death\\" certainly earns both thumbs well turned up in every other way - dialogue, characterization, setting, humour (the side plot about the husband's murder by Hetta Finestein, a lovable little gray haired old lady, is a positive hoot), imagination, novelty, creativity and more. And I have to hand it to Robb ... she writes a mean sex scene. Whew! They're footloose, they're well-timed, they're playful and they're enough to bring a little sheen of sweat up on your brow!Highly recommended! Romance, police procedural, mystery, science fiction ... you name it, they all fit. If you like a lightweight, easy-going enjoyable read in any of those genres, you'll enjoy \\"Naked in Death\\".Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"With so much going for it, I wanted to believe this book was better then it was.

This is a good book to pick up from the local book trader."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"The In Death series is one of my favorite books series. I just love the relationship between Eve and Roarke. I thought it was time to go back and read the first book again. It was wonderful to be re-introduced to both Eve and Roarke. I liked Eve's dedication to her job. I was less comfortable with her notion that her only value was through her job. She said, more than once, that without the job she was nothing. I liked Roarke's determination to see where the relationship with Eve would go. He was definitely the more emotionally daring of the two of them. I liked that Eve did trust Roarke and stand up for him.The mystery itself was less compelling mainly because I remembered who the criminal was. I liked the way the futuristic society was introduced without the infusion of large \\"info-dumps.\\"This was a good start to a series that grows richer and more entertaining with each additional volume. I recommend them to all readers of romantic suspense."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I've got a crush on Roarke! Oh, man, he is HOT!Okay, now, the book. J.D. Robb, pseudonym for Nora Roberts, has written a series of 25 books about Eve Dallas, the finest of New York's finest and a homicide detective, and Roarke, her incredibly rich, incredibly sexy, incredibly handsome, incredibly smart lover from Dublin. What a terrific combination!Now, we add a weird element. The setting is NYC in the year 2058. I don't really care for sci fi, but this element only makes this yummy series more appealing. The stories and people are not extreme in sci-fi weirdness, but the future brings cool new conveniences and interesting changes to their lives. People travel off-planet now and then; robots provide household services and security; cops use laser guns; cars have auto-pilot settings; prostitution is legal and regulated; and, food is supplied and prepared by machines that people stock.Eve and Roarke are two lost souls who make each other whole. Eve is so independent, good at her job, beautiful, full of compassion for victims of crimes, and emotionally needy. Roarke is so good at everything he does, particularly taking care of Eve. They fall passionately in love and simply cannot live without each other.The plot is incidental. The real story is about Eve and Roarke, and it is wonderful and fun."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"An edgy, fast paced, yet insightful novel, providing murder, police drama and romance in a futuristic setting. New York detective Eve Dallas is assigned to the murder of a high class hooker with ties to a prominent family. The investigation leads her through twists and turns and she becomes involved with Roarke, one of her suspects, making her question herself and begin to come to terms with her own mysterious past.A gripping lead in to the series."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"The main character of this book is a spineless whimp who continually throughout the book says things she doesn't mean, acts stupidly and unprofessionally and then lies about it. Roarke is an arrogant, presumptuous jerk and would be an OK hero if someone would take him down a peg. Eve is not the one to do it, as every time she says something, he overrules her (even in her choice of beverages) and she lets him do it. This would be OK, if that is the way her character was written. Instead, the author claims she is a strong-willed, independent professional woman who knows her own mind. THEN WHY DOESN'T SHE ACT LIKE IT? Why does she keep letting Rourke overrule her? Even in simple matters like eating dinner or what to drink (he does this, twice with the beverages). The author should either have Eve be a woman who likes to be submissive and not care about her career or stop having her actions so out of character. She sleeps with a suspect in a murder investigation (sounds like something my self-destructive sister would do) and then lies to her police chief by claiming he's been taken off the list of suspects. HELLO? Can we say incredibly unprofessional, risky, and not to mention, STUPID? She'd only known the man a week. The only thing that gets this book it's two star rating from me is the author's interesting vision of the future and flow of writing. Otherwise, she needs to choose different attributes for Eve. They don't mesh with her behavior. Very annoying to read."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I guess I'm going against the grain though I feel like I'm being generous with a two-star rating. Based on the other ratings I was expecting a lot more. Why two-stars? The story was incredibly predictable. I like at least a couple of twists and turns, and was hoping for a surprise ending, and..... nothing. The story was slow, way too much time on an incredibly predictable love story, (gee - tough, poor good-girl cop with a history gets incredibly wealthy, elusive, handsome guy who just can't seem to resist her - who woulda thought?!), unrealistic conversations, and not in a good fiction book way, the person who you think is the bad guy turns out to be, oh, the bad guy, too little action. I regretted the time I spent reading it and not just putting it down and instead waiting for at least a good ending. Sorry J.D., my first and only ever read of one of your books."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I was a fan of mystery novels before I stumbled upon Roberts &quot;Born In&quot; romance series. Loved the romance but by the 3rd book in the trilogy, I was pretty bored with romance alone. This series is the best thing I've ever stumbled upon. While you're enthralled in the romance, you're thinking &quot;who did it??&quot;, while you're enthralled in the mystery, you're thinking &quot;are they going to 'do' it??&quot; (ha ha). Not big in sci-fi, I could have done without the future, but it doesn't interfere enough for non-sci-fi fans, and actually adds a little flavor to the story.I cannot put these books down. I'm on the 3rd in the series, excited that there are about 15 more to go! At this pace, I'll probably have the whole series read by the end of next week!Die-hard mystery fans may be disappointed, as will die-hard romance fans.

I am not a person who thinks \\"Sex Sells\\" A Book or a Movie...and I normally avoid books with a lot of sex and bad language. They just aren't needed to entertain me. We have over indulged imaginations as it is...we don't need every detail painted in vividly graphic sensationalism.For me a Great Story Line and believable and interesting charaters are what makes for a Great Read. I loved both her plot and her characters. I just wish she didn't have to add the sex to sell an already good series. It would hold it's own with out all that.But, I WILL LEAVE FURTHER JUDGEMENT UP TO YOUR OWN PERSONAL LIKES AND DISLIKES.Happy to Review Books For Other Booklovers!So many books....so little time,peggy"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"The characters have potential, however, the end was not much of a mystery - very predictable. I cannot really recommend this book."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"This is the one that started my obsession with this series but I didn't actually like this particular story, which is ironic to me because now, many books later I can't wait for the next to be out.One of the things that drew me to the series was knowing that if I liked it, there were so many (over 30 books and counting, not including the short stories) to read after this one. And that it took place in the future.I wasn't a Nora Roberts fan, I didn't (and don't) read romance novels, my main authors are Stephen King (who's quoted in EW as liking and considering future novel in the series \\"Born in Death\\" as \\"SVU in the Future,\\" something I kind of agree with), Dean Koontz, Patricia Cornwell, John Grisham, and Faye Kellerman, and I rarely stray from them. But when they couldn't keep up with my need to read, or changed how or what they wrote about, I started looking for new authors to read.My aunt recommended this series because of it's future/mystery aspect and it interested me enough to give this first book a try. I was determined to read them in order, she insisted it didn't matter, but I've learned along the way that it does matter if the little details matter. There are small mentions of past stories (or details from past stories) in future books, so if you haven't read any in the series yet, you definitely want to start with this first one.While I didn't love the first one, I did like it enough to keep keep reading, and 30+ books later I'm reading the latest and saddened to know there will be a waiting period before I can read the next.*** slight spoiler ***I started reading these back to back and initially got annoyed by the formulaic style, Eve always needing someone (Roarke usually) to come to her rescue and usually because she couldn't just wait for backup or take someone with her to investigate. So I'd alternate with some other author to keep it fresh and eventually the formula changes and alternates so every book didn't end the same way.*** end slight spoiler ***And the characters have grown and evolved with each book so it doesn't feel like you're reading the same story over and over again. I've grown to really likethem (the characters) and look forward to reading about them in each new book.While I haven't loved every story or every aspect of every story along the way, the series as a whole has kept my attention and I've grown to really look forward to when I can read more. Always happy to hear that a new one is coming out so I hope she never tires of writing this series."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I have heard many times about the In Death series by JD Robb, but I never had the opportunity to try it out, and I was daunted by the number of books already released (35) in this series. However, one day audible had a sale, and Naked In Death was on the list, I figured I would finally give it a try. Naked in Death hooked me in with the determined detective heroine, the intrigue of a murder investigation, the futuristic world, and of course, Roarke, the hard-edged billionaire who falls for the detective.I found the setting to be quite interesting and even believable, guns are out-dated, they are collectible only, lasers are the new weapon, communication devices include video, electronics work on voice command, and there are living communities on the moon and in space. What also relates more to this story is that prostitution has been legalized an regulated. Escorts have to take classes, be licensed, and be drug free. In return, there are no pimps and prostitution is considered a profession.When a Senator's granddaughter, who is a licensed prostitute, is murdered with an old fashioned gun, Lieutenant Eve Dallas is put on the case. There are challenges, twists, turns, and Eve has to confront her own past demons to solve this case. Warning: This case involves crimes of sexual nature, and is not always easy to read. J.D. Robb does an excellent job with this book, the emotions run high and the violence and gruesomeness to the murders is not sugar coated.And then, there's Roarke. Roarke is a rich, powerful man, he has a certain mystery to him, and he connects with Eve from the beginning. Several aspects of the case originally point to Roarke as a suspect, and Eve is torn between her personal beliefs and evidence of the case. Through it, Roarke remains strong, he can put up with Eve and understand her, and I loved the dynamic between them.Naked in Death is an excellent read. I am only sad that i didn't read this book and series sooner. I loved every minute of listening to Naked in Death, and I can't wait to read more books in this series. Romance readers, if you are like me and missed this series, you are missing out! I definitely recommend reading Naked In Death.*Note on the Audio* Naked in Death was narrated by Susan Ericksen, and she did a wonderful job. Since the book is futuristic, there were even some fun sounds she had to make, and she pulled it off. I really enjoyed her narration style and will listen to more books narrated by Susan Ericksen in the future. **"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I have never had much interest in reading mysteries. I am a reader who likes my books simple but fun. I don't like having to think too much while trying to enjoy a story. Little did I know that I was wrong. After hearing so much hype around this series by J.D. Robb -- who is actually Nora Roberts -- I finally caved and decided to venture into this genre of reading. I had to see what all the fuss was about and to finally figure out what all the other people were swooning about whenever 'Roarke' was uttered in a sentence.Lt. Eve Dallas is searching for a serial killer. A killer that takes enjoyment in killing licensed prostitutes while playing mind games with the police is just the tip of the iceberg in this story. While Eve is trying to pin down who the killer is, she is also dealing with other cases, political personnel who think they are owed their undivided attention, and a suspect who is quickly becoming a person of interest in her personal life. Now granted, I guessed the killer early on but it still was a surprise to discover I was actually right! I also found that the mystery part of the book wasn't at all difficult to follow along with. The author did a wonderful job of only revealing certain things at certain times to keep the reader second guessing.Now lets talk about Roarke. Hotness has entered the pages and taken over this readers imagination! Roarke demands attention and leaves you wanting more. I couldn't wait until Roarke stepped into a scene in the book because he brings Eve to life and leaves the reader drooling. He is smart, rich, sexy and has an accent -- the ultimate reader fantasy! Eve struggles not only with personal reasons in letting Roarke into her life, but she also deals with job fallout as well when they get hot and heavy. I was cheering for Eve and Roarke the whole time and I loved how Eve finally opened up to him. I can't help but think that Eve still has a bunch of history to work out in future books involving her past. I also can't wait to learn more about Roarke's past as well.I admit that my review is a little scarce on the plot, but I am worried about giving too much away in case you haven't read it yet. I will tell you that there are some amazing side characters as well and that the main characters will keep you interested up until the end. I am now a new fan of romantic suspense that author J.D. Robb obviously knows how to write. Bring on the next book because it is going to be a fun ride to read about!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I picked this book up and read the back cover as I am alway intereste in cop mysteries. When I read that it was set in the future I wasn't sure I would like it but picked it up anyway. Wow was this book well worth the read. It is extremely well written and keeps your interest from begining to end. It is not predictable as many are. This is why I stopped reading Mary Higgens Clark as I could figure out the killer by the middle of the book. This book is a must buy if you are interest in cop mysteries as it is so well written that it makes the future believable. I couldnt put it down."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Naked in Death is the first book in a 34 book series (so far) by Nora Roberts (writing under the name \\"J.D. Robb\\"). The series is about a police officer named Eve Dallas. She is a homicide detective, she takes her work very seriously. She has a tragic past.This book concerns a case of three women who were murdered and Eve's work to find the killer and bring them to justice. As in every good mystery there are twists, turns and surprises along the way. She is romanced during this investigation by 'Roarke' a mysterious wealthy man who may or may not have something to do with her case.I was engrossed with this book while reading it. The characters were interesting and complex, the plot was realistic, and the way the story unfolded was entertaining to the reader.

Recently I decided to back track and start over at book one. I love these books and I am so happy I started over.

She is such a fantastic detective and her partner Fenney (don't know about the spelling) brings a lot to the table also. I really enjoyed watching them figuring out this case step by step. There were tons of moments where the action played out in my head. I know exactly who I would have playing Eve if it was a movie or TV Series!What I Liked: I liked that Eve had a back story that made her a better detective and made her a bit fragile. It was refreshing to see that she had faults, a quick to pull trigger with her anger, but was very solid!What made me go huh?: I am not buying Eve's and Roarke's relationship right now. It just seemed forced and all the sudden. Plus, it just didn't fit with how careful Eve seems to be. Though I am sure over the series it will work out.Audio Review: I thought Susan Ericksen did a FANTASTIC job. She was very good at bringing edginess to Eve and sexiness to Roarke!

RobbBerkley ~ July 1995Brilliance Audio ~ 2008Narrator Susan Ericksen4 Stars! ~~~ This is a futuristic murder mystery with a great cast of characters and scorching chemistry between the hero and heroine!First off, I'd like to commend the narrator, Susan Ericksen! She did a phenomenal job reading this book and kept me intrigued and riveted from the beginning. Through Ms. Ericksen's talent I was easily able to distinguish the characters as her nuances brought them alive. Now, to the story. I'm a lover of intrigue and mystery, so I'm not sure how I managed to miss this series when it first started in 1995. Just a note though, there is graphic violence. Eve Dallas is a flawed heroine whose experiences as a child weigh heavy on her as an adult. She's passionate about her job and though she is hardened by her experiences she's not totally numb like she'd prefer to be. Roarke is a perfect match for Eve. He often crosses the line of the law, but never in a sinister way. He's a bit of a rogue and a definite charmer! The love scenes are hot and the emotion though often intense, is also tender. The mystery was very well written, as were the details of the not so distant future. I'm very much looking forward to listening to book two in this series."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"i love j.d. robb i own every in death book they put in audio form. i wish it was unabridged but then you cant have it all.

I enjoy it very much every time i listen to it."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I have to admit that I wasn't really all that interested in reading these books... until I had read some recent reviews of several titles in the series. When I happened to see the omnibus edition of the first two In Death books I figured, why not give them a shot?Somehow, in reading those reviews I didn't realize these books were set in the future, which gives them an interesting twist. Actually, at times I wished that there was more emphasis on the fact that these books are set in the future--Robb could have supplied more detail in that respect. The story is certainly not for the faint of heart, and I should have realized that there would be more than enough sex, as well, given who we're dealing with (Robb a.k.a Nora Roberts). I skimmed over that and dealt with the foul language--I suppose it made sense for the story, regardless of whether or not I actually liked it. The storyline was interesting, if a bit predictable. But at the same time there were enough twists that I didn't have it totally figured out by the end. Robb does a pretty good job with the characters--Eve and Roarke are fairly well-developed (Eve more so than Roarke), and the antagonistic characters are definitely not likable in the slightest.I plan to read the next book, Glory In Death, sometime soon, though I don't know that I'll continue the series beyond those two books. My reading tastes don't really include a lot of sex and foul language. All the same, Robb writes a good, suspenseful mystery and I could appreciate the story for that in itself."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Honestly, I was really surprised that I liked this book so much. So much so, that I went to the library as soon as I was done with the book to search for the next one. I've never read any of Nora Robert's books and wrongly assumed that I wouldn't like her books because she is a well known mainstream romance author. I enjoyed the gritty feel of the novel and the slow, burn of the romance between Eve and Roarke. The plot didn't feel contrived at all. The only thing I'd say is that the futuristic feel of the book is just not that strong - not that it's really a bad thing. I guess I'm just use to reading more paranormal/urban fantasy books where things are so different than the real world.I love Eve and Roarke's characters. While many authors write stories with a strong female character, the strength often crumbles at the drop of a difficult situation. This is not so with Eve. She was consistent in her actions and thoughts. Roarke was a great balance of the strong, powerful, alpha male that was also sensitive and vulnerable. A slow build up to the romance is what I prefer and exactly what I got.It's exciting to see that there are so many books in this series and that the ratings have been consistently high because I suspect these books will keep me interested and entertained for a long time to come."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I am pleased to have a new, good detective series to read. This one kept me up until 3:00 am and even then I forced myself to put it down. The futuristic picture of New York is interesting, and the murder mystery is well constructed.

On her long list of suspects is Roarke, a multi-billionaire charmer. As Eve finds herself emotionally involved with Roarke, even to the point of trusting him, the pressure is on for her to find the real killer.What Makes It a Five Star Read:The suspense and mystery are unquestionably entertaining. The romance is hot and sweet. The balance between the two is flawless, a tribute to Robb's impeccable writing style.

Eve Dallas. I have turned many friends on to this series. It's fun, captivating, romantic, suspenseful, and thoroughly entertaining. Robb/Roberts' strength in writing is only enhanced by Erickson voice.

This is the first of many \\"InDeath\\" books, all of them starring Lieutenant Eve Dallas of NYPSD, circa 2058.

There are short fan-produced videos on YouTube, most of them junk but a handful of surprisingly good quality and content. Character \\"Kate Beckett\\" of tv show \\"Castle\\" was very obviously modeled on Eve Dallas, at least for the first season (Rank, expertise & dedication to the job, physical appearance and coffee addiction are straight out of InDeath). Start with this book, and if you like it, read the rest of them in sequence by publication date. While each book stands on its own, you'll get caught up in the continuing saga of various recurring characters, most especially the leading man in the series.

The supposed instant love between Geoffrey and Cecilia did not ring true at all nor did McVay's behavior induce me to believe that he would get away from punishment for his crimes.

It would also be a good option for short plane rides, where you are constantly interrupted by offers of drinks or peanuts.I enjoyed the repartee between the homeowner and the nimble-fingered burglar he cleverly catches, the moral dilemma of rescuing a young girl who may or may not exist versus ensuring the continued captivity of the burglar, and the sly way the burglar turns everything to his advantage. The ending, whilst somewhat predictable, left far too many unanswered questions. It felt like one of those movies that ends in such a way you KNOW there's going to be a sequel. Cute, but unsatisfying.Please do not let this put you off, though. It is truly an easy, light-hearted piece of entertainment and I enjoyed it. Well done, Ms Miller.

Not just a nostalgia-laden trip down memory lane, the book details the sociological impact baseball, particularly the Philadelphia A's, had on the surrounding neighborhood in North Philadelphia.The book basically has two plotlines. One plotline deals with the baseball played at Shibe Park. It discusses the extreme peaks and valleys experienced by the A's during their time at the park. It also analyzes the shift in fan allegiance from the A's to the Phillies that occurred in the late 1940's and early 1950's, which eventually forced the A's to move after the 1954 season. Finally, the book discusses how the advancing age of the park forced the Phillies to move out of the park after the 1970 season.The other plotline deals with the interaction of the community and the ballpark (and teams at the ballpark). It traces the pride the local community had in the ballpark (and the A's) during the early years of the park through the changing demographics of the neighborhood and the changing modes of transportation in America which gradually made the park (and the area around the park) unattractive to most fans. This arc also emphasizes how the A's and later the Phillies were an integral part of the community.Overall, Mr. Kuklick has written a book that doesn't mythologize Shibe Park, but rather puts it in a more real, human context.

Bruce Kulkick's book does just that. It is a grown-up story written with passion and anger and affection. The author knows the game, knows that IT IS a game and does a balancing act that should satisfy fans of Big League ball, 20th century American history, and any city planning student around. Baseball is said to be a perfect game in its dimensions; if the distance between bases were any shorter, far too many hits would be produced, if the distance were longer, nobody would ever get aboard. Kuklick is a writer who carries off the same tricky balance. Elegaic and important."},{"Title":"Fall, winter and spring abundance and geographic distribution of mountain goats on the Bradley River winter range: Final report","review":"The author did an outstanding job in writing this book. I've visited Philly several times on business. The nature of my business took me to the distressed areas of North & West Philadelphia. I visited 21st & Lehigh where Shibe Park formerly took & now has the church covering part of the grounds. I only wished that I could have seen the park during its existence. I had the opportunity visiting Philly on a weekend pass when some Army buddies back in 1968, but unfortunately we didn't think about attending a ballgame at Connie Mack Stadium. My loss.If your a native Philadelphian, Phillies, or a baseball fan you must read this book. It talks about not only the A's, but the Phillies, and even the Eagles and their ownerss. It talks extensively about the immediate neighborhood, North Philly, and the problems that both Connie Mack & the Carpenters faced owning the stadium. I didn't think the book would be as near as enjoyable as it proved to be. The Amazon reader's star ratings are usually grossly over graded, but not in this instance."},{"Title":"Fall, winter and spring abundance and geographic distribution of mountain goats on the Bradley River winter range: Final report","review":"University of Pennsylvania historian Bruce Kuklick has written with \\"To Every Thing a Season\\" a masterful analysis of the role of the relationship of Major League Baseball (MLB) to the city of Philadelphia and its culture in the twentieth century. He takes as his nexus one of the most significant of the concrete-and-steel stadiums built by various teams in the first part of the century, Shibe Park, home to both the National League Phillies and the American League Athletics--A's for short--for much of its history. Shibe Park, built by Connie Mack and others for $301,000, opened its doors in 1909. It was the home of the Athletics until they departed the city for Kansas City in 1954 and the Phillies between 1938 and 1970 when they moved to Veteran's Stadium.This is sophisticated history, not the once-over-lightly narratives of many baseball histories. Kuklick emphasizes the interrelations of the A's, the Phillies, and the residents of Philadelphia with Shibe Park as the point of convergence. Connie Mack, the owner of the A's, provides the human face of much of the description in the book and his successes and numerous failings on and off the field give \\"To Every Thing a Seasons\\" much of its dramatic power. Mack built two great baseball powerhouses with the A's, the first time in the years surrounding 1910 and again in the years around 1930. In both cases he dismantled those teams and sold the players to other Major League Baseball (MLB) franchises. The Phillies had far fewer good years than the A's, but did manage to win a National League pennant in 1950, and came close in 1964 when a late season collapse allowed the St. Louis Cardinals to take the pennant.Kuklick does not recite too much of the on-field activities of the Phillies and A's, but instead focuses on the role of Shibe Park, and by extension its occupants, in the life of the Philadelphia. As such \\"To Every Thing a Season\\" is quite excellent urban history, and at some level also business and economic and social history, rather than sports or baseball history. Kuklick is correct to conclude, and this very fine book emphasizes it: \\"Part of the story of Shibe Park is one of proprietorial rapacity, cynicism, and the limitations of even admirable people in an industrial society\\" (p. 190). Kuklick's epilogue is a superb contemplation of the social function of MLB teams and their home cities, using Philadelphia as a model. It helped generate a shared identity and taught camaraderie and patience and acceptance of the world and its fortunes. In the end, Shibe Park served as a collector of memories for the city, of both good and bad events. It became, over time, the city's equivalent of the family kitchen table.There is no question but that any reader will learn quite a lot from this book, and I recommend it as the starting point for serious investigation of MLB and its relation to the homes of its various franchises."},{"Title":"Fall, winter and spring abundance and geographic distribution of mountain goats on the Bradley River winter range: Final report","review":"Aside from being a fine history of Shibe Park(what most know as Connie Mack Stadium) this work doubles as a history of both Philadelphia baseball and Philadelphia itself.

Of course, most know him as the one who coined the immortal, defiant phrase &quot;I have not yet begun to fight!&quot; This book delves beyond that, as Morison shows Jones as he really was, a human being born in obscurity in Scotland who developed a love for the sea at an early age. He was simultaneously a shrewd combatant with a quick temper (in many ways the American equivalent of the great English admiral Nelson,) and a gentleman who enjoyed the company of numerous lovely ladies ashore. Morison leaves no stone unturned as he takes the reader on a detailed, captivating journey (from page one, the reader is hooked.) He sailed the waters that bore witness to Jones's battles and drew extensively upon the naval archives of the four primary countries that figured in Jones's life. To give you some idea, the engagement with H.M.S. Serapis is fleshed out in such marvelous detail that one can almost smell the gunpowder, but Morison goes beyond that, explaining what happened before, during, and after, most of which one would not learn in history class. In fact, I would make book that at least ninety percent of what one will read in this book would not be learned in history class. Morison has included pictures, charts, diagrams, excerpts from letters (some of which are in French with English translations), and has deftly blended them and the text into a perfect biography. For anyone who wants to learn more about Jones, this is required reading."},{"Title":"John Paul Jones: A Sailor's Biography","review":"It has been said that most great men are bad men. Samuel Eliot Morison's superb biography of John Paul Jones supports, if not proves, that proposition. Jones's greatness is undeniable: Although he was the son of an obscure Scottish gardener, he virtually founded the United States Navy, he won one of the most important sea battles of the Revolutionary War when he was only 32, and he later commanded ships in the service of France and Russia. But Jones also was extremely temperamental, excessively vain (after receiving an honor from France, he liked to be addressed as \\"Chevalier Paul Jones\\"), and he had mistresses in practically every port. Morison, a longtime professor at Harvard and the author of the authoritative, Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of Christopher Columbus, as well as a massive, multi-volume history of the U.S. Navy during World War II, reports all of this in a matter-of-fact fashion. Morison's Jones is a great sailor and a man of the world in every respect.According to Morison, Young Jones was highly ambitious and went to sea at age 13 \\"as a road to distinction.\\" During the next 15 years, he learned well his trade and he also became an American patriot. At the beginning of the Revolutionary War, Morison writes that the American navy was \\"only a haphazard collection of converted merchant ships,\\" and the Royal Navy was probably the most powerful in history. But General George Washington, according to Morison, \\"had a keen appreciation of the value and capabilities of sea power,\\" and, in October 1775, Congress appointed a Naval Committee of Seven to manage the colonies' maritime affairs. In December 1775, seven months before the American colonies declared their independence from Great Britain, Jones accepted a commission as a lieutenant in the continental navy.Although Morison is primarily interested in Jones's activities during the Revolutionary War, he makes a number of more generally cogent observations. For instance, the United States government was in a state of nearly constant impecuniousness and was able to afford to build only one of the largest class of naval vessels, a ship of the line, during the conflict. In Morison's view, this was the status of the war at the time of the battle off Flamborough Head in September 1779, which secured Jones's fame: \\"The War of Independence had reached a strategic deadlock, a situation that recurred in both World Wars of the twentieth century. Each party, unable to reach a decision by fleet action or pitched land battles, resorts to raids and haphazard, desultory operations which have no military effect.\\" That deadlock continued, according to Morison, until 1781. Morison also writes that Britain took the position \\"since the United States were not a recognized government but a group of rebellious provinces,...American armed ships were no better than pirates.\\"Morison appears to be deeply impressed by Jones's technical competence: \\"One of Paul Jones's praiseworthy traits was his constant desire to improve his professional knowledge.\\" That passion for self-improvement reached fruition September 1779 off the Yorkshire coast of east-central England when a squadron which Jones commanded from the Bonhomme Richard defeated the H.M.S. Serapis in a three and one-half hour battle during which those ships were locked in what Morison describes as a \\"deadly embrace.\\" (Bonhomme Richard sank during the aftermath of the fierce fighting.) It was during this battle that Jones defiantly refused to surrender with the immortal phrase: \\"I have not yet begun to fight.\\" According to Morison, \\"[c]asualties were heavy for an eighteenth-century naval battle. Jones estimated his loss at 150 killed and wounded out of a total of 322.\\" Morison writes that Jones was at his \\"pinnacle of fame\\" in late 1779, and, when he visited France, which was allied with the U.S. during the Revolutionary War, in April 1780: He became the lion of Paris, honored by everyone from the King down.\\" When Jones returned to the United States in 1781, however, he was unable to obtain what Morison describes as a \\"suitable command,\\" and he never fought again under the American flag. In 1788 and 1789, as \\"Kontradmiral Pavel Ivanovich Jones\\" he swerved in the navy of Catherine II, \\"the Great,\\" Empress of Russia. When he died in 1792, he was buried in France, but, in 1905, his body was returned to the United States and now rests in the chapel of the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland.Jones's nasty temper is frequently on display. Morison remarks on various occasions that his crews were \\"disobedient,\\" \\"sullen,\\" and \\"surly.\\" Which was cause and which was effect is difficult to ascertain. Jones clearly was an overbearing commander, which may explain, though does not excuse, his crews' bad attitudes. On one occasion Jones had one of his officers \\"placed under arrest for insubordination [giving the officer] a chance to clear it up, and Jones was unwilling to admit his error.\\" It is not prudent to compare events during war in the late 18th century to the peace and prosperity of our own time, but no reader of this book will be impressed by Jones's interpersonal skills.Morison makes numerous references to \\"prize money,\\" the curious, but apparently then-universal, practice of rewarding captains and their crews in cash for capturing enemy ships. The fact that Jones pursued prize money with vigor may raise additional doubts about his character, but I would guess Morison believed that Jones simply followed a custom which probably motivated many successful naval captains of his time.Morison held the rank of admiral in the U.S. Navy during World War II. Although the degree of detail in his narrative is fascinating, I found some passages too technical, and I suspect some other lay readers may be baffled as well. (The book's charts and diagrams were, however, very helpful.) But that is a small price to pay for a wonderful biography of one of the most intriguing figures of the American Revolution."},{"Title":"John Paul Jones: A Sailor's Biography","review":"John Paul Jones is one of those figures on the fringes of the American pantheon. Most educated people have heard the name, but few know anything about the man beyond, perhaps, that he proclaimed, \\"I have not yet begun to fight!\\" Much to my surprise, after reading this classic biography (winner of the 1960 Pulitzer Prize for Biography) by Samuel Eliot Morison, the godfather of US Naval history, Jones' exploits are both relatively unknown and relatively modest. There is, however, nothing relative or modest about Morison's biography, which is an excellently structured and wonderfully written piece of history that is a pleasure to read.How did Jones attain immortality for his role in the American Revolution while other leading military figures of the period (most notably, in this reviewer's opinion, General Nathaniel Greene) have nearly vanished from history? Jones' attachment to the United States, both as a nation and a cause, were slight, even dubious. He was born and raised in Scotland and didn't arrive in America until roughly 1775 (on the run from a murder trial, no less, which also prompted him to add the alias \\"Jones\\" to his birth name of John Paul). He never owned a home or even maintained a permanent resistance in his adopted land, and instead lived with friends or at hotels at government expense. During his forty-five years of life, Jones only spent about three of them on American soil -- and that time was divided among four brief visits. His commitment to the principles of the American Revolution are a bit suspect, although he did frequently claim to be a citizen of the world engaged in the fight for liberty. Nevertheless, when Catherine II of Imperial Russia, the ruler of the most despotic of European monarchies, dangled a much coveted flag officer position before him in 1788 Jones quickly jettisoned his liberal pretensions and jumped at the offer.If Jones lacked the deep American roots of a John Adams or the strong ideological convictions of more recent immigrants like Thomas Paine, he was at least a military hero, right? Well, sort of. Jones' major military exploits during the war can be summarized as follows: a partially successful raid on his hometown port of Whitehaven, Scotland followed by a botched kidnapping attempt and then the capture of a modest-sized British warship while cruising the Irish Sea aboard \\"Ranger\\" in 1778, and then the famous defeat of the \\"Serapis\\" off Flamborough Head in September 1779 aboard the \\"Bonhomme Richard.\\" Like Doolittle's Raid on Tokyo in 1942, the military value of these actions were minimal, but the psychological impact -- both at home and with the enemy -- was enormous. The British home islands had, afterall, been inviolable since a Dutch raid in 1667. Thus, Jones stands alone as the man who brought the American Revolution home to the British Isles, albeit in a way that caused little material damage.So, through a combination of moxie, luck and the general absence of anything else to cheer about, John Paul Jones -- one-time slave trader, murderer, Imperial Russian admiral, and alleged rapist of a 12-year-old (in his defense he swore, foreshadowing a future American scandal, that he \\"did not have sexual relations with that [girl],\\" although conceded that other amorous relations did occur) -- emerged as a bona fide hero of the American Revolution. Jones died alone, indigent and forgotten in Paris in 1792. But today his remains rest in an ornate tomb (modeled on Napoleon's) at the US Naval Academy and he is widely regarded as the father of the US Navy, which has become the global juggernaut he dreamed it would be.In closing, Morison does a remarkable job in capturing not only the essence of his subject-- Jones' native intelligence, egotism, insecurity and opportunism -- but also the pulse of life on the open ocean in an eighteenth century sailing vessel. The skill, experience, fortitude, and endurance it must have taken to guide these ships in battle and in treacherous seas with a motley collection of mutiny-inclined men as a crew is difficult to fathom. That Jones did so with such obvious success is, indeed, impressive. For readers with an interest in naval affairs or simply a love of sailing, this book would be a welcome addition to your library."},{"Title":"John Paul Jones: A Sailor's Biography","review":"A hero of my youth, this book appears to tell the full story.

I recommend it."},{"Title":"John Paul Jones: A Sailor's Biography","review":"A voluminous writer, including the lengthy \\"Oxford History of the American People\\", Samuel Eliot Morison is probably best remembered for his \\"Admiral of the Ocean Sea\\", a 1942 warts-and-all biography of Chistopher Columbus, in which he revealed, among other things, the great explorer's fondness for torturing animals. Morison's 1959 \\"John Paul Jones: A Sailor's Biography\\" is equally frank and detailed. Born John Paul in 1747 Scotland, the boy went to sea at the age of 13 to learn the profession and at 21 became the master of a merchant ship. For a brief while he engaged in the slave trade (on what was called a \\"blackbirder\\"), but he was turned off by both the moral question and the incredibly filthy conditions. By reading and socializing John Paul improved his mind and his manners, though Morison makes it clear he was always \\"a hard person to get along with\\". It was his bad temper that got him into legal hot water and caused him to add the \\"Jones\\" to his name while eluding the authorities. The name sort of came and went thoughout his life. An interesting point in the narrative is the fine line between pirating and privateering. Our hero was often accused of being a pirate, an accusation he resented, because all his exploits were supported by the government; and actually the only difference between the two occupations seems to have been official approval. Morison also depicts sea life in the late 18th Century unflinchingly. Shipboard existence could be brutal: seamen who signed on for \\"an agreable Voyage\\" were soon disillusioned by the disagreeable reality, and when a suspected mutineer receives 230 (!) lashes with a cat-o-nine-tails, the reader must wonder how the man survived. Jones' most famous exploit was the battle (described with diagrams) off Flamborough Head when he was commodore of the Bonhomme Richard and proclaimed his momentous declaration not at the conclusion of the battle, Morison assures us, but near the beginning. As for romance, the Captain had an active port life, seeming to prefer women who were already attached; he himself never married. More than once Morison hints that Jones was of a dashing appearance, but contemporary calculations put him at 5'5\\" (he probably suffered from what would later be called the Napoleonic Complex), and Houdon's bust reveals a sharp hatchet face. (The same year Morison's book was published the Brothers Warner released a biopic called \\"John Paul Jones\\", and who'd they cast in the lead? Six-foot, woodenly handsome Robert Stack. Leave it to Hollywood.) Jones' true love, of course, was America, and he continually endorsed a strong central Navy. Even though he died and was buried in Paris, his remains were eventually exhumed and replaced (appropriately) at the Naval Academy Chapel in Annapolis in an ornate sarcophagus that Morison admits was \\"more or less\\" based on that famous tomb in the Invalides. This is a intelligent biography, including 25 illustrations, with only one caveat: other reviewers have implied that the maritime vernacular gets awfully thick for the average reader, and this is true.

Not only did this book delve more into the Horde War the Skikar warriors are fighting against the Daemons, it went more in-depth with the secrets Tryton has been withholding for centuries from his people. After Tryton and his team locate Niki, who finds herself in the mist of the Horde War, Tryton finds himself possessed with a wanting he's never experienced before. Niki is his goddess and what he wants he gets. The sparks and sexual desire between these two is flaming hot! The story also brings forth a multitude of revelations for the Shikar warriors and how far the Daemons will go to destroy both them and humans. Prepare yourself for a couple of surprises and many twists and turns. This is a must read if you are a fan of the Horde Wars series."},{"Title":"The Horde Wars - Lord of the Deep","review":"Let me start off by saying I was most pleased to find that Tryton has found himself someone to love, Nikki.This was anoutstanding read and I finished the book in a day.

So now something has to be really special to invoke the same sense of wonder I felt as a hearty youth. Milorad Pavic can still do it, always; Italo Calvino, mostly; Jack Vance, often; Fritz Leiber, sometimes; maybe a few other names -- James Branch Cabell, Mervyn Peake, Clark Ashton Smith... and Jeff VanderMeer. He's one of the few bright lights currently burning in fantasy writing. And he's young, so whereas I'm enjoying the grave-lights or sunsets of the other figures on my list, VanderMeer is providing me with a dawn. Dradin, In Love is a superbly atmospheric work which succeeds in mapping a shadowy, almost Kafkaesque city landscape which has expelled cliche beyond the furthest suburbs. VanderMeer pulls off what I see many fantasy writers (especially here in the UK) failing to do. Yes, he's one to watch out for, and he deserves to be more widely read."},{"Title":"Dradin in Love: A Tale of Elsewhen & Otherwhere","review":"Dradin in love is a profoundly disturbing excavation into the destruction of one man's desires. Dradin finds more about himself than he wishes to know, with unforeseen results. The victorian ouvre of the story gives the beginning a kind of naivete, and the deconstruction of that naivete through startling revelations seems to be the driving force behind the plot. This is an excellent read, written in a style largely indistinguishable from Victorian/Edwardian novellas. The internal illustrations are excellent and add to the surreality of the story, rather than diverting attention away from the plot."},{"Title":"Great Debates: Language and Culture Skills for ESL Students","review":"I bought this book, thinking it would work well for my college debate class, which is comprised of many ESL and ELL students.

Instead, I got a book that shows a number of different projects that showcase a specific letter of the alphabet - all 26 of them - A-Z. An attempt is made to match each letter of the alphabet with a flower and create a piece that showcases that flower. The index lists a total of 18 stitches amongst all of the flower names. Unfortunately, you will have to leaf through the book to look at each stitch to see if it is the one you want to learn how to make.

They have to stretch things a little on some letters (even THEY couldn't think up any flowers that start with X). Every letter also features a full color photograph of the stitches/flowers used for that letter, as well as a multi-color stitch guide to follow.

This book also has instructions on how to do many gathered flowers with wider or wired ribbon. In addition to flowers by alphabet (including some unusual choices like caladiums), there are instructions on how to make decorative initials; something I haven't seen before.

The strength of this story lies in the characters and the action. The memembers of the Black Beret team are well developed and interesting. Mr. McCray does a good job of breathing life into these charachters and illustrating the emotional scars they received from their tours during Vietnam. My only complaint is that the antagonists of the story were fairly two dimensional and could have used a little more fleshing out.Action fans will love this book. The conflicts are well written and add a good deal of suspense for the reader. A minor shortcoming is that there wasn't more detial on the weapons used by the team. This author also writes the Soldiers of Barabus series (under another name), but from what I've read the Black Berets series is superior. I'd recommend this series to fans of Mac Bolan, Soldiers of Barabus and other books of this genre.

Taisen Deshimaru was a Zen master, yes, but he was also a simple, ordinary man. And it is this viewpoint that so enriches his explanation of Zen Buddhism.QUESTIONS TO A ZEN MASTER, unlike the works of, say, D.T. Suzuki, is not a &quot;scholarly&quot; work. Deshimaru-roshi explains Zen in a very clear, pedestrian manner, and abstains from fancy language or dizzying metaphysical concepts. He speaks of Zen as something relating to the most basic of everyday actions, even eating and sleeping, making love and defecating. Deshimaru-roshi tries to say (and succeeds wonderfully) that Zen is not some obtuse, mind-boggling philosophy but the here-and-now, this breath.Although scholarly works on Zen Buddhism have their place, Deshimaru-roshi's heartfelt clarifications are worth reading. An added bonus with this book is a short Q&amp;A with Deshimaru-roshi by several Christian monks. Although brief, the sections does provoke quite some thought even from this Christian reviewer.QUESTIONS TO A ZEN MASTER is worth getting from anyone interested in Zen."},{"Title":"Questions to a Zen Master: Practical and Spiritual Answers from the Great Japanese Master","review":"Ok, to be fair to Taisen Deshimaru here-a previous reviewer mentioned some sort of a sex scandal which involved him. I looked everywhere I could using Googles search engine to look into the matter, and never once came across anything concerning that. So as far as I know, that reviewer is the only source for the information.Now, how was the book? If you are just starting out in Zen, I would not recommend this book to you. Not that it is complicated stuff. You just need a bit of seasoning to swallow some of it, and to discriminate a little between what is accurate, and not accurate. For those starting out, I would recommend any books by Zen Master Seung Sahn-ie. the Compass of Zen, Only Don't Know, Dropping Ashes on the Buddha. These books will give you a more (yes, in my opinion) accurate account as to just what Zen practice is all about.This book is in a question and answer format, and sometimes you get the impression he simply cannot handle the question. Does this mean everything he has to say is useless? Not at all. In fact I did take away some useful teachings from this book. At other points, however, I shook my head laughing out loud. So it's a coin toss, if you are somewhat familiar with Zen-this book is innocent fun. If you are unfamiliar with Zen, it could prove to be a dangerous introduction in my view. So there it is, my first 4 star review-I try to be a little nice!"},{"Title":"Questions to a Zen Master: Practical and Spiritual Answers from the Great Japanese Master","review":"This was one of my first &quot;real&quot; Zen books. Much of what I had read up to this point was western philosophical discussion on Zen. This was one of my first exposures to subjective Zen.Taisen is really cool. Funny &amp; smart.He's agnostic, for example when asked about the existence of a metaphysical realm he says that although he's had metaphysical experiences, nothing can be confirmed or denied so it's best to remain silent.He's got an excellent grounding in science but is a student of Dogen so his agnosticism is shot through with mysticism. He's into opening up, becoming receptive and often comes back to a attitude of; &quot;Try to look at the tree instead of talking about it. An when you look at it try to not see your notions of the tree. Go beyond that.&quot;He always comes back to the actual practice of Zazen over thinking about Zen. Without the experience of Zazen notions of Zen are empty."},{"Title":"Questions to a Zen Master: Practical and Spiritual Answers from the Great Japanese Master","review":"There are some useful information in this work and some genuinely interesting insights. Unfortunately there is also a lot of really bad quack science interspersed through out the book that I find really off putting. Two right off the top of my head are the idea that Westerners need to eat meat and consume alcohol, and that we normally only think with the left side of our brain.Further from it's obsession over the forebrain and brain stem et al to it's comments on the macrobiotic diet, the text is firmly rooted in the late 1970's making it dated at best.Combined with the reptition (how many times is the word \\"coffin\\" used throughout the text?) and the disjointed feel of the question and answer format, it is in my view just not a very good introduction."},{"Title":"Questions to a Zen Master: Practical and Spiritual Answers from the Great Japanese Master","review":"I have owned this book for years and always found it to be an honest, interesting and helpful guide to Zen thought, mindfulness in everyday life, and the practice of sitting meditation.

Probably it's far better to read this than to go right for the big and legendary scriptures of Zenbuddhism. For myself I read it when I was twenthy and I still gaze through it once in a while.

I read this book in a matter of hours but the concepts, ideas and insights have stayed with me for years and years. I have reread this book probably at least twenty or more times.

The subjects are varied, but always there is the basic emphasis on zazen (sitting) and not letting the mind overcomplicate what is simple, natural and automatic.In this increasingly complicated world, I find a great deal of meaning and significance to the whole idea of \\"letting go\\" of thinking and rediscovering our original nature underneath the mind and letting it arise .A truly \\"Mondo\\" mondo :)"},{"Title":"Questions to a Zen Master: Practical and Spiritual Answers from the Great Japanese Master","review":"As someone who has had a continuing interest in Zen, reading Master Deshimaru's lively and spirited answers to typical (and not so typical) questions regarding Zen and his take on the subject.

Apart from the language difficulties, Deshimaru Roshi is distinctly Japanese in his presentation-- alluding more than explaining, pointing more than telling.It is strange to talk of the essence of Zen, because Zen rejects the notion of an essence. However, this is exactly how I would describe this book. In the beginning, Deshimaru Roshi reveals that the golden key to Zen is the practice of zazen. He gives the instructions for zazen first. A wise person would go no further in the book without following these instructions for zazen. The instructions are very simple, yet may prove quite difficult in practice. In the pages that follow, Deshimaru Roshi transmits his understanding of Zen in a Western cultural context in response to questions. At times, Deshimaru Roshi seems ambiguous or frustratingly vague. This is in part, I believe, due to the nature of his project. Zen is not a set of beliefs to adopt. In is a set of transformational practices. His words are to be savored rather than devoured."},{"Title":"Questions to a Zen Master: Practical and Spiritual Answers from the Great Japanese Master","review":"This is what buddhism is all about.

Even as a Catholic schoolboy in the Midwest, I had heard of Mother Cabrini, the first American citizen to be made a saint. That, however, was the extent of my knowledge. As we have been attending mass at the shrine, I thought it would be a good idea to find out more about her, so I got this book.As a wealth of biographical information, Too Small a World is very useful. I always find a saint's youth to be the most interesting part of their lives and Maynard takes us through Cabrini's youth in Italy. He tells us of her desire to be a nun and her struggles to achieve that, first living in a house with poor female role models and then starting a house and, eventually, her own worldwide organization of sisters. He tells us of her dream to do missionary work in China--a dream she never achieves--which is redirected as work among Italian immigrants in the United States (by Pope Leo XIII, who becomes a close friend).With this first trip to the United States in 1889, Mother Cabrini begins her incessant travels, taking her to numerous countries in South America and Europe, and coast to coast across the US. Along the way, she founds convents, orphanages, schools and hospitals. Her ability to find locations, raise money, recruit people and administrate her holdings is awe-inspiring though, for a biography, this process gets a bit repetitive through the last portion of the book.Of course, originally published and give imprimatur in 1945, Too Small a World is typical of a saint's biography of its time. For a modern, more secular reader, the simple pieties and miracle claims can sound a bit hollow. On the other hand, no one can deny Mother Cabrini's selfless work for the less fortunate, working through repeated illness and doing her best with whatever is asked of her.

Details are included when they are relevant to the story told, but the story is allowed to move along quickly, and this book is entertaining and illuminating. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to get an idea of what pre-revolutionary Havana was like, whether or not they are interested in nightclubs. My parents, who often went to Tropicana, said that the book tells it like it was. The book also includes wonderful vintage photos."},{"Title":"Tropicana Nights: The Life and Times of the Legendary Cuban Nightclub","review":"This book tells the story of the most famous caberet in the Americas and why it is still legendary even today. It also weaves the history of pre and post Revolutionary Cuba and all the intrigue that implies. Havana nightlife comes alive. The city's customs, both quaint and treacherous, play themselves out against a tropical motif that could only happen in Cuba. Models, gangsters, jazzmen, dancers, rumbereros, number runners, government henchman and architects all play a role in the vision of Senor Martin Fox whose love of a location gave birth to a legend. You will laugh and cry, but you will better understand this land so close and yet so foreign. Very well handled in the capable hands of author Rosa Lowenger, you will never think of Cuba the same again."},{"Title":"Tropicana Nights: The Life and Times of the Legendary Cuban Nightclub","review":"Tropicana Nights shows the views of two Cuban women from different generations who politically disagree, but are brought together by their love for Cuban culture, particularly the Tropicana Nightclub.

This is part as-told-to autobiography by the wife of the club's owner back in the Fifties and part history of the club by the book's co-author.

The Life and Times of the Legendary Cuban Nightclub. Harcourt, Orlando, New York, London ISBN 0151012245This is a very exciting and interesting book, well worth reading. Personally I found this book, \\"Tropicana Nights\\", by chance and in it my distant cousin Leonela Gonzalez.In my recall it is Cuba in the 1950. Leonela is six years older than I, Professor of Ballet, student of Alicia Alonzo and showgirl in La Tropicana; she sings professionally. She is all curves, raven black hair, smooth skin, full lips, high cheek bones, jet eyes. She is 5 foot four and less than 120 pounds, but towers over me in her high heels. I stutter but cannot speak, so drunk on her presence I cannot talk, unable to take her extended hand, I mere give a judo bow. She is one of the goddesses of flesh.We are family, both of us great grandchildren of Leonela Enamorado Cabrera, that brave and graceful Taina woman who was consort of the great general Calixto Garcia at the time of the fullest power of his fiery warrior strength. Grandfather was child of Leonela Enamorado's passionate war time love match; Leonela Gonzalez is fruit of the descendents of a later formal marriage.Thus I read this book intensely, trying to better understand things past. The authors have compiled oral history and compared it to the record of scholarly and popular writings on the matter. Lowinger and Fox have struggled, as all honest authors must on books about Cuba, to eliminate propaganda. What has come of this is a beautifully detailed, well written, hypnotically fascinating and engrossing book on the Havana Nightclub \\"La Tropicana.\\"The book presents the scene and the lives the actors of that place against a background of Cuban history. And it does that with remarkable accuracy, there are a few errors: as a University of Havana student, Castro did his first killings when he belonged to the \\"the trigger happy\\" Uni'n Insurreccional Revolucionaria (UIR) not Masferrer's Movimiento Socialista Revolucionario (MIR). The official Cuban Communist Party had very little to do with war against Batista until the last few months, quite the contrary it frequently supported that regime by providing information on resistance groups. The presence of Ta'no racial mix and culture, now clearly demonstrated by DNA studies, is glossed over yet both Batista and Leonela had such ethnic roots; the word Guajiro is taken from the original Taino word.These authors of \\"Tropical Nights\\" explain that those who visit Cuba are not welcomed to return if they write the mildest criticism of the Government. They honestly point out such details as that the nomenklatura of the Castro government, took over and keep well painted the residences of the upper class, while the residences of most of the population are crowded and in disrepair.As the Lowinger and Fox point out, contrary to official Cuban government propaganda in the Tropicana then these goddesses were not available to the clientele, for there were enough such places in Havana. The goddesses' loves of after hours which were then private matters are clearly presented. There were Mafia gangsters there, but they fearful of losing their comfortable residence in Cuba, limited their activities to providing gambling advice and were mere toothed minnows when compared to the far more numerous and lethal Batista goons. Don't keep on reading this, go buy this book!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Tropicana Nights: The Life and Times of the Legendary Cuban Nightclub","review":"I liked this book considering it's the only source as of now of this Once Great Establishment before a Murderous regime took it over,However,The book does not stick to it's subject as the title would imply, The Club is covered but it goes back and fourth to the author(Rosa Lowinger,A Cuban american who apparently sees nothing wrong going back and fourth to the island, I am Cuban American and I can see past the Facade of Cultural Exchanges.)The book mainly tells the story from Ofelia Fox and Sadly her Lover Rosa Sanchez' side(Apparently she thinks the \\"Autenticos\\" were a bunch of Nobodys\\",perhaps she was Batistiana? or doesn't know that under Carlos Prio,The National Bank was Founded,The Union kicked out it's undesirables under him and he had an Honest National Chief of Police,The Best and Only True Democratic President Cuba Has ever Had.)the book has a couple of black and white photographs,and the author again paints the picture of Batista somehow being in equal to Fidel, Fidel Sent Over 14,000+ to el paredon,and many more were unaccounted for or still languishing in prison,the 20,000(Batista) is a Myth as it is in the book pointed out which contradicts the author.The Author talks to known Dancers in The Current Regime's Cuba that either or unsympathetic to the plight of their fellow compatriots or are in cahoots with them,one is married to a Mexican Elitist Leftist and owns her place in Cuba,The author Laments the Strict Measures of the Embargo, Again messing up the whole premise of the book and title. That fact she thanks/Acknowledges Louise Ann Bardach author of AntiExile book:\\"Cuba Confidential\\" and Castro Apologist,and she doesn't \\"want to offend\\" the authorities in order for her not to be denied re-entry into Cuba for her many Back And Fourths for her \\"Research\\",The other thing I don't care to know about is Ofelia and Rosa's Personal Life,If this was the intent why not just have called the book why I think the Embargo is bad or The Story of Two Women? something along that lines,Hopefully a better Book on The Once Great Tropicana will come out,my GrandFather worked there and It Prior to 1959 It was Owned BY CUBANS FOR CUBANS not by an Elite Committee who rules over their own people with an Fist."},{"Title":"Tropicana Nights: The Life and Times of the Legendary Cuban Nightclub","review":"You think you've read everything there is to read about Cuba, but you haven't--until you've picked up Tropicana Nights by Rosa Lowinger. This adeptly-written book chronicles the rise and eventual fall of Havana's most glamorous night club. The book follows the lives of its owners, Martin and Ofelia Fox, as they build their \\"paradise under the stars,\\" with cameos by a veritable who's who of iconic entertainers: Carmen Miranda, Nat King Cole, Josephine Baker and Steve Allen. Woven into the story are sidebars on Cuban music, modernist architecture and regional politics, that, together, come to form a complete picture of Cuban culture in the 1950s. The book also follows Ofelia as she rebuilds her life from scratch in the United States following the Cuban revolution and Martin's death. It's an entertaining, page-turning read with a gripping, personal narrative. And it offers the most striking portrait yet of what it has meant to be Cuban in the twentieth century."},{"Title":"Tropicana Nights: The Life and Times of the Legendary Cuban Nightclub","review":"This fascinating book provides a never-before-seen insiders look at the creation and transformation of Cuba's legendary club, the Tropicana. The Tropicana wasn't just a nightclub and casino, it was a showcase for Cuban music and dance that helped spread Cuban culture internationally.Anyone who has seen a big Las Vegas \\"spectacular\\" production should know that many of the elements we consider \\"Vegas style\\" were actually created at the Tropicana in the 1950s by the Tropicana's shrewd owner and the club's choreographer, Roderico \\"Rodney\\" Neyra.The book is written by journalist Rosa Lowinger and Ofelia Fox, the widow of the club's last owner, Mart&iacute;n Fox. The book quite naturally revolves around Fox, a shrewd businessman who navigated the minefield of Cuban politics to create a fantastic entertainment venue that attracted visitors from all over the world.So many books of this type are as about as engaging as an encyclopedia entry, but this one reads more like a novel. There's plenty of suspense, intrigue, romance, and a cast of characters -- some famous and some infamous -- that come to life in the author's detailed and poetic text.The book includes a nice section of period photos, and is a compelling read.

Of course I had no idea at the time."},{"Title":"Tropicana Nights: The Life and Times of the Legendary Cuban Nightclub","review":"Tropicana Nights gives the reader a sense of what life was like in Havana during the 1940s and 1950s. The Tropicana nightclub embodied the creativity and glamour of that era.Tropicana still exists in Havana today. In the 1940s and 50s, it was a nightclub, cabaret and casino. It hosted performers such as Nat \\"King\\" Cole, Ginger Rogers and Liberace. Its audience was composed of the rich and famous, politicians and people wanting a special night out. Tropicana consistently met and raised people's expectations. The shows were legendary due to the imaginative choreography, live animals and beautiful Tropicana models.This book is a collaboration of two women who are brought together to tell Tropicana's story. Ofelia Fox is the widow of Martin Fox who owned the Tropicana from 1950-1962. Rosa Lowinger was born in Havana but raised in Miami. As they work together on the book, some issues are raised.Rosa and Ofelia have different views on Cuban politics. Ofelia claims that both Batista and Castro are dictators. Rosa must be sensitive about what she writes about Castro or risk being denied entry back into Cuba.Rosa is curious about the possible Mob involvement at Tropicana. Ofelia and Martin went to Trafficante's daughter's wedding and were personally entertained by Frankie Carbo (a hit man for Bugsy Siegel in the 1930s) when they visited New York. Ofelia maintains that this was just a good business relationship. but Rosa isn't so sure. It is up to the reader to decide who is right.There are also questions about Ofelia's relationship with her roommate (Rosa Sanchez). They have been together for more than 30 years yet when asked, Ofelia states that Rosa is a close friend but they are not a couple.Lowinger has written a book that reads like a juicy novel. She has a great writing style, I kept turning the pages to find out what happened next. After reading the personal anecdotes and seeing the photos, I felt like I knew the various characters (the showgirls, the dancers and roulette dealers). I also enjoyed finding out what happened to everyone in recent years.Armchair Interviews says: Come spend some time at the Tropicana and find out why it was paradise under the stars."},{"Title":"Tropicana Nights: The Life and Times of the Legendary Cuban Nightclub","review":"I visited the Tropicana in Havana in October, 1959... only a couple of months before the departure of Batista and Castro's entrance into Havana.

However, there are no memories of my visit to that beautiful country any more vivid that my evening at Tropicana; even though it has been fifty years (this month).

They are easy reads and teach great lessons like team work, accepting differences in people and sportsmanship. They can really boost a child's confidence."},{"Title":"No Arm in Left Field (Matt Christopher Sports Classics)","review":"When his family moves to Forest Lake, Terry Delaney hopes to be able to play baseball, his favorite sport. He approaches life in Forest Lake with a bit of trepidation, as he will be one of the few black children in the city. Fortunately, he meets and becomes immediate friends with Mick and Mick encourages Terry to try out for little league baseball. Tony is another boy on the team who takes an immediate dislike to Terry because he is black.Play starts and while Terry has many skills on the diamond, he has two weaknesses. He can cover enormous ground in left with his feet but has a very weak throwing arm. Terry is also a sucker for a high and outside fastball, he can clobber what he can reach but he can't reach those pitches. When those weaknesses appear in games, his teammate Tony makes fun of Terry, which creates dissension and unhappiness. The other relatives of the boys meet and there is a thaw there, but Tony finds it difficult to give up his prejudice.The coach talks to Terry and has him move closer to the plate. This, in combination with greater discipline at the plate, helps Terry to improve his hitting. The other players realize that Terry has a weak arm, so they compensate by moving closer to him when receiving a throw. A big game arrives and Tony decides that he wants to win more than he wants to dislike so Terry and Tony reach an understanding and when they win the game, they take the first steps toward friendship.One could almost date this book by the way in which race and sports are handled. It is clear that professional sports have been integrated for some time and the animosity Tony shows to Terry was born from a situation with Tony's father where he feels that a black was promoted ahead of him. After some time to get to know and understand each other, the racial animosity evaporates and everyone pulls together. It is a simple story with a basic and topical, at least for the seventies, moral."},{"Title":"No Arm in Left Field (Matt Christopher Sports Classics)","review":"The book I read was NO ARM IN LEFT FIELD.

Even though all your more senior colleagues made the same journey from chrysalis to butterfly (or moth, in many cases), they quickly forget the tribulations of the process, and so there is little or nothing in the way of meaningful orientation offered at most schools. I had high hopes for this not-thick volume as a useful manual to assist the newly appointed instructor, and it indeed does the service of bringing a lot of material together in one place, but a reader who has been thinking and reading about the subject for a few years will find nothing original here. All the advice on teaching methods, advising students, why and how to get yourself published, why and how to pursue grant money, and the great and foggy subject of &quot;faculty service&quot; has been cribbed from other (presumably more original) authors. However, the thing I found particularly off-putting about this book is that all of it is couched in a self-conscious vocabulary and phrasing that almost serves as a model of academic-speak. And that's not a compliment!"},{"Title":"New Faculty: A Practical Guide for Academic Beginners","review":"This book is just what it advertises - it is good down-to-earth and practical advice for those just starting out on their teaching careers.

It combines a simple text with full-color photographs that are rich in fascinating details. The plants covered include mangrove trees, banyan trees, baobab trees, saguaro cactus, mistletoe, and more.My only problem with the book is the title. It seems a bit narrow-minded to arbitrarily designate some plants as &quot;strange.&quot; I'm sure lichen (which is depicted in the book) is not considered strange by someone who lives in a region with lots of lichen. That gripe aside, this is a worthwhile book."},{"Title":"Picture Palaces: Views from Americas Past","review":"What's the catch? Simply that this book was designed to be given away, something no true movie palace lover could ever bring him/herself to do! For this is not actually a \\"book\\" but a collection of 24 postcards culled from the famous Curt Teich Postcard collection. The postcards are perforated so as to be removed from the book and used.Many of these postcards are all but impossible to find today (even with the miracle of Amazon and eBay auctions). Views range from the \\"needs no introduction\\" Graumann's Chinese in Hollywood to a long gone original, the \\"Dreamland\\" Theater in Montrose Colorado. My heart skipped a beat when i saw the stunning night scene depicting the Temple Theater in Geneva NY; today just a misty memory. In most cases, they are the last real evidence that these places actually existed.The reproduction of these cards is done in such a way that they could never be mistaken for the originals. (Perhaps on purpose?) The stock is shiny and the colors too bright to be original Teich cards. But, they are lovely nostalgia pieces and a must-have for any collection.

I have never laughed so much in my life.I am now going to get my hands on every word P.G. Wodehouseever wrote. I truly would have loved to meet the man."},{"Title":"Code Of The Woosters","review":"In his excellent introduction, Alexander Cockburn notes that &quot;the true Wodehouse fan has the concentration of a butterfly, fluttering inconsequently over Wodehouse country and prattling foolishly about favored features of the region. Very irritating, for serious tourists and new arrivals.&quot;Do not fret. Within a few pages both the initiate and the expert will be won over. This is a superb book in the Wooster-Jeeves series, full of Wooster's malapropisms, preposterous schemes, boggled literary quotes (&quot;the snail was on the wing and the lark on the thorn--or rather, the other way around . . . &quot;) and memories of hi-jinks at Eton and the Drones' club. Then there is Jeeves, the gentleman's gentleman, aware of his subordinate position to Wooster, but--as admitted by all-- possessing a greater knowledge of &quot;the psychology of the individual.&quot; Consider the following exchange between Bertie and the ever-troubled Augustus &quot;Gussie&quot; Fink-Nottle: &quot;this is frightful, Bertie.&quot; &quot;Not too good, no.&quot; &quot;I'm in the soup.&quot; &quot;Up to the thorax.&quot; &quot;What's to be done?&quot; &quot;I don't know.&quot; &quot;Can't you think of anything?&quot; &quot; Nothing. We must put out trust in a higher power.&quot; &quot;Consult Jeeves, you mean?&quot;The book's events appear to take place soon after those described in &quot;Right Ho, Jeeves,&quot; and before &quot;Joy in the Morning.&quot; As mentioned above, one is easily drawn into the humorous misadventures of our protagonists and their screwball plotting against Gussie's fianc&eacute;'s father and his neo-Fascist friend, Spode, modeled after England's Sir Oswald Mosley. Written in 1938, even the humorous hand of Wodehouse touches on the threat of the fascist &quot;black shorts&quot; (the shirts, apparently, had already been taken).Lighthearted fare, but perfectly crafted by a master of modern farce. This book is simply a delight, a compote of impossibly funny personalities sweetened with a meringue of wit and satire. P.G. Wodehouse, along with those other two-initialed humorists of the early to mid-20th century (E.B. White, S.J. Perelman, A.J. Leibling) is one of our most treasured writers. Give &quot;The Code of the Woosters&quot; a try; I think you'll soon join his legion of fans. Most highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Code Of The Woosters","review":"In the circles I run in, Wodehouse is not a well-known name. Thus it doesn't surprise me that it's taken this long for my first trip through the tulips with Jeeves and Wooster. It saddens me, but it doesn't surprise me. \\"Saddens\\" for this confection is the perfect mix of all of the elements of comedy.On one level, the story is classic bedroom farce. The action takes place in a country house, where people are constantly running from one room to another. Everytime one door opens, a new misunderstanding occurs and the plot is violently thrown in another direction. It makes one realize how effective a well-constructed bedroom farce can be in delivering sparkling comedy.On top of the farcical elements, Wodehouse also manages to throw in some biting satire. There are well placed but subtle jabs at fascism, fashionable psychology, and upper class morality. They never trip up the story, only serving as wonderful little digressions that do much to add weight to the lighter elements.The book is populated by a wonderfully motley crew of snooty misfits, each doing their bit to stoke the fires of the story. But the cake is taken by Jeeves and Wooster themselves. Neither could exist without the other (at least in a literary sense). The first fifty or so pages prove this, as Wooster heads up to the country house ahead of his manservant. The character flounders during these sections. Only when Jeeves arrives (to save the day, natch) does the narrative gain an even greater head of steam. I can't imagine how tedious it would be to listen to Bertie Wooster's mindless meanderings for a whole book, without the simple and economic replies of his man Jeeves. They are the pins in the balloons that release Bertie's hot air. As I said before, this is my first foray into Jeeves and Wooster country, so I can't say if the other tales in the series live up to the standard set here. It would seem like an impossible task.The brilliance of the Jeeves/Wooster dichotomy is that Wodehouse doesn't take the easy route; that is, telling the story through Jeeves narration. It would be too easy to allow us into Jeeves brain, where we would either be confronted by his undying loyalty (which the reader could never understand, given the ignorance of his charge) or his hatred for Bertie (which would undermine the whole tale). Rather, we get Bertie's side of things, and his ambiguous depiction of his man makes Jeeves that much more intriguing a character. And furthermore, it allows Bertie to be a very interesting \\"unreliable narrator\\". We cannot trust -- but can laugh at -- his recollections of past events (the book is told entirely through recollections), or his characterization of hisself (in which he tries to pass himself off as an intellectual, rather than a pompous boob). The \\"unreliable narrator\\" is my favourite of the current post-modern literary fads, one which Wodehouse gleefully saunters through a half century before its time (side note: for a fine example of a case where the modest butler also serves as the \\"unreliable narrator\\", see Kazuo Ishiguro's book \\"The Remains of the Day\\", a personal favourite of mine).One cautionary note, though: in this edition, don't read the introduction first. Alexander Cockburn can't help but give away some key plot points in the examples he provides of Wodehouse's comedic prose. It is a finely written essay, but it belongs at the end rather than the beginning, so to not spoil the reader's fun of discovery. Other than that mild criticism, this is a perfect piece of comedy."},{"Title":"Code Of The Woosters","review":"Bertie Wooster's is a different world. A different world indeed, even from the jazzy age of 1920s and 30s England that P. G. Wodehouse employs as his setting. The code of the Woosters is to never let a friend down, and Bertie would do this far more often were it not for his tactful and clever gentleman's personal gentleman, Jeeves. Bertie is a marvelous type of fellow: over-educated but under-intelligent; useless to society but wealthy beyond any need for scruple; completely numbed by the simple pleasures of an aristocratic life, but always there for his friends and family in a pinch. Amusingly enough, very few of the people that Bertie is enlisted in aiding actually deserve anyone's help. He is variously bullied and cajoled--but usually blackmailed--into putting himself in the most precarious positions. He must steal a cow-shaped piece of silver or his Aunt Dahlia will never let him eat a meal served by her godly French chef; he must steal a policeman's helmet to indirectly prevent himself from betrothal to a starry-eyed ditz of a woman. Being a Wooster, of course, he would go through with such a wedding rather than be impolite.What makes Bertie's bumbling and stumbling antics the more amusing is that he fancies himself a man of wit and decisiveness. Nothing could be further from the truth. Jeeves is the man for that, as well as the man to keep Bertie from his predilection for screaming fashion faux pas.Wodehouse employs a wonderfully dry wit and a delivery that ranges between the anecdotal and the rat-a-tat. One finds oneself smiling through every page, and occasionally being forced to place the book on the side table so as not to harm in during a fit of laughing out loud. Wodehouse's influence on writers such as Evelyn Waugh, Kingsley Amis and Stephen Fry has enriched British literature of the last century, but he himself was a true original, as are Jeeves and Wooster."},{"Title":"Code Of The Woosters","review":"There are very few novels that can guarantee five good laughs a page and chuckles during all the spaces between, but the Bertie Wooster/Jeeves novels of P.G. Wodehouse fill the bill. It is even jollier when a good British comedian simply reads the novel to you, as does Jonathan Cecil in the Audio Partners release of the 1938 &lt;The Code of the Woosters: Jeeves to the Rescue&gt; (1-57270-182-X).Here on 6 audiocassettes with a total running time of 7 hours is one of the stories you might have seen dramatized on Masterpiece Theatre a while ago. Oh, you know, the one about Bertie having to steal a cow-shaped creamer from Sir Watkyn Bassett for his Aunt Dahlia. Along the way, he becomes entangled in the on again, off again engagement between the newt-loving Gussie Fink-Nottle and the simpering Madeline Bassett, Roderick Spode who heads the Black Shorts (since all the Black Shirts have been bought up by an Italian of the period) and harbors a shameful secret), Stiffy Bynge who wants to marry the local clergyman H.P. &quot;Stinker Pinker,&quot; and the local Constable whose helmet has been pinched.The plot is simple at first and then, as in any good farce, rapidly accelerates into the complexity of a Baroque French clock and with about as much socially redeeming value. We simply sit back and marvel at the mechanism as (to carry on the analogy) Wodehouse's puppet-like characters perform their intricate movements around the hapless Bertie Wooster who not for the first time in these stories tends to lose faith in Jeeves just as that master of intrigue is at his brainiest. All this in the inimitable Wodehouse upper-class British twit jargon and a world every bit as real as that of Damon Runyon and W.S. Gilbert, providing you accept certain premises.Jonathan Cecil was very badly miscast as Arthur Hastings in two or three Poirot films in which Peter Ustinov played the sleuth. Here he is a gem, reading as he does every word of the novel and acting out every character, male and female, in a different voice. His reading, Wodehouse's literary style and plotting, and all the rest made 7 hours on the exerciser pass pleasantly quickly.Highly recommended even for more relaxed listeners."},{"Title":"Code Of The Woosters","review":"Previous: Right Ho, JeevesThis was my first excursion into the Wonderful World of Wodehouse, and remains my favorite (though others are in close contention). The plot is simply brilliant, tightly woven together with twists and turns and ingenious irony, and flows directly from the story in Right Ho, Jeeves. Between silver cow-creamers, little leather notebooks, ferocious dogs named Bartholomew, police constables and their helmets, angry neo-Nazis with buried secrets, and the looming threat of the soppy Madeline Bassett, laugh-out-loud comedy is inevitable. Funnier still is the fact that once Bertie arrives at the dreaded Totleigh Towers, all the action takes place in one day and night, making this the most fast-paced of the Jeeves books. This is one instance in which Bertie is never to blame for the soup in which he finds himself-it is thrust upon him by others, either by cajoling or blackmail, and Bertie's ever-good-hearted nature is taken advantage of to full extent. It is Jeeves to the rescue once again. The ending will leave you smiling-and finally able to take a deep breath and relax!Next: Joy in the Morning (Jeeves in the Morning)"},{"Title":"Code Of The Woosters","review":"As with any novel about Jeeves and Wooster, I don't want to give too much away. Much of the humor is not just in the language but in how surprisingly complex things can get before they are resolved. So my first suggestion is to skip the introduction by Alexander Cockburn who quotes some of the funnier scenes in the book.Now as for the story it involves a cow-creamer, a small leather book, two marriages, a want-to-be Dictator and a police helmet.The Code of the Woosters has 222 pages of some of the best dry British humor ever to come from P.G. Wodehouse's pen. As always the dialogue between Bertie Wooster and his man Jeeves is some of the greatest you will ever encounter in your whole life. How one book can contain so much is beyond me but this is, as any of his books are, a must for any library."},{"Title":"Code Of The Woosters","review":"An early critic of P.G. Wodehouse complained that his second book was identical to his first, only the character names had changed. In response, Wodehouse resolved to continue writing identical stories, but to keep his character names the same. And so, The Code of the Woosters is nearly identical to all other Jeeves and Wooster novels; Bertie gets into a sticky situation, inadvertently makes things worse, and is ultimately rescued by Jeeves. Could any one of them possibly be any good if they are all so unoriginal? Yes. In fact, they are all excellent. How? Wodehouse was a genius; reading any one of his books will prove it to you. His characters are unforgettable. His narrative is brilliant. Above all, his books are hilarious, and The Code of the Woosters is one of his finest.Betram (Bertie) Wooster, a lazy, bumbling (but well meaning!) gentleman living in Britain during the early 1900's, is pressured by his aunt Dahlia to steal a cow-shaped milk creamer from Sir Watkyn Bassett, a magistrate who once fined Bertie five \`quid' for \`pinching' a policeman's helmet. The task is made complicated by the presence of Roderick Spode, the amateur dictator who founded \`the black shorts' and who is a friend of Sir Watkyn; Spode is watching Bertie like a hawk and threatens to break his neck if he sees Bertie so much as glance at the cow-creamer. Things go downhill when Gussie Fink-Nottle (a newt fancying friend of Bertie's) suffers a snag with his engagement to Madeline Basset (a dreamy girl who holds opinions like \`the stars are God's daisy chain,' and who thinks that Bertie is madly in love with her). Bertie rushes to patch things up between them, but nearly becomes engaged to Madeline himself. In the end, only Jeeves, Bertie's brilliant, (almost) all-knowing manservant, can guide Bertie out of these troubled waters.If you aren't familiar with P.G. Wodehouse's dynamic duo, you owe it to yourself to read this book. I guarantee you won't be able to stop laughing. Nearly every line is comical. The narration itself (the story is told by Bertie) is positively hilarious. And so, I give The Code of the Woosters the highest marks I can!"},{"Title":"Code Of The Woosters","review":"This book by P.G.Wodehouse is one of the best books ever.This is one book where Jeeves (coupled with Aunt Dahlia) are at their very best.It's about a very strange situash (as Bertie would put it) wherin Bertie has to steal an old 18th Century Cow Creamer for his Uncle Tom wanted, failing which his Aunt Dahlia would no longer permit him to taste the cooking of her master chef Anatole again. And, if this isn't bad enough, Bertie's freinds, Gussie Fink-Nottle and the Rev. Henry 'Stinker' Pinker make it worse. And, worst part of it all is old Pop Basset, his buddy and future Dictator of England, Roderick Spode as also Pop Basset's daughter, Madeline and her cousin Stiffy Byng. This book is best read with a dictionary and it is strictly recommended that you avoid the foreign phrases"},{"Title":"Code Of The Woosters","review":"All of the P.G. Wodehouse novels about Bertram (&quot;Bertie&quot;) Wooster and his gentleman's gentleman, Jeeves, are funny. Some are reasonably complicated in their plots. But none compare to this classic in the series.From the beginning, Bertie is up against impossible odds. Sent by his Aunt Dahlia to sneer at a Cow Creamer, Bertie dangerously bumps into Sir Watkyn Bassett, the magistrate who once fined him five guineas for copping a policeman's helmet on Boat Race night, and Roderick Spode, Britain's aspiring fascist dictator. The only trouble in this encounter is that Bertie is clutching the Cow Creamer on the sidewalk after having tripped on a cat and falling through the front door, and Sir Watkyn recognizes him as a former criminal. Barely escaping arrest on the spot, Bertie returns home to find that Aunt Dahlia wants him to debark immediately for Totley Towers where Sir Watkyn has just taken the Cow Creamer he has purchased after pulling a ruse on Uncle Tom. When there, Bertie is to steal the Cow Creamer. At the same time, he receives urgent telegrams from his old pal, Gussie Fink-Nottle, to come to Totley Towers to save his engagement to Madeleine Bassett. Bertie feels like he is being sent into the jaws of death.Jeeves immediately fetches up a plot to get Madeleine Bassett, to whom he has been affianced twice, to invite Bertie to her father's home. Upon arriving, Sir Watkyn and Roderick Spode immediately catch him holding the Cow Creamer. Sir Watkyn threatens years in jail, until Madeleine comes in to rescue him. But Sir Watkyn proceeds to assume that everything that goes wrong from then is due to Bertie. For once, Bertie is the innocent party. But he takes the rap anyway, because of the code of the Woosters, never let a pal down.Never has anyone had a goofier set of pals. Gussie Fink-Nottle has developed spiritually so that he has less fear, but his method of achieving this soon puts him in peril. Stephanie &quot;Stiffy&quot; Byng, Sir Watkyn's niece, has to be the goofiest acquaintance that Bertie has. She is a one-woman wrecking machine for creating havoc. Her fiance, another old pal of Bertie's, &quot;Stinker&quot; Pinker, the local curate, is only slightly better.Just when you cannot see any way that Bertie can avoid gaol, Jeeves comes up with one brilliant plan after another. It's truly awe-inspiring as well as side-splittingly funny.P.G. Wodehouse remarked that he preferred to write as though the subject were musical comedy, and he has certainly captured that mood here at its vibrant best. You'll be on the edge of your chair and trying to avoid falling on the floor laughing at the same time.After you've followed more twists and turns than existed in the Labyrinth at Crete, consider how far you would go to save a pal . . . or to keep a secret . . . or to protect a loved one. What should the personal code be?Be generous with your friends and to all humankind."},{"Title":"Code Of The Woosters","review":"This is my favourite Jeeves & Wooster story yet. It had me laughing out loud; a bit annoying for my wife trying to work nearby. This is a great story and a handsomely bound, affordable book from Overlook."},{"Title":"Code Of The Woosters","review":"This has to be among the best of Wodehouse. As so many other reviewers have remarked, the novel has a fluid feel to it; total and complete chaos. Starting with an ominous phone call from Aunt Dahlia, Bertie jumps from bowl to bowl constantly in the soup.I loved the quotes from this book, on things being gruntled and what not. The characters are also amazing. Sir Watkyn Bassett, the treacly Madeleine, with Spode running after Bertie wanting to break his bones, the dog Bartholomew (this was perhaps one place where I almost laughed out loud) which terrorizes Bertie and Jeeves when (I think) they have to take shelter on top of the cupboard-Bertie goes to great lengths introducing this terrier. The moment is when they throw a candle at Bartholomew and it eats it.The cow creamer plays no small part in the plot. It is a hideous silver jug that uncle Tom collects. Aunt Dahlia wants Bertie to 'sneer' at it by saying that its modern dutch, which might lower its value, apparently.There is also Stephanie Byng and stinker Pinker who constantly trips over things. And constable dobbs, Aunt Dahlia herself, and Gussie Fink Nottle. There couldn't have been a more ridiculous set of characters than here.This,and perhaps some of the Pig books (Pigs have wings, and Summer Lightning come readily to mind). I wish the world were as nice as that depicted by Wodehouse."},{"Title":"Code Of The Woosters","review":"The Code of the Woosters, by the inimitable P. G.

I would highly recommend this book to everybody who likes this type of literature."},{"Title":"Code Of The Woosters","review":"I'd only read Wodehouse's short stories, and that a long time ago. This book amazed me by maintaining the comic pace that he keeps in his short stories, building setup upon setup and yet never descending to the level of the contrived payoff. Each punchline is genuine and builds on the previous ones, and when I laughed aloud in the middle of the book and someone wanted to know what was so funny, I realized there was no way to explain it without sitting them down and making them read the book. Absolutely wonderful comic writing, and well worth picking up for a lazy Sunday afternoon."},{"Title":"Code Of The Woosters","review":"Wodehouse is in my opinion the most underrated author in the englich language. He is too often dismissed as merely writing 'amusing' and escapist fiction which offers no insight into our soceity or the lives we lead. I would like to point out to the advocates of so called &quot;serious literature&quot; that Wodehouse invokes in us the most basic feeling we can experience...laughter. I cannot help but be overcome by Wodehouse's unbelievably adept use of the english language to create the most hilariously subtle situation comedy ever written. I cant recommend this book strongly enough. Wodehouse exhausts all superlatives!"},{"Title":"Code Of The Woosters","review":"Spode is one of Plum's more memorable villians, just as Mrs Travers is Bertie's kind and loving aunt.This is perhaps the second most hilarious book by Wodehouse.

It's the perfect introduction to Wodehouse's farcical world. The thing that makes this series stand out from the Blandings series and everything else is that they're told by clueless, intellectually-challanged Bertie Wooster, and this adds a delicious extra layer of humor. This is also why any performance of the Jeeves novels will necessarily only catch a fraction of the wit to be found in the books. You get the situations but not the narration. Jeeves In the Morning was titled Joy In the Morning in Britain, by the way. Fair warning: read either Code of the Woosters or Jeeves In the Morning and you risk becoming a Wodehouse fan for life. (Of course, I think it's a risk you should take.)"},{"Title":"Code Of The Woosters","review":"Wilfred Sheed in the forward to \\"Leave it to Psmith\\" classified Wodehouse, along with Gilbert and Sullivan, as anti artist artists. Anti artist artists were born something out of a reaction to English public opinion against Byron and Shelley and their questionable views and lifestyles. Their motive is to knock high ideals off their perspective horses. While Europe was taking art seriously, maybe too seriously, with rebellious Wagnerian operas and psychological probings of Flauberts and Prousts and such the English were being amused by Gilbert and Sullivan and other entertainment of high silliness. There is a method to the madness of Wodehouse and that is to knock down any art that takes itself too seriously.Wodehouse can draw one sophmoric prank out into a mini novel which at time can be tedious and at times masterful. In the end not much is really said here or is it?"},{"Title":"Code Of The Woosters","review":"I love Wodehouse's Jeeves book. My review and rating concern the Overlook Press edition. While this edition is commendable in many ways, it falls short in one critical respect. The hardcover, binding, and paper are very nice. However, the font is small. I'm not that old, and I read a lot for work and pleasure. The font is appreciably smaller than usual for hardbacks, paperbacks, magazines, newspapers, and journal articles. It strains the eyes. So, while Wodehouse's content would merit a 5, this edition gets a 3. Hopefully, this review will help someone who (like me) is already a fan of Wodehouse and is looking for a nice hardcover. This edition would be perfect if the font were larger."},{"Title":"Code Of The Woosters","review":"As always, simple minded Bertie is in the soup. He has gotten on the wrong side of Sir Watkyn Bassett and his close pal Spode for trying to grab a silverware for his Uncle Tom, which Bassett had an eye on. Aunt Dahlia (Tom's wife) sends him to Totleigh Towers to steal it. Also, at Totleigh Towers, Bertie's pal Gussie is preparing to get married to Madeline (Watkyn's daughter). Meanwhile, Stiffy (Watkyn's nice) is in love with Pinker (another pal of Bertie). When Bertie arrives at Totleigh Towers, everything that can go wrong with the lives of these people, breaks loose. And all of them are aimed at Bertie! Bertie faces all of it with the help of his faithful butler Jeeves and all ends well.If there were no sitcom on TV, Wodehouse would have invented it. The outlandish characters, the outrageous dialogues, all set in rich classic Britain. I couldn't help laughing out loud while reading this book. Between all these stormy characters is the real hero of the books -- Jeeves with his cucumber cool air. Wodehouse cannot be explained, has to be read. I see a definite movie potential in his books.In case you were wondering, The Code Of The Woosters is \\"Never let a pal down."},{"Title":"Code Of The Woosters","review":"While this book was quite enjoyable, it is not a thriller, filled with twists and conspiracies and secret societies, along the lines of the Da Vinci code, which starred Tom Hanks.

I bought this at the bargain price of $3.95 for a supposedly \\"unabridged\\" audio recording of Wodehouse's book. What I got was a 3-hour theater production -- not the audiobook edition at all! The dead giveaway is as follows:Publisher: L.A. Theatre Works-- that is, a theatrical company, not an audiobook publishing house. So the headline -- \\"The Code of the Woosters [Unabridged] [Audible Audio Edition]\\" -- is completely misleading. Instead of one person reading you the complete text of the original book, you get several actors acting out a very abridged version of the book (as if it's a play, and given the audience applause, it may well have been a play that they recorded).I have brought this mistake to the attention of Amazon's customer service department and asked for a refund (so I can go buy the real thing). On the other hand, if you really want a 3-hour shortened theatrical version of this novel... then this recording is fine."},{"Title":"Code Of The Woosters","review":"THE CODE OF THE WOOSTERS defied my usual reading style. That style is interactive and generates marginalia, which absolutely fills the white space of books I enjoy. But my copy of TCotW is nearly pristine, with the reading experience provoking few comments. Not to sound pompous; but for me, this novel was dull fluff, albeit a masterful demonstration of voice. Still, I recognize my limits. If I were a Brit or more aware of the conventions of 1930's British social satire, then maybe...TCotW gains life after Wodehouse establishes the character Sir Watkyn Bassett, who is the antagonist of Bertie Wooster, as Bertie is charged with snatching a silver cow creamer and battles, in his twitish way, to foster the nuptials of Stiffy and Madeline. Sir B is a magistrate, host, and wealthy man who Wodehouse eventually endows with gravitas. Once this exists, Bertie's shenanigans become funny, especially in Chapter Nine, when he asks Sir B for permission to marry Stiffy. Without Sir B's grounding, the novel is merely highly-mannered farce and not especially amusing.A good way to read TCotW is to tic the margins whenever Wodehouse uses an archaic or obscure word or expression. \\"How my Aunt Agatha's McIntosh niffed to heaven...\\" \\"She biffed off and I leaned...\\" \\"That's where you're making your bloomer.\\" \\"... a bucket of cold water right into the mazzard.\\" \\"Snootered to the bursting point...\\" \\"...and come a purler in the bathtub.\\" In his use of such words and expressions, Wodehouse shows he is an exacting and playful writer."},{"Title":"Code Of The Woosters","review":"THE CODE OF THE WOOSTERS is one of the few novel-length works about \\"intellectually negligable\\" young aristocrat Bertie Wooster and his titan of a valet Jeeves. I found the CODE OF THE WOOSTERS somewhat entertaining, though about two-thirds of the way through it starts to drag and all in all left me unimpressed.Summarising the setup of the novel would be difficult, but it begins with a battle over a cow-shaped creamer. The cow creamer is desired by Bertie's Aunt Dahlia and Uncle Tom, but is bought instead by Sir Watkyn Bassett, the retired magistrate who once fined Bertie five pounds for stealing a policeman's helmet. Aunt Dahlia gives Bertie a choice between infiltrating Bassett's house and stealing the cow creamer, or never again tasting the wonderful meals of her French chef Anatole. Two related problems are the engagements of Bassett's niece Stephanie \\"Stiffy\\" Byng and Bertie's school chum Harold \\"Stinker\\" Pinker, and Basset's daughter Madelaine and Wooster friend Gussie Fink-Nottle. There's also Roderick Spode, Watkyn's menacing associate and the leader of a fascist group called the Saviours of Britain. The book was published in 1937, and through Spode Wodehouse makes a few jabs against Hitler and Mussolini.In spite of its observation of human social interactions which really are often zany, the novel does seem somewhat far-fetched. A character hears a major revelation but reacts too tamely, the plot's resultion in the last couple of pages seems like an easy way out of a book starting to run out of steam.There are a few moments in THE CODE OF THE WOOSTERS which made me laugh out loud, and therefore I do cautiously recommend the book. However, it is a somewhat insubstantial novel, and falls into a three-star rating.

Jeeves' solutions are always fascinating, as is his &quot;sang froid&quot;, as Bertie would say. I must strongly suggest to the first-time reader, read the introduction LAST. Alexander Cockburn does a decentish job of analyzing the story, but not without doing some major spoiling of plots. Lastly, I would argue my own opinion that the Wodehousian plots are not the strongest point of the book, but the breezy, conversational narrative style of the main protaginist, Bertram Wilberforce Wooster. This (funny in and of itself) is hilarious agaisnt the backdrop of his hyper-intelligent valet (or &quot;gentleman's personal gentleman&quot;, as Jeeves refers to himself), strong-willed women, clutzy or (dare I use the word to describe a character of the 30's) nerdy friends, and comical villains.

Wodehouse outdid himself with this classic; every line is a howler and every character, from Aunt Dahlia, to Roderick Spode, to &quot;Stinker&quot; Pinker and that &quot;Spink-Bottle&quot; to Bertram himself...just perfect gems of literary shenanigans. Read this book for no other reason than to bask in the obvious joy Wodehouse took in his language and in the work and play of writing!"},{"Title":"Code Of The Woosters","review":"\\"The Code of the Woosters\\" by P.G. Wodehouse is a riotous romp through an English country manor that sees that poor protagonist, Bertie Wooster, the center of attentions he least desires. The title refers to the fact that a Wooster will always help a friend, even to his own detriment and possible imprisonment. \\"The Code of the Woosters\\" is a laugh-out-loud rambling story full of canceled engagements, thievery, and the brillance of Jeeves.Bertie Wooster's troubles begin when his friend Gussie Fink-Nottle fears that his engagement to Madeline Basset (a previous fiance of Bertie's) has been irreparably damaged. He asks Bertie to visit them at Madeline's house, a trip that Bertie loathes to take, for he has had a previous run-in with Madeline's father, a magistrate, over a prank snatching that occured in his younger days. Bertie's Aunt Dahlia is thrilled that her nephew will be at Totleigh Towers, for she wants him to snatch an antique silver cow creamer that Basset bought from under her husband's nose. Bertie doesn't want to follow through on his aunt's wishes, but his host has already fingered him as a crook when the cow creamer indeed goes missing, along with a local police officer's helmet, the same \\"crime\\" Bertie committed in his youth. It doesn't help Bertie's state of mind when his friend's engagement is in a constant state of flux and the girl might be intending to marry him instead. Only Jeeves can come up with a satisfactory solution to all the problems facing his master.\\"The Code of the Woosters\\" is as convoluted a plot as Wodehouse ever created. Just when Bertie believes one obstacle to be overcome, another graver misfortune takes its place. The solution is humorously satisfying and well worth the rambling road it takes to get there."},{"Title":"Code Of The Woosters","review":"I got this book for my birthday on May 30th, this year. I guess that makes me new. But, I can say this, this is undoubtedly the best Jeeves book that Mr Wodehouse ever wrote!The main story is about how Bertie has to steal a cowcreamer for Aunt Dahlia or else he'll never eat from her godly French chef Anatole's dishes again!Along the way, he meets Sir Watkyn Bassett, who once fined him a fiver on Boat Race Night for pinching a policeman's helmet. With Sir Watkyn is his friend and soon-to-be-nephew Dictator Roderick Spode.Sir Watkyn, showing Bertie's Uncle Tom lobster, upsets Uncle Tom's stomach, and takes the cowcreamer. Meanwhile, Bertie gets a message from Gussie Fink-Nottle, who is going to marry Sir Watkyn's daughter Madeline. Gussie screws up the engagement, and it's up to Bertie to fix it.Then Spode says if Bertie pinches the cowcreamer, he'll beat him to a pulp, and, as I've said too much, you should go buy it!

Sir Bassett was once a magistrate, and he remembers Bertie from a past appearance in his court (a matter of stealing a police constable's helmet during the exuburance of his college days).Events lead to complications as Bertie ends up as a house guest at the Bassett estate, where he tries to mend the romances of both Madeline and her cousin Stephanie, while Aunt Dahlia is intent on recovering the cow creamer that Sir Bassett had made off with - she is willing to use a little larceny. Events lead to a little blackmail - it is always useful to know something about someone that the person does not want the public to know about - and a little horse trading when you have matters that a person needs settled (preferably out of court).It is the usual Wooster and Jeeves, with the supporting cast of characters, including Bertie's old classmate and fellow member of the Drones Club, Gussie Fink-Nottle; and introducing another old school acquaintance, Harold Pinker, who is now a curate at the local village. I don't think that it is necessarily the funniest, but it is delightful light reading. It was published in 1938, just before the onset of World War II."},{"Title":"Code Of The Woosters","review":"This book had me laughing all the way through.

We follow the further meetings and doings of Bertie Wooster through a mirthful chain of people and merry events which tangles itself about poor Bertie linking him to that blasted cow creamer like a prisoner to his iron ball, until finally Bertie's valet Jeeves as usual frees him from the whole mess and rids him of all worries.But what the deuce is a cow creamer anyway? It is a vessel, part of a dessert and coffee service, used to serve cream and shaped in the form of a cow. Of course that's what it had to be, and I would have figured it out on my own too. After all anyone will tell you that grand old chap Vincent is no stranger to the more rarified items of trivia and that he can trivialize with the best of them. There's always something working in the old bean as they say. In any case, I'd have been able to figure out the purpose of this object, from the name alone in fact, had I for a minute imagined it possible that such a silly thing could have existed in the first place.That the book follows P.G. Wodehouse's classic Jeeves & Wooster formula doesn't make it less entertaining, nor does it eliminate all surprises. Great fun.Trivia: The Code of the Woosters is set in the late 1930s, just before WWII and Wodehouse satirizes Hitler in much the same way Charlie Chaplin did in is film \\"The Great Dictator\\".Vincent Poirier, Dublin"},{"Title":"Code Of The Woosters","review":"After reading some recommendations, Michael Dirda's especially, I decided to give Wodehouse a try.

While it might be preferable to the Wodehouse newcomer to start with some of the earlier stories (pick up \\"Carry on Jeeves,\\" which contains the above mentioned story), this is as good a place to start as any. The humor ranges from subtle to laugh-out-loud hysterical. Trust me; pick it up and you'll read it over and over again."},{"Title":"Code Of The Woosters","review":"P G Wodehouse was very likely the funniest, most inventive and creative humorist in the English language, as agile a wordsmith as Shakespeare and far more prolific. There are very, very few of his books which are not every bit as funny today as they were when first published. (You may wish to avoid the very first school stories, but that's about it.)The Code of the Woosters is of a piece with all Bertie/Jeeves novels, that is to say, brilliantly funny. The plot, which is as complicated and involved as any in British farce, is just about beside the point, as so much of the value in reading Wodehouse is in admiration and enjoyment of the language, the outrageous similes, the references to snippets by everyone from Browning to the Bible to contemporary stage songs, and the ridiculous characters, but even then this one is admirably involved. Somehow a book involving a would-be dictator (of the Black Shorts), a nauseautingly ugly cow-creamer, a journal of the repellent or objectionable mannerisms of one's companions, friendly aunts and domineering country-house hosts, etc etc et multiple cetera, all combine to jam 222 pages of joy, which cannot but leave you with a huge grin on your face as you close the book. Like every Jeeves & Wooster novel, it is a must buy."},{"Title":"Code Of The Woosters","review":"Code of the Woosters served as my introduction to the oeuvre of Wodehouse, and, I must say, it was an exceedingly pleasant introduction at that. The book is absolute comic brilliance; it sets the standard for what lesser folks (like Carl Hiaasen) have tried to accomplish on their own right.Some books are read once and discarded, but Code of the Woosters, I feel, has the rare quality of being able to be read time and time again...not just cover-to-cover, but at any particularly mirthful point which captures the reader's fancy. (The number of laugh-out-loud vignettes are too numerous to list.)The only negatives to the book were the verbose introduction by left-wing crank Alexander Cockburn (if I had a name like \\"Cockburn\\" I'd be a bit edgy myself) and the relatively scant presence of Jeeves. Not that he plays a cameo role, but one does wish he figured more prominently.If you haven't read this yet, you are in for a treat."},{"Title":"Code Of The Woosters","review":"The Code of the Woosters, by the inimitable P. G. Wodehouse, is a fun and enjoyable romp with Bertie Wooster and his Man Jeeves. This novel features numerous plotlines, including but not limited to, the battle over a cow creamer, a lost notebook, romantic entanglements, the theft of a policeman's helmet, a potential jail sentence for Bertie, a dictator, and more romantic entanglements. Each plotline is brought to a conclusion by the brilliance of \\"Plum\\" the excellent English humorist. The book is full of hilarious one liners and brilliant wit. Amazingly, this novel was first published in 1938, yet it is still full of timely situations.This novel of classic comedy introduces us to Totleigh Towers and its owner, Sir Watkin Bassett. Several memorable mainstay characters are in this book including Gussie Fink-Nottle, Aunt Dahlia, Madeline Bassett, and Stiffy Bing. Any journey taken with Wooster and Jeeves is time well spent.

Wodehouse's best entry in the Bertie and Jeeves series. It is a deliciously funny and clever little novel, revolving around the acquisition of an antique cow creamer. Bertie summarizes his pickle perfectly:\\"Right. Now then. Item One-Aunt Dahlia says that if I don't pinch that cow-creamer and hand it over to her, she will bar me from her table, and no more of Anatole's cooking.''Yes, sir.''We now come to Item Two-vis., if I do pinch the cow-creamer and hand it over to her, Spode will beat me to a jelly.''Yes, sir.''Furthermore-Item Three-if I do pinch it and hand it over to her and don't pinch it and hand it over to Harold Pinker, not only shall I undergo the jellying process alluded to above, but Stiffy will take that notebook of Gussie's and hand it over to Sir Watkyn Bassett. And you know and I know what the result of that would be. Well, there you are. That's the set-up. You've got it?'Yes, sir. It is certainly a somewhat unfortunate state of affairs.\\" (106).Revealing much more of the humor involves revealing more of the plot, which I won't do. I will simply say that Wodehouse was one of the literary comic greats of his time. This novel is a good place to start."},{"Title":"Code Of The Woosters","review":"A critic of P.G. Wodehouse complained that his second book was identical to his first; only the character names had changed. In response, Wodehouse resolved to keep his character names the same from then on. And so, The Code of the Woosters is nearly identical to all other Jeeves and Woosters; Bertie gets into a sticky situation, inadvertently makes things worse, and is ultimately rescued by Jeeves. Could any one of them possibly be any good if they are all so unoriginal? Yes. In fact, they are all excellent. How? Wodehouse was a genius; reading any one of his books will prove it to you. His characters are unforgettable. His narrative is brilliant. Above all, though, his books are hilarious, and The Code of the Woosters is one of his finest.Betram (Bertie) Wooster, a lazy, bumbling (but well meaning!) gentleman living in Britain during the early 1900's, is pressured by his aunt Dahlia to steal a cow-shaped milk creamer from Sir Watkyn Bassett, a magistrate who once fined Bertie five \`quid' for \`pinching' a policeman's helmet. The task is made complicated by the presence of Roderick Spode, the amateur dictator who founded \`the black shorts' and friend of Sir Basset, who is watching Bertie like a hawk and threatens to break his neck if he sees Bertie so much as glance at the cow-creamer. Things go further downhill when Gussie Fink-Nottle's (a newt fancying friend of Bertie's) engagement with Madeline Basset (a dreamy girl who holds opinions like \`the stars are god's daisy chain' who thinks that Bertie is madly in love with her) becomes shaky and Bertie rushes to patch things up between them. In the end, only Jeeves, Bertie's brilliant, (almost) all-knowing manservant, can guide Bertie out of these troubled waters.If you aren't familiar with P.G. Wodehouse's dynamic duo, you owe it to yourself to read this book. I guarantee you won't be able to stop laughing. Every single line is comical. The narration itself (the story is told by Bertie) is positively hilarious.

They must contend with enormous curate Harold &quot;Stinker&quot; Pinker, his devious fiancee Stiffy Byng, the perpetually creepy Sir Watkyn Basset, his wannabe-Nazi friend Roderick Spode, fish-faced Gussie Fink-Nottle, and--worst of all--the soppy Madeleine Basset, who constantly believes that Bertie is madly in love with her.With a cast like that, things are bound to go wrong. To steel up his courage for fiancee Madeleine, Gussie writes down degrading things about Sir Watkyn and Spode in a leather notebook--and promptly loses it. The blackmailing Stiffy Byng takes the notebook and will give it to Gussie if Bertie convinces her fiancee, Stinker Pinker, to steal a policeman's helmet.Still here?The characters are caricatures, but they're GOOD caricatures!

In addition there is an appendix which in 1 paragraph for each of the 50 states outlines the settlement procedures in each and every state. There is also 10 pages of blank forms in the back of the book, which are suitable for copying and using. The book is easy to read taking a complicated and foreign subject and breaking it down and explaining it. It comes as no surprise that this book is used by real estate schools and professionals. Every real estate professional should have a copy and read it as well as use it for reference. If you ever had questions about a real estate closing, those questions are probably answered by this book. If you are only ever going to buy one or two properties this book is going to be over kill, but if your plans include buying multiple properties and you are a real estate investor, then this book will be a helpful tool in your real estate toolbox.The illustrator is Dave Patton, who also did fine work in Leigh Robinson's excellent book \\"Landlording\\".My only reservation is that some aspects of settlement are handled differently in different states and locales, that everything could not be covered in this book. There is no standard for settlements in different states and some states use different documents.

Jones. The author is better known to some for his novel, This Island Earth, which was turned into a cheesy 1950s B movie and later lampooned on MST3K. But Jones' real claim to fame is the title short story in this book, The Non-statistical Man, which has been called the best science fiction ever written about the human sense of intuition. Like most interesting SF books, this one is long out of print. I'd read it before, many years ago, in an anthology or old pulp. I recently happened across this copy at an estate sale and bought it so I could re-read it.The Non-statistical Man is the story of Charles Bascomb, chief statistical analyst for a major insurance company; a man obsessed with logic and precision, a man who lives and breathes statistics, a man who endlessly ridicules his wife's sense of intuition. His world slowly turns upside down after he discovers a series of anomalous insurance claims. Somehow a growing number of people are buying exactly the insurance they need, just in time to make a claim, and then cancelling. Convinced there is something possibly illegal and definitely strange going on, Bascomb sets out to investigate.The trail leads to Dr. Magruder, an obvious quack who teaches self-help classes designed to develop the human sense intuition through a series of mental exercises and pills. The mental exercises are clearly nonsense and the pills turn out to be ordinary vitamins when analyzed. But somehow, where ever the doctor turns up, people begin outsmarting insurance companies. Every time Bascomb thinks he's close to understanding the scam, logic and statistics fail him. His wife's logic-defying intuition, however, repeatedly puts him back on the right track.If Bascomb can't put a stop to Magruder and his quackery, the entire insurance industry is doomed and field of statistics with it. In his desperation to preserve his world view and belief in statistics over intuition, Bascomb decides the only way to find out the doctor's secret is to sign up for classes, take the pills, and follow the exercises. Strange doesn't even begin to describe the events that follow.The other stories in the book are enjoyable footnotes in SF history but don't compare to The Non-statistical Man. The Gardener is the story of a child born with a mutation that gives him unusual mental powers. It's notable primarily for an early use of the term Homo Superior. The term originated from Olaf Stapledon's story Odd John in 1935.The Moon is Death, set in a future of interplanetary travel, is the story of astronauts sent to Earth's moon to find out why no mission there has ever returned. It reads like an early SF pulp story; you've got weird radiation, rapid aging, gun fights on rockets, and atomic explosions.I found Intermission Time marginally more interesting. It involves colonists travelling to a planet with two intentionally designed societies that are experiments in solving problems that have plagued human history. Two musicians, a brother and sister, are destined for one of the colonies. John, the brother, falls in love with Lora, a woman he meets aboard the ship who's destined for the other colony. Once a colonist commits to the voyage, they can't back out or change plans and both colonies are sealed against contact with the other. The two lovers are faced with a series of dilemmas and choices, balancing individual relationships against the good of the species.Lastly, I can't help but add that this is the 1968 Belmont Future Series (B50-820) paperback edition published by Belmont Books of New York with some interesting and uncredited cover art that looks suspiciously like it might be the work of Robert M. Powers."},{"Title":"The Non-Statistical Man","review":"I was both intrigued as well as a little disappointed in this book, mainly because I was expecting a lot more. I will say that I had the advantage of not knowing a single thing about it until I started reading it. It will be different for you, of course, if you read this review.Some say that this book (more like a short story, really) is all about intuition. I have heard it said that it is all about intuition. But I'm not sure that was the point Raymond F. Jones was trying to make. Perhaps more was the author's desire to encourage all readers to think outside the box.It is thought provoking, I'll give it that. The main character is a statistician who zealously embraces his techniques and practice as an employee of a big insurance company. But then, with the help of another main character we are introduced to, he discovers that he has a greater power than just a talent for numbers. He is dragged, painfully at times, into the world of intuition. But really, in my opinion, it was more like discovering one has the ability to foretell the future, almost the way a palm or crystal ball reader would. I'm exaggerating, but so did Jones.The other main point that Raymond Jones was perhaps making was what sort of impact this would have on society should individuals start tapping into it. With our main character's \\"former powers\\" as a statistician, he was deliberately doing wrong to people for the sake of making money for his employer. But as his newly discovered abilities in intuition evolve, he becomes more, well, moral. This is the part that confused me a bit. The story does go into evolution a bit, and it is discussed as to why humans gave up certain physical abilities that animals have over us on our way up the evolutionary chain. Well, the explanation is simple of course, to replace with powers of the mind. But would that make people \\"good\\" to employ intuition?Well that's where the reader is left. The story goes quickly. Do I recommend it? Yes, for the sake of getting a different perspective on things. But be prepared to have more questions than answers at the end of it.Kelly Libatique, author of \\"Divine Knowledge Transfer\\" and \\"A Toast to the Holy Ghost?\\"[...]"},{"Title":"OUTSIDER","review":"The political insights in the contemporary Italy are scrutinized with admirable fruition, through a timely, opportune and intelligent approach.Totally recommended for all kind of readers due its noted relevance."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"This book--at times disjointed, rambling, self-referential, and irreverent--is decades ahead of its time. It's an interdisciplinarian's dream as Twain takes on economics, geography, politics, ancient and contemporary history, and folklore with equal ease. Mostly though, one appreciates his knack for exaggeration, the tall tale, and the outright lie. It's a triumph of tone, as he lets you in on his wild wit, his keen observation, and his penchant for bending the truth without losing his credibility as a guide.The book's structure is also modern: He recounts his days as a paddlewheel steam boat \\"cub,\\" piloting the hundreds of miles of the Mississippi before the Civil War, then, in Part 2, returns to retrace his paddleboat route. Although a few of his many digressions don't work (they sometimes sound formulaic or too detailed) most of the narrative is extremely entertaining. Twain seems caught between admiration and disdain for the \\"modern\\" age-but he also rejects over-sentimentality over the past. He writes with beauty and cynicism, verve and humor.

Well, now that you've reached adulthood, you should make time to read _Life on the Mississippi_. It's mandatory reading if you live in a state that borders the great river, anywhere from Minnesota down to Louisiana. It's mandatory reading if you have come to that point in life when you can suddenly appreciate American history and post-Civil War stories written by someone who lived through that time.Writing in the first half of the 1870s, Twain retraces the steps of his youth: the watery highway he knew when he trained to be a riverboat pilot nearly 20 years earlier. He speaks of how life _was_ along the river, and what life _became_. It's almost a \\"you can't go home again\\" experience for him, while the reader gets the benefit of discovering both time periods.I have two favorite parts that I share with others. Chapter IX includes a wonderful dissertation about how learning the navigational intricacies of the river caused Twain to lose the ability to see its natural beauty. And Chapter XLV includes an assessment of how the people of the North and the South reacted differently to the war experience. If I were a social studies teacher, I'd use that last passage in a unit on the reconstruction period. So put this title on your vacation reading list, and don't fret: the chapters are short and are many -- 60! -- but you can stop at any time, and the words go by fast. _Life on the Mississippi_ should make you forget all about any Twain trauma and report-writing you may have suffered as a teenager. [This reviewer was an Illinois resident when these comments were written.]"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"This is the book that Mark Twain himself thought to be his greatest. It is basically a memoir in two parts of his life spent on the river with historical sketches, statistics, and other matters thrown in.The first part of the book tells of Twain's early years as a riverboat pilot. He talks about being a cub pilot, about learning about the intricacies of the river and the difficulties of navigating it, and about his mentor Horace Bixby. Twain's love of the river and his pride in \\"mastering\\" it are made obvious in these chapters.The second part recounts Twain's return to the river in 1882, mainly to \\"see it again\\" in preparation of writing this book. Starting in St. Louis, he first goes south through Baton Rouge to New Orleans. He spends a bit of time there and describes life as he sees it in the city (there's a funny chapter regarding the above-ground cemeteries and an argument about cremation). Then he heads north on the steamboat City of Baton Rouge, piloted by his old mentor Horace Bixby. He stops off in Hannibal for three days, just enough time to see how much the town and some old acquaintances have changed, and then continues all the way to St. Paul, Minnesota.Twain's humor, as he recounts conversations with people, sights seen, reminiscences dredged up, and a myriad of other matters that fill the book, is always evident. It's one of the great books on the mighty river, and whether you are a lover of the works of Mark Twain or interested in the Mississippi River during the time period just before and after the Civil War, you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"What a great novel! Twain is wonderfully funny, yet his scathing social commentary concerning his own times are as serious as a heart attack.When a Connecticut Yankee gets sent back in time to King Arthur's Court, he decides his superior knowledge should be used to educate such an \\"ignorant race.\\" Of course, we all know that the road to hell is paved with good intentions, and if I didn't know better, I would say that the person who coined the phrase did so after finishing this novel. The story's main character, Hank Morgan, is a likeable, if not laughable character, yet as most of us already know: absolute power corrupts absolutely. Once technology gets on a roll, the beast of civilization takes off running and Morgan cannot pull in the reigns. Total disaster ensues (incase you had not already guessed).This was a fun read and a look at a problem that is still very much alive today. Too much civilization can be like a disease, especially when those who are working to spread it find that they are doing it for reasons other than altruism.Also, do you remember the scene in \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" when Indiana Jones whips out his gun to shoot the sword-wielding Sultan? That scene was surely lifted from this very book!Trust me, this is a novel for thought, but one that will not bore you. Twain was a master and this is perhaps my favorite of his novels. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"You might wonder what prompted Mark Twain to sidle from \\"straight\\" fiction into the realm of outright fantasy. Twain transports a Connecticut shop foreman twelve centuries into the past [and 5 000 kilometres!] to Camelot and Arthur's court. Initially confused and dismayed, Hank Morgan's Yankee practicality is quickly aroused and he becomes a major figure among the panopolied knights. With the title of The Boss, his rank equals The King or The Pope with its uniqueness. His elevation doesn't distract him from a more profound impulse, however. Hank's Yankee roots and wide experience evoke an ambition - nothing less than revolution. He wants to sweep away the monarchy and aristocracy and establish an American-style republic in Arthurian Britain.Mark Twain's scathing criticism of the sham of hereditary monarchy bolstered by an Established Church makes this among his choicest writings. He resents the condition of a Church which \\"turned a nation of men into a nation of worms.\\" A fervent believer in individual freedom, Twain uses Hank to voice his disdain of Britain's royalty. It's no more than might be expected of a man who boasted of but one ancestor - who sat on the jury that executed Charles I. Hank knows revolutions never succeed when implemented from above. Revolution be achieved only when the individual's attitude changes from meek acceptance toself assertion. Hank's method reaches people through clandestine schools and factories, publication of a newspaper and establishment of a telephone system. These new forms of manufacture and communication become the foundation by which Hank expects to abolish the ancient, mis-named, chivalric tradition. Does he change the course of history?Twain relocates the roots of American democracy from the heart of the frontier yeoman farmer to the brain of the urban industrial worker. Here the man of wide, practical experience shows how to survive compared to those with a formal education. Hank has a simple ambition - establishment of a republic - but utilizes a broad spectrum of ideas to bring it about. He would gladly replace the Established Church of Rome with his own Presbyterian ideals, but is aware that it would be swapping one evil for another. \\"Each man should select his own religion, or make one\\" he contends. Yet, finally, it is this dread force that impairs his desire for change. The final sequence stands as a peer to the biblical Armageddon, Twain wallowing in a frightful bloodletting unseen in any of his other works.Mark Twain contrasts the Reign of Terror of the French Revolution with the centuries of slavery, serfdom, and poverty that killed countless more people than that spasm of excising of aristocracy. What else spurred him to write of human rights with such passion? He had written of slavery before, but this book is especially wrathful in describing the \\"peculiar institution\\" eliminated in his homeland but a generation before. He forces the king to experience the slave's condition, a form of degradation he would have all aristocrats endure. Every feature of the human condition is examined in this timeless treasure. He challenges you to follow his gaze, considering whether today's societies, monarchical or not, will endure the scrutiny."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"As with all of Mark Twain's work this book works on two very different levels. The first of course is a simple adventure story the second is a bitingly satiric work that unmasks many of the hypocracies of \\"conventional wisdom\\".I have to believe that most of his readers of his time (and ours) did not understand his underlying messages regarding society and its institutions. For me, it was hard to miss the way he unmasked the church, the state and society as a whole. I had to laugh out loud at some of the ways he managed to expose the absurdities of government and religion.This book is a quick read and is immensely satisfying if the reader takes the time to follow Twain's logic to its natural conclusions."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"In Life on the Mississippi, Twain recounts his river experiences from boyhood to riverboat captain and beyond. Encompassing the years surrounding the Civil War, this book is an excellent source of 19th-century Americana as well as an anthology of the mighty river itself. Replete with rascally rivermen, riparian hazards, deluge, catastrophe, and charm, Life on the Mississippi is another of Twain's stellar literary achievements.Wit and wisdom are expected from Twain and this book does not disappoint. It is equally valuable for it's period descriptions of the larger river cities (New Orleans, St. Louis, St. Paul), as well as the small town people and places ranging the length of America's imposing central watershed.The advent of railroads signalled the end of the Mississipi's grand age of riverboat traffic, but, never fear, Life on the Mississippi brings it back for the reader as only Samuel Clemens can. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"Life on the Mississippi is by far one of the most wonderful books ever written about the post Civil War era in America. Mark Twain takes the reader on a melancholy look at this period of time in history as you journey into the Mississippi of his youth, adulthood, and the people and the communities he knew so well. He conveys a miraculous picture of this lively river giving it the grandeur and prominence it deserves. He defines the river very much like a living organism with a power and personality all its own. As the book unfolds, he begins in his days when he grew up along the river and became a steam boat pilot, ending that career with the advent of the Civil War. Later he returns to the river after some twenty years and takes a journey as a writer from around St. Louis to New Orleans and back up the river into what is present day Minnesota. You learn about the different cultures along the river, its tributaries, as well as the remarkable people who become part of the forgotten history of our nation. Twain's anecdotes are sheer brilliance, and he has an incredible way of choosing just the right story to illustrate a particular point transporting the reader back into time as if it was the present day and you are standing beside Twain observing what he is seeing. His reflections of his times along the river and his descriptions of the people and places make this a true masterpiece of literature and I highly recommend it. I found myself only able to read short portions at a time, as I personally found the sheer beauty of the entire book was a work to be savored and digested rather than rapidly consumed as you would with any other book. As I poured through the book, I felt often as if I was traveling with Mark Twain as a companion along his charming and magnificent journey during a wonderful period of history."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"This is an excellent book. It is by far the best Twain I have read yet, and I give it four stars. In this novel, Mark Twain holds the glory and romance associated with Arthurian Legend up to the standards of 19th century society, and reveals defects in both the romantic ideal of King Arthur and the faith that Twain's generation holds in scientific and social &quot;progress.&quot; Both funny and thought-provoking, this book provides the reader with a new set of eyes with which to view the barbarism and injustice that Arthur and his knights so valiantly fought to preserve. A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is the tale of Hank Morgan, a typical 19th century man who is transported back in time to the days of Merlin, Guinevere, and King Arthur. After becoming aware of his surroundings, and deciding to ignore his uncertainty about whether King Arthur actually existed, this man uses the common knowledge of his time period, his practicality, and some perfectly timed arrogance to acquire a position of great power in this land that he finds repulsive and in need of an enlightened leader. The ensuing story is the tale of what happens when the two utopias collide and this man abuses his power in an attempt to bring the &quot;great and beneficent&quot; miracles of the 19th century to the Age of Chivalry. I would recommend this book to any reader in 8th grade or above, but I would discourage people with passionate faith in the purity and glory of King Arthur from reading this book if they do not want to be forcefully presented with demonstrations of chivalry's inhumanities. A fairly well developed sense of humor will help the reader to enjoy Mark Twain's subtle ironies and satirical situations, and some basic knowledge of science helps in understanding some of the scenes, however this isn't vital to the book. The vocabulary is moderately advanced, the subject matter is somewhat mature at times, and the philosophical reasoning is probably beyond the reach of most Junior High students, yet I would encourage anyone who is interested to give this book a try. This novel is also great for the general public because A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court provides the reader with a main character with whom they may identify. The main character, Hank Morgan is presented with situations in which he must deal with being a stranger in a new atmosphere, being a social outcast due to his uncommon beliefs, he must avoid physical confrontation, and he is forced to use his intellectual abilities rather than brute strength to solve difficult situations. Many readers will have faced similar difficulties in their lives, and this ability to identify with the characters will definitely add to the overall enjoyment of the story. With this piece of work, Mark Twain displays his true talent for excellent writing and story telling. He incorporates enough adventurous and action filled scenarios to make the reader want to continue reading vigorously, yet he also manages to discuss very philosophical and thought-provoking topics during the lulls in the action. This book reads very quickly near the beginning and end. The action tapers off during the middle of the story, but not for long, and once it starts to pick up again, Twain demonstrates his true potential for greatly entertaining writing in the very climactic and cleverly ironic ending that brings this all-around great book to an even better close. This is definitely a book worth reading."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"You probably already know the basic setup: a man from 19th Century Connecticut goes back in time to King Arthur's England. The book is both an adventure story and a social satire. It is in many ways baffling, and is a great attempt but not necessarily a great finished work of literature. The book is confused and ill-organized; attempting to do too many things at the same time. A parody of medieval chivalry and romance, an invective against social inequality and political injustice, an attack on human ignorance and superstition, it is at the same time written as if it were for children. Deadly serious and cynical, the novel is also saturated with lowbrow humor. Despite the disjointed nature of the book, there are many great parts in it, and it is certainly well worth reading."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"I read this recently after having kept a copy around for years; I now wish I had read it years ago. It is witty, observant, and a wonderful slice of American history; thenow-vanished steamboat culture comes alive like nowhereelse.

A wonderful book - I simply cannot praise it highly enough."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"If you think Bing Crosby's 1949 movie was anything like Mark Twain's fantasy classic published in 1889...Forget It! Like the precursor novels,'Gulliver's Travels' written in 1726 by Jonathan Swift and 'Alice in Wonderland' written in 1865 by Lewis Carroll were made into movies that are barely representative of the original novels. The film starring Bing Crosby was a musical / comedy only touching on the very basic part of Twain's novel.Mark Twain's view of England's Lifestyle in 528 was very harsh pertaining to church and throne to say the least.On page 246, he says...\\" if one could but force it ( manhood ) out of its timid and suspicious privacy, to overthrow and trample in the mud any throne that ever was set up and any nobility that ever supported it\\". The book has none of the film's niceties, instead it graphically tells of unjust hangings,stake burnings, murder, slavery, and an unfair caste system. This is a brilliant novel written 113 years after the Revolutionary War and 24 years after the Civil War. The contents truly reveal Mark Twain's political and social views, which I think are worthy of the study they have received. For further information on his thoughts see: 'Autobiography of Mark Twain: Volume 1, Reader's Edition (Mark Twain Papers)'.In the year 1879, Hank Morgan ( his name is only mentioned once ), an arms factory foreman, gets into a fight with a man named Hercules ( no, not him ) and wakes up under a tree in King Arthur's Camelot in the year 528! He is captured by the less then adequate knight, Sir Kay. At first Hank thinks he is in an insane asylum, but then as he is brought before The Knights of the Round Table to receive justice, he realizes that he really is in the sixth century. He is stripped naked and sent to the dungeon and sentenced to be burned at the stake the next day. The page, Clarence, visits Hank in the dungeon and is convinced by Hank that Hank's a super magician. Clarence becomes Hank's right hand man. Hank remembers that the next day will have a total eclipse of the sun. He warns King Arthur and Merlin the Magician that he will blot out the sun if they attempt to burn him at the stake. The next day they don't believe him and as they start the fire under Hank, the sun starts to go dark! The King wants Hank to stop it and become the second most powerful man in Camelot. Hank waits for the eclipse to pass and now becomes known as The Boss to the chagrin of Merlin, now a vowed enemy of The Boss.The Boss with the help of Clarence secretly starts many modern businesses, such as; a telephone system, a newspaper business, a railroad, army and naval academies, an arms factory, an electric company and an advertising company with the knights displaying the ads on their armour, just to mention a few of his enterprises. King Arthur requires The Boss to go on a quest with the damsel, Sandy, to save enslaved princesses from three ogres! It turns out to be a pig sty with three farmers. He returns to Camelot a hero with his now beloved Sandy. He then has many adventures in Camelot, such as; jousting tournaments with the knights armed with lances and The Boss with a pistol ( who do you think won? ), the blowing up of Merlin's Tower, the magical repair of the fount at the Valley of Holiness, and many more. At this point The Boss decides to go incognito with King Arthur into the realm of the peasants. They find many injustices and wrongs amongst the people, but before they can return to the castle, they are captured by a earl and sold into slavery. They are accused of murder and sentenced to hang. The Boss escapes and calls Clarence for help. The next day just before they are to be hanged, Lancelot and 500 knights arrive on bicycles to save the day!The ensuing years are good for The Boss, his wife Sandy and their daughter, Hello-Central ( that's right! ). Unbeknownst to The Boss, Merlin has made his family sick, so The Boss takes his family away from England and goes on a long cruise/ vacation to heal. That's when :The expression [the shit hits the fan] is related to, and may well derive from, an old joke. A man in a crowded bar needed to defecate but couldn't find a bathroom, so he went upstairs and used a hole in the floor. Returning, he found everyone had gone except the bartender, who was cowering behind the bar. When the man asked what had happened, the bartender replied, 'Where were you when the shit hit the fan?' [Hugh Rawson, \\"Wicked Words,\\" 1989] This is the best part of the book, the last 100 pages, or so. I never could have predicted the ending. The interesting thing about this book is that Mark Twain is the narrator! The book starts out with Twain on a tour of the Warwick Castle. He is approached by a old man seemingly knowledgeable about the castle and the knights. The old man starts to tell Twain his story from thirteen centuries ago, but grows weary at the Warwick Arms, and before retiring to his room, he hands Twain the manuscript to read. This was a great book and if you only read one classic this year...make it this one!"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"In this novel, Twain invented a common fantasy theme: a modern man travels to an ancient era and introduces modern technology and modern political ideas.I found the fantasy part somewhat lurching and disjointed. Major innovations such as the telegraph show up off-stage. Sometimes years pass between chapters with no obvious notice. The ending feels forced, too.The antagonists are a mixed lot. The knights and Merlin are just foils -- always wrong, always stupid. The King is more interesting -- he is invested with personal courage and dignity. Sandy, too, is maddeningly medieval one moment, and a co-conspirator with Boss the next.Mixed in with the scenes about 19th century technology in medieval England, Twain delivers several scenes about medieval justice, nobility, and slavery. He writes fine thunderous fusillades on the side of human dignity and human liberty. These are the best parts of the book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"I really enjoyed this book; it was one of Mark Twain's best, in my opinion. Hank Morgan, a mechanic in a nineteenth century New England factory, is hit on the head during an argument. He wakes to find himself among knights and magicians in King Arthur's court. What follows is a work of satire, in which Twain celebrates ingenuity and democracy over the bumblings of monarchy. But he also asks whether such progress necessarily makes a better society. Gradually as Hank becomes more powerful, he also becomes more ruthless and less able to control events. On top of all that, it was a great story as well. I loved Twain's writing style; it wasn't too overwritten, and I enjoyed the way he alternated from modern style to medieval. Hank's narration is in a more modern style, but the other characters speak with prithees and thous and hasts. Also, the edition I have has wonderful ink illustrations to go with the chapters by Dan Beard.

Not terrible because it simply makes fun of those things, I could easily digest that, but because it seems to seriously attempt to make the legends seem to be groundless and made up, with none of their hidden meaning and mystery.

What an interesting book! I'd never read it before. It's about a guy named Hank Morgan from Connecticut, who gets transported 1300 years back in time to the 590s, and the mythical days of King Arthur. Mr. Morgan is a brilliant, mechanically-inclined, resourceful guy and he goes about trying to civilize the 6th century, by \\"inventing\\" and introducing modern conveniences like the telephone, the steam engine, soap, gun powder, etc. That's fun, of course. I've always enjoyed imagining all the cool stuff I could \\"invent\\" if I was transported back in time. I never realized that someone had written a book about it - let alone Mark Twain! In practice, it would be totally impossible to invent all the stuff that Mr. Morgan invents. Materials just weren't available. But who cares! It's fun to imagine it anyway, and Twain does all kinds of creative stuff with the idea.The book is at turns funny and tragic. The Dark Ages are portrayed as brutal, savage, merciless times...which I'm sure they were. Makes you appreciate living in a modern democracy. Hmmm...what else to say...there's a few weird spots in the book where the story line takes a bit of a sudden jump. One gets the feeling that Twain got fed up with a few bits of it, and just kinda patched it together at those spots. Let's see...what else? The ending is not particularly uplifting, which is too bad...I like my books to end on a happy note. On balance, though, it's pretty good entertainment.'"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"Three books in one. 1) Mississippi River history and geography, 2) My life as a riverboater, 3) Return to the steamboats, a miscellany.

But this lesser known novel embodies all that is great in Twain's writing. It has the humor, but also represents Twain's great eye for social commentary. I highly recommend it to all fans of Twain."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"This is the fictional journal of a man who somehow got transported into the time of King Arthur. It is told from an interesting point of view because in the beginning of the story the man supposedly wanders into the house of the writer and gives the writer this journal of the events of his life in the 500s. The journal tells the story of how the man first found himself in King Arthur's time, was taken to prison, and was about to be killed when he remembered that there was to be an eclipse at noon. So, he makes the people believe that he is a great magician and that he made the eclipse happen, so if they don't release him and give him great power, he will never bring the sun back. They of course believe him and he comes to be known as the \\"Boss\\" because he is basically the boss of the king. He marries, has children, and then.... The story is captivating and realistic (except, of course, for how he got there), punctuated by witty humor and hilarious circumstances. A must-read classic for everyone!!!"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"Wow! What a book. I myself have only read one other book by Mark Twain and that was Tom Sawyer and I really didn't like it. But my compliments to Mr.Twain on this one. This is a book that I had a hard time putting down. The adventure, humor, and excitement came with every turn of the page. The book is about Hank Morgan who is a young man in Connecticut in the 19th century who is sent back to the 13th century. There he barely escapes death, and I mean barely and later serves an important position in King Author's Court. During his time there he introduces 19th Century technology to the people of the land of Camelot, making him an instant hit. Even though he barely escapes death he still makes rude and contreversial coments toward the king. To find out how the book ends you'll just have to read it. This was a really awsome book and I really enjoy it. I would recomend this to anyone who has an imagination and loves to read adventures with humor as well. I really liked this book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"This book may seem like a perfectly innocent book that you would want your children to read. Mark Twain's a fabulous American author, right? Well, \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" starts off innocent enough.... Hank Morgan, a factory owner in 19th century Connecticut is hit over the head with a crowbar by a rowdy employee. He is knocked out, and when he awakes he finds himself with Sir. Kay, one of the knights in King Arthur's Court, who brings him back to Camelot to be executed. The beginning of the book shows off Mark Twain's obvious distaste for 6th century society in Britain, but also has a few of its more humorous moments. We learn that the knights of the round table are nothing more than Vulgar Braggarts, we witness the destruction of Merlin (the yankee's enemy)'s tower, the cruelty of Queen Morgan LeFay, and the antics as Hank and Sandy go on a quest to find several captive princesses (who are nothing more than hogs!)Hank impresses everyone by institutionalizing modern conveniences back into that era (trains, telephones, guns, newspapers....) Anyway, the book takes a darker turn when King Arthur and Hank travel incognito as peasants and witness the downtrodden and oppressed peoples. One of the more touching moments of the book is when King Arthur carries a dying girl out of a hut to her mother, risking getting infected with smallpox. It gets even darker when Hank murders 10 knights with a pistol, then later when he and a handful of other men kill off 50,000 knights with high-voltage electric fences, land mines, and trenches with sharp spears sticking out on the bottom, only to almost die from the stench of the dead. This book is better for the mature reader because it deals with many issues of society, such as discrimination between social classes, and not accepting other cultures. I definetly wouldn't reccomend this for: SQUEAMISH PEOPLE, PEOPLE WITH LIMITED READING SKILLS, AND PEOPLE WHO LACK MATURITY. Despite all of the defects of this novel, it sure is a classic!!!"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"In this book, It was easy to notice all the small detail such as the accents, rooms of the court's detail and the description of life in Camelot. All those were so detailed it made me think about all the work Mark Twain put into this. This book's detail alone blows any other King Arthur book out of the water. After just reading the first 200 pages, this book has hooked me as its favorite. The beginning was terriffic and will hook you into reading the rest in suspicion about what the Narrator's next adventure will be. The book has taught me (and will teach anyone who reads it) a lot about Camelot and what it would have been like to live there. If you love to read historical fiction books, you'll love this book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"Imagine yourself thrown back fourteen hundred years to the kingdom of the legendary Arthur. Add some technical know-how, a touch of arrogance, and a taste for adventure, and you would be Hank Morgan. The successful head superintendent of an arms factory, Morgan is sent back in time by a nasty knock on the head, and finds himself a prisoner at the court of the once and future king. Through an incredible knowledge of astronomy, and mechanics, and his natural intelligence, he finds his way to the top of the Arthurian power structure, and becomes The Boss. Posing as a powerful magician, he impresses the people and the court with magnificent firework displays, stellar predictions, and other \\"tricks\\" that today are taken for granted. As he learns more about the social inequalities in the culture that he has no choice but to live in, he comes to the conclusion that he must free the masses from the oppression of the nobility. Morgan attempts to impose the ideals, governing system, and ways of thinking of the industrialized 19th century onto the primitive 6th century. Secretly, he develops a civilization of his own time inside Arthur's Kingdom, his eventual goal being to destroy every remnant of the old ways, and replace them with the new. Traveling the kingdom, Morgan spreads his influence and his beliefs. He encounters on his adventures both heartbreaking situations of cruelty, and heartwarming scenes of humanity. Throughout the whole kingdom, however, he always sees the need to destroy the feudal system. Twain teaches us something through Morgan's determination, and something else by the calamitous ending of the book. The good: A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur is probably the most accurate of all the king Arthur Legends, as far as describing the daily life, customs, and superstitions of the people of the period. It does not lionize the Knights of the Round Table, but at the same time it does not speak of them as savages, as some accounts do. Similarly, it makes the people out to be decent, simple, and yes, sheep, but not total fools. A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur describes the time impartially, meticulously, and colorfully. There is not the element of glamorization just as there is not the element of degradation. Twain's use of the first-person narration makes the story more realistic; the people who are dying of small pox are horrifyingly well described, and the grandeur with the banners and shining armor at a joust is equally enticing. Most importantly, this book flows well: each event leads to the next, and it all fits together nicely. The twist that Twain puts on the end superbly concludes the story, and it makes you really think. The not-so-good: A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur does move slowly at times. Also, the main character, Hank Morgan, is excessively American. Twain really overuses the baseball metaphors, and Morgan's contempt for all forms of mysticism and non-scientific explanations of things damages the atmosphere of the book. His impatience with the people who do not understand his speech and ideas, and his general attitude of superiority make him slightly less likeable, and more difficult to pay attention to. It is sometimes hard to bear Hank Morgan's thoughtless destruction of 6th century culture, and his obsession with the wonder of technology. The sometimes absurdly long descriptions, vivid pictures of violence, and overall length of this book would make it difficult for people under about twelve or thirteen to enjoy. Mark Twain is sending several messages in writing this book. The first and perhaps most important is that attention should be paid to the way in which a culture develops. Hank ultimately destroys Arthurian England as it was know, because he advances only the parts of the culture that he personally believes to be important. Twain is saying that if we are not involved in our world, everything is out of our control, and we can only hope that the reins fall into the right hands. Morgan's downfall can be attributed to this and to the fact that he disbelieves all other powers besides science, and even more than disbelieves dismisses them. Another main point that this book incorporates is that no one power should be allowed to become too strong. Twain reinforces this point with the examples of the Church and of Hank Morgan. A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur addresses issues that face Mark Twain's time and issues that face ours. It brings many ideas, messages, and themes together into a cohesive body. With Camelot as the backdrop, Morgan's story as the message and Twains engaging style as the messenger, this book is delightful."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"A supervisor (Hank Morgan) in an arms factory in Connecticut is hit along the side of his head with a crowbar and wakes up to discover that he has traveled back in time to England when King Arthur ruled (the year given as 528). The Boss, as he is later known, saves himself from being executed by predicting a solar eclipse. He is made Arthur's minister and becomes an enemy of Merlin. He uses his knowledge of nineteenth-century technology to try and make life better in 6th-century England. But, when he attempts to improve the lot of the peasantry and to end the power of the Knights, he finds himself opposed by the aristocracy, Merlin, and the Church. This is a great satire and illustrates Twain's poor opinions of the aristocracy and of Kings and nobility (&quot;no ability&quot;). Interestingly, it is also the first time-traveling novel in which a character travels to a distant time. (In &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; by Charles Dickens (1843), the main character travels in time is limited to the periods in which he had actually lived.) This is a classic and it should be familiar to all well-educated individuals."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"Mark Twain is, of course, a famous writer and a producer of a number of US classics. But this one is just too much of Mark Twain trying to make nasty remarks in order to be a cynic and too much of pushing American chauvinism, against too little realism to be bearable. Fine, 19th century Americans (and 20th and 21st as well) believe as a religion that their republic was the best invention since sliced bread and every other country in the history of the world was a land of morons. But this story depends on some far-fetched underestimation of human beings (or overestimation of Americans in relation to all others) in combination with sweeping generalizations and a lot of sweeping history under the rug.In short, I didn't like it."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"I was very suprised by the complexity of this book. I had seen the movie with Bing Crosby many years ago and enjoyed it for the light romp that it was.

We have more and more things to entertain us, yet feel more bored than ever. As I looked over some of the reviews of the classic books including this one, I noticed how often the word boring was used when describing a book. I guess in today's fast paced world if a book doesn't come with large speakers, a big screen and a joy stick it is boring. We aren't sheep, and are entilted to our own opinion, but when I hear the word boring being used, it intrigues me and makes me want to see who used the overused word."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"Mark Twain's satiric fantasy &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court&quot; sets up the premise of a 19th Century American being transported (via the application of a crowbar to his skull) to the legendary Camelot, where he initially suffers culture shock in the extreme. The novel's immediately obvious flaw (and I assume Mark Twain was aware of it but simply ignored it) is the 19th Century hero's ability to communicate with Britons of the 6th Century. They, of course, would have been speaking an English similar to that in &quot;Beowulf&quot;; the book has them talking like characters in &quot;Hamlet&quot;. The opening chapters are comic in mood, complete with limp jokes. (When one character introduces himself as a page, the Yankee replies: &quot;Go 'long, you ain't more than a paragraph.&quot; Oh, Lord.) However, the story quickly becomes dark and then increasingly darker. The degraded condition of the masses (which the modern hero compares to 18th Century France) culminates in a tour (with King Arthur disguised as a peasant) of a oountryside corrupted by monarchy and the Church, both of which were loathed by Mark Twain. Feminists should be warned that the author's misogyny is given free rein here: all the ladies of the court are thoughtless twits, and Morgan Le Fay is a shrew who habitually and casually kills her servants. The heroine Alisande (who, of course, becomes Sandy) is a tiresome chatterbox, whom the hero abruptly marries as a sort of social condescension. But his attitude towards women is merely a part of his general misanthropy, leading him to write at one point: &quot;Well, there are times when one would like to hang the whole human race and finish the farce.&quot; Once the protagonist has established himself as Arthur's right-hand man (he's called &quot;The Boss&quot;), he exercises his Yankee ingenuity to industrialize the realm. With the genius of Gutenberg, Morse and Bell at his disposal, he sets up a newspaper and introduces the telegraph and the telephone to the Middle Ages. (Just how he devises the technology to accomplish this is not made too clear.) At any rate, The Boss is considered a great wizard, and Merlin (or Brer Merlin, as the Yankee calls him) is treated like a fraudulent fool. Motivating all this is a somewhat smug sense of 19th Century superiority. Actually, the Yankee goes beyond his own century and into the 1900's. When Guenever's treason causes the civil war which divides Britain, The Boss drills a group of cadets (his West Pointers, he calls them) that he leads off to battle against the anti-Arthurian knighthood. The result is a blood bath presciently and repulsively similar to the trench warfare of 1914-1918. (The novel was published in 1889.) If this is meant to be an indication of future efficiency, it's an extremely pessimistic vision. But then, the whole story is Mark Twain's gloomy statement on Mankind's uneasy place in a dysfunctional world, be it the Dark Ages or the somber present."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"From what I've read, The Prince and the Pauper was Twain's first foray into historical fiction. He clearly reused one of the major themes from that book in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, which was published seven years later - that of a royal who gets a chance to see how the other half lives. In the earlier book, the prince and a young beggar exchange clothes for fun. In this book, it probably isn't realistic to make a full-grown man exchange clothes with another for the fun of it, so Twain gives the somewhat flimsy excuse that the protagonist (who has become the king's right-hand man after traveling back in time) has decided to go see the kingdom in disguise, and the king has decided to go with him. There was almost no more discussion of it than that - I don't think Twain ever mentioned whether the rest of the king's court knew what he was doing. Certainly no search parties are ever sent for him, but it's strange that everyone would let him just go off with basically no protection.In any case, Twain's dislike of sixth-century England is very clear, although, he has ascribed many social behaviors to it that did not actually occur at that time. He even admits to this in a strange preface. At one point, he says, \\"Here I was, a giant among pigmies, a man among children, a master intelligence among intellectual moles: by all rational measurement the one and only actually great man in that whole British world.\\" Now, I understand that the protagonist, being from 19th century England, has thirteen centuries of knowledge more than the \\"children\\" he references, but it's still pretty pompous to claim that much advantage over an entire kingdom.The protagonist finds the king extremely stupid and doesn't miss an opportunity to mention it. The protagonist himself does a number of stupid things, including getting himself and the king sold into slavery, but somehow those are just little mistakes; whereas the king's inability to pretend to be a commoner because he has really never had the opportunity or reason to study one, of course, proves that the king is an idiot. In The Prince and The Pauper, the prince returns to his throne with a greater knowledge of his people and rules that much better for it. In this book, the king returns to his throne and then Twain is a little too busy with creating a way for his protagonist to get back to the nineteenth century to really discuss what happens to the king after his escapades.This was fun to read but personally, I prefer The Prince and the Pauper."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"The book A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Mark Twain is told from the view of Hank Morgan, later on known as The Boss. Hank Morgan travels back in time from the 19th century to the 5th century, in King Arthur's Court. Hank learns from a man dress in a knight's armor that it is the 5th century, he doesn't believe that he traveled back in time, he thinks he is in an asylum. Suddenly Hank remembers that the day that he was told also happened to be the same day of the first recorded full Solar Eclipse. Hank finds that he has wandering into a place where they are hanging innocent people. Hank has some fun and tells the people that he will put the world into total darkness very soon, he hopes that if it truly is the 5th century, the people will believe him. Sure enough the eclipse does happen, all the people are in awe. For the rest of the book Hank is then on known as The Boss.Throughout the whole story, Hank gives King Arthur tips about how to be more successful. Hank goes on a venturous journey with King Arthur and he helps the King train Knights and create a large army. Hank gets a seat at the round table even though he is not a knight. Hank uses his knowledge to reinvent things that were a new invention from his time. After King Arthur dies, Hank must help the empire live on.I recommend this to people who are 13 or older and enjoy long, very detailed books.

Needless to say, he goes on an excursion with King Arthur experiencing many events along the way. On the journey he learns lessons of how to be noble and be a knight. My opinion of this book is that it lacks something, something that is entertaining. I do not find it interesting or appealing. Mark Twain uses many details like most books he has written. The book went a bit overboard on them. Talking about how it feels to be in armor for a page doesn't entice me. Also Twain goes onto new events too fast by actually lacking in detail. He did not have a smooth entrance to the journey he that the king and him went on. Also, I didn't realize until a chapter or two after Sandy, a damsel going on the journey, was introduced that she was a woman. I thought she was a horse at first. He could have transferred details, meaning using less on particular items and more on entrances. Overall, this book did not appeal to me at all.

The book is boring because in the middle of the book fo about 50 pages they are riding on horses to get to this place to save some princesses that have been turned into pigs. Also the book goes on and on about boring sujects, and the few interesting subjects are over in a few pages. This book is too gory, and there is too much killing.

Throughout the years he invents things we have today, but they didn't have back then. He also educates and helps people of the kingdom and becomes a knight himself. I found the book to be time-consuming and dull because nothing ever eventful happened and the old English they used made it hard to comprehend. They did not have a lot of big events at all. All he did was talk, talk, and talk about what he was going to do. It would have been more stimulating if they described when he was fighting, exploring, or helping others. Another thing that made it boring was that they used old English. It baffled me when they would say &quot;thou are pithy&quot;.

He stereotypes shamelessly throughout this book. And despite the fact that both the narrator and people who read this book seem to assert that this tale is set in the 6th century it absolutely is not. You did not have castles, titled lords and ladies, a powerful Roman Catholic church, and French sounding names in 6th century Britain! Had Mr. Twain been more balanced in his writing and more historically factual I personally would have found this book a great deal more readable. A story about someone in the 19th century transported to a time and place where Britons and Anglo-Saxons were fighting for control of the land would have been even more fascinating.

His mentor cusses him and asks why he thinks he was telling him them. Twain replies sheepishly that perhaps he was trying to entertain him.

Worth reading and perhaps even including as a source should you ever chance to write a paper on the beheading of poor king Louis."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"I wanted to like this book. I expected to like it. It's got many of my favorite ingredients - time travel, satire, Britain, but I kept finding it falling flat.Part of the reason is that there is no clear setting. I think this may have been on purpose, maybe to ingrain (or prop up) the author's desire to juxtapose the two societies, so that the reader can never be too sure that a comment is applicable to then or now. Another thing I disliked was the Boss. He is our main character, and he's supposed to be our link and guide to what is good and lacking between the two societies. Instead he's an unreliable narrator, more guilty of the crimes than the people he attacks.An added point, that I don't think is necessarily inherent in the novel, but one that kept occurring to me as I read, was the question of whether we are actually more intelligent now than in the past. it may seem that we are, because we have the accumulated knowledge of all those that went before us, but are we really smarter? Are we smarter than Twain? King Arthur? Oommgogutuktuk at the discovery of fire? And add to that the particular sharpened stick of hindsight? Would we fare better with our big brains and our racial memories at any time before us? Twain implies not, but I don't know if I'd agree or if I'd attach a greater failing to the man than the idea.(less)"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"The Twain tale that pleases me most.

I thought Twain did a great job incorporating the newer (of his time) technologies into the old mid evil times. Not only did I think he did this very well; he had a very interesting take at explaining the great achievements of knights that do not seem to be what we would consider real. Like when knights fought giants and things of that nature, and how magic was explained. I thought it was interesting how he explained that a lot of the knights did not really do a lot of the things that they said, like kill ogres and giants, they only said they did because no one was around, and no one ever questioned the adventures that the knights told of. Another cool thing was how he incorporated newer technologies, like gunpowder, into how he did his \\"magic\\" and made people believe that he was a great sorcerer. This was a very good and interesting book, and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"I purchased this edition of Life on the Mississippi because I know that Library of America books are the highest quality and most definitive editions available of the works they publish.This edition includes an introduction written by Jonathan Rabin, a British travel writer and novelist (Passage to Juneau,Bad Land: An American Romance(winner of a National Book Critics Circle Award),Old Glory: A Voyage Down the Mississippi, andSurveillance). It also includes an 8 page chronology of Twain's life, notes on the text used in the book, and footnotes.The book is a paperback but larger format than most - essentially identical in size to the Library of America hardcover editions - and as all other LOA editions it is printed on very high quality paper (acid free).In his introduction, Rabin states that \\"Later in life, Twain would claim Life on the Mississippi as his own favorite among his books\\", and articles originally appearing in the Atlantic Monthly in 1875 served as the starting point.This is nonfiction from Mark Twain, reporting his recollections of experiences he gained beginning in about April, 1857, when he became a cub pilot on the Mississippi, and culminating in May 1861, when he made his last trip on the river as a pilot (at age 25). Being nonfiction it is unlike his novels Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, but it is every bit as enjoyable to read.This Library of America printing is a fine edition to purchase if you want a high quality book for your library, and you care that the text of the book is the most accurate available (see below), and it is very reasonably priced. There are many different and cheaper printings available, but not to these standards. This is the version I will always recommend to anyone wanting to add this to their collection or give to someone as a gift.For those who are interested in the specifics of why this edition is different from ANY other presently available (other than LOA's own hardcover), I offer the following, from the Library of America website (this came from their explanation for the hardcover LOA bookMark Twain : Mississippi Writings : Tom Sawyer, Life on the Mississippi, Huckleberry Finn, Pudd'nhead Wilsonwhich in addition to Life on the Mississippi, includes the three mentioned other novels by Twain. I have edited this to retain only the comments relevant to Life on the Mississippi:---------------\\"The book reprinted in this volume is presented in the best text now available. As early as January, 1866, Clemens had contemplated writing a travel book about the Mississippi River. Five years later, he told his wife that he proposed to spend two months on the river and take notes, but the actual beginning of \\"the Mississippi book\\" did not come until William Dean Howells, editor of the Atlantic Monthly, pressed Clemens for a contribution to follow \\"A True Story\\" (November, 1874). Clemens wrote twice to Howells on October 24, 1874, first to say \\"my head won't 'go,' \\" next to propose a topic. While walking in the woods with his friend and pastor, Joseph Twichell, he explained, he \\"got to telling him about old Mississippi days of steamboating glory & grandeur\\" as he had seen them from the pilot house. Twichell exclaimed, \\"What a virgin subject to hurl into a magazine!\\" The work that resulted went into seven issues of the Atlantic, January through August, 1875, omitting July.The contribution to the Atlantic was not nearly enough to make a subscription book, however, and only after a series of efforts to persuade Howells or some other friend to accompany him on a note-taking visit to the Mississippi did Clemens at last undertake the journey in 1882. By the terms of his contract for the book with James R. Osgood, Clemens became in effect his own publisher, Osgood--who had no experience in the publishing of subscription books--his agent.Clemens redivided chapters, revised chapter titles, added \\"The Record of Some Famous Trips\\" (334-36), made perhaps forty-five other changes, and the Atlantic material became chapters IV through XVII of the book. In composing the additional forty-six chapters--a wearying task--Clemens made voluminous use of his own travel notes and padded the work with previously written but unpublished tales, such as \\"The Professor's Yarn\\" (chapter XXXVI). He also borrowed perhaps 11,000 words from other writers. Most interestingly, he took the \\"raft passage\\" from his manuscript for what later became Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and incorporated it in \\"Frescoes from the Past\\" (chapter III). Indeed, he crowded so many pages into his manuscript that some became superfluous; he was able to omit some 13,000 to 15,000 words and to move other material to appendices.The first American edition (1883) is reprinted here. Ultimately, the methodically prepared text of the future will involve a comparison of the first American edition and the holograph manuscript held since 1909 by the J. Pierpont Morgan Library. The manuscript contains matter not in the book, and the book, matter not in the manuscript. Except for a few pages that Clemens called \\"the eighth batch\\" and--because of the illness of his typist--sent to Osgood in holograph form, the first American edition was set from a typescript made from the Morgan manuscript. Only a few pages of the typescript survive (at the Morgan Library and at the Houghton Library, Harvard). Clemens revised both the typescript and printer's proofs. That collating the manuscript with the first American edition will reveal errors in the book text has been shown by Willis Wager in \\"A Critical Edition of the Morgan Manuscript of Mark Twain's Life on the Mississippi,\\" a dissertation submitted at New York University, Washington Square College, 1942. A few original manuscript readings are given in the notes that follow at 233.3, 380.14, 451.32, and 516.27-28.The standards for American English continue to fluctuate and in some ways were different in earlier periods from what they are now. In nineteenth-century writings, for example, a word might be spelled in more than one way, even in the same work. Commas could be used expressively to suggest the movements of voice, and capitals sometimes gave significances to a word beyond those it might have in its lower-case form. Since modernization would remove these effects, this volume has preserved the spelling, punctuation, capitalization, and wording of the editions reprinted here.The present edition is concerned only with presenting the texts of these editions; it does not attempt to reproduce features of the typographic design--such as the display capitalization of chapter openings. Footnotes within the text are those supplied by Clemens. Open contractions are retained if they appeared in the original edition. Typographical errors in the other editions used here have also been corrected.\\"---------------"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"This item arrived in excellent condition.

There's also a subdued hilarity that sometimes isn't so subdued as the main character will voice criticism or state his views on a wide variety of subjects. Twain wrote this in 1899 but it sounds like something you would hear from someone a 100 years later. It could just be timeless.

The beginning of the book had a very interesting attention grabber. Hank Morgan, the main character, was at the colt factory where he worked when he got into a heated fight with a co-worker, Hercules. Hank then got hit in the head with a crowbar, passed out, and awoke to find himself in 6th century England. This introduction to the book made for a real page turner.I also liked the ways that Hank fooled everyone throughout the story with his \\"magic\\". Everyone thought he was a sourcerer because they thought he made the sky completely black, where as it was really a luner eclipse that he knew was going to happen from being from the future. He also said that he could blow up Merlins Tower by fire sent from the sky, but he really used explosives. He used his knowledge and newer inverntions to his advantage when he went back in time because they were things people from 6th century England never knew about.Mark Twain also used a lot of imagery in this book. I feel that it gave a better understanding of what was going on and it made the book exciting to read.One of the reason I only gave this book four stars is because I didn't like Hank and Merlins relationship. I think they should have gotten along instead of fighting and butting heads throughout the whole story. Mark Twain waited until the end of the story for them to get along whereas if he had done so sooner, the two of them would have gotten more accomplished throughout the story.The other thing i didn't like about the book was Hank and Sandie's kids name, \\"Hello-Central\\". To me there seemed to be an unclear meaning behind the name and i'm really not sure why that name was chosen. I think there could have been a better plot behind it or a better name could have been chosen.All in all, I think this is a wonderful book for anyone with an imagination to read and I would definatly recomend it to people in the future."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"In &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court&quot;, Hank Morgan is transported to the legendary times of King Arthur and Camelot.

A war takes place, and England is left in ruins. Hank sees this as his oppurtunity to proclaim a republic and destroy feudalism once and for all, but he has some opposition...I really liked this book. It was very exciting and the characters were hilarious; there's King Arthur, who can't swallow his pride and will fight on suicidely. There's the maiden, Sandy, who, while accompanying Hank on a quest, drones on and on unstopably about the stupidest things! The only downside id the difficult vocabulary and the occasional archaic expressions. Words like &quot;obstetatiously&quot; and &quot;obstenuating&quot; or &quot;hence&quot; and &quot;smote&quot;.

As I say, pure Twain!I guess if we went back to the days of 'sexist' literature-'Boy's' books and 'Girl's' books-'Life on...' would be a boys book,but it is also a fascinating piece of historical reading; Twain looking back on a bygone era whilst we today read his 130 year old account of things.And when looking back on historical times,who better to read than someone who was there?

This book clearly reflects that from the beginning to the end. Twain is a riverboat captain, and travels up and down on the Mississippi river, seeing cities such as New Orleans, Memphis, and St. Louis. He describes his experiences in very lively fashion to the extent that the reader can very well imagine what river travel was like in Twain's time. It should not be forgotten that river travel at that time was commercial and an essential way of getting back and forth. And Twain makes the reader feel that riverboat travel was lots of fun and very adventurous even at that time. The book is a valuable contribution to history in that Twain accurately describes what has happened and what the events mean for those who live in that time period. Personally, I feel that this is one of the best books I have ever read. Also, the last time I went on a trip aboard the steamer NATCHEZ in New Orleans, I heard the on-board announcer say that if Mark Twain were alive today, the NATCHEZ would be his home.

If you don't like this book I feel sorry for you."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"I read the book A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. It began quickly and I was easily intrigued by the author's usage of vocabulary and his extraordinary ideas. He began in such a way that one could not put the book down and I found myself staying up late in the night just to finish that one last chapter. Yet, as I continued reading, my mind began to wander from lack of interest. The book became a little redundant and it was hard to concentrate on reading. I fell behind in my reading schedule because I was unable to stay focused on what I considered to be boring text. Luckily, as I kept reading, the plot began to thicken once again. I was again caught up in the story. The last third of the book proved to be an interesting one. I kept reading even when I knew I had to do other things. My mind stayed with the book even when I wasn't reading. I believe that the character development was done extremely well. You get to know the characters and you know how they feel. Even before someone speaks, you know what their reaction to the situation will be. This is a sign of a very well written book. A book where one can feel the characters' feelings is one that is easy to read. Not in the sense that the text is easy, but it is easy to stay interested in the book. It is beautifully written as a whole. Yet, through the middle it becomes more of a technological book. The inventions created are thoroughly explained. I found that thoroughly boring. Although it was interesting to know what was being created, I wasn't interested in a step-by-step process as to how it was being made. I recommend this book to a more mature audience. Not because of any obscene situations, but because I believe it would be too hard to comprehend before the age of twelve at the youngest. Not only would it be hard to comprehend, but it may be quite boring to those under that age. Of course, it depends upon who the person is that is reading the book. Yet, generally I believe it would be most fitted for older teens to adults. Their ability to comprehend and appreciate the writings of Mark Twain would help to make this book an interesting one to read. All and all, I would generously recommend this book. It is a novel that not only interests you, but keeps you thinking as well. The plot, along with the style of writing, is well thought out and keeps you turning the page each time. Although at times it can become a little boring, for the most part one would find this novel enjoyable. One can probably find it at any local bookstore, any library, or even purchase it on the internet. If you are looking for a good book to read, then I would suggest that you pick this one up today."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"While a bit strange, _Yankee_ makes some interesting points about both medival and modern life.

One thing that bothered me was that it supposedly takes place in the sixth century, but the characters speak quasi-Elizabethan English; the language spoken then would have been nothing like English. Twain also maligns the Roman Catholic church (it causes the downfall of the nearly 19th-century world the Yankee has built up), but England was only beginning to be converted to Christianity, if that. These may be minor points, but I don't think a satire of England of old has much bearing on modern America. Can one expect the world of 13 centuries ago to be like the world of Twain's day or ours?"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"While the critique of the weaknesses of Arthurian society are obvious, this is a really remarkable book for its critique of Twain's (and perhaps our) America. The ending can be seen as a prophetic warning of the consequences for war of the adoption of modern technology. Even Twain's accounts of the problem of instantly democratizing a traditional society seem remarkably current to today's efforts to bring our political system to Eastern Europe, etc. This is no teenage science fiction novel, but as usual with Twain, a book with many meanings and insights."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"This book is not a &quot;good&quot; book, in that it fails to achieve its supposed purpose (which is to deprecate chivalric romance).

Prepare for a vitriolic horror-ride that seems to prove nothing but man's futility--i.e., welcome to Twaine's latter period. Mark Twain's work of psuedo-realistic phantasy is perhaps the most marked and fascinating failure in literature. In the novel Twain sets science and technology against chivalry and romance. Twaine attempts to overthrow a thousand years of fuedal and romantic tradition by means of scientific and economic efficiency. Yet (without revealing too much) in the end the Yankee must praise the romantic hero King Arthur; has used the very superstitions he disdains to dupe the people; come to love an archetype of the simple medieval personality he despises; and, amazingly, has threatened to destroy an entire civilization. In the end the only thing the Yankee proves is that modern man is far too arrogant for his own good, and that it is all too easy to become the villain you hate. So what was Twaine's point? Supposedly to prove the vast superiority of the modern age over the Chivalric Age. But did Twaine actually believe his utterly amazing ending carried out his task? I doubt it; I think the book is a classic example of Twain's disbelief of everything.

In the preface, the Yankee, mostly referred to as \\"The Boss\\", is clonked on the head by a crowbar and miraculously wakes up over one thousand centuries prior. Medieval Times soon turns to be a harsh place for the Yankee, instantly reducing him to the status of a slave. By using his prior knowledge of the date of a solar eclipse, he convinces the higher powers of the land (and everyone else in those times), that he is of magical roots. It is here that we witness one of the biggest thematic sequences of the book. The Yankee is befuddled by the nave nature of the English population, and as an effect, continues to take advantage of this facet of medieval life. The Yankee himself is a very clever character, as we first see with his usage of the solar eclipse, and then again when he \\"MacGyver's\\" together a lightning rod and gunpowder to exterminate Merlin the Wizard's tower. Actions such as this could be easily compared to the antics of Twain's other character, Huckleberry Finn. The Yankee goes through several years with trying to conduct Industrial change years before any such events would have occurred. The push for change continues when The Yankee takes on a quest to help a woman by the name of Alisande, or Sally. On a quest to save a number of maidens, they happen upon two ordinary peasants. Eating breakfast with them, The Yankee questions them about the idea of a more modern democracy, planting the seed for rebellion. The climax of the novel comes when a Tournament with a knight ends with The Yankee displaying his future weaponry in the form of a revolver, in which he uses to shoot his opponent and 9 other knights dead. In turn, he reveals his underground 19th century movement upon the world. In efforts to not give away the ending, I'll stop there. In my opinion, the plot here is one of random events that all concur to the same centralized theme. While this sounds fine in theory, the actual execution of such a technique is hardly appropriate. I found novels such as Huckleberry Finn much more approachable and I was able to enjoy it more, as the plot was much more rich and fun. I would probably recommend this book to someone looking for a satire of history, more than someone looking for a story with a fantastic plot."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"This novel tells the story of Hank Morgan, a 19th century engineer from Hartford, Connecticut who through a strange turn of events finds himself in the 66h century England of King Arthur. He is almost immediately captured by a knight upon his arrival in the 6th century and taken to Camelot where he learns he is to be executed in a couple days time. Using his superior modern wit to escape the situation, hank sets out on a grand process of introducing 19th century technology, know-how, education, and values to Arthur's realm.The novel is filled with many humorous moments as is apt with other fiction from Twain but there is also a distinct dark side to the story that becomes ever more apparent. The impact of the past with the present (at least at the time of writing) results in the dismantling of the romantic view of the past while simultaneously reveals the faults in the belief of scientific and social progress. The England of Arthur is depicted as one where the people, although not generally subjected to the institution of slavery, are for all purposes the equivalent of slaves. The \`freemen' of the day have no rights whatsoever and are subject to the whims of a nobility whose only entitlement to rule is blueness of their blood. The Church is similarly depicted as repressing force against the mass of humanity. The protagonist Hank struggles endlessly to awaken in the people a sense of social justice and outrage at being treated as dirt by their noble lords. He is constantly frustrated in his attempts though and concludes that the level of indoctrination is so deep in the people that only large structural changes and the rise of a new generation will provide the seeds for a revolution to overturn the existing order.Hank Methodically sets out to accomplish just such a revolution by starting clandestine centers of education and industry, all the while keeping an eye on the Church so as not to have his program disrupted. With the introduction of modern technology and education, \`progress' moves along at a steady pace. But with all the advances to society also comes the capacity to disrupt and destroy as much if not more. In seeking to replace the controlling ideology of the Church, Hank inadvertently sets up a rival ideology that demands the complete submission of the people as well.Twain's criticisms of the 19th century become all the more apparent when applied against the backdrop of an age unrecognizable to ours. It is rather amazing that the problems he confronts, free market capitalism, mechanization of war, political ideologies, confidence in a historical progression towards a better society, would all come to the fore in the 20th century as pressing questions confronting a world with the ever growing capacity to destroy itself. The novel stays true to Twain's pessimism concerning his day and the \`damned human race' ends with a truly terrifying scene. All good novels have to concern themselves with themes that go deeper than the mere story that they tell. Twain certainly does not disappoint with this effort."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"Every time I look at a river, I think of Mark Twain and his adventures on the Mississippi. His writing, always funny and warm, tells us first of the history and stories of his beloved river, and then of his experiences learning the steamboat trade. I found his description of being a steamboat student very similar to being a medical student: two-hundred years later and in completely different trades, route memorization and gradual responsibility for people's lives still have much in common. This book made me want to travel the Mississippi, not as it stands today but as it appeared to Twain in his youth. I feel the same way about Gabriel Garcia Marquez and his Magdalena river. I think it is amazing how these inspired authors can make me love a river I have never seen."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"Few books exist that speak thru the ages by examining themes and situations that confront people of all time. This is one of those books. Unlike Twain's other classics, the focus of this piece is not America, or topics from American history (i.e. slavery), but more general themes such as industrialization, freedom, religion and religious dogma, government control, the meaning of progress, and individual aspirations versus peer pressure.In short, this book focuses on the adventures of Hank Morgan, a Connecticut Yankee who falls asleep one day, and wakes up in England during the reign of King Arthur. This world of knights, damsels, poor hygiene, and overbearing Christian dogma seems ripe for change for our protaganist. Hank proceeds to introduce \\"progress\\" to this new (old) world in the form of practices, knowledge, and inventions he is familiar with from his time; post Civil War USA. He does this in the name of bettering the lives of those around him, both physically, and emotionally. The result is utter chaos, the destruction of the existing social order, and lessons in colonialism, nation-building, and culture shock that all missionaries, soldiers, politicians and businessmen should heed.Along the way, the book brought both tears and laughter to this reader. One of Twain's strengths is his ability to bring emotion to commonday events by portraying them from various viewpoints. This trait is on display here in its most tragi-comedic form. Overall, a great book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"There is no denying that Mark Twain is one of the best American authors. His wit and caustic style is just one of a kind, and his novels, with the in depth plot and yet witty and sardonic characters and the episodes that are at times comic and serious, is what defines that man and author that you either love or hate. In \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,\\" it may leave some ambiguous. First of all, the idea is clever: making a man from the 19th century go into another time and era in 6th century Britain so he can critique, satarize, and change the lifestyle of it, therefore creating a \\"frame\\" that helps us to view how synonymous the time era back then somewhat reflects the 19th century. However, the main problem is that it's not consistent. Diving in the first few chapters is just fine, but then the story goes along a bit too slow and becomes too difficult to digest. In other words, it doesn't get to the point, and quite frankly it gets kind of dull. At times i would read one chapter and stop, feeling as if i read over 100 pages in half an hour, exhausted. I can understand why many would enjoy this novel, but it personally didnt do anything for me. If there was more action, movement, and a more firm plot (at times i didn't really understand what stance Mark Twain was trying to make, he seemed to try to make a satire on the society of the 6th century in England but it becomes ambiguous and lost throughout the story), perhaps i would give this book at least 3 stars. Apparently Mark Twain wasn't at his best when he wrote this book. Sure, the wit and humor is still there, but the excitement that drove the reader to keep on reading just isn't there. Not highly recommended, but if you are interested in it, go for it. Regardless, it's still a good story, just didn't work for me."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"Mark Twain is indisputably the greatest writer in history, and his wisecracking sense of humor reached its pinnacle in Connecticut Yankee. Far more than a simple time travel book, this book will keep you thinking. One minute the hero is trying to end knighthood once and for all by taping ads to suits of armor and the next minute he is trying to explain supply and demand to an ignorant farmer. The best part of this book is Hank Morgan's journey through the countryside with King Arthur. Though Twain uses his typical sarcastiic tone throughout the novel, it has a very serious, satyrical meaning. I would also like to show that some of us under the age of 18 can still appreciate great literature. Mark Twain was truly a genius, and being a fellow journalist, he is one of my heroes. It is truly a tragedy that other kids cannot recognize the significance of Twain and his works. The only book of his people seem to want to give credit to is Huck Finn because it dealt with racism. Nowadays people think a book can't have a serious meaning unless it involves the persecution of blacks, but Connecticut Yankee is simply a whole lot better than Huck Finn. Every American, every lover of literature should read this book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"In Life on the Mississippi the steamboat is depicted as the workhorse of Midwest expansion. Prior to the advent of the railroad efficient inland transportation was confined to waterways and the Mississippi river basin , with \\"about 1,250,000 square miles,\\" was the \\"Body of the Nation.\\" (Twain, preface) Mark Twain fulfills his boyhood dream of becoming a river boat pilot and, returning some twenty-one years later, writes of his youthful experiences and later observationsThe steamboat was a technological phenomena. The vehicle that evolved to meet the unique demands of this particular environment was a special design of river boat. In his own inimical style Mark Twain captures both the excitement of the riverboat's arrival and describes its essential components:\\"She is long and sharp and trim and pretty; she has two tall, fancy-topped chimneys, with a gilded device of some kind swung between them; a fanciful pilothouse, all glass and \\"gingerbread,\\" perched on top of the \\"texas\\" deck behind them; the paddle-boxes are gorgeous with a picture or with gilded rays above the boat's name; the boiler deck; the hurricane deck, and the texas deck are fenced and ornamented with clean white railings; there is a flag gallantly flying from the jack-staff; the furnace doors are open and the fires glaring bravely; the upper decks are black with passengers; the captain stands by the big bell calm, imposing, the envy of all; great volumes of the blackest smoke are rolling and tumbling out of the chimneys...the crew are grouped on the forecastle; the broad stage is run far out over the port bow, and an envied deck hand stands picturesquely on the end of it with a coil of rope in his hand; the pent steam is screaming through the gauge cocks; the captain lifts his hand, a bell rings, the wheels stop; then turn, back, churning the water to foam, and the steamer is at rest.\\" (27)Within a period of ten minutes the boat has been offloaded, loaded and departed. It is an efficiency of system and design ideally suited to its unique purposes, but as the Civil War looms its days are numbered. By then the steamboat had already evolved to it most advanced state and the steam locomotive has become the dominant form of transportationAs a literary piece by a \\"brilliant travel writer and incomparable humorist\\" (Kaplan, in Twain, xvii) Life on the Mississippi earned its accolades, but, as a window into a period of time, one can extract an eyewitnesses truth. In Life on the Mississippi, Mark Twain describes the latter period of the steamboat's heyday dramatically cut short. Wartime technology did not improve the riverboat other than to convert it into an instrument of war. What doomed the steamboat to oblivion was the advent of the steam locomotive and the railroads. The steamboat well served the purposes of river life in its time but was eclipsed by the railroad.That the steamboat was functional is indisputable, but if form determines function, it was a perfect adaptation of a water craft in conformity with purpose and contemporary technology. Combined with light weight and flexible wood construction the steamboat evolved into a shallow draft, wide beamed, low freeboard hull propelled by stern or side paddle wheels. The overall size of a steamboat was a compromise between maneuverability and economy. Power plant, fuel, cargo and passengers were accommodated within a superstructure rising above the hull. Bulk items, machinery, deck hands and low fare passengers were located on the main deck; superior public and private accommodations at higher fares were on the upper decks. Here travelers could enjoy incomparable luxury.High on top of all was the pilothouse. River pilots, by necessity of their position earned through their experience and knowledge of the river, had the best view. By status, they were the pinnacle of river hierarchy. Mark Twain, on his 1882 return to the river, quaintly asks of a fellow passenger he suspects of being a river pilot: \\"Have you ever traveled with a panorama.\\" The passenger responds, \\"I have formerly served in that capacity. [Twain's] suspicion was confirmed.\\" (315) Only higher than the pilothouse were the tall stacks made so for the purpose of disgorging noxious black smoke and dangerous smoldering ash to the wind.All components contributed to functionality, but perhaps the \\"stage\\" or ramp which bridged the gap between the boat and shore, contributed most to its versatility. It enabled the boat to be hailed from landings along the shore without the aid of a dock. As an apprentice, Mark Twain is left alone on the bridge for the first time by his mentor. His initial proud serenity is broken by a sudden awareness that the boat is heading for imminent impact with a \\"bluff reef.\\" His panicked reaction throws the ship into reverse, but he is saved by the return of the pilot who calmly restores order and chastises him. \\"When you have a hail, my boy, you ought to tap the big bell three times before you land, so the engineers can get ready.\\" (53) The \\"bluff reef\\" was actually a wind reef (from the effect of wind on the surface) and they sailed uneventfully through it.The romance of the steamboat era is tarnished by frequent tragedy. Mark Twain loses his brother Henry, a cabin boy on the Pennsylvania, who died when the ship's boilers explode in June 1858. The hazards of operating year round and during night and day, plus the varying river conditions contributed to mistakes of judgment and probably just bad luck too! The pilot may have been king, but he was still human and suffered from the human faults of vain glory, unrealistic confidence, ego, and infallibility.When he returns to the river in 1882 after an absence of twenty-one years, Mark Twain notes the changes that have occurred on the river. There are very few ships left in operation. Passenger travel is limited in frequency and destinations. The romance he once knew is gone, but a new one is beginning, the romance of the rails.Today we know that the railroad too would have its heyday and, in time, its romance would also wane. But has the romance of the steamboat and rail eras disappeared? Today you can take cruises on Mississippi riverboats and luxury train trips across the continent. The difference now is that trips are for novelty and not necessity. The romance only comes from the remembrance of a time past and not the needs of the present."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"I know this book was boring and humorless to a lot of students and I can understand why. Things like the telegraph mean nothing to us now, but in Mark Twain's time it was hot technology like a rocket or the Internet are to us today.Mark Twain was saying, what if we took our modern technology back to a time when people believed in magic and faught with swords and armor. Whoever did this could probably convince these people that the technology was a superior magic and could use this knowledge to dominate them.This is what happens in the story, but only for awhile. Eventually, even the people in King Arthur's court adjust to having the new technology and no longer see it as magic. For example, the people running the telephone exchange don't care about the Connecticut Yankee's &quot;magic&quot; they just want to keep the lines of communication open with Camelot.This kind of story is called &quot;satire&quot;. It is basically a story that teaches us something by making fun of something else. In this story, Mark Twain makes fun of the kind of people who think they can accomplish anything with technology. The Yankee thinks that he can use technology to trick the nights of King Arthur's court and to manipulate them. At first he succeeds, but gradually they become so immersed in the technology that they don't care about magic and legends any more. Once their mental landscape changes, the Yankee has lost the context he needed to control them. The main argument here is that technology does not solve everything, it just produces new problems. And the kind of people who worship technology are bound to fail in one way or another.Hope this helps."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"This is Twaine at his best. The book provokes thought, draws sympathy, and is downright hilarious. It also reads smoothly and at a brisk pace. It's a quick, fun read. I should also emphasize that while this is frequently labelled as children's literature, I find that label to be completely misleading. While it can no doubt be enjoyed by children at their level, there are a number of subtleties, particularly in the humor, that will be beyond the comprehension of most 13 year olds.The most pervasive feature of theme of the book is the ignorance of people in the sixth century. The Yankee is constantly dazzling both king and commoner with all manner of \\"miracles\\" (really just works of engineering or culture that he has as a result of his 19th century education). The people are the most easily duped idiots imaginable, and hold the most base conceptions and prejudices, and have no conception of justice. Twain believes these shortcomings are a product of their environment and education, rather than inherrent deficiencies (\\"training, all is training\\"). He also tackles slavery (an institution out of practice by the time of this book's writing), draws sympathy for slaves, and advocates the equality of all humanity. All pretty simple stuff. At a slightly deeper level, he tackles economic policy, namely protectionism vs. free trade, a debate that raged into his day and even into our own. He ridicules the views of the protectionists and their inability to understand the meaning of real vs. nominal wages, clearly a slap at certain arguments of his own day.Though the social commentary is interesting, if elementary, the satire is by far the best part of this book. Twain takes so many shots at so many targets that it's difficult even for the careful reader to notice them all. By far the funniest character is Alisande, a charicature of Arthurian women, who the yankee pejoritively nicknames \\"Sandy.\\" When she rambles on for hours to no apparent purpose \\"running her mill,\\" by whihc Twain pokes fun both of women in general and of their style of speech in Arthurian literature. A very funny scene is when Sandy relates a story from Thomas Mallory ver batim, with the Yankee constantly interjecting with suggestions to improve Mallory's arid writing style. \\"The Irish guy sounds like all the others, Sandy. You ought to give him a brogue, or at least have him say something like 'be jabbers' so that you'd know it's him speaking,\\" which of course is a suggestion Sandy takes.Another great piece of satire is Twain's commentary on the yankee himself. When he defeats opposing knights, he makes them sell all sorts of trinkets and products, from top hats to soap to stoves, as his way of spreading civilization. Of course these goods don't make a nation civilized, but that the yankee thinks they do is Twain's pejorative commentary as a westerner on eastern materialism. Twain's way of telling it is very funny stuff. There's much more excellent humor that can't be mentioned for the sake of space.The ending is another excellent commentary. The yankee's beautifully crafted civilization crashes down because of the irrascible prejudices of the people, which the church uses to its advantage. Twain's negative view of imperialism is here reflected, in how he depicts the folly of elevating a society by outside influences. A civilization must grow at its own pace, developing its views and values through a long process of trials. Attempts to import institutions from without are bound for failure. Though relevant in Twain's day, this is equally applicable in ours.So, if you want the whole package: a quick, easy read that also provides thought-proviking commentary and great humor, I'd recommend reading this. It would be hard to find a better book that has everything this one does."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"Although I usually enjoy Twain's writing style, and his sense of wry humor, there was something about A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court that was less than satisfying.Some of the situations that the protagonist gets himself into are \\"classic\\" Twain. When the narrator is transported back to the time of Camelot, he begins to speculate about rituals, customs and general style of life. There is one part where the townspeople are convinced that he can perform great magical feats (he actually has Merlin as his rival), and when they corner him about performing one, he has to think of a way to please them or face punishment. He realizes that he can remember when an eclipse is going to come, and there is the way out of his situation. There are many adventures, where the narrator becomes critical of their ways, as a time warp will do. He is a fish out of water in many ways in this new world, not understanding, for instance, their need to have extravagant adventures: \\"Hardly a month went by without one of these tramps arriving; and generally loaded with some tale about some princess or other wanting help to get her out of some faraway castle where she was being held in captivity by a lawless scoundrel...\\" Because of his ability to perform great acts, he becomes known as the Boss, and helps to free some poor peasants from terrible punishments.Maybe what made this less of a story was that it became too \\"preachy\\" and filled with social commentary. Although this is what usually makes Twain's novels, here it seemed to detract from the over all story. I was much more interested in hearing about the next adventure, but the narrator continued to rattle on and on about what he felt was wrong with this society. You get the feeling that Twain, not the narrator, is speaking after awhile. In the end, I guess it wasn't really the book I expected it to be. Still, it has its moments, and there are some parts that will have you chuckling to yourself as you read.I consider Twain to be one of my favorite authors, but this is one of his lesser achievements."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"The title also happens to be the plot outline. Elements of the plot have been duplicated in countless books, TV shows and movies. Army of Darkness and MacGyver leap immediately to mind. The book is a fantasy, and if haters can set aside its numerous anachronisms (A man from 1900, for example, would never be able to understand the language of 6th century England), it's quite enjoyable.The novel is considerably more adversarial than one might expect. The main character is uncouth, obnoxious, and a jerk, even more so than is necessary given the immensely frustrating ignorance of the 6th century people. I suspect Twain plugged himself in to the Boss character, and had a good old time writing this one.The main character is out to get the established Church, not in a no-holds-barred, Philip Pullman way, but in a logical way that recognizes the value of faith while tearing down the humanistic and suppressive political and economic machinations of the Church.Twain also takes shots at England through the ages, at its historically oppressive caste system and at the English people's long-running love of hereditary nobility.Commentary on politics and on human nature abound, but A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is still a great adventure story. These two elements step on each other's toes sometimes, but Twain pulls it off.Clunky title. Great book.RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"With so many versions of this novel to choose from, it's tough to pick the right one off the shelf. The Modern Library's version is wonderful. I highly receommend it. Well made and bound for easy reading, this novel even feels good in the hand. All the original illustrations are here, with the text wrapped around them marvelously. A true pleasure to read."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"**This review may contain spoilers.\\"Cursory reading of Twain's quasi-satirical \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\\" suggests that the author was simply interested in lampooning the blue whale-sized targets of Arthurian characters, chivalry, knightly ideals, tyranny, religious hypocrisy, ancestral elitism, and ignorant superstition. The novel does, but I believe Twain's satiric scope was much broader. \\"Connecticut Yankee\\"'s target is humanity and the human condition itself, with Hank Morgan as its ironic prism.Superficial readers of \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" are wont to cheer for the protagonist Hank as a droll, unflappable champion of progressive economic, social, and cultural freedom. On the surface, he is. But Hank is subtly more sinister than that. All his improvements and ameliorative actions throughout the book only seem to benefit the British populace. Instead, everything he does is ultimately self-aggrandizing and self-serving, not to mention manipulative. He constantly and contemptously plays upon the British population's (from serf to King Arthur) fearful ignorance and superstition to achieve his paradoxical goal of conquest. His purported dream of converting Britain into a republic is undercut by his \\"hankering\\" to be its first president. Hank's subtle imperialism shows through the seams. Even Hank's name is ironic. His last name, Morgan, reminds you of King Arthur's malicious sorcerous half-sister Morgan Le Fay, who also had designs on Arthur's kingdom.Hank manages to lay a veneer of 19th century \\"civilization\\" upon 6th century England, but as the Catholic Church's interdict towards the end of the novel proves, that veneer is transient. I believe the prominent theme of \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" is that human betterment must be inherent and developed from within by honest and genuine moral means, not imposed adventitiously from the outside. Furthermore, younger, pliant minds not marinated in superstition are more likely to retain these lessons better than their mentally intransigent elders. That's why the former page Clarence and fifty or so young men remained loyal to Hank even after the rest of Britain plunged back into the Dark Ages after the interdict.However, Hank manipulates even these followers in a desperate attempt to preserve a vestige of his republic. Like a modern fortress, Hank and his followers protect themselves with moats, electric fences, and Gatling guns and exterminate all the opposing English forces. However, it is a Pyrrhic victory because the mound of putrefying knightly corpses threaten to asphyxiate them. Merlin, who is portrayed as a buffoonish charlatan throughout the novel, suddenly displays his true powers and puts Hank in a deep sleep in a cave, to awaken 1300 years later. Hank does wake up, but, perhaps remorseful over his deeds, pines away for the noble, romanticized England he dismissed at the beginning of the novel.Successful satires about the human condition have two primary characteristics: 1) Humans and humanity have many flaws, sins, and vices and 2) Humans and humanity very seldom correct those flaws, sins, and vices. By these standards, \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" is a largely successful satire. Ultimately, there is no one really worthy of admiration, not the conniving Merlin, not the noble but dunderheaded King Arthur, not even young Clarence (though he comes reasonably close), and not the devious Hank. Perhaps \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" was the harbinger of Twain's increasingly dark and cynical attitude towards humanity in general."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"I bought the book for a trip I was taking down the Mississippi River during the summer of 2010.

What surprised me the most was that it was in the junior fiction section of my local library, and the more I read, the more surprised I was. I was an advanced reader when I was young, but I would have been hard pressed to understand or get much out of this book anytime before high school. That said, I was fairly riveted throughout the novel. Hank Morgan's character was amusing, resourceful, and altogether human. After reading so much about the \\"perfection\\" of Arthurian and Round Table society, it's nice to hear about what life would have been like even if King Arthur and his Round Table did exist. The ending was distinctly bittersweet, and I can honestly say that this has become one of my favorite classics."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"I've seen all of the one-star reviews of this book and they all seemed to be done by fourteen year olds with no imagination, and no understanding that bad grammar is to be left at AIM.

If you like Monty Python and the Holy Grail, it makes the book doubly interesting, because you can see how a person from the 1800's parodied medieval times versus a person from the 1960's. The only reason I gave this book four stars is because sometimes Twain did go on a little too long with the details.I really think you should read this book if you haven't had your mind melted by video games and graphic novels.

In particular, my first thought upon opening the book was as noted above. I fancied myself the sovereign of knowledge, a throne which holds much promise and much responsibility as Twain demonstrates throughout the book. This mental exercise led me to the same conclusion and results as Hank.I perhaps disdain the collusion and alliance of the church and monarchs as much as Twain who is particularly acrimonious of these institutions. I therefore identified with Hank readily and enjoyed reading as he organized and recruited among the populace those who would be most loyal to his cause. Gradually with education, toil, leadership and a bit of luck he finds himself at the helm of new political and economic system buttressed by a technological revolution.A lesson here perhaps for our \\"modern\\" leaders?A great bedtime story for your children as well as a disguised critique on monarchy and theocracy."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"I've been reading a lot of classic literature recently, and I also recently saw the Mississippi River for the first time...so this book seemed liked the perfect one for me to read right now.This is a \\"non-fictional\\" book by Mark Twain. (I guess that means based on some truth but embelished in various ways?) In it he recalls the years he spent during his youth as a steamboat pilot on the Mississippi River. Then he suddenly jumps forward many years in the book to when he is an older man. As an older man, he decides to go back and travel on the Mississippi River again. He finds the river much changed. The course of time (the Civil War has come and gone, the expansion of the railroad, and the forces of nature) have greatly changed life on the river. The once thriving steamboat trade has almost disapeared.Besides his personal recollections, he also includes other interesting stories,history,folklore, talltales, and such.

I really enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"This book was at first a huge disappointment. I went into to it expecting a humorous, light-hearted Mark Twain book. However, this was far from what I got. The story begins as a narration through the eyes of Hank Morgan, a 19th century factory manager. The plot starts when Hank is knocked out by an employee and wakes up in the 6th century. After dropping the idea that he is in a dream, he tries to make the best of the situation by improving the lives of the people. Using the knowledge he has of the future and his formal education, he wins the social rank known as &quot;The Boss&quot; and begins to educate a small group of people. His goal is to set up a republic and to destroy the overruling church officials. As time progresses, he sees the life of the people through their position (sees the life of a knight as a knight) and his desire to create an equal, yet effecient civilization increases. He tries to introduce the new ideas of his present time to them and the effect is something to read about. In the end, he learns that trying to change the atitude and customs of a large group of people is not as easy as he at first thought. The Yankee observed some very dark and distrubing facts about people. The book was not the most entertaining book, but the insight to humanity makes it well worth the read."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"A classic read, a man from the modern age is displaced in time winding up in Camelot.Mark Twain makes plenty of fun of chivalry and middle-age wizardry.The book first appeared in 1889, but it's an entertaining read today. The novel is filled with humor and at times takes an optimistic stance on technology and modern age versus middle age, but there're also some touching moments and more than meets the eye at a first stance.When considered at a deeper level, it can lead the reader to think about ancient times and their real connections to our current society. What was Mark Twain's perception of history, and what are the main influences on this perception?Anyway, it's not compulsory to ask such questions, and the novel is enjoyable from a purely &quot;entertainment&quot; perspective. The book is suited both for kids and adults."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"This book was actually required reading for one of my college classes. I really like the parts of the book where Twain talks about the river and becoming a steamboat captain, but I thought the rest of the book sort of dragged - I ended up skimming those parts. Still, though, he does talk about the river for most of the book, and it is a classic, so its worth reading at least once.

Outstanding!!!!!"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"This action adventure drama is a Mark Twain tale of a troubled man redirecting his life the fit the sixth century lifestyle. Written from his pen at the low point of his career, Mark Twain's Connecticut Yankee was unorganized, and is unable to hold one's attention.After being forcefully struck on the head by a not so gentle tool, Hank Morgan awakes with the realization that he is not in Kansas any more, in fact he is not in Connecticut either. He opens his eyes as a distraught stranger who has collided with a new age of unworldly elements, known as the sixth century. Coming from nineteenth century America, he is only equipped with confusion and bewilderment. Although throughout his existence in his present setting he learns that he possesses the power of knowledge and experience that he has involuntarily drawn from the well of the future. Stealthily using this to his advantage he quickly works his way up Camelot's socioeconomic ladder he then takes a position among the sixth century's finest.Almost immediately after acquiring his coveted political stature Hank is questioned of his worth. He is challenged with a knightly quest. Adventure arouses when he nobily accepts this journey. On the way he partners with a disarranged, yet flamboyant, long-winded maiden who shares Hank's company, while ruining his silence throughout their quarry. All through Hank's entity in the sixth century he indirectly influences the people with his foreign knowledge, all the while going through life altering experiences that will be impressed upon his mind for the rest of his days.It is obviously shown that Mark Twain was in an unhappy stage of his life while composing this peace. Do not be disillusioned by past reputations. The strong and healthy characters, depthful plots, and striking adventure are absent in this book. The story gave a feeling of gloomy misery, and anger. The climax and conclusion were blunt and quite unsatisfying, leaving the reader not only needing more, but wanting a plot as well. Packed with interesting yet depressing insights to mankind, and the actuality of the often glorified Camelot, the story does leave one thinking. Although all the while giving the reader a stale and dismal reaction. Consistently questioning the reader's interest, this book is graced with an unconcluded and depressing response."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"Had Twain stopped after the first section, in which he describes riverboat piloting and his exploits therein, I would have come away with a positive impression of the book. His piloting writings were entertaining and interesting, even though not particularly relevant in today's world.However the later chapters ruin the book. Twain documents his return to the Mississippi with a plethora of miscellaneous descriptions and loosely related anecdotes. These sections range from only mildly entertaining to just plain boring, as Twain doesn't even use his humor to save them.In the end the disappointment of the second half outweighs the enjoyment of the first half."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"Mark Twain is a great author, but not here. I liked his \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and \\"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" and, I've a fine appreciation for the man's sheer wit. \\"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\\" is the best short story I had to read in High School. \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\\" is an overblown rant against religion dressed in the trappings of novelization.I found the plot absurd. Twain's barbs against religion were witty, but so over-the-top they interfered with the actual story. I kept finding the novel stupid instead of funny, and pointless instead of witty, especially when 'technology/modern civilization' began dominating the court. The use of detail detracted from the story; extremely overwritten. The main character was an 'expert' on everything, and felt more like an author's mouthpiece than a real man, even a caricature of a man. If you aren't amused by old-style religious slanders, expect a plot, and have read modern time travel stories, you'll hate this so-called 'great' novel.Please feel free to discuss in the comments rather than giving me rage-unhelpfuls because you disagree with my opinion.

I guess in today's fast paced world if a book doesn't come with large speakers, a big screen and a joy stick it is boring. We aren't sheep, and are entilted to our own opinion, but when I hear the word boring being used to describe anything, it intrigues me and makes me want to see who used it."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"This novel by Mark Twain tells the story of a man who is swept back in time to the Dark Ages, the supposed period that Arthur and his round table existed. The story seems light hearted and fun throughout most of the text, but it was also written to make apparent the problems of medieval socity, specifically the form of government, which was feudalsim. Fuedalism's downfalls are thoroughly ecplored all throughout the novel by hank Morgan, the main character, as he thoughout the land trying to show the people of the time how wrong the way they live is. mark twain's writin style comes through very stronglyin thsi novel. Like many of his other books (Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn) CYKAC at first glance looks and reads like a children's story. but as further reading and closer study show this is not correct. Several times very graphic descriptions of death and fighting are used and many of the issues addressed by Twain take a knowledgeable mind to be comprehended. This style of writing is misleading at times, because of the way the author describes people and things in a light hearted an almost comical manner. He also labels characters throughout the story with odd names and titles. The light-hearted nature soon fades away when the author paints a picture of families being separated by slavery or the injustice of the Church to the people it is supposed to serve. Twain's writing style may be misleading, but it adds flavor and diversity to the text that is hard to find in other novels. The story That Twain writes is really a parody of the Arthurian legends we all know. Twain keeps the same names and positions of the characters, but completely changes their personalities from what we are used to. Many times when a character is into\\\\roduced it is shocking to think of them the way Twain wants us too. But what he really is doing is showing us realistically what King Arthur and his knights would be like if they had existed in medieval times. The author's perception of the characters real, more human selves was believable, but in contrast the exploits of hank Morgan were astronomicaly unbelievable. hank's adventures throughout the kingdom were entertaining, but were bogged down by the issues that the author wanted to bring across to the reader. more comic relief was needed to keep the reader from becoming depressed and to keep the story moving. Over all CYKAC was fun to read and well written, even though it could have done without some of the lectures and soul grabbing that the author throws at you. The ideas taht Hank comes up with are fascinating and totally unbelievalbe, but I still enjoyed them. The change in the characters personalities were a welcome change form the traditional &quot;knights in shining armor&quot; mold used in many other Arthur novels. It gave the story a new boost and helped separate it from the rest of the Arthurian legends. At times it may have been slow, but the freshness and diversity of the book kept me from putting it down, and I think you to will agree with me if you decide to read this novel"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"I haven't read much of Twain's works, but this is undoubtly the best Twain book I have ever read (Huckleberry Finn, Tom Sawyer, jumping frogs...bleurgrht!).

It gave interesting ideas and showed the foolishness of the knights in the famed 'Camelot.' I loved it.&quot;"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"A &quot;modern&quot; (late 1800s) man named Hank Morgan, after getting into a fight with a subordinate at his factory and being knocked on the head, is mysteriously transported back to Britain, 19 Jun 528 AD, the heyday of Camelot, King Arthur and the Knights of the Table Round. The book is presented as a kind of diary of his experiences there.Hank is able to use his modern knowledge to perform feats which awe the locals and their king and is promoted to being the king's right hand man. Hank goes about making various improvements, with an eye toward eventual revolution to free the common people from the oppressive social system. He starts secret &quot;man factories&quot;, recruiting those real men (and women) who seem to have an inkling that they can and should break free of domination and live in freedom and independence.A main thrust of the story is to disabuse the reader of any romantic notions he may be harboring about this era of history. The author clearly portrays the barbarism, filth, injustice, senseless violence, backwardness and brutality of this time and these people, often mocking their ignorance and superstition in the light of our more enlightened ways.A particular gripe is the humble but ignorant reverence of the common folk for King, Church and nobility. He vents that the terrible violence of the French Revolution pales in comparison to the centuries of depredations imposed on the common people who, in his view, were fully justified in that bloodletting. He rails against the Catholic Church of the day as a chief enemy of the freedom of the common people, encouraging them to remain humble toward authority (however unjust) and comtemplate the higher, God-ordained reasons for their sufferings.Among my favorite of the host of bit-part characters to make an appearance in the book is Sir Ossaise of Surluse, &quot;a brave knight and of considerable celebrity&quot; resulting from significant skill in past knightly jousting tournaments. He is one of the many knights that Hank has put to work as traveling salesmen, wearing bulletin-boards front and aft advertising Hank's many innovative products, such as tooth-wash and soap. Hank explains that Sir Ossaise was &quot;of a light and laughing disposition, and to him nothing in this world was serious,\\" which is why he has chosen him to advertise his stove polish (there are no stoves yet). When we meet him, Sir Ossaise has played a trick on another salesman (of toothbrushes) by sending the latter after a group of \\"likely customers.\\" After a long, hard chase, that energetic knight discovers the group consists of five poor souls released the night before from a long dungeon imprisonment, it having been &quot;all of 20 years since any one of them had known what it was to be equipped with any remaining snag or remnant of a tooth.&quot;One touching scene happens when Hank and King Arthur disguise themselves as commoners and travel throughout the kingdom to assess what's really happening there. Along the way, they are captured for the purpose of being sold into slavery (since they cannot prove their status as freemen and the ancient Roman law holds that they are slaves until proven otherwise). Hank is able to play along, knowing he'll eventually work out a way to get free. The king, with his high-born pride, keeps his chin up and maintains an attitude of resistance and defiance, refusing to yield to the abusive slave trader. Hank observes that the king truly knows how to act like the free man he is, regardless of circumstances.While early in the book it seems we are headed in a promising direction toward a happy and virtuous end, Twain later turns the plot in darker directions. Hank stages a &quot;final battle&quot; between the forces of Chivalry (about 30,000 knights) and his own forces of republican progress (himself and 52 boys!). The Battle of the Sand Belt is an outright slaughter of the larger reactionary force. Unfortunately, the evil Merlin has the last laugh and puts Hank into a 13-century sleep, even as his co-conspirators are trapped in their cave fortress and being sickened by the 30,000 decaying corpses of the opposition (so much for a light-hearted and happy ending).In the last scene, Twain has finished reading the manuscript given to him by Hank back in the 19th century. It is toward morning at the lodge where they are both staying and Hank is sleeping fitfully and making noises in the next room. When Twain checks on him, Hank is muttering about his beloved 6th century life (including a wife and child), apparently relieved that his 19th-century experiences were &quot;just a dream.&quot; We, of course, are left assuming that Hank's 6th century experiences were the dream (but of course, there IS that written record ... hmmmm). Before he wakes up, Hank dies in his sleep, so we'll never know for sure.The author clearly holds the misguided assumption that religion is hostile to freedom (see The Theme is Freedom by M. Stanton Evans for a full treatment of this error). He sees morality, human nature and society as being malleable by human reason, rather than as following fixed norms created by God. This way of thinking sees a strong affinity between the (very different) American and French Revolutions and interprets both as a throwing off of the shackles of religion and tradition which are believed to encumber the pure, relativist, rationalist and optimistic vision of liberty. In summary, its a fun story, but suffers from incorrect assumptions about reality."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"The name of the book I am critiquing is A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur&#65533;s Court by Mark Twain tells the story of a Connecticut man who is thrown back in time to the King Arthur time period. He is faced with a lot of these incidents like going to war.It takes place in the nine tenth century in Camelot. I found this book to be a good one because Mark Twain does a great job of putting a picture of what of what the main character is seeing and exepriencing. The details ore so well put that you can almost believe you were their. Also, the way the characters talk and the dialogue is so fitting to the character.Finally, I would recommend this book to teens because a child wouldn&#65533;t get it and I think an adult wouldn&#65533;t be interested. I hope my review has been useful to you."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is an interesting novel written by Mark Twain. This is a fantastic book for the high school level reader, but would be entertaining to adults as well. In this novel the main character, Hank Morgan, is mysteriously transported from the nineteenth century in Connecticut back to the fifth century in England. During his time in medieval Britain, he keeps a journal which is what most of this book is. The preface and afterwards are both the narration of Mark Twain who writes as if he has found Hank's journal, and is merely writing it down in a book. As the journal starts out, Hank is introduced to King Arthur and after narrowly escaping death and becomes the country's most powerful advisor. Hank introduces many modern wonders to this feudal society. He is hailed a magician, being able to perform wonderful &quot;miracles&quot; and &quot;magic&quot;, when it really is only modern science. It is very entertaining to read about how the feeble-minded people of that time react to these feats. In the end, there is a tremendous battle with many exciting episodes leading up to it. If a reader is partial to battle scenes of high caliber, this is a book for him! Of course, Hank has many other battles as well. Once of his biggest enemies is the Church of England. The big question the reader asks themselves during this book is &quot;Will Hank return to his time and if so, how?&quot;. It was exciting for me to ponder this question throughout the novel. During Hank's travels through medieval Britain, he meets many people. The people he meets who think a government ruled by the people in Britain (his ultimate goal) would be a good idea, he sends to Camelot where he has schools set up which teach people about modern governmental ideas. Schools were also set up to teach people how to produce his wonders of modern science. These few enlightened people remain loyal to Hank until the very end. I thought it an entertaining notion that people, who were trained from birth to believe in one thing, could realize its faults and begin to believe another things. I really enjoy this book because it brings a lot about human nature into question. It discusses the vast differences of beliefs, manners, and life styles between one hundred years ago and fourteen hundred years ago. I also thought the differences between classic Arthurian legend and Mark Twain's perspective of the time was very interesting. Hanks training of these idealistic people he runs across plays into the large political aspect of this book. Since Hank's ultimate goal is to transform Britain into a country ruled by the people, he starts factories producing modern goods, which greatly changes the lives of the Britons. I enjoyed the descriptions of the people's reaction to these modern products of science thirteen centuries before they would be invented. Throughout the entire book commentary and philosophizing concerning the comparison of the fifth century feudal system of Britain and the nineteenth century democracy of the U.S. by Hank Morgan is common. This political aspect is typical of Twain's works. It gave me great pleasure to read this aspect of the book and to comprehend it's meaning. Through Hank Morgan, Mark Twain is able to depict vivid images in the readers mind. Whether it is a person, scene, or sensation felt by Hank Twain describes it in a way that puts a solid picture in the imagination of the reader. I have not seen the movie of this novel, but I have heard it isn't very well done and it is nothing compared to the book. I believe this is because Mark Twain paints such a realistic picture in the mind of the reader, it is nothing compared to what some director can film. From Mark Twain's great descriptions and writing style to the unique ideas presented, the novel A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is a fantastic novel. There are so many aspects of it to enjoy, and it is just an all around entertaining book. I give this book four out of five stars and I recommend it to any one interested in fantasy, especially if they want a different perspective on King Arthur.BY: Christian J. Vazquez"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"Mark Twain was one of the United States' greatest writers, but not one of its most brilliant novelists. A case in point is this 1889 novel, \\"A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court.\\"The plot has been redone so many times as to make a synopsis here seem pointless. The title character is a practical-minded factory superintendent from Hartford laid out by a crowbar-wielding worker and transported to the time of King Arthur. After conning the locals by anticipating an eclipse and pretending he has blotted out the sun, the Yankee sets to work reforming Arthur's kingdom in slow degrees, earning the wrath of the wizard Merlin among others.The novel's defenders point out that while written in the guise of a children's novel, \\"A Connecticut Yankee\\" is a cleverly subversive satire that ridicules tradition and progress simultaneously. For seven-eighths of the book, however, it is neither a fair nor a scintillating fight. Our hero, Hank Morgan, is the book's narrator, and perhaps unreliable, but Twain offers no hint of this as Morgan and Twain mock the customs and puncture the myths of this bygone day, informing us whatever existed then couldn't hold a candle to the present day.\\"Somehow, every time the magic of folderol tried conclusions with the magic of science, the magic of folderol got left,\\" Morgan explains.As the book develops, Morgan builds up the society he finds with modern conveyances, including trains, guns, and telephones. At one point in the story, knights ride to battle on bicycles.Anachronism soon devolves as the main source of humor for the book, along with the narrator's off-handed way of telling us about the people he meets, none of whom impress him. One maiden proves such a windy bore it is a surprise to find Morgan later married to her, and quite a fond husband at that. There is one fellow named Clarence who becomes Morgan's chief acolyte, but he only shows up to help Morgan out of the various minor jams that form the narrative thrust of our story.Much of the time, Twain uses Morgan's experience as an excuse to launch into some invective, particularly involving institutions like slavery and the Roman Catholic Church. Critics talk about this as a slam against capitalism, too, but for the most part Twain presents capitalism as a fine and noble thing, ruined only by the blinkered idiocy of Arthur's subjects.Whatever point Twain had in setting this story in Camelot goes by the boards after 50 pages. He references Malory but demonstrates little interest or fondness for the subject. Arthur goes on one meandering journey with Morgan disguised as a serf, Twain borrowing from his own \\"Prince And The Pauper\\", but Arthur otherwise registers little in the story and his court even less. When Arthur's fate is sealed, it occurs off-stage and is presented in the manner of a second-hand report.I got the feeling that Twain had a good idea for a novel but no notion what to do with it. This happens with his novels, like \\"Pudd'nhead Wilson\\" and \\"The Gilded Age.\\" His best-known novel, \\"Huckleberry Finn,\\" has a famously disjointed ending, though that wrapper is a regular prize compared to what he does here. It's one of the big \\"huh\\" moments in American literature, exceeded only by those critics who explain why it is so brilliant, because it satirizes the whole message of the rest of the novel or anticipates trench warfare or shows why suits of armor are a bad idea when worn in battle against an electrified fence. To me it's Twain clearly throwing up his arms and leaving his reader in a hole after being dragged around for over 300 pages.Twain knocks off some good one-liners, and does enough with the concept in the beginning that you wish his heart had stayed in the venture. It didn't, but fortunately for his legacy academia has been more than willing to make up for his lack of patience or effort."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"This was one of my favorite books when I was growing up so now that I own a kindle I can reread and enjoy it all over again.

He sends a mechanical genius back to the time of King Arthur to take a look back at America. Because of his knowledge, the narrarator becomes the King's right-hand man, the second most powerful man in England, known as The Boss. He begins to establish a more advanced society underground to gaurd against the Church. Over many years, he learns to adjust to the society and becomes respected world-wide due to his &quot;magic.&quot; Unforetunately this results in making Merlin his great advisary. The Boss goes on many adventures and gets involved in many predicaments, each time surviving by his wit and knowledge.

No contest!"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&iexcl;s Court&iexcl; is a hilarious story written by Mark Twain. The story starts out talking about a young man named Hank Morgan, who was somehow transported back to the 6th century in England. He started out thinking that he arrived in an asylum, where everybody thought they were in the time of King Arthur. He later proved himself that he was in the 6th century by witnessing a total solar eclipse which he knew it was going to occur on the twenty-first of June A.D. 528 at 3 minutes after noon. After that event, he was given place in the government, and continuously used his cleverness and knowledge he learned in the 19th century to improve and prefect the country he was living in, during the 6th century. He used his knowledge in the field of science and performed what the people in the medieval times, called magic; and as time progressed he became the country&iexcl;s most powerful advisor. During this period of time, he kept a journal, which is what most of this book is.Unlike most of the other stories, the plot of this story was consisted of two time periods, the modern 19th century and the medieval 6th century. The main character, Hank Morgan, was mysteriously sent back and became someone like Jesus because he knew what was happening and what is going to happened already in the history lessons when he was still in the 19th century. A literary device Mark Twain used in this book that made this book very amusing was all the satires Hank used to mock the people in King Arthur&iexcl;s court. For example, when a page was introducing himself to Mark, Mark said, &iexcl;Go &iexcl;long, you ain&iexcl;t more than a paragraph.&iexcl;I recommend this book for people who want something light and less serious, because this book will give you a good laugh."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"A Connecticut in King Arthur's Court gives the reader a feel for how someone must adapt to a new surrounding they are put into. Mark Twain shows that in the Yankee, as he gets more involved in the community as the novel goes on. The book starts in an upbeat comical mood. Jokes are being thrown, and people are having fun times. Thenn the mood of the book starts to get darker. The flaws of Camelot and the King start to come out. Twain does a great job using detail in the story, setting, and characters. He must have done some research while writing. The beginning of the book will hook you in to keep reading. I couldn't wait for the next adventure or squabble to pop up."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"The main character, Hank Morgan, gets hit on the head in the 19th century and goes back in time to the year 528 in King Arthur's court. Using modern technology, he becomes more famous than evil Merlin the Magician. Hank, titled the Boss, meets humble friends like Clarence and Sandy who help him get accustomed to the Medieval Period. Hank travels around the English countryside with a down-to-earth man, King Arthur. I liked the story because it was interesting and unique. I found the story to be interesting because the 19th century meets the 6th century. Hank brings electricity, personal hygiene methods, and other modern conveniences with him to the Medieval community. It is interesting how the Middle Ages people get acquainted with these technological advances. The book also gives you insight and a new point-of-view on famous Medieval legends. King Arthur dresses up as a peasant, his sister Morgan Le Fay overturns hanging sentences, and Merlin becomes a deceiving, unfriendly magician, all as a result of Hank's magical powers and his influence on them. There are a few very intense and suspenseful events that make you wonder the fate of Medieval myths. The book has a complicated plot. There can be parts where there is little or no eventful action for a long time. However, when there is an action, it is intense and happens quickly. If you like fantasy and/or myths, you will definitely love A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. It is a mature, insightful book. Twain maintains his reputation as a master storyteller with this book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"A very amusing, political satire. Many interesting points were brought up and even when Twain addressed serious issues of class and self and society, his humor shined thru. It is nineteenth century technological reliances meeting sixth century codes of chivalry. Of course it is all very anachronistic, but instead of hurting the work it helps Twain prove his points. I don't agree with those who consider it chaotic, although I do see that some may find it so since Twain attempts so much. He tries to tell an interseting tale, question society and mankind, and be humorous all at once which IS difficult, if not impossible."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"Here is my review.You would have to be mentally ill to pay $12.00 for a book you can download for free.This book would have to be capable of doing my taxes for the asking price."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"Mark Twain, like Will Rogers is an American icon.

Morgan keeps a diary of the events and happenings of what goes on during his crazy adventure at King Arthur's kingdom. Using 19th century technological advancments, Morgan fools everyone into believing that he is a great magician. After he gains the respect of the kink and the people, he becomes known as &quot;The Boss&quot;. He goes on several adventures which result in a comical, exiting atmosphere for the book to take place in. I didn't particularly like this book for a couple of reasons. First off, none of the jokes are funny. This might be because it was writtern in the 19th century. The author (Mark Twain) was probably cracking jokes from the time it was written. Some times the jokes dept on repeating themselves. Morgan kept on using slang from the 19th century; of coarse none of the medieval characters were understood him. The book also got really boring, really fast. There was really no action in it. It seemed like the author was trying to make it funny, but couldn't. The characters were unrealistic; they would not be in the same mood for 5 minutes.

I felt that Twain often drug on certain topics or ideas. I think that I would have found this book to be a lot more interesting if Twain would have been more forward and to the point.

He develops England using modern technology. He goes on some expeditions and tries to change everything that was bad in the Medevil times. I did not like the book at all because it was incredibly boring. Most of the book had nothing to do with the main climax. The whole book was filled with completly irelevant and confusing details. There were a lot of things that happened suddenly and were not sufficently explained-like when Hank got married. Overall there were to many details where they didn't need them and not enough details where they did need them. The book was also very unrealistic. If Hank knew all that he did in the book, he would have probably rivaled Einstien's IQ.

The main characters were Merlin, King Arthur, Clarence and the main character Hank Morgan. I did not like this book. I think the book is very boring because it is hard to understand the complicated text. The way that the text was complicated was Mark Twain was writing how Middle Ages citizens would talk and one of his sentences went like this, &quot;Graddually as the time wore down one annoying fact still borne upon my understanding&quot;. Another reason I don't like this book is that it is to hard to know what is really going on and who is speaking in the book. At one point in this book I had a totaly different picture in my mind then what was happening in the book. I thought that Clarence and not Hank Morgan was going to get hanged and then burned.

Hank Morgan's intent to both dominate and liberate Arthurian England, and to \\"rescue\\" a supposedly benighted country so that it might become an image of the United States, foreshadows the American Exceptionalism that took us into Viet Nam and, later, into Iraq. When Arthurian England decides it does not want to be liberated, or to become like the United States, Hank in a fit of temper destroys a culture, using American technology to bring about its ruin.

I found this book very boring because it didn't have much action to keep my attention. The reason why it was so boring is because the guy just sits around all day feeling proud of his high status. The story also doesn't have many characters, which would have made it more interesting. The book was also hard to understand. Because it was set in the middle ages, the characters used old-fashioned words like &quot;Lo&quot; &quot;thou art&quot; etc. that i could not understand.

The man attempts to modernize everything. He makes people believe he is a powerful magician by performing simple acts that seem unreal to the people. For example, he blows up a tower by connecting gun powder to a lightning rod during a storm. Amazing....I think not. I thought this book was boring because there are to many unnecessary details. Who cares what each prison cell looks like? One whole chapter was on the prices of food and how they vary from town to town. Another reason I disliked this book is because it was hard to follow. All the different knights names are so hard to remember and its so slow paced that if you put the book down you can't remember what was going on and you're not interested enough to care.

That Twain has managed such a mix is further proof of his crowning genius.The story revolves around Hank Morgan, a modern American businessman who is transported back in time. He is shocked by the backwardness, ignorance, and poverty of Arthurian England and decides that the people there deserve a \\"new deal.\\" (This novel is where FDR picked up that phrase)The novel is mostly comic, occasionally tragic, and consistently compelling as it follows this quixotic scheme to its ultimate conclusion. The plot reveals Twain's brilliant insights on the nature of freedom; the trade-offs involved with economic development; America's role in world history; the interplay between capitalism, religion, and tradition; and the tragedies of history, without ever tipping his hand as to what Twain himself believes.And, of course, it is hilarious. The Yankee's misery while wearing armor, his bafflement at chivalric customs, and the bizarre contrasts between his modern innovations and the medievel world make for regular laughs. No other author could make his readers think so hard while laughing so hard.Recently, this book has gained an added resonance, as Twain's take on the Americanization of a traditional culture can be easily applied to our current projects in Iraq and Afghanistan. Twain ends his book with a violent insurgency against the Yankee intruder, and horrific bloody tragedy. Hopefully our project will not end in the same way."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"The best work by Twain I've read to date. This combination history, memoir, travelogue, and collection of sketches is both humorous and entertaining. I have also learned a great deal about Twain, his time, and the history of steamboating and the Mississippi. Written later in his life, this work is mature in style as well as content in spite of its loose organization and focus. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"Twain has a way of taking something that we commonly idealize and shooting holes all through it. Where Letters From Earth took aim at religious belief, this time its Camelot. This is a good satire although not as strong as Letters which is a five star multiple reading kind of book.In Connecicut Yankee, the author runs across Hank Morgan on a tour of Warwick Castle. They \\"fell together as modest people will in the tail of a herd being shown through\\". Morgan, however, has an uncommon familiarity with the objects shown and he eventually ends up relating the story of a Connecticut Yankee to Twain after a few hot Scotch whiskeys.Morgan, it seems, after a crack on the head, found himself transported back to King Arthur's time. After being captured by Sir Kay and being delivered to the Round Table as a trophy, Henry Morgan asserts himself as a master magician over Merlin and sets himself up as \\"The Boss\\". He then begins to secretly initiate improvements and reforms such as setting up a clandestine WestPoint, installing telephone lines, starting manufacturing centers and training journalists - all the while balancing the Church and the traditional castes of the country. A misheard comment lands him scheduled to duel Sir Sagramore but is postponed for Sagramore's crusading stint. In the meantime and in preparation for the undetermined date of the duel, Arthur assigns Morgan to the aid of a young girl who comes to the table claiming that a number of princesses are being held captive by ogres. From there he goes on to \\"magically\\" fix the Holy Fountains, a spring to which people pilgrimage but has stopped flowing and then, with King Arthur in tow, attempts to travel as a commoner and lands in a world of trouble after he and the King are taken as slaves. It is a fun story with a lot of humorous situations. This is why it is recommended to young readers, I suppose.However, Twain's biting sarcasm makes it a good book for adults too. His antecdotes are vehicles for pointing out the absurdity of the concept of nobility, the probability that the belief in ogres and magicians meant that the people of the time were largely ignorant and gullible. And in their ignorance, they are cruel. Time and again we come back to this theme. But, back to the sarcasm. For example, one of his methods of getting rid of knights is by turning them into traveling salespeople of various household sundries!Additional meanings, interpretations, etc. are explored in the afterword and, honestly, unless it had been pointed out I would not have caught it at all. I didn't see this as a treatise on the nature of man although, once explained, I saw that that was there. I enjoyed this simply as a light satirical story."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"Mark Twain is synonymous worldwide with the Mississippi River, mainly because of the Tom Sawyer/Huck Finn stories. However, Life on the Mississippi is just as important and, in a testament to Twain's greatness, nearly as readable despite being non-fiction. It details his history with the river and gives an overview of the river itself; this may sound boring, and almost certainly would be with anyone else, but I long ago decided that even Twain's laundry list would be worth reading, and this certainly is. The magic he seemed to bring to everything is in full force; one would be very hard-pressed to find another non-fiction book that is so entertaining, besides Twain's others of course, but it is also awesomely informative. In addition, Life is historically notable as the first book written on a typewriter, not Huck as is commonly thought; however, it made Twain able to finish Huck, which he had struggled with for some years and set aside. Huck fans and scholars will want to read Life for this alone, but it is more than worthy in itself.Twain starts by giving some basic facts and history; this is the least interesting part but only lasts a few pages, and I urge anyone bored by it to continue. Much of the information is of course dated but remains historically valuable as a portrait of the river as it then stood. Far more interesting is Twain's unforgettable rundown of his years as a riverboat pilot - a central life experience that led to much of his writing. We get a fascinating glimpse of this long-vanquished trade, which was all but unthinkable even when Life was published. It is important to recall that Twain was a pilot before such boats had steam or even lights at night. He details piloting's extraordinary difficulties with engrossing detail and typical self-deprecating humor. We learn much along the way about the riverboat lifestyle, the river itself, and riverside towns. Anyone curious about what it was like to live in this era and/or how its inhabitants thought and acted will find a wealth of information; we learn as much here as in any history book, and it is of course infinitely better written. Life covers a crucial American history era and is an important primary source even for those not interested in Twain and certainly essential for anyone who is, as it gives substantial background about a crucial part of his life. The book is indeed in part a bildungsroman; Twain had always loved the river and began pilot training soon after first leaving home. He structures the narrative so that it reads much like a story, and we see him grow from navet&eacute; and ignorance to an admirable experience and wisdom.Twain then details a trip he made on the river many years later, noting what changed and what stayed the same. There is significant autobiographical material here also, but the crux is descriptive. Twain describes the river's whole length and everything having to do with it as he goes, making it all utterly absorbing. As always, there are many eminently readable tangents. Several are autobiographical - reminisces as well as then recent events. Particularly interesting is Twain's profoundly touching visit to his hometown after a long absence. However, a good part of Life has nothing to do with the river directly but is at least as engrossing as what does. Twain's many asides are full of wit and insight; few have ever probed so deeply into life and humanity, and we are lucky to have his wisdom, much of which is hilarious. Especially engaging are observations on North/South differences, notably including the Civil War. Twain's sociopolitical criticism is also as brilliant as ever, taking on everything from architecture to Walter Raleigh to speech. Finally, Life would be valuable even if lacking all this because it passes on an invaluable treasure of American folklore.Life is quite simply required reading for anyone even remotely interested in American literature; it is essential Twain, which makes it simply essential."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"In the novel, A Connecticut in King Arthur's Court, Mark Twain shows the differences between modern society, and sixth century Great Britain. Hank is a self-assured factory worker who knows how to make just about anything. The protagonist, is mysteriously transported back to the sixth century, when struck in the head by a crowbar.He uses his vast knowledge of explosives and metals to quickly become a leader in the monarchy. His democratic thoughts and ideas become his ambition as he strives to make Great Britain a republic. Twain's novel shows how much of a change society has gone through from the sixth century to the time of the writing of the novel. He also show's how little education anyone received in the sixth century, even the members of royalty are not very wise. Hank's mediocre education is far superior to anybody's in the whole monarchy, because of the advances in education to the present.Twain shows that the laws of the sixth century were made for the few against the many. At one point a woman is put to death for stealing just enough food to feed her baby. Hank tries, throughout the book, to get the royalty to realize how unfair their laws are to the common man.This book makes you feel angry at points about the horribleness of the monarchy, yet ashamed because similar acts still go on in the present. An example would be how the rich and privileged still get the best of everything, while the have-nots get the last and worst of everything, both now and then. Twain has a comic sense in the book, and yet he still shows a contrast between the comic and the serious. This book should be a classic for Twain's creative portrayal of the sixth century, yet also because it makes us think about our society today."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"Twain's account of his years on the Mississippi is part travel book, part memoir, and part historical work, with a few sketches, stories, and tall tales tossed in for good measure. There is even an outtake from the not-yet-published \\"Huckleberry Finn,\\" along with extensive excerpts from historical and contemporary accounts by other authors. This smorgasbord of material makes for an uneven book, but much of it shows Mark Twain at his humorous and humanistic best.The kernel of the volume (and its best, most cohesive section) is in chapters 4 through 17; this material appeared in the Atlantic magazine in 1875 and recalls his early life as a crew member on steamboats in the early 1850s. His adventures as a young man are fraught with danger, full of comedy, populated by a number of ornery, mischievous, and reckless characters, and occasionally embellished (although Twain is a bit obvious when he's fobbing off a yarn). As Twain later wrote in \\"Puddn'head Wilson, \\"if there was anything better in this world than steamboating, it was the glory to be got by telling about it.\\"After he published the series in the Atlantic, Twain added another 46 chapters; much of it an account of his homecoming (incognito--or so he'd hoped) to the Mississippi River in 1882, when the steamboat had been rendered obsolete by the railroad. Many of these descriptions are unusually (for Twain) melancholy; he remarks upon the relatively emptiness of the river traffic and notes the transformations to the river and its banks that had made steamboat travel safer but less adventurous. His new journey provides opportunities to relate a number of stories--some allegedly told to him on the river and a few unpublished tales that he deemed relevant and worthy of inclusion.The material from other sources, unfortunately, tends to bog things down--and there are about 10,000 words of it commingled in the text and included as appendices. Twain gathered newspaper articles and historical documents; he also included travel writing from earlier visitors, primarily Europeans distracted by how Americans and their homes were horribly uncouth and dirty. (You almost get the feeling that Twain would have smacked \\"the once renowned and vigorously hated\\" Frances Trollope upside the head if he'd had the chance; she provides Twain with the most interesting, if snooty, descriptions of traveling along the Mississippi early in the century.)The material Twain wrote, however, more than compensates for the dryness of the extraneous stuff. As always, he is quotable, witty, amusing, and provocative. In spite of its excesses, nobody has done the Mississippi better."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"Who hasn&#65533;t heard of King Arthur and the knights of his Round Table? Along with Robin Hood, the tales of King Arthur are the most exciting tales that British history has produced &#65533; tales of grand chivalry, as gallant knights in shining armour rescue damsels in distress, and fight for courage, truth and justice. But were the knights really so noble and courageous? Through the eyes of a nineteenth century Yankee (Hank Morgan) who goes back in time to King Arthur&#65533;s sixth century court, Mark Twain suggests that the sixth century wasn&#65533;t quite so glamorous. Here&#65533;s a taste of his delightful humour: &#65533;As a general thing &#65533; as far as I could make out &#65533; these murderous adventures were not forays undertaken to avenge injuries, nor to settle old disputes or sudden fallings out; no, as a rule they were simple duels between strangers &#65533; duels between people who had never even been introduced to each other, and between whom existed no cause of offense whatever.&#65533; Twain compares it to boys going at it on the spot: &#65533;I had always imagined until now, that that sort of thing belonged to children only, and was a sign and mark of childhood; but here were these big boobies sticking to it and taking pride in it clear up into full age and beyond. Yet there was something very engaging about these great simple-hearted creatures, something attractive and loveable. There did not seem to be brains enough in the entire nursery, so to speak, to bait a fishhook with; but you didn&#65533;t seem to mind that, after a little, because you soon saw that brains were not needed in a society like that, and, indeed would have marred it, spoiled its symmetry &#65533; perhaps rendered its existence impossible.&#65533; (p16) As for the quest for the Holy Grail? &#65533;The boys all took a flier at the Holy Grail now and then. It was several years&#65533; cruise. They always put in the long absence snooping around, in the most conscientious way, though none of them had any idea where the Holy Grail really was, and I don&#65533;t think any of them actually expected to find it, or would have known what to do with it if he *had* run across it ... Every year expeditions went out holy grailing, and next year relief expeditions went out to hunt for *them*.&#65533; (p54)Sound wickedly funny? Hank Morgan doesn&#65533;t stop there with his nineteenth century heroic arrogance. Using his superior knowledge of solar eclipses, blasting powder, reading and writing, and electronics, he soon becomes The Boss who single-handedly helps sixth century Britain take a short-cut to nineteenth century civilization. Chivalry becomes a thing of the past, and the knights of the Round Table are converted to more worthwhile endeavours as baseball-players and business men &#65533; some commissioned on more nineteenth century style quests as &#65533;missionaries&#65533; to advertise soap and toothbrushes on sandwich boards. It helps, of course, that the magician Merlin is a faker and con-artist, and that hero Hank can do much more impressive &#65533;miracles&#65533;, which are nothing less than elaborate scientific stunts with blasting powder and cement. Camelot soon finds itself with a functioning telephone system and newspaper. All is wonderful, until our hero is commissioned to go on a quest to rescue forty-five princesses locked in a castle by three ogres. He discovers that being a knight isn&#65533;t as glamorous as it&#65533;s made out to be, because you can&#65533;t even use your handkerchief, and you get dust in your nose. Along with the dim-witted King Arthur, Hank&#65533;s plan to walk around in disguise as a peasant backfires when they are nearly executed as rebellious slaves, rescued only when Launcelot and the boys arrive in the nick of time - on brand new bicycles.Twain&#65533;s irreverence in dealing with the beloved Arthurian traditions garnered him a great deal of criticism at the time of publication. Yet as the peels of laughter fade, it becomes clear that Twain is using his humor to make a very serious point. Is he merely critiquing the vices of medieval feudalism and warning against over-sentimentalising the past? If he is critical of King Arthur, surely it is not a criticism directed at the monarchy or the noble virtues that the knights of the Round Table pursued, but rather at the vices of an unbalanced class structure. Or is Twain using a comparison between the sixth and the nineteenth centuries to make an argument for or against the scientific machinist age of the nineteenth century? It is clear that the protagonist &#65533; the first person point of view used by Twain to embrace the reader in sharing his convictions &#65533; embodies one set of ideals and arrogantly looks down on King Arthur who embodies another set of ideals. The sixth century holds fast to the concept of greatness and position being attained by birth, whereas the nineteen century has little reverence for rank and file, replacing it by a respect attained by achievements alone (p46ff). Morgan is sharply critical of injustices created by the medieval class structure, where people are slaves to &#65533;King and Church and noble&#65533; (p74ff), and is especially negative towards orthodox Christianity (specifically the Catholic church), feeling it safer for power not to be concentrated in one single organization (p56,108). He also mocks the simplistic medieval beliefs in the supernatural, and his own scientific &#65533;miracles&#65533; appear to be a reflection of nineteenth century liberalism and atheistic philosophy, where beliefs in supernaturalism were exiled through the advance of scientific naturalism, and where the Christian God was dethroned and replaced by science. The failures of the faker Merlin appear to be symbolic of the failure of medieval supernaturalism, since it is Morgan&#65533;s scientific knowledge that can perform the true miracles. What Twain unconsciously shows is that faith in natural science is just as much a religion as faith in supernaturalism, because the protagonist doesn&#65533;t convert King Arthur&#65533;s court to naturalism. By projecting himself as a supernaturalist, and taking advantage of King Arthur&#65533;s court ignorantly attributing his scientific miracles to the supernatural, Morgan proves to be just as much a political manipulator as Merlin or the established Church.I cannot believe that Morgan is totally a mouth-piece of Twain, or that Twain uses this work to advocate Protestant America over against Britain, since Twain was in fact an opponent of American imperialism. It is true that eventually Morgan proclaims and defends a republic with electric fences, revolvers and dynamite, exterminating the whole chivalry of England and replacing it with American imperialism and technology. But in the end it proves to be a hollow victory, with Morgan on his death-bed having second-thoughts about his technological achievements, and speaking about medieval chivalry with emotional longing and passionate love. The nineteenth century symbols prove to have the same destiny as those of the sixth century &#65533; they are conquered and die. Is Morgan&#65533;s death a symbol of the fate of the Western machine age, and is Twain asserting that nineteenth century American arrogance over earlier civilizations is misplaced, because it will share their destiny? The final cynicism in which the novel ends can not be overlooked, and is a suggestion that society&#65533;s optimism and faith in technology and science are misplaced because these can never improve humanity. Twain&#65533;s disenchantment with technology and progress is a reflection of the failures experienced in his own life: science in the end is not mankind's god or saviourTo get maximum enjoyment and understanding of Twain&#65533;s humour, I highly recommend reading a version of the Arthurian legends before Twain&#65533;s parody. He occasionally quotes Malory&#65533;s fifteenth century classic &#65533;Morte d&#65533;Arthur&#65533; &#65533; deliberately assigning a very different context and meaning to what was originally intended. To appreciate the conventions and ideals he is mocking, a read of Malory is essential, such as the English rendition produced by Sir Frank Knowles.It&#65533;s a brilliant concept, and makes William Goldman&#65533;s farcical and popular &#65533;The Princess Bride&#65533; look like inferior literary fodder for kindergarten kids. Not only is it funny, but there&#65533;s a great deal of depth beneath the surface, which Twain uses to convey a great deal of seriousness. Yet even while critics argue about just what it is that Twain is being serious about, there is no doubt that this is thoroughly enjoyable and humorous work, just as enjoyable today at the end of the twentieth century as when it was written at the end of the nineteenth. It is not so much the dark and serious underlying tone that has made this work a classic but Twain&#65533;s brilliant humour, creativeness, and story-telling."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"The perfect counterpoint to Le Morte d'Arthur. The Arthurian legends are wonderful tales but they are mythic literary productions. Mark Twain gives them a good old-fashioned strapping out behind the outhouse. With the Connecticut Yankee as our guide, we have front row seats on everyday life in Arthurian Britain: White slavery, le droit de seigneur, confiscation of property in event of suicide, nonexistence of impartial justice, the (unintended) degrading influence of Catholicism on the masses, immense ignorance, superstition... And that's just day one. But Mark Twain will never leave you stranded in a dark hell hole. Oh no - brilliance, mirth, and devastating common sense are always surrounding you on any journey with Mark Twain. This book is classic Twain: Funny.A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is chock-full of brilliant Twainisms. My favorite is his observation that a conscience is a very uncomfortable thing to have, and the significant difference between a conscience and an anvil is that, if you had an anvil stuck inside you, it would be a lot less uncomfortable than having a conscience. And Twain clearly concurs with Tom Paine that the English nobility were \\"no-ability\\" - simply the latest in a perennial series of robbers making life miserable for everyone and doing all in their power to hang on to power. A fine modern treatment of this theme is Ken Follett'sThe Pillars of the Earth. Twain also mentions the beautiful mispronunciations of childhood, and how the bereaved parental ear listens in vain for them once the child has grown.You'll never look at castles the same again (and I suspect the Dark Ages will never know what hit them)."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"Mark Twain, the most globally recognised of the greatest American writers, comes closest to autobiography in this odd and fascinating book. This is the story of part of his life at least, and lays out much of his unique moral and political philosophy.As a book, Life on the Mississippi lacks a truly coherent story line after the half-way point; it tells the story of Twain's training as a Mississippi steamboat pilot, then, when he returns to the river years later as a successful writer, it drops off into anecdotes as Twain travels down the great river, and can be a deadly bore for some readers.But, oh, what a picture of Twain it draws! There are great tales of characters he meets along the river, told in his inimitably funny style, wonderful bits of his childhood - like the tale of his insomniac guilt and terror when the match he loans a drunk ends up causing the jail to burn down, killing the drunk - and insightful portraits of the towns and villages along the river.This is a characteristically American book, about progress and independence as well as the greatest American river, written by this most characteristically American writer. It is a true classic (a thing Twain despised! He said, &quot;Classics are books that everybody praises, but nobody reads.&quot;), a book that will remain a delight for the foreseeable future."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"&quot;Life On the Mississippi&quot; is Mark Twain's tribute to the Mississippi River, which surrounded the earlier part of his life.

This is true. Yet, the avid reader, and Mark Twain enthusiast, will not bypass these chapters.

The book's filled with the humor and wit readers know Twain for.I would argue that A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is more finely written than The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. It certainly doesn't have any of the silly plot devices of Finn, like reintroducing Tom Sawyer into the final part. And while literature professors talk of how radical Huck Finn was for its condemnation of slavery, I believe A Connecticut Yankee is equally radical for its condemnation of capitalism. They're both fine books, but I found A Connecticut Yankee more entertaining and finely crafted."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"This is a detailed local history of a few years on the Missippi which can help genealogists as well as Riverboat fans and river enthusiasts.

From resecuing damals turned into pig to duels with other knights Hank experiences what chiverally is in its true form. Although I really enjoyed this book and would read it again I do have some critisism on it. There were parts in this book that seemed to drag, There was just some chapters I had a hard time getting through such as the chapter called \\"Sixth-Century Political Economy.\\" In it Hank tries to explain to some peasents about what economy is but they don't get it. While reading his explanation I found that I quickly got bored and tried to hurry through that part. There were a few other chapters like this, but for the most part I thought the story fast paced and quite enjoyable.

This is definantly a classic that people ought to read if they get a chance."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"Mark Twain is synonymous worldwide with the Mississippi River, mainly because of the Tom Sawyer/Huck Finn stories. However, Life on the Mississippi is just as important and, in a testament to Twain's greatness, nearly as readable despite being non-fiction. It details his history with the river and gives an overview of the river itself; this may sound boring, and almost certainly would be with anyone else, but I long ago decided that even Twain's laundry list would be worth reading, and this certainly is. The magic he seemed to bring to everything is in full force; one would be very hard-pressed to find another non-fiction book that is so entertaining, besides Twain's others of course, but it is also awesomely informative. In addition, Life is historically notable as the first book written on a typewriter, not Huck as is commonly thought; however, it made Twain able to finish Huck, which he had struggled with for some years and set aside. Huck fans and scholars will want to read Life for this alone, but it is more than worthy in itself.Twain starts by giving some basic facts and history; this is the least interesting part but only lasts a few pages, and I urge anyone bored by it to continue. Much of the information is of course dated but remains historically valuable as a portrait of the river as it then stood. Far more interesting is Twain's unforgettable rundown of his years as a riverboat pilot - a central life experience that led to much of his writing. We get a fascinating glimpse of this long-vanquished trade, which was all but unthinkable even when Life was published. It is important to recall that Twain was a pilot before such boats had steam or even lights at night. He details piloting's extraordinary difficulties with engrossing detail and typical self-deprecating humor. We learn much along the way about the riverboat lifestyle, the river itself, and riverside towns. Anyone curious about what it was like to live in this era and/or how its inhabitants thought and acted will find a wealth of information; we learn as much here as in any history book, and it is of course infinitely better written. Life covers a crucial American history era and is an important primary source even for those not interested in Twain and certainly essential for anyone who is, as it gives substantial background about a crucial part of his life. The book is indeed in part a bildungsroman; Twain had always loved the river and began pilot training soon after first leaving home. He structures the narrative so that it reads much like a story, and we see him grow from navet&eacute; and ignorance to an admirable experience and wisdom.Twain then details a trip he made on the river many years later, noting what changed and what stayed the same. There is significant autobiographical material here also, but the crux is descriptive. Twain describes the river's whole length and everything having to do with it as he goes, making it all utterly absorbing. As always, there are many eminently readable tangents. Several are autobiographical - reminisces as well as then recent events. Particularly interesting is Twain's profoundly touching visit to his hometown after a long absence. However, a good part of Life has nothing to do with the river directly but is at least as engrossing as what does. Twain's many asides are full of wit and insight; few have ever probed so deeply into life and humanity, and we are lucky to have his wisdom, much of which is hilarious. Especially engaging are observations on North/South differences, notably including the Civil War. Twain's sociopolitical criticism is also as brilliant as ever, taking on everything from architecture to Walter Raleigh to speech. Finally, Life would be valuable even if lacking all this because it passes on an invaluable treasure of American folklore.Life is quite simply required reading for anyone even remotely interested in American literature; it is essential Twain, which makes it simply essential. As for this edition, it is essentially bare bones. Anyone wanting supplemental material will need to look elsewhere, but this will do well for most, as the text stands very well on its own."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"Mark Twain's Life on the Mississippi, originally published in 1883, is part memoir, part paean to the Mississippi River and its culture, and part compilation of whatever miscellaneous anecdotes Twain thought were worth relating.Twain begins with a history of the Mississippi since it was discovered by de Soto in 1541.

Twain wrote such travel literature classics as\\"Innocents Abroad\\", \\"Following the Equator\\", \\"A Tramp Abroad and \\"Life on the Mississipi.\\"Life on the Mississippi was published in 1883 shortly before Twain's greatest novel \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" was unveiled to readers in 1885. In Life on the Mississipi\\" Twain sets out to travel down the long river. Twain (born Samuel L. Clemens) was born near Florida Missouri growing up in nearby Hannibal nestled next to the great river. As a boy he dreamed of becoming a steamboat pilot. As told in the autobiographical chapters of this book he did become one in the years prior to the Civil War. Twain was an apprentice pilot working under the expert tutelage of Horace Bixby. Twain had to learn every inch of the river from St. Louis to New Orleans and back. He left the river to join the Confederate Army. After a few weeks he left the army for the West where he began to write as a newspaper reporter gaining fame for his short humorous sketches.Nevertheless, Twain also wanted to see the river once again. In Life on the Missisippi he sketches the variious towns along the river such as St. Louis, New Orleans, St. Paul, Natchez, Vicksburg and Memphis. He tells tall tales about clever card sharks, grisly murders, Civil War battlesand American Indian legends. His brother was killed in a steamboat explosion and Twain recounts this sad tale. The highlight of the book is his return to Hannibal where he remembers his childhood and what has become of all the children he played with as a boy. There is even an excised chapter from Huckleberry Finn which Twain added to this book.Life on the Mississippi is will live as long as American literature. Mark Twain is the Lincoln of our Literature.

It starts out with a fictional character in King Arthur's kingdom. It then creats a labyrinth of problems that the character solves using the technology of his time. It ends triumphantly with Hank (the main character) winning a huge battle for control of England. Although the book had moments where the suspension could be felt by the reader most of the time the descriptions and characters feelings filled the pages with unnecessary narritive. Because of this the racy plot with many intresting characteristics ends up taking a long time and being slowed down by the thoughts of the characters. Although this book is considered a classic its writing could be compared to the writing of Charles Dickens. The plot of the book is well written and thought out but, in an attempt to make the book seem more realistic both authors throw in space-fillers. Also as in GREAT EXPECTATIONS Mark Twain creates a connection between all characters that happens only within a few pages.Because of all the connections in the book the plot can become hard to follow and in order to fully understand the book it is better to glance over what you have just read. The plot at times is to amazing for any reader to believe, the author gives the main character the ability to make all inventions from his time and, at a glance creat new ones. He makes the character follow a heroes journey of sorts, where he must face entire leigons of soliders but wins by flipping a swich or shooting a gun. In a way, however, it is intresting to see how todays knowledge can be used in the past for conquest and for peace. The story the book gives made me think of what would happen if someone actually did go back in time. Because each new chapter in the book introduces a new character or a new problem it makes the reader carefully follow the plot. This creates the need to read every sentence and that is very demanding on the reader.I did not enjoy the book. It was too much to read for such a limited plot and the ideas were repititive. Because of all the different aspects of the book it was barely possible to keep on reading it.

He travels back in time to the Middle Ages. He meets new people and pretends he is a magician since he knows so much about the future. He becomes a well known hero throughout the land. The book is pretty much about his successes and adventures as he learns about Medieval times. To me, I thought the book was more on the boring side, but I think someone older might enjoy it more since the book has more complicated events and words. I think it was too long and slow because it would use up pages and pages describing landscapes or how uncomfortable wearing armor is when all I really wanted to do was get to the real point of the story. Also, I don't think the characters were very exciting and interesting because they would never really act like a real person would act during a similar situation. Like how the main character, Hank Morgan, never really wondered how he got to be in the Middle Ages and how he never really missed the 1800's or thought about how he could go back.

At one point I had even memorized \\"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\\" as a seventh-grader in Catholic school. Twain has always held a sentimental place close to my heart, so when our book club chose to read and discuss A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, I was all for it.I had heard vaguely of Twain's atheist mindset and his antagonism toward religion in general. But until I read Connecticut Yankee, I had no idea how much irrational and unfounded antipathy Twain had for the Catholic Church in particular. The pervasive theme in Connecticut Yankee is that our modern enlightened world is far superior to that which went before and that the \\"bad old days\\" of slavery and oppression were almost completely the fault of the Catholic Church. This anti-Catholic sentiment can hardly be denied as Twain himself urged reviewers not to mention it when the book first came out. \\"Please don't let on that there are any slurs at the Church,\\" he told a sympathetic reviewer in the Boston Herald. \\"I want to catch the reader unawares, and modify his views if I can.\\"So Twain engaged in what we know today as the \\"last acceptable prejudice.\\" By way of a simple comparison, let us imagine that, instead of Catholics, Twain had chosen Jews, Mormons, or Evangelicals as the villains of Connecticut Yankee. Would it still occupy the exalted position it does as an American classic? Or would it be relegated to those dusty shelves where reside other scurrilous works or racist manifestos to be studied as a historical curiosity of a meaner age?For me, the most annoying aspect of Connecticut Yankee was Twain's almost total ignorance of history--or, perhaps more accurately, his decision to turn history on its head to better fit his polemical aims of blaming all the ills of society on the Catholic Church. This is a classic example of what happens, I suppose, when a journalist with a wide breadth of knowledge but no depth attempts to novelize about a historical subject. To address some of Twain's errors:1.) Slavery in antiquity was in no way the fault of the Church. That pernicious institution long predated Christianity and was endemic to classical pagan societies. Indeed, the Church has a long history of making the lot of slaves more tolerable and being among the premier abolitionist institutions in the world.2.) The idea that the Church suppresses intellectual freedom is a fable made up during the Protestant rebellion, though it is heartily embraced by Twain. Far more erudite scholars than I have examined this fallacy in detail, so rather than address this topic in detail here, I would point the reader to Tom Woods's excellent book,How the Catholic Church Built Western Civilization.3.) Twain writes naively of democracy, putting in Hank Morgan's mouth the notion that \\"Where every man in a state has a vote, brutal laws are impossible.\\" One wonders what Twain would have made of our modern America, where not only every man, but every woman has a vote, and yet the ghastly practice of abortion is not only legal, but enshrined as a human right. Democracy of itself does not ensure enlightened government. Without the temper of religion, democracy is as likely to produce brutal and repulsive laws as the worst monarchy. De Tocqueville understood this. It's a wonder that Twain did not.There are many more, but this review is already more prolix that I had intended.As always, Twain's writing sparkles in Connecticut Yankee and his lampooning of the style of Mallory is very funny. His characters, however, viewed 120 years later, are crudely drawn. Hank Morgan is an Alger-esque self-made man whose compendious knowledge of all subjects is just a little too convenient. The legendary Arthurians are all soulless pawns that Twain moves around to further his polemic. No insight is offered into their characters at all. They are all cruel and completely self-serving--as they must be in Twain's mind because they belong to the aristocracy. The story ends on a bizarrely depressing note for a tale that was predominantly a humorous satire for the first seven-eighths of its length.In short, this is not a book I will be reading to my kids as a bedtime story. For me, it is to be considered a shameful period piece, written at a time when it was acceptable and even laudatory to be a Know-Nothing and make up slanders about the Catholic Church. That it is a cleverly-written slander is only another mark against it. Amusing slanders are pleasing to read but have the potential to do real harm both to the target and the reader."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"&quot;Life On the Mississippi&quot; is Mark Twain's tribute to the Mississippi River, which surrounded the earlier part of his life.

Imaginative work paralleling medieval England with Industrial America in the lat 19th century. Witty, adventurous and well written. I have yet to read a Twain book I disliked."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is an intriguing novel written by Mark Twain. This is a fantastic book for the high school level reader, but would be entertaining to adults as well. I am a freshman in high school, and I enjoyed many attributes of the plot and writing style. In this novel the main character, Hank Morgan, is mysteriously transported from the nineteenth century in Connecticut back to the fifth century in England. During his time in medieval Britain, he keeps a journal which is what most of this book is. The preface and afterwards are both the narration of Mark Twain who writes as if he has found Hank's journal, and is merely writing it down in a book. As the journal starts out, Hank is introduced to King Arthur and after narrowly escaping death and becomes the country's most powerful advisor. Hank introduces many modern wonders to this feudal society. He is hailed a magician, being able to perform wonderful &quot;miracles&quot; and &quot;magic&quot;, when it really is only modern science. It is very entertaining to read about how the feeble-minded people of that time react to these feats. In the end, there is a tremendous battle with many exciting episodes leading up to it. If a reader is partial to battle scenes of high caliber, this is a book for him! Of course, Hank has many other battles as well. Once of his biggest enemies is the Church of England. The big question the reader asks themselves during this book is &quot;Will Hank return to his time and if so, how?&quot;. It was exciting for me to ponder this question throughout the novel. During Hank's travels through medieval Britain, he meets many people. The people he meets who think a government ruled by the people in Britain (his ultimate goal) would be a good idea, he sends to Camelot where he has schools set up which teach people about modern governmental ideas. Schools were also set up to teach people how to produce his wonders of modern science. These few enlightened people remain loyal to Hank until the very end. I thought it an entertaining notion that people who were trained from birth to believe in one thing, could realize it's faults and begin to believe another things. I really enjoy this book because it brings a lot about human nature into question. It discusses the vast differences of beliefs, manners, and life styles between one hundred years ago and fourteen hundred years ago. I also thought the differences between classic Arthurian legend and Mark Twain's perspective of the time were very interesting. Hanks training of these idealistic people he runs across plays into the large political aspect of this book. Since Hank's ultimate goal is to transform Britain into a country ruled by the people, he starts factories producing modern goods which greatly changes the lives of the Britons. I enjoyed the descriptions of the people's reaction to these modern products of science thirteen centuries before they would be invented. Throughout the entire book commentary and philosophizing concerning the comparison of the fifth century feudal system of Britain and the nineteenth century democracy of the U.S. by Hank Morgan is common. This political aspect is typical of Twain's works. It gave me great pleasure to read this aspect of the book and to comprehend it's meaning. Through Hank Morgan, Mark Twain is able to depict vivid images in the readers mind. Whether it be a person, scene, or sensation felt by Hank Twain describes it in a way which puts a solid picture in the imagination of the reader. I have not seen the movie of this novel, but I have heard it isn't very well done and it is nothing compared to the book. I believe this is because Mark Twain paints such a realistic picture in the mind of the reader, it is nothing compared to what some director can film. From Mark Twain's great descriptions and writing style to the unique ideas presented, the novel A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is a fantastic novel. There are so many aspects of it to enjoy, and it is just an all around entertaining book. I give this book four out of five stars and I recommend it to any one interested in fantasy, especially if they want a different perspective on King Arthur."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"You think that you would know what to expect from Twain after having read much of his fiction, but that just isn't the case. After having read this book, I am convinced that, had Twain put his mind to it, he could have written about two snails racing and it would have been funny, interesting, and enthralling. I just could not put this book down, as I realized that the only thing better than Mark Twain's fiction is wondering about how real his nonfiction is! Twain's humor never fails him. I have never encountered a book that is so mentally involving, yet so relaxing. I say \\"involving\\" because Twain seems to use just the right words and phrases to stimulate the imagination. My recommendation is to grab yourself a hammock, set it up next to a river or stream, and sip on lemonade while reading and chuckling. This book provided me with a few of my best spent hours on a summer's day that I could imagine. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"To me, this book seemed like several rather disjointed chunks of writing about Twain's Mississippi experience. I don't know what happened. Maybe he compiled all his scraps of material about this period and threw them together, not bothering with transitions or filling in gaps, or smoothing out the narrative flow.In any case, I found the writing delightful and in places laugh-aloud funny. I even typed out several large passages in a letter I was writing to my brother. The letter must have taken me an hour to write but I just had to share those passages with someone. That's how good Twain is. You want to share him with others who enjoy fine writing.I'm not sure I'd go so far as to say this is Twain's finest book. But it is well worth reading and it lays out in detail perhaps the cross section of Twain's life that he enjoyed most."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"My first copy of this absorbing work was a small, compact edition published by the Oxford University Press. I read it by candle-light and found myself borne into another world, transported. In the early chapters, Twain focuses on his introduction to steamboating - he wears his YOUTH on his sleeve, recounting his cub-piloting experiences with the delight of a child. In the latter chapters, set in the post Civil-War era, Twain focuses on his returning impressions - he wears his HEART on his sleeve, remembering the world of his youth, burdened by sweet nostalgia, and a sense of finality and loss. If you have ever been young, you will laugh, and if you have a heart, you will probably shed a tear. No other writer in American literature has so completely combined a genius for wit and humanity. This is one of those rare books that can be read more than once, and enjoyed even more the second time."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"He picks you up off the spot where you are sitting and places you standing on the deck of a Mississippi riverboat in pre-Civil War America. His writing craft is so vivid, detailed, and compelling that you feel as if you yourself have followed each bend and turn, avoided each logjam, and squinted over the bow each starlit night of a journey down the mighty Mississippi River. Additionally, he adds context to the voyage, in the form of digressions about the times, the way peole thought and acted, real items from newspapers of the era, and his own opinions and observations of human nature. It is not a novel. It is non-fiction, but it's writing style makes it as readable as a novel. It was pure pleasure"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"Was Twain the greatest writer America ever produced? Certainly no other author has written so many genres so well. Life on the Mississippi is one of my favorites by Twain. What a storyteller! From his own personal experiences to explorers, psychics, the Civil War, slavery, geography, steamboat history etc. Twain gives us a glimpse into himself and his country.Twain is of course humorous in this book, but his lesser known quality--insight--is very keen in this book. Twain's style is at once sophisticated and simple. It is pure mastery.While this may not be up there with some of other Twain's writings, it is certainly worth the time and money. Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"It was one of Arthur C. Clarke's laws that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Mark Twain predated Clarke by several decades, but he seemed well aware of the idea behind the law, as demonstrated by his novel, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.The title character is Hank Morgan, a late-19th-century New Englander who - by a blow to the head - is transported back to Camelot. This is no mere dream, however; it appears Morgan is actually there. He quickly learns that all is not nearly romantic as the tales of Arthur and chivalry might suggest; instead, this is a land of ignorance, violence and oppression.Morgan's technological and scientific know-how makes him appear to be a great wizard, much more respectable than the flim-flamming Merlin. First by taking advantage of a convenient solar eclipse, Morgan is soon elevated to being Arthur's prime minister, and starts a process of transforming Old England into New England. Paradoxes don't seem much of a concern.This novel - one of the earliest time travel stories - is an often clever satire with many targets, particularly slavery and caste systems, economics, religion (particularly Catholicism) and the idea of chivalry. Only the most basic framework of the Arthurian legends are \\"true\\" in this book. Where the book is a bit weak is when it gets too talky; there are also not many interesting characters outside of Hank himself. Overall, this is a good book, but it is not Twain's best."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"\\"Life on the Mississippi\\" by Mark Twain is no doubt a classic memoir from the Civil War generation. Although Twain was smart enough not to remain with the southern armies for more than a few weeks, his life is still very much part of that era. His most famous book, \\" The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" (which was inspired by the trip along the Mississippi river described in this book), is considered one of the first books which touches upon the racism of the south and its often backward traditions. Twain's work is unique because he is not a northerner like Harriet Beecher Stowe, heralding the inequities of southern life without really living in that region. Twain was from the border state of Missouri.He certainly embodied the divided feelings of his homeland in regards to the times. As witnessed in the book, there is much reverence and nostalgia for the old south along the river that Twain knew so well, but he is able to poke fun at its eccentricities with a wit that perhaps was Twains defining feature as a writer. The sense of personal conflict is a classic point of reference for most writers to the point of sounding clich&eacute;, but Twain's writing is the model from which the clich&eacute;s are derived.The main impetus behind Twain's journey is chronicled in his pages, which is his comparison of life before and after the war. Just as Huckleberry Finn was written twenty years after the war, this book could have only been composed after a considerable interval of time. It is both Twain's memoir of his life as a steamboat pilot and retrospective of the glory days on the river upon returning there in the early 1880's. The steamboat trade is a shadow of its former self as river commerce had been replaced by the railroads. In these shadows Twain writes of all sorts of tales and memories of each part of the river as he travels along it, often concealing his true identity for the sake of getting objective information. The reader can see right away that there is a fondness for tall tales and exaggerations amongst the river folk, as many romanticize the past. Twain's writing seems quite level headed throughout, as he is able to sort through the \\"river lore\\" and relate the important and practical aspects of river travel to the reader (but that is not to say that he is exempt from embellishing to keep the reader on his toes).One aspect of the writing that I thought interesting was Twain's focus upon the practical details of his early days as a steamboat pilot's apprentice. When many think of Mark Twain, romantic notions of travel and freedom are brought to mind, but Twain's first 100 pages is all about the skills of the trade in an ever changing river. The flawless memory needed for the job was quite impressive and no doubt fed his ability to recall his life's work later on. Many forget the man's practicality, which gave him unique insight into the social milieus that he often lampooned or mocked.The mix of personal memoir and river history is done seamlessly, as Twain's early memories are intertwined with certain portions of the river. Just as an aging man looks upon his youth with fondness, Twain recalls the exciting days on the steamboats, evoking a sense of nostalgia for a youth and culture that have passed into history."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"The story of Hank Morgan, the plucky supervisor in a gun factory in the late 1800s, who is knocked out and wakes up under a tree in the times of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. He is promptly captured and condemned to death, but saves his neck through his knowledge of a solar eclipse in the 6th century, which happens to occur the following day. He plays this to his advantage along with his knowledge of 19th century technology and quickly gains a reputation as a magician more powerful than Merlin. He becomes known as \\"The Boss\\" and secures a place in the government of King Arthur and sets about secretly to change the primitive and savage ways of the people, even daring to challenge \\"the Church\\" (the Catholic Church) and trying to institute modern freedoms.The satire is classic Mark Twain, and the situations Hank finds himself in (and his responses to them) are often very humorous. The story, however, was obviously meant as a more serious criticism of the idea of monarchy and especially of the abuses of religion when there is no freedom to choose. While I have no complaint with his logic and reasoning, I found it tiresome to continually read his folksy diatribes on the concepts of noble birth or religion - especially when the same argument popped up so often. What started out as an amusing tale became rather boring when the story stopped for these editorials. In the end, it just wasn't a very endearing story; funny and interesting at times but not enough to warrant a full four stars - call it 3 and a half."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"Mark Twain (1835-1910) grew up along the banks of the Mississippi River, and he captures the feel of the mighty river during the steamboat era in this superb narrative and memoir. I particularly liked the earlier chapters, as Twain describes his youthful tutelage as an aspiring steamboat pilot in the years before the Civil War. Readers see what it was like guiding a steamboat over a river full of dangerous snags and sandbars - in clear daylight, through thick fog, and on moonless nights. The author then jumps ahead to his middle age - describing life along the river and in the South after the Civil War, and including politics, epidemics, and the supplanting of steamboats by railroads. The book's second half lacks a bit of the magic found earlier, but remains eminently readable and informative. This is a remarkable narrative by a great writer."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"I read this book when I was young and going through a Mark Twain phase. I enjoyed it. I re-read it when I was in the Peace Corps serving overseas, and I was struck by two things: First, Samuel Clemens understood the world in such an extraordinary way that, at times, he must have felt like a voice in the wilderness (yet, he was willing to share himself with the world). Second, if you are going to go live in someone else's world, you must realize neither you nor those around you will ever be the same...growth, change, challenge can be incredibly beneficial, but you will lose some part of yourself and take something away from others.I'll be reading this again throughout my life. I can only imagine what else I will learn."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"It is not Twain's best book, and certainly not the same as something like Huckleberry Finn, however this is highly recommended reading. The satire is excellent, and although some people who may be a little too serious about Arthurian legends may not appreciate it, I certainly did. Based on this book I would guess that Mark Twain would've been the among the best, and definitely the funniest, science fiction writers of all time if he had decided to follow that path. This book is great for anyone who loves the humor of Mark Twain."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"Wow! That is the one word I have for this book, Wow. Twain once again shows that he is utterly and purely a genius in disguise. Our character is carried from the 19th century all the way back to the 6th century by a blow in the head. A man used to telephones, cigars and newspapers he is completely and utterly suprised by the simpleness and ignorance of mankind in the 6th century.After escaping from a fiery death using his knowledge of eclipses, he emerges from King Arthurs castle hailed as the greatest and most powerful magician that ever lived, he sets out to try to \\"modernize\\" Camelot. With the help of Clarence, a trusty righthand man that he met while he was a prisoner he sets up a telephone system, introduces a newspaper, starts a line of advertising, tries to convince the populace to use soap, along with many other things. Our character also takes part in some very distructive things like trying to overthrow the Church and the King, he even thinks of becoming president one day.Not everyone becomes his friend however, there is one guy in particular who is not so keen on the idea of him becoming \\"The Boss\\". His name is Merlin and he used to be a wonderfully respected magician until our character came along. Now everyone has lost interest in him because they have mover on to bigger and better magicians. Merlin shows contemt and disdain several times throughout the book, trying to win back his title. He never suceeds which I found quite humorous.In conclusion I did like this book because it was witty and slightly far-fetched. The idea of a telephone system, a printing press or the King riding a bicycle is simply prepsterous and therefore humorous. To put it simply, I loved this book because I got a kick out of it."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"Almost all of the novel features the narration of Hank Morgan, a foreman at a weapons factory in Connecticut who in the year 1879 is hit on the forehead by a crowbar by one of his unruly workers. When Hank wakes up he finds himself in England in the Sixth Century where King Arthur reigns.He is captured by a knight, brought to Arthur's castle and it is determined that he should be executed for he seems to be some strange demon sorcerer, what with his 19th century clothes and speech. But he just happens to be in possesion of the knowledge that on that particular day on which he finds himself in the sixth century, a total eclipse is going to occur. Of course, 6th century England dosen't know anything about eclipses and thinks such natural occurances are the work of various demon sorcerors or signs of god's anger and so on. Hank threatens to use his powers of sorcery to cause the sun to be completely blotted if they go through with his execution. The eclipse occurs and the people in the court are thus flabbergasted. King Arthur makes Hank his Prime Minister and Hank uses his political powers over the next decade or decade and a half to use his elementary knowledge of late 19th century technology and institutions to reform Arthur's kingdom. He introduces telephones, telegraphs, grammar schools, military academies, newspapers. He tries to reduce the barbaric oppression of the serfs and slaves. He tries to introduce enlightenment ideals in the country. He successfully discredits Merlin, the charlatan court magician, in part by pretending to perform miracles, using his knowledge of electricity and construction of munititions. 6th century England, of course is completely ignorant of all these technologies and so takes Hank's use of them as evidence of his extraordinary supernatural powers. He blows up Merlin's castle. At one popular monestary, the monks and nuns are terrified because the water in their very large indoor pool has been reduced by a large amount. They think the reduction has happened because of God's displeasure with them for engaging in the decadent and self-gratifying act of bathing in the pool but Hank discovers that the water is leaking out the bottom of the pool where some bricks have loosened. He constructs a big scene to reveal his miracle, including fireworks which the people have never seen before and the loud sounds and explosive lights he explains are the evil spirit being expunged from the monastery that was allegedly restricting the water level in the lake. This alleged miracle gives Hank the credibility he needs to convince the monks that they could bathe without retribution from God.There is much critique in the narration from Hank on the social, economic and political conditions in Arthur's England. He reports on the conditon of the serfs. What little income such as from the produce that they create on their own plots, is stolen by taxes and as tribute by the nobility and the church. The feudal lords drive their serfs to starvation, disease and death so that they, the lords can live luxurious lives without working themselves. The lords execute or imprison serfs who get too uppity or refuse orders to have their daughters be sexually abused or often times for no reason at all. Hank works to try to release some of the prisoners, whose minds have all been deostroyed by their experience, in the castles of the nobles. The serfs and the slaves, the vast majority of England's population have been trained by centuries of oppression to be mentally docile. They think they deserve to be slaves and think their oppression is the way things should be. Hank notes in relation to this, how the world has traditionally recoiled at the execution of about 10,000 rich people during the French Revolution's \\"Reign of Terror.\\" But there was an incomparably greater terror which affected hundreds of millions of french peasants who suffered a reign of terror lasting many centuries as they were starved and robbed and worked to death by the aristocracy.Hank tries to introduce the elements of the Enlightenment. He tries slowly and subtly to spread the idea that the English nobility has illegitimate power and that the people deserve to control their own destiny. He tries in the same way to inculate a basic spirit of independent thinking, to undermine the spirit of submission to authority. Hank writes that in his opinion true patriotism is quite the opposite of submission to governmental institutions and the laws. Institutions and laws grow outdated, tyranical and ineffective and people who do not voice their opinion about the need to change such things are not true patriots. He succesfully undermines the barbaric and silly custom of knight errantry--he gradually converts the knights into travelling salesman for soap and the other things he is trying to encourage. He fights a bunch of the nights towards the end of the book while wearing gymnastic tights and using a gun and lasso.The end of the story brings a sort of twist and one fully understands the satire as it relates to Hank's vanity and overconfindence in his late 19th century intellect and technological know-how.This a good story, very well written, intelligent, amusing and every so often something comes up in it that makes you laugh out loud.There may be a few minor mechanical problems with the flow of the story, such as one or two actions not being fully accounted for. The last part of the episode where King Arthur and Hank get taken as slaves is kind of rushed through."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"'Connecticut Yankee' is an excellent political satire still relevant to today's world. Everyone's heard of it, and it's been spoofed many times in film. However, few people have read it and they're missing a treat. Mark Twain is one author whose works consistently remain applicable to modern society. 'Yankee' is funny, interesting and highly worth your time."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"Summary:Hank Morgan is a fiery shop boss in the Colt Arms Factory in New England during the late 1800s when he is knocke unconscious by another worker who gets the better of him during a fight. When Hank wakes up, he finds himself in Britain during the 7th century C.E. in the time of King Arthur. As it just so happens, before Hank can be burned at the stake for threatening to blot out the sun, the solar eclipse he predicted takes place and everyone in King Arthur's royal court cowers at his command. Hank is given what was formerly Merlin the Magician's position as chief executive and renamed The Boss. The Boss then begins to reform ancient Britain, introducing dynamite, fireworks, bicycles, electricity, telephones, etc.But, as is only becoming of someone of his rank, he must inevitably go on a quest. It just so happens that a damsel in distress, Sandy, has come a-calling and has a mission for a knight. So, Hank embarks on a journey with Sandy and returns victoriously having saved a pen of pigs that used to be a queen and maidens but was mysteriously transformed, though only Sandy knows this.Hank continues with his plans of reforming Britain, but lets slip another plan to the King that he wants to secretly go among the peasants as a commoner himself. The King likes the idea and signs on. They embark on a series of adventures that end with both of them being sold into slavery and very nearly being hung.Due to a misheard comment several years earlier, Hank is forced to battle another knight who was offended by the remark. In an effort to crush the ancient norms of chivalry, Hank not only battles the knight (using a lasso), but challenges all of the knighthood of Britain. His challenge pays off when he pulls out his six-shooters and lays waste to ten of the knights, the rest breaking ranks and running.After this incident, three years of bounty follow during which Hank's reforms become common place - except in the Catholic Church. Ultimately Hank is deceived by the Church, King Arthur is betrayed by his son Mordred and the greatest knight of England, Lancelot, who has been in love with Guinevere for ages. When all of this comes to a head, both Mordred and Arthur are dead and the nation is without leadership except for the Church.Of course Hank can't let this situation stand. Gathering up his very best men, he destroys his wonderful factories and holes up in a cave. The last of the knights, totaling some thirty-thousand, come against him and 53 of his best men (52 and Clarence). Nearly all of the knights are destroyed. But what Hank and Clarence hadn't considered is what the decaying men's bodies would do to them seeing as how they can't leave the cave.In the end, Merlin, the magician that has plagued Hank since his arrival, sneaks into the cave disguised as a woman and casts a spell on Hank, causing him to sleep for 13 centuries or until his own time again. After the spell, Merlin is killed and the story ends.My Comments:There is no doubt in my mind that Samuel Clemens is one of the greatest writers of all time. This book is not only superbly written, but absolutely hilarious and remarkably insightful. Some of Clemens' insights into humanity are astonishing.The story itself is pretty good, though the ending is a little bit well, open. You aren't sure exactly what happened, though you have a pretty good idea. I would love to read something about 'the writing of A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court', it likely draws upon Rip Van Winkle as well as numerous other writers and writings of the day.There is also a lot of commentary about the Catholic Church and its oppressive nature. Whether this is based in early American anti-Catholic sentiment or just plain anti-religious sentiment, I don't know (both are possibilities considering the time period). Perhaps the aforementioned book about this book, when written, will answer that question. I chose to look at it as anti-religious sentiment and thoroughly enjoyed it throughout.Overall, this book is a definite must read for everyone. I recall having read a children's shortened version when I was about ten, but reading in its original form is a treat. Read this book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"Although this book's concept is no longer novel - one may now even call it clich&eacute; - its \\"time travel\\" aspect was - at least in the sense that it is used in this novel - a fairly new concept in fiction at the time Twain wrote it. No less a science fiction authority than Robert A. Heinlein even goes so far to say that Twain \\"invented\\" the time travel story. Now, this is certainly stretching the truth a bit, but one can see how Heinlein was heavily influenced by Twain from reading this book. This novel's time travel aspect is not used for science fiction; no, it is a purely satirical vehicle. Twain transplants an \\"aw shucks\\", no nonsense American smack dab in the middle of The Dark Ages. By having his character attempt to transplant American ideas of technology, government, and morals into this staunch, backward (anyway, by our standards) British society, Twain is clearly forging an attack upon monarchy - which he once called \\"surely the grotesquest swindle ever invented by man.\\" That said, we see from the devastating ending (which surely no one who has read this book wasn't surprised by) that the book is as much a satire on American arrogance and idealism as it is on the British. One may not always agree with Twain's politics, but one must at least respect them. He also demonstrates in this book the oft-forgotten truism that one's tribal customs are not the laws of nature - and what business do we have trying to force ours upon anyone else's? A devastating satire all around."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is definately a departure from what one might consider &quot;normal&quot; literature, exploring the possibilities of a regular man going back in time to visit the grand kingdom of Camelot. The story starts with a man telling of a fight in a factory in which he was foreman, and how he was knocked out. Upon waking he was in the land of Camelot, though he didn't realize it. Being put up for burning, he used his knowledge of the past to save his skin, using an eclipse to bestow his &quot;magical powers.&quot;This display was extremely impressive for the people of the day, who that main character described as a childish race, always exaggerating tales for their own glory. After being given all the power in the land, next to the king of course, he set out on a quest to bring the land of camelot into the realm of the modern with such things as the telephone and telegraph, the railroad, and steamboats. All these monumental changes in the world were taking place without the general public's knowledge of it, and was gradually being mixed into the culture, in the main character's goal of removing chivalry from the cultural mix.After performing several &quot;miracles&quot; to his people, and going off on several grand adventures, the main character has the church turn on him, and try to bring the entire populous back to its simpler time, of swords, castles, damsels in distress, and the quest way of life. That is where I leave it up to you to find out the rest of the plot, if you really want to read it.In my overall opinion, the book seems to be rushed by Mark Twain, where he tries to mix his general opinions of humanity, his ideas for its future, and just a fun story line all in one, too quickly. The story unfolds hurridly and seems to lack direction at times, and needs a bit more development. A great read if for enjoyment, but don't use it for your overall future plan for humanity, as it is a bit lacking there.This book will likely appeal to school kids in the middle to high school range, because of its fair amount of depth and hidden meaning, but will also enjoy quite a good story, and a fair bit of insight as to what life was like back in the old days. It seems that Mark Twain had done a fair bit of research as to what life was in the age of Camelot before having gone out to write this book. Almost everybody will enjoy this, even if for no particular academic reason. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"When Hank Morgan, the head superintendent of the great arms factory, receives a smack on the head given by a friend nicknamed Hercules, he wakes up under an oak tree. A young man tells Morgan is he is in Camelot in the year 528. Not believing the boy, Morgan insists it is the year 1879 in Hartford, Connecticut. Morgan's adventures are written in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, by Mark Twain. Sir Kay throws Morgan in prison after he finds the Yankee and scares him up a tree. Sentenced to death the next day, Morgan performs a \\"miracle\\" before he is hung and King Arthur, believing him to be a wizard, set him free. Slowly, Morgan works his way up to \\"The Boss\\" of King Arthur's court and brings all of his 19th century knowledge to the people of Camelot, such as the telephone and electric lights.Although I would recommend this book to advanced readers, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is over 400 pages and it was difficult for me to get into the story at first. Also, the language was hard to understand. For example, \\"Fair sir, will ye just?\\" and \\"Prithee do not let me.\\" Despite the length and the language, I enjoyed the way Twain used characters and stories from the Arthur legends and formed them into the plot. The book made me think, what would the world be like if some one actually did go back in time?"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"Twain brings up a lot of interesting points which, although not new, may seem so because of the manner and voice he uses to bring them up. Some consider this work &quot;chaotic,&quot; but I don't agree. Yes, he does attempt a lot in this work- humor, the relation of an exciting tale, and questioning mankind and society, but the book still has a flow. It contrasts the nineteenth century dependence on technology and efficiency with a pseudo sixth century that uses a caste system and rigidly follows codes of chivalry. The ending was not particularly insightful, as one would expect, but it still satisfied me. The book had me chuckling much of the time- I mean, can you just picture Sir Launcelot with a few hundred knights, in their armor, and riding bicycles?! Or a knight, in the lists at a tournament, being lassoed cowboy style?! It was also interesting to read because it gives you a sense of life in Twain's time, with a few references to the Civil War, or the dispute over currency... And, hey, you've gotta love Hello-Central!"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is a comedic novel written by Mark Twain. It is about a 20th century man who goes back in time. The ISBN number is 978-1613823774, and you can purchase it for around ten dollars online.This book is one of Mark Twain's easier reads, and is even an easy read despite being written by Twain. It is also one of the most intriguing books I have ever read.Hilarious does not even begin to describe this book. Mark Twain did an excellent job portraying the life of a Yankee being sent to live in the 12th century. The clothing and culture differences, and the large contrast between his modern innovation knowledge and the medieval world make for great laughs. Throughout the book the Yankee is criticizing the people he meets, while they're doing the same to him. He comments on their clothes, hair, dialect, and even the way the walk.Mark Twain made me think hard in this book with anecdotes and his sarcasm. It all made sense later in the book when he acknowledged and explained what he meant. Most authors would never do that, which makes the book easy to understand.I would recommend this book because it has hard facts, and is brilliantly written with a humorous tone."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"Written by Mark Twain long after the age of steamboats, Life on the Mississippi paints a vivid picture of those wild days on the river. Before the channelization projects, before the bank stabilization projects, before channels were marked by buoys or there were radar and sonar to aid pilots on the river, navigating the ever-changing river was truly one of the great feats of the frontier. Twain tells the story first-hand and with his unique combination of wit and descriptive narrative. This is truly an American literary classic and a must-read for anyone interested in 19th century America."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"I remembered reading this a teen and wanted it for my Kindle, especially since it was a freebie.

The first half (or so) is autbiographical--about his learning to be a pilot before the Civil War. The second half is his return to the river in the early 1880s, with many observations about how it and the people who live on it have changed. Throughout, there are engaging anecdotes and stories, many of them mixing humor and horror, and these kept me going through the long stretches about how the river has changed its course through the decades. You can see how Vonnegut and Heller can be seen as Twain's descendents after reading the book--the occassionally morbid, satirical voice that seems to permiate American humor.All in all, a bit of a mixed bag, at least for me. Worth reading, but I wish I had skimmed more passages than I did!"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"This book is amusing in some of the same ways that Captain Stormfieldis amusing. A modern man of the time is placed in a different, strange,setting, and gets to make humorous observations about the natives,locals, functionaries and authority figures.Here, the device is time travel, plonking a 19th century American in the middle of a fantasy version of King Arthur's court."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"Hank Morgan is a typical Connecticut resident living in the late eighteen-hundreds. He is a clever foreman and loves the technology of his time. One day while at work, Hank is hit with a crowbar and knocked out. When he is finally revived, he finds himself in Camelot in the year 528. Things seem pretty bleak for Hank, who is immediately taken prisoner by a knight and sentenced to die. He uses the knowledge that a solar eclipse is due in order to gain a reputation as a powerful magician, more powerful even than Merlin.Hank quickly adjusts to his position as adviser to King Arthur, and uses his expertise in the areas of science and engineering whenever he sees an opportunity. Soon all of Camelot is connected by telephones and telegraphs, trains are beginning to be built, and knights travel the countryside on bicycles. Hank introduces American systems of money and has plans to turn Camelot into a democracy after Arthur's death.But Hank has enemies, including Merlin and the church. These enemies are powerful and capitalize on the superstitions of the people living in Camelot.This was a very clever book, highlighting some of the weaknesses of a Medieval society, and the things a modern capitalist might do to improve them. Parts of it were slow, but it is a very old book, written in a different style than today's stories, so that is understandable."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"I home school my daughter and was looking for some works by American authors. When I decided on Mark Twain it was great to be able to get something other than Tom Sawyer. The book was easy to find, affordable, and exactly what I was looking for. The Kindle is easy to transport so the book can go anywhere in a purse and be read at anytime (even at night under the covers with no flashlight)."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"This is the first book by Twain I've read. I have had a love affair with England and her history, and this take on the Arthurian legends was definitely interesting and cleverly written."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"I love this book. I had read it before and was glad to get it for free.

Probably one of Mark Twain's best. Even though it was written a long time ago, it is very modern in its approach."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"I enjoyed this book very much when I was younger and am so excited to have my son read it."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"For YEARS I have had a copy of Mark Twain's: \\"Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court\\". But I've never read it. In fact, I even did a book report on it, in sixth grade... got a \\"B+\\" on it. (Didnt have the heart to tell the teacher, I was taking, what I knew from the Movie staring Bing Crosby) I think, one reason why it took me so long to pick it up and actual READ IT, was that it has small print and is always a thick book. (I can be lazy at times) I was looking for something read. Thought I would give Old Mr. Twain, a try. i am SO loving \\"Connecticut Yankee\\"!!! I can not put it down!!! It is a \\"fast read\\". Why did I wait so long to enjoy this classic?"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"Forget the little leaguer and Martin Lawrence, this is the original and it's way more engaging. It's amazing that Mark Twain did a time travel story in the 19th century that still mops the floor with nearly any time travel story since.Going into it, I expected something like Crichton's &#34;Timeline&#34;, but instead got something a lot closer to &#34;Dr. Who&#34;, less the back-and-forth control over the time traveling."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"Premise is interesting but becomes tedious over the telling. Almost like a movie script.I remember enjoying it a lot more when I was twelve."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"Mark Twain's time-machine drops the main character in this book in the 6th century of King Arthur's Great-Britain.What he sees is a nation of slaves under the heel of king, Church and noble ('a privileged class is but a band of slaveholders'): 'sweat blood for them, starve that they might be fed, work that they might play, go naked that they might wear silk and jewels, pay taxes that they might be spared from paying them.'But the slaves were so poor-spirited that they took the thanks (cuffs and contempt) and the attention they got as an honor. They were completely under the spell of the Church: 'a united Church means death to human liberty, and paralysis to human thought ... in two or three little centuries it had converted a nation of men to a nation of worms... she invented 'divine right of kings'; she preached (to the commoner) humility, obedience to superiors, the beauty of self-sacrifice, non-resistance under opression and she introduced heritable ranks and aristocracies.'No wonder that the nobility, 'tyrannical, murderous, rapacious and morally rotten as they were, were deeply and enthusiastically religious.'In order to fight against the forces of darkness and to free mankind Hank Morgan creates teacher factories.But he is confronted with the problem of heridity and social conformism: 'There is no such thing as nature; it is merely heredity and training. All that is original in us can be covered up and hidden by the point of a cambric needle, all the rest inherited from a procession of ancestors that stretches back a billion years.'His teacher schools liberate only a few dozens of pupils. With their help, he has to dynamite the whole British aristocracy in order to install his ideal of universal suffrage ('when every man in a State has a vote, brutal laws are impossible').This comical science fiction story is ultimately a very actual political diatribe against exploiting privilege, pure indoctrination and class (in)justice.A must read."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"It is possible to understand what someone is doing, to sympathize with it, and yet not particularly enjoy it. The whole mode of this work, the fantasy, the bringing the Bridgeport foreman Hank Morgan back to medieval England and King Arthur's court as a way of discrediting inherited monarchy, the aristocratic institutions of the past means that the work is on a playing field and in a mode less 'real 'to me than that of 'Huckleberry Finn' 'Tom Sawyer' ' Life on the Mississippi'.Instead of the rich colloquial language of the American worlds Twain grew up in we have here a stilted formal language. True there is something of interest in seeing how the practical, technical, innovative 'modern Yankee' deals with the archaic reality he is presented with.But to my mind the book does not have the real Twain humor, and is more an excursion in 'ideas' than in real three- dimensional characters shaping their lives in the world."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"Its theme is the superiority of reason, technology, and intelligence over mysticism, ignorance, and religion. The battle in the closing chapters is spectacular. Gatling guns against a horde."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"Who has not wondered what they would do if sent back centuries earlier armed with the knowledge of modern life? Mark Twain is perhaps the first writer (at least the first that I know of) who makes a serious effort (with much comedy thrown in) to consider this question.The main character, Hank Morgan, is mysteriously transported from the then modern age of the late 19th century into the land of Camelot, with King Arthur and his knights. Although the story is well known for the comedic stories within the book, less known is the author's serious statements about human frailties such as prejudice (this book is an outspoken criticism of slavery at a time when the Just Cause myth of the American south was getting its start), superstition, autocracy, blind reliance on tradition, etc. His severity against the Catholic church stings me because that is my faith, but when considering the history of the church and some of the atrocities committed by some church leaders, his denigration is not without some justification.There is much here for philosophical debate. Twain takes an anti-determinist view of what man is capable of accomplishing, but he is fatalistic about the ability of one person to make a lasting change. I think that he missed the point. Hank Morgan failed not so much because of the forces of custom or the clergy, but because he tried force cultural enlightenment. This is like expecting wisdom from ten year olds simply because they have the lessons of their elders available to them. Cultural improvement is a developmental process and comes from self awareness. The character would have also been improved if he had learned more of his own cultural shortcomings from involvement with this different society. Regardless, this is a highly enjoyable book that shows why it, and the author remains of interest over a century later.I disagree with the Editorial Review written by the School Library Journal that this book is recommended for as early as fifth grade. I believe that the subject matter would be better considered and discussed with those in later grades."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court written by Mark Twain is a superb work of literature. This Arthurian novel is different from others because the view point is not from anybody from the round table or that time. The protagonist, Hank Morgan is a blacksmith from 19th century Hartford, Connecticut when he gets hit on the head by a crowbar. Following the incident he is knocked unconscious and transported back in time in a fanciful, diluted dream. There he is taken to Camelot and imprisoned. During his death trial he tricks the court into thinking that he is a magician when he conjures an eclipse. In A Connecticut Yankee Hank rallies against feudalism and idle aristocracy. This novel has become one of my favorites, but I'd only recommend for the 14 or 15+ crowd for Twain's sense of humor and for the confusing Old English."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"\\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\\" is one of those rarest literary treasures: a comedy that, for all it's hilarity, actually has both a heart and a brain. Not just a set of cheap laughs, as most comedy of any sort is, Mark Twain's classic novel enlightens as it entertains, throwing an unflinching spotlight on the darker elements of human nature both in the Utopian (to our eyes) Camelot and of modern capitalism and the American Dream.The plot is a familiar one in our age of sci-fi and fantasy, though it was innovative when Twain conceived it: Hank Morgan, an enterprising 19th-century engineer, is knocked unconscious and comes to in King Arthur's fabled Camelot. Bewildered but determined to make the best of the situation, Morgan uses his knowledge of history and mechanical skills to convince everyone he is a super-magician greater than even Merlin. Once ensconced as the King's right-hand man, Morgan sets about reforming the country into a republic, a sort of prototype America. Most of the book follows Morgan through a series of haphazard adventures which Twain uses to illuminate the great but often forgotten evils of the Dark Ages, including the abuses of the Catholic Church, the ignorant and useless ruling body that inevitably arises from a monarchy, and the pitiful working conditions of the medieval peasant or slave.Nor is Twain's critical eye trained only on the far-flung past. Though Morgan is essentially a sympathetic figure, he struggles to find anything the least bit admirable about the knights and nobles he must live with, and considers the chivalric code merely fit for derision. Meanwhile, Morgan's own capitalist code is in full effect, and he takes advantage of every opportunity to cash in his advanced education for the big bucks.Colorful and sublimely written, Twain's time-travel masterpiece is both a magical fantasy and a stinging dystopian satire. Don't be fooled by the several movie versions of this story, some of which are great fun in their own right. Yes, the novel is funny, often riotously so, but the humorous skin hides a deadly earnestness beneath, and the finale is far less optimistic than one who has first seen the film versions will doubtless expect. A deservedly immortal literary gem."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"The book gives a humorous description of what would happen if a modern man was transported to the court of King Arthur. It had a realistic beginning. The part where he &quot;cloaks the sun&quot; to get out of being executed was done nicely also."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"I'm only 14 years old, but I finished reading this book for my 8th grade English class about a week ago. The edition I have is 575 pages, but I went through it in about three weeks. It is an excellent, entertaining, very funny and thought-provoking book. I enjoyed it very much. If I had read the Canterbury Tales or some other book relating to the Middle Ages, it may have been pretty boring, but this, my first Mark Twain book and the longest I've ever read, was first-rate entertainment."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"If you are unacquainted with Twain's work, this is the ideal starting point. So much of his life was spent by and on the River that it has saturated into many of his greatest works such as Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn. His years training as a riverboat pilot (when the pilot was in charge, not the captain) and, years later, his visit to the same towns and cities provide a stunning portrait of how the River played a major role in shaping America. No one has the wit, charm and command of language of Twain."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,","review":"In this wonderful book, Mark Twain blends humor and suspense wonderfully. The main character, Hank Morgan, is knocked over the head with a crowbar and is somehow transported back to the sixth century during King Arthur's reign. Taking advantage of the superstitiousness of the people, he saves himself from death at the stake by predicting an eclipse. He earns a position secondary to the king and displays nineteenth century technology to the inhabitants. During his stay in Camelot, Hank learns that monarchy, the Established Church, and knight errantry must come to an end. To help create this wonderful work of literature, Twain gives the characters a definite personality to help describe them. The suspense certainly adds to the reader's interest. This is a book that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"The Frequent Fryers Cookbook : How to Deep-Fry Just About Anything That Walks, Crawls, Flies, or Vegetates","review":"Fried Food will Kill Ya!

For one, no this book is not a surprise as its publishing was announced months before your review and because RD has always said he'd be willing to write a WC book given a publisher that was also willing. Secondly, of the three persons you list as &quot;legends&quot;, only one of them falls into that category, assuming you're using the context of the word that I and most fans are thinking of. While Flair and Hart may have their negatives outside the ring, in the ring they are icons of what wrestling can and should be.

The author, R.D. Reynolds, is a masterful comic writer who obviously loves the sport. It is a must-read for any longstanding wrestling fan.That being said, the review written by the reader from Hillsdale, NY is right on the mark when he (or she) points out that much of what Reynolds presents as &quot;wrestlecrap&quot; in fact represents the most endearing and exciting chapters in pro wrestling history. For example, for Reynolds to state so brazenly that wrestlers such as Kamala, King Kong Bundy, Hacksaw Jim Duggan, and Mario Mancini lacked &quot;legitimate wrestling skills&quot; is simply absurd. Duggan, for example (real name Terry Funk) was a silver medalist in the heavyweight Greco-Roman style competition in the 1968 Olympics. This is somehow not &quot;legitimate&quot;? And the expos&eacute; on Abram Leibowitz (better known as Stone Cold Steve Austin) left me shaking my head - why must Reynolds focus so obsessively on Austin's 2-year losing streak in the short-lived NAACP?To claim that wrestlers such as the Iron Sheik, Saba Simba, Roddy Piper, Outback Jack, and Killer Khan were offensive caricatures misses one essential point: these wrestlers were actually from the countries they claimed (Poland, Brazil, Ireland, New Zealand, and Norway, respectively)! It doesn't seem fair to include these men in the same &quot;wrestlecrap&quot; category as Chris Benoit and Kurt Angle. The same goes for Reynolds's disdain for the days when every WWF wrestler represented another profession. In real life, Sparky Plugg really was a mechanic, Mike Rotundo really had been a meat inspector, and Wendy Richter really did own a construction company. So why shouldn't the WWF have revealed as much?And does it really matter that the Von Erich family name was really Lesnar? That Brian Pillman was killed by an ice cream truck? That Hulk Hogan and Bertha Faye were only married for three weeks? That Lou Thesz perjured himself at the McMahon steroid trial? That Andy Kaufmann and Jerry Lawler co-owned a pizzeria in Bloomington, IL? That a Nobel Peace Prize winner (Terry Gordy) became a wrestling announcer? That former NWA champion Shawn Stasiak was convicted as an accomplice in the Oklahoma bombing? None of this is true &quot;wrestlecrap,&quot; but rather part of the rich history of the sport that has attracted so many millions of fans over the years.I rate this book highly because of its great entertainment and nostalgia value. It's just that the book's perspective doesn't always make sense. (For example, I wonder why Owen Hart's tragic suicide was portrayed in the same lighthearted vein as was the steel cage match between Nailz and Jim Crockett at Wrestlemania XXIV in 1993.) However, any true wrestling fan will probably read this book in a single sitting. Despite its flaws, this book really is a minor masterpiece."},{"Title":"WrestleCrap: The Very Worst of Pro Wrestling (WrestleCrap series)","review":"These so-called authors must be mad! They forget that TRUE wrestling fans know all about this sports-entertainment. That's because REAL fans read Capt. Lou Albano's Idiot's Guide to Pro Wrestling. Sorry RD but's it's hard to buy into a book by someone who doesn't even know the Rock's real name (Rocky Melvin for those of us in the know). Come on, the authors would have us believe that the Gooker did not thrill and entertain us all with his dance moves. Who could forget that the Gooker had a great WCW tag-team title-run with the Shockmaster? The authors of this book...That's who! Shame on you!

The idea behind &quot;wrestlecrap&quot; is to poke fun at wrestling's more bizarre products such as the gobbledy gooker[sic], aldo montoya, and outback jack. The central problem with this book is Reynolds' major attitude problem, as he tears into wrestling legends like Hulk Hogan, Lex Luger and Vince Russo, while simultaneously sticking his head right up the backsides of wrestling cancers like Bret Hart and Ric Flair(who by the way are the REAL wrestlecrap). His attempts at comedy(nearly the whole book) fall flat time and time again, and the few times he tries to get serious and infromative he spew more lies than George W. Bush and Tony Blair prior to the Iraq War. This book is yet another poorly written, totally unresearched cash-in on the wrestling boom. Ironically on Reynolds' webiste he mocks &quot;the complete idiot's guide to pro wrestling&quot; for the same stuff he himself does in this book. AVoid."},{"Title":"WrestleCrap: The Very Worst of Pro Wrestling (WrestleCrap series)","review":"First of all, this book is hilarious, mostly because all of the facts in it are wrong. The author had some very shoddy sources on this book. One claim he makes is that Mick Foley wrestled under the name Cactus Jack. Rest assured, Mick Foley is most well known for portraying the Ultimate Warrior shortly after the death of the original Warrior, Glenn Jacobs. Cactus Jack was none other than Jim Hellwig. He also states that Hulk Hogan was the star of several movies that were nowhere near the blockbuster hits that announcers hyped them to be. Trust me, I went to see Santa With Muscles, and the line was going around the block to get into the theater. He mentions that Kamala hailed from Africa, blatantly false. Kamala originated in South Dakota, where he trained at Stu Hart's dungeon. He has many other nationalities mixed up as well. He lists Roddy Piper as being from Scotland, when everyone knows that he is Irish. I have heard that he is working on a second book about the death of WCW. I have news for you Mr. Reynolds, WCW is still alive after WWF went bankrupt. WCW then changed their name to WWE and took over WWF's old shows."},{"Title":"WrestleCrap: The Very Worst of Pro Wrestling (WrestleCrap series)","review":"I have to admit, &quot;Wrestlecrap&quot; is one of the few books where I actually considered inflating my rating. The book seems like it was a genuine labor of love for someone who, as far as I know, is not a professional writer by trade. And there were a number of good laughs to be found within its pages. But I would be lying if I didn't acknowledge that as a big fan of the &quot;Wrestlecrap&quot; web-site, I found myself somewhat disappointed in the book, and have a feeling that other fans of the site will have the same reaction.The whole appeal of the &quot;Wrestlecrap&quot; web-site, and what makes it a source of such hilarity, is how it goes into minute detail describing the ridiculousness and inanity of some of the worst wrestling gimmicks ever presented to the public. In this book, though, instead of &quot;going with what brought him to the dance&quot;, the book is written more as a &quot;Cliffs Notes&quot; history of the wrestling business over the past twenty years. The dumb angles, preposterous gimmicks, and ridiculous storylines that are gone over with a fine tooth comb to hilarious effect on the web-site are often given only a few sentence description in the book. Granted, these are generally a hysterical few sentences, I just wish the book offered the same level of detail that the web-site does.I also noticed a number of factual and chronological inaccuracies in the book, which leads me to believe that the author chose to rely primarily on his memory for research (the very short &quot;Sources&quot; section at the end of the book seems to confirm my suspicion). For example, the author claims that Hulk Hogan's box office bomb, &quot;Santa with Muscles&quot;, as opposed to ruining Hogan's acting career, actually led to him getting his own TV series, &quot;Thunder in Paradise&quot;. Only problem is, &quot;Thunder in Paradise&quot; came out in 1994, &quot;Santa with Muscles&quot; hit theaters in 1996. In the chapter entitled &quot;Warrior Wisdom&quot;, Reynolds claims that after breaking into the business together in California, Jim &quot;Ultimate Warrior&quot; Hellwig and Steve &quot;Sting&quot; Borden went their separate ways, with Sting going to the Mid-South/UWF promotion and Ultimate Warrior going to World Class Wrestling in Texas. Actually, Sting and Warrior went to Mid-South/UWF Wrestling together as The Blade Runners tag team before Warrior later left for World Class. Reynolds was also off on when Ole Anderson was fired as WCW booker (he was actually fired BEFORE the infamous &quot;Black Scorpion&quot; angle reached its conclusion, not after as the book claims) and on when the NWO split into the &quot;NWO Hollywood&quot; and &quot;NWO Wolfpac&quot; factions (the book claims the split came after the &quot;Fingerpoke of Doom&quot; angle between Hulk Hogan and Kevin Nash, when actually that angle is what ended the split). Admittedly, some of these are fairly minor errors, but for a book that is primarily going to appeal to long-time hardcore wrestling fans, there is nothing that an author can do to lose credibility with his audience that to present a number of incorrect facts that many readers will pick up on.I'm probably being overly negative here, a result of high expectations. I should mention that the book is very well-written and there were times when Reynolds really hit his grove, like when describing the inane plotlines of many Hulk Hogan movies, rehashing some of Vince McMahon's hair-brained schemes like the World Bodybuilding Federation and XFL, or when going off on the 200 years behind the times portrayal of black wrestlers like Kimala or Saba Simba. I also selfishly hope that despite its faults, the book sells extremely well so that Reynolds can bring back the full Wrestlecrap web-site, instead of the scaled down version that has been up for the past few years."},{"Title":"WrestleCrap: The Very Worst of Pro Wrestling (WrestleCrap series)","review":"First of all, I am a big fan of Reynolds's web site. For the record, Reynolds each week features examples of \\"wrestlecrap,\\" i.e. story lines and gimmicks from the world of professional wrestling that seem particularly lame. (For example, a guy whose gimmick is that he's a wrestling plumber qualifies as wrestlecrap.) The Wrestlecrap site has a large, devoted following, due in part to Reynolds's peerless knowledge of the sport, but mostly to his wicked, dead-on sense of humor.Numerous times on his site, Reynolds promised that the book would NOT simply consist of rehashed examples from his web site. Unfortunately, that's exactly what at least 95% of this book is.A true fan of the site will recognize almost all the material here. Compounding the problem is that Reynolds's trademark wit is absent. Except for a few bright spots, he seems to be holding himself back, adopting a lamer, more \\"proper\\" writing style than the funnier, freer one found on his site. So not only is the reader presented with old material, but it's not even presented in as amusing a fashion as it has been before.Also, the \\"expos&eacute;\\" material promised by Reynolds on the site is rather weak. His account of the fall of the WCW is accounted more thoroughly and better elsewhere - Shaun Assael's solid yet unspectacular \\"Sex, Lies, and Headlocks\\" is one such example.I am a Reynolds fan, and I wanted to like this book. For the reasons given above - which, I believe, anyone will recognize upon an open-minded reading of the book - I could not. If you're not a fan of wrestling, you probably don't care about the myriad ridiculous wrestling angles from throughout the years. If you are a fan of the site, skip it entirely. You've seen it all before, only better.This leaves the wrestling fan who is not familiar with the site. This might actually be a good book for such a reader. It's sure to conjure up some hilarious moments that you forgot about long ago. There is, after all, a rich history of material to work with here. For everyone else, I would recommend a pass. Reynolds certainly has it in him to crank out an excellent book. This one just isn't it."},{"Title":"WrestleCrap: The Very Worst of Pro Wrestling (WrestleCrap series)","review":"Anyone who has visited the Wreslecrap website and is expecting more of the same will probably be disappointed with this book. While it does cover a lot of the silly angles and gimmicks over the years, most of them are only given a cursory glance, and there are many others that are completely overlooked. Instead, the author(s) seem more interested in presenting their halfassed wrestling history of the past 20 years, liberally colored with their own \\"smark\\" predjudices (you know what I'm talking about - Hogan, Nash, and Triple H are the devil, Ric Flair is a god, Stephanie McMahon should be burned at the stake, etc.)For example, in one chapter the author blames Kevin Nash for nearly destroying the WWF due to his title run in the mid-90s, but two chapters later he's running down all of the lame gimmicks the WWF tried to pass off on the wrestling audience during the same time, which had a FAR greater effect on the poor wrestling business of the mid 90s than the guy who held the big belt for barely a year.There's an entire book that could be written about all of the bad gimmicks WCW threw out there in their last two years, but most of these are glossed over in an attempt to recap the Nitro/Raw war (which most people who would be interested in this book are already very famililar with). Basically, they should've stuck with the \\"wrestlecrap\\" and left out the pseudo-insider commmentating completely.Another gripe I had was despite the authors' attempt at historical perspective, they managed to get several dates wrong and juxtapose events... for example, \\"Santa with Muscles\\" came out over two years after the TV series \\"Thunder in Paradise\\" began, contrary to what the book claims.This book would be a keeper had the author attempted to get interviews with those involved with \\"wrestlecrap\\" over the years. But aside from John Tenta, there's virtually no opinion from the wrestlers themselves.Oh, and I counted at least four variations of \\"an enemy most vile\\" - time to invest in a thesaurus, I believe.Between the errors and the emphasis on \\"history\\" over simply describing lame angles and gimmicks, I cannot recommend this book."},{"Title":"WrestleCrap: The Very Worst of Pro Wrestling (WrestleCrap series)","review":"If you are a wrestlign fan, you will enjoy it. Lots of funny sarcasm and tasty bits of backstage politics.The problem is, it focuses too much on being a history of the last 15 years of pro wrestling, and often lost focus of bringing up the worst ideas in wrestling. A book similar to the old Baseball Hall of Shame series would have been far better, in which the various catagores of bad ideas are the chapters and then list the most egregious examples. This is too much of a straight history for a book with its supposed thesis.As a wrestlign book, its five stars. BHut for one with a specified topic, its only a 4 out of 5."},{"Title":"WrestleCrap: The Very Worst of Pro Wrestling (WrestleCrap series)","review":"As a wrestling fan for 15 years, it was real treat to take a trip down memory lane with this book. I was a big fan of the Wrestlecrap web site, but since it has been cut down, it was great to read these stories again. The book had me laughing and often finding the nearest person to me to read sections to. If you've been a wrestling fan for any period of time and there have been times when you have said &quot;that was quite possibly the dumbest thing I ever seen on wrestling&quot;, trust me. There have been far dumber and they are all in this book. A great read."},{"Title":"WrestleCrap: The Very Worst of Pro Wrestling (WrestleCrap series)","review":"It is amazing reading this that people actually watch wrestling as the storylines that the authors mention are so laughably ridiculous that one would think that people couldn't possibly love the sport.I found this book to be a good read, contained a great deal of humour and it gave a concise history of the recent years in wrestling.As mentioned in earlier reviews, there are a number of research errors in the book that take away from the overall rating of the work but nevertheless I think it is a worthwhile addition to the wrestling bookshelf."},{"Title":"WrestleCrap: The Very Worst of Pro Wrestling (WrestleCrap series)","review":"I've loved wrestling, and at times, like from 1996-00 and pretty much nowadays, I've hated wrestling. But even the wrestling that I did love, such as the Ultimate Warrior's triumphant destruction of the early 90s, had to be taken with a grain of salt and the smile of a smart mark.What I love about this book is that it's just like me. It's a smart mark. The author clearly likes wrestling, has a long and involved history of watching it, and appreciates good gimmicks, good workers, and good matches. But what the guy doesn't like are wrestlers like Bastion Booger, gimmicks like Robocop coming to WCW, and workers with egos such as Hogan's. This guy appreciates good wrestling, and he likes to watch the \\"sport\\". But at the same time, he knows what it is and therefore has certain expectations of quality. He does a good job of calling out the events that came below that line. Some way below.Take for example a ludicrous situation where in the early 90s, Jake the Snake Roberts was trying to help the Ultimate Warrior overcome his fears to face the Undertaker, and at one point Jake buries him in a casket. The author takes amusement in the fact that the Warrior commands \\"Bury me snake man!\\" and then, upon the casket's closing, \\"screams like a little girl\\". The way it's written, and the mental images it creates, is worth a laugh. This guy's good enough however to point out when the Warrior has a match worth watching, and that's pretty much the tone of this book.While not always presenting absolutely stinging satire, the book is certainly light-hearted and tongue-in cheek. It often speaks in a flat-out unobjective sarcastic narrative, such as when \\"poor Vince Mcmahon, beacon of integrity, was being beaten in the ratings by evil millionaire Ted Turner\\". The book gets as many facts straight as I can tell, from my own memories and having cross-referenced a lot from my other more straight wrestling books. Sure, this book's a lot less polite and paints a lot of things with impressions of ulterior motives and dishonesty, but that's the point, it intends to poke at the silly, tasteless, and flat out ridiculous aspects of wrestling. More or less chronologically from the early 80s to present day. My only gripe is that sometimes the author centers on a specific subject, such as one of Hogan's movie bombs, for a little too long. But hey, no one else has done it to this extent and it doesn't happen often enough to hate the book by any means.While my favorite book on the subject, for a multitude of reasons, is still \\"The Buzz on Professional Wrestling\\", Wrestlecrap is a more specific and ridiculing (though still very much respectful) take on the dumber side of sports entertainment. Pick it up for a good laugh at some of the stuff you've always remembered or may have missed, or just for some humorous validation that yes, that stuff you saw was pretty dang crappy."},{"Title":"WrestleCrap: The Very Worst of Pro Wrestling (WrestleCrap series)","review":"When I purchased this, I was under the assumption that the book was going to be all about Wrestlecrap and the bad ideas in wrestling over the years, but it wasn't. Instead, I got a book that simply detailed the history of WCW and the WWF (mentioning both the good and the bad). While that's a nice little story in it's own right, that's not what I paid for. I got the book to read about the likes of Papa Shango and Repo Man, not the Monday ratings wars. While it's true that certain gimmicks are covered, they're only presented in these two ways:A.) Barely described and only given one sentence or paragraph.orB.) Copied and pasted from the WrestleCrap site.There are far superior wrestling books out there."},{"Title":"WrestleCrap: The Very Worst of Pro Wrestling (WrestleCrap series)","review":"I read this book and found it to be fantastic! I have watched wrestling off and on for many years. This book was so well written that it helped me to understand alot about wrestling. The author obviously is a huge fan of wrestling and also very interested in talking to people who may not understand all of the behind scenes and scenarios that make Pro Wrestling work (Or not work)!!Anyone could pick up this book and have a good understanding of wrestling and the promoters. I could not put it down. Thank you Randy Baer and R.D. Reynolds--Great Job!!! I will recommend this to all of my friends."},{"Title":"WrestleCrap: The Very Worst of Pro Wrestling (WrestleCrap series)","review":"First off, I have never visited the Wrestlecrap Website. That said, when I heard about the premise of this book, I was expecting a slightly amusing look at bad gimmicks like \\"The Red Rooster.\\" I was surprised to find that this book gave more than lists and photos of outrageously horrid characters. \\"Wrestlecrap\\" is so much more. This book ponders the thought process of the higher-ups in WCW and WWF. It describes gimmicks that were created for personal satisfaction rather than business savvy, gimmicks that were created out of desperation rather than creativity, and bad gimmicks that the promoters honestly thought were brilliant. Best of all, I found this book to be more than just slightly amusing; this book is hysterical!Wrestlecrap primarily focuses from the mid 1980s to the present, when Vince McMahon Jr gave pro wrestling a brand new paint job, and how folks like WCW's Jim Herd tried to \\"outcamp\\" the WWF with disastrous results. While I've read countless articles presenting icons like McMahon as everything from innovative to cutthroat to no-nonsense maverick, it's not very often you get to read a detailed report on the many blunders that go on amidst the successes, in the ring and behind the dressing room curtain. Yes, we know multiple Doink the Clowns were lame, how embarrassing the fake Razor Ramon & Diesel was, or how we cringed at WCW's \\"Wonderful World of Oz.\\" But Wrestlecrap goes into great detail about the geniuses who dreamed these angles up, why they expected them to work, why they didn't work. We read about backstage politics, and how some promoters created bad gimmicks specifically to make the wrestlers they disliked personally look bad. The author is also humble enough to point out a gimmick that, considering how way-out it was, should have failed, but instead became one of the most successful pro wrestling personas of all time: The Undertaker.Early on in the book, Reynolds and Baer appropriately take the heat off the wrestlers for performing these gimmicks, since they are performing a job at the booker's request.The point of wrestlers following the orders of the promoters is driven home in the book's forward, which is written by John \\"Earthquake\\" Tenta. Tenta was a Sumo and legit tough guy long before he became Earthquake. Even with that reputation, he did not hesitate, when asked, to dress up like \\"The Shark\\" or as Golga of The Oddities (confession time---I think we all have at least one \\"Wrestlecrap Guilty Pleasure\\"...mine is The Oddities!). In a business where big egos and dressing room hissyfits can make headaches for promoters, Tenta is a breath of fresh air. He stresses that wrestlers have to make do with the personas given them, and give it their best shot, and that for every \\"Stone Cold\\" Steve Austin created, there are a hundred \\"Sharks.\\" He is able to laugh at the bad gimmicks he did, as well as laugh at himself. John Tenta, despite being a Sumo, obviously never thought that the wrestling business was \\"beneath him\\" unlike many folks in the biz. For this, I take my hat off and salute John Tenta.This book is a shockingly wonderful book, and highly recommended for anyone who wants to see the rationale behind bad decisons!"},{"Title":"WrestleCrap: The Very Worst of Pro Wrestling (WrestleCrap series)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. They talked about all the bad gimmicks that were created and some of the reasons behind them. Iespecially enjoyed the chapters detailing WCW's fighting the WWFby trying to Copy what had worked for them with disastrous results.The only thing that they accomplished by showing sex, sex and moresex was permanently drive away many fans who never came back. Iand others have seen many of these gimmicks on the royal rumble andsurvivor series dvds and they still make you laugh. The Oz gimmick that they talked about was especially noteworthy. It was createdas a cross-promotion but utterly flopped. As I was reading this, Ifound myself busting out laughing at just how bad a lot of this was.A lot of the mini-movies that WCW filmed to promote matches fortheir PPVs were just god awful.

It destroyed Runnels' career. And where was the mention of what Vinny Mac also did to Dustin\\"s father, Dusty? After putting \\"the American Dream\\" in a polka dot outfit and saddled with the worse valet ever, you'd figure these incidents would deserve special mention as it seemed Vince was going out of his way to discredit the Runnels family.I also noticed there was no mention of Rowdy Roddy Piper's unfortunate Wrestlemania VI appearance where he painted half his body black in responce to his facing Bad News Brown.

I enjoyed the presentation of that, and figured this was continuing in the nature. It did just that, but included far more humorous affair. The book spotlights several, not every single one, but a big chunk of some of the worst gimmicks and events to happen in the modern sport of entertainment we know as Professional wrestling.Two of the key things I was concerned about was that the book not just be a repetition of 'Death of WCW', and that they didn't just rip on Hogan the entire time. They did a good job keeping that stuff separate, although everything example they give about Hogan in this book is sadly valid.But make no mistake about it, this book isn't solely about cheesey 80s to the failure of WCW in the last chapter, it keeps going, further proving there will always be more Wrestlecrap to write about.I strongly recommend you read this book as well, it's a very educated read and will shock you:The Death of WCW: WrestleCrap and Figure Four Weekly Present . . .

As I write this, Kane just married Lita because he won (or was that lost)a match with Matt Hardy; Undertaker recently buried Paul Bearer in cement; and Kurt Angle was faking an injury, even though it occurred after Big Show choke-slammed him over 20 feet onto a concrete floor!

It is a spinoff of the website of the same name. The main difference between the two is that on the website individual crap is looked at, while here in the book, the various crappy aspects of wrestling are strung together to form a larger story. What I mean by that is that the chapters will usually focus on what happened in WCW or the WWF during a particular time period. There are a few exceptions, like a chapter all about the Ultimate Warrior and one about Hulk Hogan's &quot;acting&quot; career. If you are the type of person who likes to laugh at the &quot;worst&quot; of anything, you should get some chuckles out of this book."},{"Title":"WrestleCrap: The Very Worst of Pro Wrestling (WrestleCrap series)","review":"After reading WrestleCrap, you will be left wondering who in their right mind came up with these stupid characters. Rest assured it wasn't the wrestlers.From the comic-book superheroes from the WWF to David Arquette capturing the WCW championship - and toss in the Doink \\"family,\\" Red Rooster, IRS and the KISS Demon - there is enough dumb characters with equally stupid storylines from the annals of pro wrestling that authors R.D. Reynolds and Bryan Alvarez had a ton of material to review.The introduction is written by John Tenta, who passed away in June 2006. Tenta wrestled under numerous gimmicks - Earthquake, Avalanche and Golga - but one really marked his career. While under contract with WCW, Tenta - as The Shark - was urged by management to alter his LSU Tiger tattoo to a shark. Soon after he changed the tattoo, the suits decided to eliminate his character.The book is a spin-off from the website created by Reynolds in 2000 and still going strong today.I confess my all-time favorite piece of garbage is the WCW series where Cactus Jack stars in \\"Lost in Cleveland.\\" Due to amnesia, CJ flees the company - really, not a bad move at the time - and a reporter then searches the streets of Cleveland for clues to where he lives. It got so convoluted that the staff writers couldn't keep up with the storyline. But in the end, Cactus is Captain Jack!There are plenty of laughs in WrestleCrap; but please remember the biggest joke is on the management teams who came up with this stuff."},{"Title":"WrestleCrap: The Very Worst of Pro Wrestling (WrestleCrap series)","review":"As a fan of RD Reynolds / Randy Baer as a person and a writer I bought this book a few years ago. I read this book cover to cover 1 time and have had no desire to pick it up ever again. Due to the many factual and writing errors in the book as well as its lack of depth, the book just has no re readability. This is especially true for any fan of the Wrestlecrap web site, which I have been for a long time, because the entire book is just reprinted and rehashed from the Wrestlecrap site.Every entry about an old wrestlecrap gimmick in the book is the same as \\"Gimmick A was a stupid idea because Wrestler X looked stupid in his costume while playing a wrestler with blank day job.\\" Outside of the comments from the late, great, John Tenta on being Earthquake / Shark / Avalanche there is no depth to any of the characters or why they existed and failed. The remainder of the book is just the usual \\"smart fan\\" opinionated garbarge that can be read on any wrestling web page about how Hart, Flair, Benoit and all wreslers under 6 feet tall are gods and Bischoff, Russo, McMahons, Nash, Hogan, Triple H, and Shawn Michaels are all the spawn of the devil who have conspired to destroy the greatness of professional wrestling. These problems with the book come from the fact that Reynolds did no research on the book and has no inside knowledge of the wrestling business.My advice is to read the Wrestlecrap web site once per week for an entire year. If you do this you will read everything that is in this book for free and in a more entertaining fashion with video / sound clips. This book is okay to check out from a friend or a library once for a trip down memory lane.

It probably helps to be a fan of wrestling, which i have been for the past seven years. It also helps to have a great sense of humor.

But, I must admit I was a bit dissapointed by his book. First of all, on the website when a crappy gimmick is dissected we are treated to images, video, and soundbites that enhance the craptastic experience. Reading a description of Mantaur isn't nearly as funny as seeing a grown man dressed like a cow-beast try to wrestle. Maybe I've been spoiled, but a description of this ridiculousness in words just doesn't drive the point across as powerfully.Also, much of the book is just descriptions of what we've seen from WWF and WCW without really ripping into them too much. RD is a very funny man, I just wished he'd gone off a bit more, he seemed to be reporting rather than offering commentary on what happened. I know he has strong, funny opinions about this, there's no need to just regurgitate what's already happened. Ridicule and mock it for all it's worth! Give me heel color commentary!I also wish he had delved more into the twisted psychology behind some of the more blatantly rascist, stereotypical, xenophibic, or homoerotic concepts behind these failed gimmicks. Wrestling is largely ignored by mainstream media, so they are often let off the hook for these transgressions. I wish RD had expounded on this a bit more and taken them to task. Is this the work of narrow-minded bookers or is this what fans demand? How does THAT reflect on all of us?All in all though it was a fun quick, read, but lacks the punch of the website.

Most of the book pretty much gives brief descriptions of the website inductions. Still, the book will keep you in stitches as you read about the absurdity behind some of pro-wrestling's absolute WORST gimmicks and booking decissions in history. The guilty parties being Vince McMahon of the WWF (now WWE), the multiple moronic bookers WCW had, and even one of AWA's worst with grown men fighting over a raw turkey (good going Bischoff).There were a few chronological errors that only hardcore fans would pick up like the nWo splitting into 2 factions and then rejoining after the finger poke of doom. The book depicts it differently. Mike Awesome was the \\"Fat Chick Thriller\\" in the summer of 2000 and later evolved (or devolved) into \\"That 70's Guy\\" (which was a gimmick I found to be entertaining even though it was stupid, but gave Mike Awesome a chance to improve on his mic skills). It wasn't detremantal to his career like the Red Rooster gimmick was to poor Terry Taylor's...RD Reynolds sticks to his guns by not bad mouthing the original Doink the Clown gimmick played to perfection by Maniac Matt Borne. He explains that the gimmick sucked when Borne left the promtion and a jobber was given the clown garb and made into a \\"goodguy.\\" And a \\"Mini-Me\\" version was created named Dink, Men On a Mission and the Bushwackers dressed up like him at Survivor Series '93 (which I had the displessure of seeing in person). And yes, Jorge Gonzalves' \\"ass crack\\" Sashskwatch bodysuit would've made a very symbolic backcover picture for the book. It would be where wrestlecrap comes from and also what the promoters were using to think up some of these horrible gimmicks!Towards the end of the book you get a sneak preview feel of his latest book; The Death of WCW which is an excellent read.Are you a glutten for punishment?

There was some entertaining moments for remembrance of ridiculous gimmicks but overall, it began falling flat about half way through. Reynolds dwells upon Hulk Hogan's movies rather than on actual wrestling for a lengthy chapter. Now I know Hogan's movies are unbelievable crap but I didn't really need Reynolds to rehash and summarize every one of the movies. He also rants about the Monday Night wars and the nWo at length after promising he wasn't presenting this book to look at the mainstream stars and stories.While the book was certainly readable, I was expecting something a bit different, maybe more coverage on the lame ass gimmicks he began talking about. There was more to Scott Hall than the nWo afterall (he did portray a gator wrangler). The further the book went, the more Reynolds talked about the big stars.Overall, the book is entertaining to some degree and a wrestling fan will enjoy it. I expected more focus on the could-a-been gimmick-wrestlers and stories rather than the superstars and major storylines. Maybe some of the dumbass gimmicks the stars used to be (Blue Blazer, Starship Coyote, Big Bully Busick, Planet Stasiak, Raven's Nest, the Skyscrapers, Powers of Pain, etc.).

Cecil is a lost young man, yes; but I get the feeling he likes it in the haze. Reality is too harsh a world for those with sensitive hearts. I remember hearing from the author once that others thought the ending too hokey; however, I found it to be just the glimpse of hope I needed to believe the Cecils of this world can stop living in a past of regret, selfishness, and \\"self-preservation\\" and become the men they never thought possible.

In order for him to get in this fine school, he had to sweep and clean the speaking room, one day the superintendent came by with a white glove and ran her finger across every piece of furniture, no dust.

This book is an autobiography by Professor Booker T Washington (1856-1915). He was born into the deplorable condition of genocide which bears the euphemism of &quot;slavery&quot;. He found a way through iron will and determinism to &quot;do a thing that the world wants done&quot; enabling to &quot;make a living for himself and others&quot; through embracing the joy and love of labor. His greatest accomplishment was the founding and building of the Tuskegee Institute of Normal and Industrial Institute from a chicken shack to a school with assets of over $500,000 free from mortgage. He rose to national and international attention as the most influential African-American of his time with his famous speech calling people to &quot;cast down your bucket where you are.&quot; People who accomplish great things are controversial, and Professor Washington was no different. Dr W E B Du Bois in &quot;The Souls of Black Folk&quot; wrote of Professor Washington, &quot;His doctrine has tended to make the whites, North and South, shift the burden of the Negro problem to the Negro's shoulders and stand aside as critical and rather pessimistic spectators; when in fact the burden belongs to the nation, and the hands of none of us are clean if we bend not our energies to righting these great wrongs.&quot; During the Civil Rights struggles of the 1960's Washington's philosophy was called into question by none other than the great Reverend Dr Martin Luther King Jr, who wrote in his book &quot;Why We Can't Wait&quot;, &quot;Be content [Washington] said in effect, with doing well what the times permit you to do at all. However, this path, they soon felt, had too little freedom in its present and too little promise in its future.&quot; These are the issues that continue to develop, and will, I suspect, for some time to come. I was most impressed by the capacity for Professor Washington to forgive. Of all his impressive accomplishments, this is one that spoke to me undeniably of his courage and strength. He forgives the man who sired him, a man worthy of the title &quot;father&quot; only in the strict biological sense. Professor Washington writes, &quot;Whoever he was, I never heard of his taking the least interest in me or providing in any way for my rearing. But I do not find especial fault with him. He was simply another unfortunate victim of the institution which the Nation unhappily had engrafted upon it at that time.&quot; Some contend that his attitudes were politically motivated, yet, I do not see what Professor Washington would stand to gain by forgiving the man who &quot;fathered&quot; him. With unblemished sincerity, he forgave his slave masters, (&quot;man-stealers&quot;, as Frederick Douglass called them). Professor Washington wrote, &quot;I pity from the bottom of my heart any nation or body of people that is so unfortunate as to get entangled in the net of slavery. I have long since ceased to cherish any spirit of bitterness against the southern white people on account of the enslavement of my race.&quot; He genuinely felt that he was far better off than his masters because, &quot;the slave system on our place, in a large measure, took the spirit of self reliance and self-help out of the white people.&quot; Why would he believe this? The epitome of his life's goal was to find and do something which was valued. The very thing his masters could not do. &quot;My old master had many boys and girls, but not one, so far as I know, ever mastered a single trade or special line of productive industry.&quot; Some may, after reading this book, still feel that Professor Washington's attitudes were politically motivated. I cannot accept that idea. I have never known any one nor do I believe it is possible to feign this level of forgiveness. It is my opinion that Professor Booker T Washington is a reflection of a love which is divine. This is one of the reasons I am so impressed with this man, and this book."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"Very interesting perspective on slavery from someone who actually lived through it.

Look at his life, what he wrote and how he approached life and you will see similarities between his thoughts and those of other achievers. Such individuals usually: read extensively, travel widely, and pursue education. This book is loaded with Christian success principles that transcend time and location.

Washington and his march from slavery to one of the foremost men of his time.His views may seem quite antiquated in today's world, given what has happened and not happened in the last 100 years in race relations and it is easy to see how Black leaders of today might be critical of Washington's views and perspectives.But to do so would be to make the all too common mistake of imprinting and transferring today's value system and experiences on a culture and time of long ago. Anyone can look back with 20-20 hindsight and criticize. What matters most is having a plan to move forward from where you are, and Booker T. Washington certainly had that. His is a remarkable story of courage, grace, and iron-willed determination, for himself and for his race.While today's leaders and purists might criticize Washington, it should never be forgotten that he took the first steps and led his race and the entire South in the first steps, no matter how imperfect they may be in hindsight, up and away from slavery.There had to be a Booker T. Washington to bridge the gap between what was and what was to be.

Reading this autobiography I'm inspired to teach as much as I've learn to others less fortunate. And I may end up being a career academic like Booker T as well. Having started a career in public speaking before reading this book I feel even more inspired to continue this pursuit because its such an effective tool. Booker T was a master orator from his own accounts. Surely all the invitations received (with no marketing or self-promotion) is a testament to his skill as an orator. Slow but sure progress is made. The language is easy to understand yet the structure is complex because there are lessons to be learnt on many levels. I highly recommend this book to all non-white South African especially those of mixed decent and black people in general. Booker T was what is called in modern South Africa a \\"coloured\\" person. He has a white father and a black mother."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"Washington potrays a resilient and resourceful man in his autobiography, \\"Up from Slavery.\\" With little formal education as a child, his abilities and outward accomplishments are astounding to read about. Tuskegee being the most well known, but not his only significant achievement.Stripped to its barest elements, Washington presents a philosophy that those with character and industry will succeed. Despite deep racism and prejudice, persistence in an American form of opportunity can result in success over time, as evidenced by Washington's life.Washinton makes no excuses and moves forward despite unfair and unreasonable treatment."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"What is most striking about Washington's autobiographical account of his rise from slavery to revered statesman is his lack of resentment toward white culture. Rather than focus on what whites should do to uplift blacks, Washington encouraged blacks to take individual agency over their lives. He believed the best way for blacks to achieve social parity was to become indispensable members of the communities in which they lived. His absolute confidence in black resilience would probably be regarded as naive in today's political discourse. And yet the long list of his (and all black culture's) achievements during this period are unmistakable and nothing short of inspiring.It's a shame this book is on the African American Studies shelf. The lessons from Washington's life apply to all humans, not just blacks. This book would be an excellent addition high school reading lists as a model of the values consonant with personal success."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"I found this to be a most amazing work. In telling the story of going from a child of slavery to the founder and president of the Tuskegee institute, Mr. Washington illustrates for us the life-lessons which can empower any individual or race in our free society today.Namely, look to your neighbor in love, not anger; recognize the nobility in working hard for something rather than expecting charity; be willing to give yourself to a greater cause; believe that people are capable of great things and they will live up to your expectations; recognize the importance of education, not just of the mind, but of the body and soul as well; recognize that any man who provides value to the community in which he lives will be accepted and even welcomed into that community; and above all, trust in God to care for your needs.I highly recommend this book as a testament to the positive result of thinking from a perspective of Love and Abundance rather than Anger and Scarcity. When Mr. Washington's humility is measured against his accomplishments, he becomes in my eyes one of the greatest Americans to have lived."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"Let me start off by saying I'm a 16 year old female...Upon looking through the history section of the store I discovered &quot;Up From Slavery&quot;, the autobiography of Booker T. Washington. I could easily recall reading about him in US history. Interested, I decided to buy it.. Well I ended up staying up all night reading this book.Washington entails his life story of endeavers and prosperity gained. He describes of how he raised himself up from slavery through sacrifices and struggles. With the self-reward of obtaining education he decided to develope the Tuskegee Institution to help further educate his peoples. As well he established a bond between, not only blacks and whites, but southerners and northerners (during post-civil war times). He talks on how as people, one should educate themselves not only in books but in labor as well. In doing so, one will achieve full-on success.&quot;Up from Slavery&quot; enlightened me so much more on Washington and his role in shaping the free life we as americans, live today. I have gained an enormous amount of respect for this intriguingly compelling man. I really do feel a great sensation of pride in our history when I think about Washington and his achievements for this nation. Beautiful."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"This is a very well-written statement of the conservative approach to the quest for Black equality. Written as Booker T. Washington's autobiography, it is important to keep in mind that part of the purpose of this book was to recruit donors to fund the Tuskegee Institute--which meant that Washington needed to emphasize that he was an accomodationist and not in any way a radical. That being said, some of the sentiments expressed in this book seem very over-optimistic in retrospect. For example, Washington says he believes that whites in the South will grant blacks full political rights of their own accord, when blacks are mature enough to deserve them, because people are innately good and will do the right thing. The end of Reconstruction and the advent of Jim Crow laws, along with the intensity of the battle for civil rights, showed him to be mistaken on that point--which is partly why he was eventually eclipsed as a leader by W.E.B. DuBois. Still, this book is a fascinating autobiography and a great statement of the moderate, gradualist approach to attaining equality."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"Everyone should read &quot;Up From Slavery&quot; by Booker T. Washington. Washington was one of the most outstanding people in our history. If he lived today he probably would become President and be one of our greatest Presidents. He had an iron will to achieve his goals in life and to do something to help his people. He started in life in slavery, born to a single mother. Later on he was abused and exploted by his step-father. He overcame tremendous hardships to get an education. He then dedicated his life to helping other African-Americans to improve their lives. He is often criticized for compromising too much with the white establishment. I think however that people need to understand the difficulties of his time and also his way of trying to change people indirectly rather than through direct confrontation. &quot;Up From Slavery&quot; is a great example of this. It is also fun to read. I have a personal reason for liking Washington. In World War II my father was in the Air Corps. For some time the bomber he flew in was protected by the famous Tuskeegee Airmen who were trained at Tuskeegee Institute, founded by Washington. The Tuskeegee Airmen never lost a plane that they escorted. So you see, if it hadn't been for Booker T. Washington I might not be here."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"Over the years, being aware of the great rivalry between Booker T. Washington and W. E. B. Dubois I had grown used to Dubois followers saying Booker T. was an accommodationalist Uncle Tom, and other similar statements. I read Up from Slavery as a teenager, and I didn't get that impression from him at the time, so I usually dismissed people's negativity about him as misunderstanding. Having recently re-read the book, it made a far stronger impression on me as an adult and I feel compelled to give my own opinion, especially since the old \\"accommodationalist Uncle Tom\\" reviews are also on this site.The time period after the slaves were freed was known as Reconstruction. The former slaves were both scared as to what the future held and deeply excited to experience this concept of freedom with the fire and enthusiasm of the Newly Born. For the most part they were very ignorant of their past, of how to establish themselves as a thriving community, how to interact with their white neighbors in a way beneficial to all and how to best use their money and time to grow as individuals. The whites were equally scared as to what the future held (change is often scary) but they were also excited for the former slaves and 100% wished them well. Yes, this was also the time period that formed the KKK, but evil racists were always around and thankfully, then as now, are in the minority.As Booker T. explained, both the owner and the owned had been damaged by the chattel slavery institution. Because the lowest member of society was the slave to whom all menial labor was delegated to, both races saw work/labor as something to be avoided. The whites saw it as something that was beneath them, while the blacks felt they should rise up above it as free men. For them, \\"freedom\\" meant \`I no longer have to work hard.' The blacks felt that if they could get an education they could \\"live by their wits\\" by teaching, being politicians, preaching or any other profession that required thinking for money, so that they would never have to perform physical work/labor with their hands again. They suffered from many misconceptions as to what made a free person successful, such as purchasing a very expensive item that they couldn't afford as a status symbol to show that they've \\"made it\\" even going into severe debt to have it. They felt that intensive study into Latin or Greek languages somehow made them superior to other people and that mastery in these fields also proved that they had \\"made it.\\"Booker T. and Dubois created two models designed to help pull the race forward as a free and successful people.1.) Booker T. Washington's model involved not only a solid education in academics and Qur'anic/Biblical principles (integrity, hard work and patient perseverance) but he also felt that each member of the race should be schooled in industry and the value of Sacred Work/Labor. As opposed to the work they were used to doing as a slave, Sacred Work was the necessary work put forward that not only made an individual indispensable to his community, but it built character, confidence, assurance, dignity and gave the valuable gift of the concept of \\"a job well done.\\" Each individual was to master a trade (or two or three) that was vital to a community's growth and do that trade to the utmost best of his/her ability so that not only would the community be successful and grow but the neighboring communities would also find that community indispensable. This would promote both a brotherly camaraderie between communities as well as help the economy by increasing the competition in free trade. Booker T's model would enable the average man to be a vital asset to his community which would become structurally solid and a vital asset to the nation's other communities. It is designed to build up the entire black community as a whole while allowing for exceptional individuals (like Booker T. Washington) to excel. This was indeed the American Dream model, that through hard work, determination, persistence and education you can achieve success.Booker T felt that because the black and white races went through slavery together, they needed to be healed together. Starting off with nothing, the former slaves needed help in order to get a foot hold onto their future. His model pulls the races together for their mutual benefit; as the black race builds itself up the white race will benefit in the proper symbiotic relationship between two businesses. Yes, Booker T. rightly saw the growing community of former slaves as a developing business and he recognized that no business achieves its ultimate success without the help of other businesses, in this case the southern and northern whites. Just like FedEx and Kinko's or Exxon and Ford work together and thus enhance each other, Booker T. knew that in order to really be successful both races needed to work together (Didn't Up from Slavery function as a business plan for investors, after all?). Of course for the grand scheme of things, for the sake of his race's success why would Booker T. (or any other black person) alienate whites by continuously putting in their faces the evils of slavery and colonialism? In other words, why would a struggling start-up business alienate the banking industry and other investors by pointing out their wrong doings? They would be cutting their own throats. Obviously, if ever there was a time to forgive and forget Reconstruction was that time. And once the ultimate success had been achieved both races would do whatever they needed to ensure the wellbeing of the partner. If some racist bigots burned a cross on Kinko's lawn and threatened to lynch the manager, don't you think FedEx would also be insulted and demand the practice stop?2.) W. E. B. Dubois was actually the spokesman for the blacks who felt that they shouldn't have to work hard anymore, now they should be free to live the way they watched the whites live for two centuries. In the Dubois model, the individual was encouraged to achieve the highest education he was able to. This would guarantee that the \\"Talented Tenth\\" (the small percentage of highly gifted individuals among every people) would attain the mega-success that was the American Dream. Dubois felt that it's the Talented Tenth among every race that furthers the goals of the community as a whole, and that the masses would benefit from a Reaganomics-like trickle down effect. This model, encouraging a work-o-phobic attitude and a individual's pursuit of success did nothing to build the black community but gave the hope that whites would accept the blacks into their communities \\"because we are free like you and we demand to live equally with you because we say so\\" which actually was the attitude that formed the KKK in the first place. Unlike the model of his rival, Dubois did not establish a system that would remove the slave mentality from the people so they would want to work hard in order to elevate themselves. Consequently, the concept of the \\"educated fool\\" was born, with the black academic full of dead languages and abstract principles with absolutely no practical way of using his education to enhance the quality of his character, dignity, morality, integrity or his community as a whole. His community is a raggedy shambles after only a few years of his living in it, because the slave mentality that the Dubois model perpetuates won't permit him even to take pride in slapping on a new coat of paint, mowing the lawn or cleaning up the trash and beer bottles littered in front of his house. Although the Talented Tenth's accomplishments have moved the race forward in very slow increments the average man, with the idea that work is bad and education only benefits a few, is free only to get in trouble or be used up for someone else's dream while he waits for the next minute advancement from the trickle down effect.Obviously W. E. B. Dubois won the debate. Seeing the Dubois model as the easy route to success, they simply labeled Booker T. as an Uncle Tom and waited for their Talented Tenth to do their thing and never gave another thought about the matter. How they felt about Booker T. was summed up by how actor Moses Gunn played him in the movie Ragtime. Does it feel better knowing that at the end of his life, Dubois admitted that Booker T. was right?No. The damage has now been done. People are fond of saying, \\"But we've come so far!\\" But have we? We would've come much farther much sooner if we had embraced Booker T's vision instead of Dubois' work-o-phobic, trickle down vision. They make that statement by pointing to the kind, modern white people that live among us today. But there have always been kind-hearted white people who've honestly wished us success! Look where all the money that helped found Tuskegee and the Hampton Institute came from. Look at the reality of our progress. As a community, after over a century since the Emancipation Proclamation, we have the same mentality we had as newly freed slaves. Instead of a household sharing a single fork and wasting all of their money on an organ that we can't play, now we've replaced the organ with a Cadillac Escalade or a Coach bag or some rims. Our communities are chaotic and scattered with no concept of leaving a legacy for our children. We lack the business savvy to own our own community shops and stores so that corporate predators can take advantage and just take our money out of our communities.Without Booker T's life training fundamentals we still are in need of therapy for the centuries of chattel slavery we've gone through and so are the descendants of our former masters. Just like we have made little progress past the legacy of slavery's inferiority complex so they are still suffering from the superiority complex slavery gave to them. For the whites, they don't see anything wrong with building up vast wealth off of the blood, sweat and tears of others and giving them as little compensation as they can get away with. They honestly don't see anything wrong with playing with the worker's minds to make them feel they are getting a good deal. Because of this, the old wealthy white families who've built their money through slave labor and their peers actually sought how they could continue to take advantage of black slave labor without breaking the new anti-slavery laws. I believe that Up from Slavery is an excellent model as to how the black race can pull itself together into an awesome community, but I also believe that the warped mind suffering under a superiority complex can \\"reverse engineer\\" the book and use it to prevent such a community from forming in the first place.STEP ONEDestroy all existing examples of strong black communitiesSTEP TWOPull out the wealthiest, most productive members of the community leaving the ignorant, defenseless poorSTEP THREEAllow drugs and alcohol to flow freely into the ranks of the poor so that their frustrations and stress will ignite into various crimesSTEP FOURPaint the picture in the popular media (both bluntly and subliminally) that these people are prone to criminal behavior anywaySTEP FIVEWith the public's approval, round them up and fill up the prisons with them. Now they are the property of the State, and can be legally contracted out as slave labor... continuing where we left off.If Dubois' model had not have been adopted, we would have been the ultimate success story, a strong and vibrant community making a major contribution to our nation's prosperity and our own people's legacy. Of course it's not too late to fix it. All we have to do is stop calling Booker T. Washington an \\"accommodating Uncle Tom\\" and get to work."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"&quot;Up from slavery&quot; documents the rise of Booker T. Washington, from a plantation slave to the head of Tuskegee college in Alabama. Along the way his narrative details the squalor and humiliations of his childhood and ends with a number of journalistic adulations regarding his career and speeches. It is a wonderful book, yet curious.Unlike Frederick Douglass, the severe critic of the slaveholding South, Washington's outlook is decidedly postive. He refuses to get into any kind of individual or group bashing, but prefers to dwell on the successes of blacks, improving race relations, and the success of his school- and students. He becomes enamored of his own success on the stump, but such is the case with most ambitious, forward looking individuals. I would have liked a bit more criticism, and fewer excerpts from the newspapers of his time (regarding his speech-making ability.) His repeated refrains about service and merit (being the only true measure of a man), are sound. All in all, this is an upbeat, inspiring story from a man who truly defied the odds, and his winning attitude is sorely needed today."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"&quot;Up From Slavery&quot; brought to light the real deal behind the man Booker T. Washington. Before reading it, I was taught to believe that he accommodated and assimilated himself and the African American race to that of the white race. It has to be made known that Booker T. Washington was born into an era where the slave mentality was not only prominent but socially acceptable. To understand his conservative efforts, you'd have to understand the fact that he achieved everything in life by hard labor. Therefore, in order to promote economic and social equality, he had to promote issues that led to these things. In other words, he felt that the newly freed blacks were not ready to integrate themselves into white society, a society that did not respect their freedom at all. He wanted African Americans to embrace a nationalistic attitude before asking white society to embrace it. If blacks were seen as the uncouf beings that we were thought to be...acceptance would never occur. So, in using every resource available including accommodation, Washington underhandedly promoted social and racial equality for all."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"Booker Washington rose to fame as a great American because of his intense understanding of the American system of government and his ability to stay focused. Booker obviously understood the impact of slavery on his race and that freedom alone was not enough in a country that did not respect that freedom. Booker's ideology coincided with that of Frederick Douglas who would have made the speech at the Atlanta Exposition, but he died earlier that year.Booker's speech was &quot;nationalistic&quot; as he told his listeners to be as seperate as the fingers on the hand and to cast down your buckets where you are. It appears to me that he prefered separation, and individualized education geared towards economic empowerment of the newly freed &quot;negroes&quot;. 90% of all the black people in this country had been slaves and lived below the Mason-Dixon Line. The other 10% were free, yet not free. Tuskegee (Institute) University attests to his abilites as a monument builder. &quot;Up From Slavery&quot; is a story within a story. Booker T. Washinton, according to Louis Harlan was a &quot;wizard&quot;. Even W.E.B. Dubois in his latter years, prior to joining the Communist Party began to agree with many of Washington's philosophies. Booker T. Washington was a politican and a technicrat. He got the job done."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"i wanted to read a book written by someone who lived as an american \\"slave\\" as well as thru the period of \\"reconstruction\\" that WAS america in the late 19th century; i hoped to hear a first hand account of slavery from a person who survived it. i wanted to understand the struggles and joys of a person who lived as a newly emancipated citizen. booker t washington is one such person who was freed from bondage.what i loved about this book:*first hand account of the affects of slavery such as: naming himself, not knowing his own birthday and age, no ties to family, no knowledge of lineage of either of his parents, etc.*THE TRUTH about why he is lauded as one of america's greatest \\"african americans\\"*the early struggles of tuskegee as a universitywhat i loved less about this book:* references to ppl, places, organizations, etc. lost to history. google helped, but dang :(* incessant listing of accomplishments - including how well received booker was by white media and white america - rather than discussion of his relationships with his 3 wives and 3 childrenaltho this book was written by booker t washington about his own life, i didnt feel as if his autobiography allowed me to learn much about him as a man... as a person.i am glad it was written as it gives context for an era and a person i can never know about, but this book is more about the chronography of booker t washington's accomplishments rather than who this man was and how he lived.that being said, i still think every american should read this book!"},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"I decided to read this book while on vacation.

Washington (1856-1915) published this autobiography. Born into slavery, after emancipation, Mr. Washington developed a philosophy that African-Americans needed to sweep away the ignorance that their subservient position had left them with, and earn the respect of the whites through hard work and excellence. In 1881 he founded the Tuskegee Institute to teach African-Americans how to study, how to work hard and intelligently (producing better results than the white businesses of the day), and how to have respect for themselves and others. This is Mr. Washington's story of his youth and his success at Tukegee.This is a fascinating and uplifting book. Though cognizant of the racism that often surrounded him, Mr. Washington never lost his faith in the basic goodness of the people of all colors that he met. The only problem I had with this excellent book was the knowledge I could not shake, that Mr. Washington's faith was not rewarded, and the white community of the day would not give the African-American community respect and fair treatment.That said, though, this is a great and wonderful book, which should rightly be considered an American classic.

It was a rewarding experience. Booker T. Washington was a great man born into slavery, into abject poverty, on a plantation in Virginia. He never knew his father or even his birthday. Washington was six or seven years old when the War Between the States ended. He lived in a slave cabin with his mother, his older brother John, his younger brother and sister, and an orphan boy. His mother, the cook for the \\"big house\\" was an illiterate as most slaves were, but a strong woman of common sense who cared for her family as best she could. Their cabin was primitive with a dirt floor no windows and poorly protected from the elements.After the war Booker moved with his mother and step father to West Virginia where he was put to work in the salt mines. Determined to get some schooling he did so at night with great difficulty.Washington heard about a school for Negroes in Virginia called Hampton. He set out on foot with 50 cents in his pocket. He eventually reached Hampton and went to school there working his way through as a janitor.Booker T. Washington met race prejudice, poverty, and illiteracy and overcame all of these obstacles.He went on to establish Tuskegee Institute in Alabama for his people. It educated boys and girls not only in academics but in agriculture and useful trades. He started the school from nothing raising all the money from contributions and the hard work of he and his students. The school still exists today and is thriving.\\"Up From Slavery\\" is an inspiring book.

Washington was a great American.Washington was born into slavery, freedom came when he was about six years old. As a child, he worked at farming and coal mining, while he sought an education. All of this time he lived in base poverty.After saving what little money he could, he set out from his home in West Virginia, for a black school in Virginia. The school was run by a retired Union Army officer, who recognized Washington's ability.Washington worked his way through school, graduated, and headed home to West Virginia to establish a school for blacks. There wasn't much money in it, but his dream was to help his people escape from ignorance and poverty.When the state of Alabama wanted to establish a school for blacks, the Tuskegee Institute, Washington was chosen to run it. His budget was pitiful, and he started teaching school in a dilapidated shanty and a hen house. His students tolerated these conditions, along with grinding poverty, because that's what it took to receive an education.The school always insisted that all students work while they study. They raised crops and animals, made bricks for sale, and built the various buildings which were needed to hold the school's ever expanding population.Money was always short, and Washington had to spend a lot of his time in the North raising funds. He was a talented speaker, and became famous on that account. He eventually formed relationships with a number of wealthy patrons, who provided funds to run and expand the Tuskegee Institute.By the time the book was written, the Institute had 6000 graduates working across the South, and had trained a large number of teachers to educate southern blacks.This book is valuable, both for the information it holds, and for the fine example of Christian love which Washington models."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"For educational pedagogy, for philanthropical courage, for inspiration and motivation on how to be the best person, read this book. Washington overcame enormous odds with intense ambition; he wanted to do his &quot;level best&quot; everyday.I found his story to be the real thing, the real item in...get this...motivational literature. Of all the self-help books published today, Washington's autobiography reads realistic and true for courage, solid advice, and practical solutions.Washington takes the large view to the race problems of his day. He is more concerned with building better human beings, male and female, regardless of race. His strategies with his students involved enforcing basic health care, instilling focused, daily discipline habits, providing vocational and academic training, and always presenting an overreaching concern for helping others achieve their highest potential. THAT is the good life."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"I found the book to be strange in some regards. Professor Washington seemed to harbor no bad feelings toward any Southerner, or even his former owners. That aside, the book is very interesting. His point of view on slavery and Southern race relations are unlike any other I've heard. Regardless of what another review says, he was definately not a selfish person in any way. He only seemed to care about his school and work, not personal life. He states that he doesnt play any games of any sort. Read this book if you want a refreshing view of post-Civil War race relations."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"Up from Slavery, autobiography by Booker T. Washington, is a true classic in African-American literature. Washington opens Chapter 1: \\"A Slave Among Slaves\\" with his vivid recollections as a Negro child growing up in the South: a slave on a plantation in Virginia, a white father he never knew, illiterate and living in horrid conditions. After the emancipation of slaves, Washington's family moves to West Virginia where he labors at the salt furnace and in the coal mines. In his precious few moments of spare time, he learns to read and gains enough confidence to leave everything behind to journey to the Hampton Institute. Later, because of his success at Hampton, he is given the opportunity to start Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. Tuskegee Institute is successful partly due to Washington's extensive travel to the North to solicit funds for the school. The students at Tuskegee, in addition to the day-to-day traditional class work, are expected to learn an industrious trade and to work at mastering that trade. Based on his own life experience, Washington believes that the most prudent way the Negro race will persevere is through this combination of education, hard work and service to others. He believes that the White race will come to appreciate the Negro race only if the Negro people prove their worth to society. Because of his passive stance, many, such as W.E.B. DuBois, et. al., labeled Washington as \\"The Great Accomodator.\\" In other words, accommodating those who were the enslavers instead of advocating for the rights of those who were enslaved. You can get a sense of this in Washington's most notable speech, the address to the Atlanta Cotton States and International Exposition of 1895:\\"The wisest among my race understand that the agitation of questions of social equality is the extremist folly, and that progress in the enjoyment of all the privileges that will come to us must be the result of severe and constant struggle rather than artificial forcing.\\"This speech brought national acclaim to Booker T. Washington and, at the time, placed him in the forefront as one of the leading authorities of his race."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"This book is a fascinating historical account of the atmosphere of America during Reconstruction. The opinions of an ex-slave on matters of racial relations, education, suffrage, and so forth are certainly worth considering in any study of this period. I loved Booker T. Washington's autobiography for this.But I also enjoy this book because it has character. Mr. Washington gives bits of advice on how to be a good public speaker - as he was a speaker of much renown - and this was quite delightful as I have often been somewhat confused by such matters. Add to this his endearing stories of the white and black races, and you have yourself an extremely worthwhile and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"Mr. Washington's book is facinating to me as an American history major. I found that learning from a black man what Reconstruction meant to a lot of former slaves was very enlightening. Mr. Washington offers up a point of view that in many cases, slavery served both black and white people well. The lines between slave owners and the slaves were often blurred; not just due to interracial relations, but socially as well.But, this book is not about slavery. Mr. Washington came from nothing and not only lifted himself up from poverty and ignorance, but determined that his life's work would be to assist others in their own efforts at bettering their lives. I found it terribly ironic that the former slaves, and children thereof, thought that their ultimate goal was to no longer do any kind of manual labor. That is what got this country into trouble. White men relying on others to do their manual labor. Mr. Washington's pragmatic approach to teaching black men and women how to care for themselves and learn a practical trade makes a lot of sense to me.The best parts of this book have to do with Mr. Washington's attitude toward life. His observations and attitudes are so positive and broad, that they are not defined by race. I found myself wanting to highlight and underline parts of the book; but the book I was reading was borrowed. Hence I am going to purchase a copy for myself. I do not buy many books; however, this book is one to keep for life. I am sure to refer to Mr. Washington's book in the future; Not just for historical content, but to keep me on track in life."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"...Up From Slavery Booker T. WashingtonUp From Slavery is an autobiography by Booker Taliaferro Washington. Booker T. Washington was a great man who fought his way out of slavery to become an educator, statesman, and political power. He was born near a crossroads post-office called Hale's Ford, in the year 1858 or 1859. He does not remember the exact year, month or date because it was the time of slavery. He lived in a cabin with his mother, his older brother John and his sister Amanda until after the Civil War when they all were declared free. He does not know any of his history beyond his mother, and less beyond his father. For most of his boyhood life he lived in an old broken down cabin containing no windows and no beds. Almost everyday of his life was occupied by some kind of labor. He had no time for himself or sports. On several occasions he went as far as the schoolhouse door with one of the young mistresses to carry her books. The picture of several dozen boys and girls in a classroom engaged in study had always made a big impression on him. He felt that to get into a schoolhouse and study in the way they did would be about the same as being in paradise. After the slaves were freed there were two points that the blacks throughout the south agreed on: That they must change their names and they must leave the old plantation for at least a few days or weeks to feel sure that they were free. After freedom was declared Booker's stepfather sent for his mother and the whole family to come to the Kanawha Valley, in West Virginia. Booker always had an intense longing to learn to read. When he was young he determined that if he accomplished nothing else in life, he would some way get enough education to enable him to read common books and newspapers. He worked in a coal mine to help pay for his education. He overheard a few people talking about Hampton University it struck his interest. He set many of his goals to go there and get a good education. One teacher that influenced Booker T. Washington was Mrs. Ruffner. She encouraged and sympathized with him in all of his efforts to get an education. While working for her he was allowed one hour a day to go to school. While living with her he began to get his first library together. In 1872 he set out to Hampton Institute a school in West Virginia, he didn't know how much it would cost or where it was. His brother helped him out with the money. When he left his mother was very weak and broken in health he hardly expected to see her again, so parting with her was very hard for him. He had to sleep on the streets because the white would not let him stay in the hotel. He had many interactions like this one. He began working for a captain in a seaport unloading crates. Booker gained his entrance to Hampton Institute by cleaning a room for Miss Mary Mackie, the lady principal. Mr S. Griffths Morgan of New Medford, Mass. from 1872-1876 donated his tuition scholarship. Booker graduated from Hampton Institute in 1875. Booker returned to Hampton Institute and started the night school to aid deserving students. In conclusion this book Up From Slavery is a very well written book. It has many details on the life of Booker T. Washington. I recommend it to young kids who enjoy reading about history and how the slaves were freed."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"Booker T.

Would order from you again."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"Washington was born into slavery as a result of his mother having been raped by her master. This autobiography is a recounting of his struggle from slavery to freedom and on to getting an education and becoming a teacher and then an educational administrator as well as a \\"Black politician.\\"In American culture, this narrative is cast as the quintessential \\"raise yourself by your boot strap\\" kind of story. In fact when I was in the First Grade, I can remember my First grade teacher, Mrs. Pogue, singing the praises of \\"the Great Booker T. Washington.\\"And while there is a great deal to admire about Mr. Washington, there is also a side that only came to light after hearing the other side of his story. Washington was called an \\"accommodationist,\\" \\"or \\"the great compromiser,\\" which in the context of the times were euphemisms for being an \\"Uncle Tom,\\" or the HNIC. He was good at maneuvering his way around in a racist white culture thinking that he was doing his people a great deal of good when in fact he was being taken advantage of, or when he was in fact consciously \\"selling his people out.\\" By making a \\"virtue, out of personal necessity,\\" Washington always had a good justification for his action and eventually became the prototype of this kind of black politician. Many Black preachers still use the Washington template for handling cross-racial situations. Plus how else were blacks to negotiate the difficult racist political terrain of those difficult times?In the book, for instance, he eschews and discourages blacks from seeking a liberal arts education and from attending college, as being frivolous. He argued for the more practical area of the \\"manual arts,\\" and \\"the trades.\\" While this may have been useful -- even good advice -- in the context of the times, there were others of his contemporaries, such as WEB Dubois, who saw Washington's approach as strictly a formulaic kind of Uncle Tomism. And the embarrassing treatment of him at the 1905 World's Fair, kind of sealed this image of him as a Black Uncle Tom by blacks and a \\"stooge\\" by whites.While the book is a good read, in retrospect, it shows Washington to have been very nave politically, and too trusting of \\"the white man,\\" who it seems never quite saw the world as he did and neither had Washington's, nor the black race's best interests in mind. Maybe it is a bit harsh to judge his action after the fact, but all other black leaders are judged by the same criteria and they come out unblemished, while Washington's accommodationist methods do not seem to have held up well over time nor have they bore any fruit.Three Stars"},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"I feel that Washington's book was very much like he was, and that is two-faced. It may have been true that he needed white support in order to get money for blacks but I feel that he didn't tell the story the way it should have been told. Slavery was a lot harsher than Washington wrote it was, this book was too carefree in dealing with the harshness of slavery. He wrote the book for the white man to read so that he could get their support and their money. He was the Benedict Arnold of the black folk."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"I read this book, here in Cear&aacute;, a state of Brazil.Even being an agronomist, I love to read books.This book is 100% available for free reading, on internet.This book was writen about 100 years ago, by an african-american , Booker T. Washington.Born in a slum, having as his mother, a black slave, as a child, Booker T. Washington became free.His father was a white man, and never recognized or create him.In fact, Booker T. Washington had a bitter childhood.Having a childhood cored in poverty, racism, prejudices, ignorance and hard labor; instead of becaming a neurotic, Booker T. Washington became a leader and teaching example for african-americans of his times.In fact many lessons of this book continuos to be usefull for every time, race or place.If you go to all my reviews that I writen before, just one autobiography that I gave five stars was, \\"World of Yesterday\\" by Stephan Zweig.To be sincere in an autobiography is very, very rare.One problem of this autobiography, is again his lack of sincerity.The author was writing about 100 years ago, and perhaps he couldn't tells us, what he was really thinking.To example, Booker T. never claims that segregation, racism/eugenics is/were by definition, bad.In fact, there's many good claims to some knowed eugenicists/racists at that times.The bitter author's childhood (a nightmare childhood), has very little space in this book.In fact, the sucess of Booker T. in education affairs has, big space in this book.Too much space, I think.If we were in 1906, I'll be giving five stars to this book.Being unsincere and having by today standards, some absurds, this book isn't useless, but we aren't in 1906."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"I read Up From Slavery in an African American Lit class, and was totally applauled by it.

The debate between Washington and WEB DuBois is famous: Wash. wanted black people to forgive and forget and continue to be the southerners work dogs. DuBois wanted the negro race to embrace higher education and follow in the footsteps of wealthy Americans like Rockefeller and Carnegie. Which plan was better for uplifting a race? It depends upon which direction the country was going at the turn of the century."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"I thought this was supposed to be an autobiography!

Two thirds of the book is telling about the school he opened, briefly mentioning his personal or home life."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"This book is hard to get into at first because Washington, in my opinion, isn't the greatest writer. He writes using many run-on sentences and MANY, MANY commas with phrases that can distract you from the meaning of the sentence (as a rule, notwithstanding, to such an extent, this is to say etc...) he seems to state his observations as if it is a fact. He tells how there were such great relations between blacks &amp; whites throughout the south and blacks held ABSOLUTELY NO resentment towards their slaveowners. I found that hard to believe (how would he know when he was just a slave?) Many of his &quot;facts&quot; didn't seem to agree with history and what I thought slavery and black/white relations were like. He almost seemed ignorant to what was probably happening around him. He goes on to tell about his life and spends at least 1/2 of the book talking about his school in Tuskegee...after a while it gets boring and you want to hear some interesting stories about HIM! I didn't think the book was too great or very informative at all."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"I read this book as a part of a class. In this class we discussed Washington's work as written from the 'trickster' perspective. In this light it was quite interesting to see how he points out hypocrasies indirectly, while apparently stating the opposite. Thus, creating a self-aware hypocrasy within the text itself.

As I continued to read I began to feel even more pride in the achievments on my grandfather, mother and myself. The only thing that puzzled me was the consitent mentioning of how the southern whites were so helpful in the rise and start of the negro's education. Personally the stories I have heard speak to the oppisdit actions and I am lead to ask the question - if the was such a united feeling amoungsdt the blacks and the whites in the northen and southern states addressing the education of the negro race then where on earth did it start to go wrong?

There are few places in the South now where public sentiment would permit such organizations to exist.'Of course, a hundred years later the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacist organizations are alive and well in the U.S.I was surprised to discover that this book - although published in 1901 - employs British (rather than American) spellings for words such as &quot;labour&quot; (labor) and &quot;colour&quot; (color).This is an important document of its time that must be read by anyone with the mildest interest in world history and the human condition that shapes it."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"This book provides a snapshot of the world of the US at one of it's most exciting times. The end of the 19th century was the &quot;Progressive Era&quot; when people came together and formed groups and associations that are still with us today. His metaphor of dipping into the cool clear water in which we are sailing for the human resources to build society is as true today as in 1890. His statement that the most pressing problem in America was for rich and poor to understand how each contributes to the whole and to learn to value each other is also timely.Besides the fascinating historical perspective of the thinking of the time, there is the insight provided by Booker T. Washington himself. His adulation of labor is reminisint of Kahil Gibran in &quot;The Prophet.&quot; The most repeated idea in the book is that any person that adds to the economic well being and comfort of their community will be sought out and cherished and that race has nothing to do with it. Coming from a person who started with so much less (he was a slave) that most of us have today and really practicing what he believed makes him someone that we all can admire. To put it in less academic terms, this is a book about an incredibly beautiful person that made me think deeply about myself and the world I live in."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"This book reminds us of the great truth, that hard work will always in the end be rewarded.

The more I study and learn about him, the more impressed I am with his vision, his integrity, and his drive to improve his people and their lot in life."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"Booker T. Washington had every reason to complain and be resentful. He was born a slave, and although national manumission occurred while he was still a boy, very few opportunities offered themselves to the newly emancipated. He fought against the odds to get an education and while he was away at school, his beloved mother died. His biological father was a slave owner who never expressed any interest in his son's life. When he was asked to be headmaster of the Tuskegee Institute, he found himself faced with empty land in a poverty-stricken area. Married three times, his first two wives died very young. His first spouse left him a single father with a young child, and the second time he faced widowhood he had three small children to raise all by himself.He could certainly have cursed fate and just given up; in stead his autobiography is the work of an unspeakably grateful and patriotic American. Washington could not find enough good things to say about nearly everyone he encountered in life or the country he felt blessed to call his home. He worked very, very hard and success followed all his endeavors. Rather than boast of his many accomplishments, he seemed to feel unworthy of the nationwide respect he earned. He humbly described his friendships with Presidents Grover Cleveland and William McKinley, talked of his constantly sought after speeches throughout the United States and Europe, and detailed his phenomenal money-raising skills that brought the Tuskegee Institute up from a converted hen-house to a campus of over 40 buildings.Throughout all his trials and successes, he constantly advocated forgiveness, humility, and gratitude. Not only did he recommend these three virtues, he lived a life that embodied them. Perhaps that's why a person born with no realistic chance at getting ahead, died one of the most admired and well-known individuals of his day."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"The author was highly instrumental in bringing this process about. He was educated and completed his schooling at the 'Hampton' school with honors. He then built and directed the 'Tuskegee' school in Alabama, and devoted his whole life to service. While this book was very informative, and is considered a milestone by a true pioneer, it is a little bit monotonous, thus THREE stars. I would highly recommend it nevertheless. Many of the thoughts, attitudes, and sayings of Booker T. Washington have been used by modern authors and speakers, and will live forever. Our country and the black race are forever in his debt for the legacy he left behind. I certainly feel better about life after reading this book.

This book needs to be required reading for all high school and college students!"},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"The legacy of Booker T. Washington incontestably stands alongside other great Americans. Washington created the Tuskegee Institute to promote the education of his people who had only recently been emancipated from slavery. Much of it was literally built by his hands and those of his charges.In so doing they could take ownership and pride of their creation. Washington raises labor from its inferior status to a place of honor. He blames the institution of slavery for distorting the dignity of labor because it \\"took the spirit of self-reliance and self-help out of the white people. My old master had many boys and girls, but not one, so far as I know, ever mastered a single trade or special line of productive industry.\\" Everything was left to the slaves. As a consequence, the slave owners \\"unconsciously had imbibed the feeling that manual labour was not the proper thing for them. On the other hand, the slaves, in many cases, had mastered some handicraft, and none were ashamed, and few unwilling, to labour.\\"Paul Lawrence Dunbar, one of the great poets of the Harlem Renaissance, expressed some discordant opinions regarding this autobiography of one of America's most influential blacks. His tone is respectful, recognizing that, after all, Booker T. Washington created Tuskegee Institute.Dunbar echoed the resentment felt by blacks who felt betrayed by Washington's accommodating stance with the powerful men of his time. Indeed, there is something of the sell-out in his nave belief that \\"the time will come when the Negro in the South will be accorded all the political rights which his ability, character, and material possessions entitle him to . . . the opportunity to freely exercise such political rights will not come in any large degree through outside or artificial forcing, but will be accorded to the Negro by the Southern white people themselves, and that they will protect him in the exercise of those rights.\\"Fifty years later, it was painfully evident that this had not come to pass, nor would without an organized movement to force the issue.For all the criticism he has received, it should never be forgotten that he walked a precarious tightrope. On the one side he had to be painfully aware of the injustices of his own people. On the other, the need of funding meant that he needed to be far more circumspect in his criticism to promote educational opportunities for his aggrieved students.We have the benefit of hindsight. Cut him some slack. He did far more under the circumstances than a lesser man could."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"Booker T. Washington: once a slave, beat down and told he could do nothing, accomplish nothing; now an example to all men, white and colored, raised above others. Why? Hard work and a desire to do good in this world. He accomplished more than a lot, from getting into a school by sweeping and cleaning a room, to teaching at a night school, to starting Tuskegee, to speaking at huge events at which no black man had ever spoken. He met great men, did great things, built a great community, and loved greatly.He wrote this autobiography about his truly great life. He wrote it simply, giving facts in a very interesting way (one thing that he felt was important while giving speeches). I had a hard time staying interested because I was very busy while reading it and felt like I had to rush to get it done. However, I liked it enough to know that I'll read it again in a less-busy time and really immerse myself in it. There's so much to learn, so much to discover in a life like Washington's. While reading it I couldn't help but be thankful for everything in my life. I was born with many luxuries given to me. Booker T. Washington started out with the clothes on his back and a dirt floor to sleep on. Education was a piece of paradise to him; food was a luxury beyond all comparison. I have always had both of those, in abundance.One word to describe this book would be thankful. Not the word I would normally use to describe a book, but really, it is. Booker T. Washington's thanks resonates throughout the whole story. Even when he was hungry and on the streets - I could almost taste his thanks whenever he'd receive a meal or a warm place to stay.Wonderful.

Great for doing a book report."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"I read this some time ago, combined with The Souls of Black Folk and The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man. Up From Slavery was the warm-up, I guess, since it was the least offensive. Of course one reader's \\"least offensive\\" is another reader's \\"Uncle Tom\\". However one can't fairly judge someone from that era using the criteria from the modern time- a fairly simple principle that is too easily forgotten.With that out of the way, let me say that as a southern kid in the late 60's reading this book I was tremendously inspired. We were hardly that far removed from Jim Crow, at least in years, so I think I was able to grasp a little of the obstacles Washington overcame. Still this is less a story of race than a story of faith, of vision, of the triumph of hard work, and the triumphs both in spite of as well as because of his fellow man.The history in not too debatable, as it is an auto-biography. By definition thus the history of the author, and this becomes one of the strengths of the books- the common sense, no-nonsense love of life thatcauses BTW to continually break through to the other side, and bring the reader with him. By the end of the book I wanted to start a college (as he did) and help my fellow man up from poverty any way I could. To not marvel at his accomplishments and to denigrate him with labels out of time is to do great injustice to the man, his relationship with God, and to his incredible achievements.To sum: it is inspiring and real, and it gives a glimpse into some of the peculiar hardships resulting from the peculiar institution, but the process is almost the polar opposite of the victimhood route of today- from someone who could most justifiably have claimed himself such a victim."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"When I bought this book I was expecting the classic reprint of the book.

Thank you."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"\\"Up from Slavery\\" is an excellent insight into the life of Booker Taliaferro Washington, and his life-long desire to better himself as well as both the black and white people of the South. This autobiography begins with Mr. Washington's childhood where he grew up as a slave, and continues throughout his adult life. Hard work is something that Mr. Washington believed in, and he felt it was essential that all students of the Tuskegee Institute must embrace.One of the things that struck me the most about this story was Mr. Washington's philosophy on how the black man could better his station in life. It wasn't through handouts or welfare, but by believing \\"The individual who can do something that the world wants done will, in the end, make his way regardless of race.\\" The story includes numerous examples of how Tuskegee students would do things (e.g., making bricks, efficiently growing vegetables, etc.) that would bring them respect and recognition in the community.One other thing I really liked was Mr. Washington's belief in teaching students how to be an overall better person. This includes everything from dental hygiene to hard work and it also focused on the moral aspects of being a good person developed through Christian principals."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"The life story of Booker T. Washington was uplifting and inspiring. This shows that a person can arise from the ashes of their life, and make something worthwhile of themselves. Being born a slave was a major set back in their lives. Booker was determined to received and education at any cost, and he succeeded. Nothing was handed to him. Hard work and perserverance was the only way he could accomplish his goals.Through turbalent times after the Civil War, Booker united the white and black race. Together they worked to build one of the finest educational institution in the south-Tuskegee, renamed Tuskegee University."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"Booker Taliaferro Washington was perhaps foremost in what he called \\"bringing up the black race\\". He did perhaps more than Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Jr., and W.E.B. DuBois ever did. Why? Because Washington did it softly, humbly, and quietly. The other black leaders attempted revolution and immediate change - both led to violence. Booker T. Washington's methods led to slow, but sure and sweeping change. He sought reform, not revolution. His life is clearly an example of Christian piety and firm faith in God. These two things also set his work apart as more successful than any other black leader. Perhaps modern black leaders should re-evaluate their philosophies for change based upon this great leader's model."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"I greatly enjoyed this book! I admire Booker T. Washington for his endless pursuit of education. This book is a great inspiration to any student. The only thing that I was disappointed with was the fact that Mr. Washington did not get into his personal or family life. I agree that school can change a person, And I believe that education can greatly shape who a person is, but I don't belive that education is the only thing that molds us. I would have loved to find out as much about Mr. Washington's private life as I learned about his schooling, and his work for schools. Despite all this, I think this book is wonderful. If you know a high school student, or college student, give this book to them as a gift. It is a good read."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"I have read this book over and over. We, certainly the entire world, have been given a resource(s) with Washington along with WEB Dubois. A check and balance regarding African Americans and the &quot;making of America.&quot;In my opinion, one must read DuBois when reading Washington.That's the check and balance.Up ... may reveal that these same attitudes and beliefs are still true of some African Amercans today. However, DuBois' counter better reflects the attitude, I beleive, of the majority of African AMercans. DuBois classic piece of work shows how, though they were physical &quot;slaves&quot; , they were free mentally, and some dared to dream, fight, and speak out even in the face of death. Oh how wonderful to know your history versus having others to tell you their side of your history.So, my response to this classic is to counter it with DuBois. Then, it can be better understood in the period in which it was written.African Americans have so much to be proud of, in spite of .... Still. what a better place this world called America would be if all people were respected and given the kinds of opportunities that America has to offer.What a classic. In countering this classic with DuBois, history definitely shows me that the old saying that all Blacks think alike is certainly nottrue. Not then, not now. Reading Washington alone, is just getting a glimpse of only half the era.Three Negro Classics- which includes DuBois and Up ... should be requried reading for all of education and educators- K-docotorate, law, medicine, etc., period.Now, that's telling the whole story!!!!!"},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"A lot of things have been said and written concerning Booker Taliaferro Washington's book, \\"Up From Slavery\\". Some were hot, and some were cold. But one focus that unites all the varying opinions is that every critic or reviewer agreed that the book is superb. Also, most people acknowledged that Booker T. was a distinguished scholar (despite the overwhelming odds that weighed him down).However, one big fact that most reviewers of this work have consistently overlooked is the circumstances that surrounded both the book and its writer. In order to have an accurate perspective of this book, we must not fail to evaluate what life was like for Booker T. After all, the book in question is his autobiography: written in a country where he was born and nurtured as a slave, before becoming a freeman whose basic human rights were consistently denied.One fact that pops up in this regard is that Mr. Washington was never free in the real sense of the word. The type of freedom a typical Black American enjoys today was an unseen luxury throughout Booker T's life: (1856-1915).In the same period, the life expectancy of an average Black American was less than half of what it is today. This was not because the folks then were all HIV-positive, but simply because any White man could barbecue a Black man right on the street and nothing would happen.That Booker T. chose not to criticize the grievous atrocities that the ubiquitous racists meted on American Negroes is understandable. It was not a matter of choice per se, rather, the swain wanted to stay alive. He understood his environment well, and had a first-class knowledge of how racist America worked. Again, it is only a dummy who wouldn't know that the (first) publisher of \\"Up From Slavery\\" wouldn't have considered the manuscript if it contained anything that will embarrass or infuriate White America. And, Booker T. Washington might be made to pay a ghastly price for authoring an \\"offensive write-up\\". We must not forget that this book was written a century ago: when \\"freedom\\" and \\"justice\\" were very different from what it is today. In those days, many \\"critical\\" Black-oriented manuscripts ended-up in dustbins; and their authors were vilified and hunted down.Today's critics who relax in comfortable armchairs and bellow that this book \\"lacked depth\\" in this way and that way, weren't born as Booker T. was; and I forgive them each time they use that word: 'slavery', in vain. Booker T. died in 1915, and history will always attest that Black Americans continued to struggle for freedom more than fifty years after his death.An old adage has it that: 'A word is enough for the wise'. Thus, I will like to end my comments here. \\"Up From Slavery\\" is a very fine book. It is small: less than 250 pages. Hence, I don't need to review or analyze it with a thousand pages. Mr. Booker T. Washington did his best: given the insurmountable circumstances that surrounded his world."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"This is a must read for anyone interested in early American history."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"The social confines of race are a self-imposed form of slavery, figurative bonds which may be loosed only through the merit of magnanimous work. Much has been discussed in recent years about the topics of racial equality, minority education, and our national history regarding members of the African-American race. It cannot be denied that a great injustice has been served this particular ethnic group, but the future is each citizen's responsibility, black and white alike. Booker T. Washington's reflective memoir, \\"Up From Slavery\\" positively affirms the virtues of equal parts work and study for a mutually successful society, race notwithstanding. As an autobiography chronicling Washington's humble beginnings in Confederate West Virginia among illiterate slaves to Boston society appealing to the socially prominent, \\"Up From Slavery\\" offers a contemporary view on race relations and the human condition. The narrative details Washington's childhood, contrasting the degrees of educational prosperity, domestic sanitation, and religious liberty with the unalienable provisions of slave owners. Washington illuminates the process of ascertaining an education against all odds, laboring in coalmines to afford night school, teaching eager black students, and finally dedicating his life's work to the renowned Tuskegee Institute. Rather tedious in these recollections, the book's plot is unnecessarily laden with exhaustive details and lacks depth in historical perspective. Given the time period in which it was written, there is margin for error in hypothetical suggestions for ethnic culmination, theorizing equal opportunities that did not materialize until seven decades later with desegregation. Individual statements are debatable, such as Washington's idealistic perspective on racial harmony being a non-issue directly after the Civil War, which seems highly unlikely given the past hundred years of civil rights conflict. Explaining the process of rising above local circumstances is the plot's best feature flowing smoothly into a chronological process, specific and concise. It plainly states the South's oppressive environment without delving into racial sympathy, lending remarkable strength. Written with commendable intentions, undue criticism of the white majority is withheld, replaced by cautious optimism and a hopeful spirit. The plot in general follows a logical sequence highlighting one man's endeavors to strive for a better life in impoverished circumstances and his inspiration to freed slaves. Typical of memoirs, the autobiography's focal point is Booker T. Washington's personal account and unique perspective. While other characters are not specifically elaborated, Washington is quick to credit his teachers, mentors, and benefactors in gracious tribute. Their admirable attributes are illuminated in model exemplification, deliberately but briefly identified. Not presenting thoroughly interesting characters for lack of breadth, the reader is focused on Washington himself rather than other outstanding individuals. His personal beliefs are well defined, confided in a trusting tone. Instead of feeling familiar with a cast of literary icons, the reader is acquainted with the author's own integrity and moral fiber. The main character is a sound representation of autobiographical focus, developed, interesting, and personal. In spite of race and social position, hard work employs utmost application in striving to reach full potential and earnest effort begets its own reward. \\"The man who can do something that the world wants done will in the end make his way regardless of race My experience is that there is something in human nature which always makes an individual recognize and reward merit, no matter under what colour of skin merit is found.\\" Washington introduces his commentary on physical labor's role in mental preparation with that solid statement, proven true the world over. People are generally more alike than different, united in faith, hope and love, set to the same toil with the same ultimate goal. \\"Up From Slavery\\" \`s central theme corresponds with reality's unprejudiced outcome of individual prosperity through rigorous application. In a progressive attempt to improve society, citizens are bound not by the iron chains of a ruling majority's tyranny but a communal commitment to self-improvement. Although borders, language and culture differentiate ethnic civilizations, their people endeavor for the same fundamental mores. Education, religion, freedom, and a reasonable level of personal satisfaction are sought by all races. Black and white, Asian and Latin American. Catholic, and Jewish, Buddhist and Baptist. English and Spanish, Mandarin and Ebonics. Beneath any layer of flesh, colored or pale, blood runs red as slavery's symbolic rose. People share their humanity if not their race, undivided for the betterment of our society through collective ability. The continuing popularity of Booker T. Washington's \\"Up From Slavery\\" originally published in 1903 has fostered universal awareness for nearly one person at a time by appealing to the heart, the mind, and the common human soul. When an individual improves his mind, converges the efforts of bodily work and recognizes the plight of fellow human beings, his life is changed. The world glows with the amber of hope for a united future, one person at a time."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"One of the most inspiring books I've read.

Washington has always been a figure that history teachers use, in my opinion, to support the so-called &quot;Good&quot; African-Americans. In other words, those who don't cause trouble. &quot;Up From Slavery&quot; displays this side of Mr. Washington. This book is worth reading because of Booker's determination that allowed him to rise above his former conditions. Yet, one can't help but get the feeling that he is all-to-ready to forget what has happened to him. Booker continues to explain, rather naively, in my opinion, how racism is to soon be erased. I feel it's unfortunate how things later came to contradict his predicitons, but he is foolishly optimistic. Overall, &quot;Up From Slavery&quot; is a decent book, but occasionally tedious."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"Booker T. Washington wrote a lively narrative of his life that deserves our attention today. The first couple of pages are startling for the nonchalant way he relates that he doesn't know the year of his birth, nor the exact location, nor with certainty who his father was. He does, on the other hand, describe the tiny dimensions to the cabin where he lived and what life was like for the slaves. Washington went on from these humble beginnings to a fine education and a life of meritoriously helping fellow negroes to improve their education and vocational endeavors.

This book details the triumphant acts of Booker T. Washington's efforts to not only develop the famous Tuskegee Institute, but to positively build bridges with America. A former slave who became a self taught, political mastermind came from the worst of what humanity had to offer to meeting and influencing American Presidents. What an honor it would have been to meet a man who provided so much to the African American man and woman. He was also willing and often did help southern whites in his community. It's ashame that in America, where education is offered legally, there is a 50% dropout rate among African American high school students.

A previous book I reviewed made me curious about how the black slaves in the south lived before their emancipation. This book satisfied my curiosity. More than saying that, I find it is difficult to review this book. Simply put, Mr. Washington tells you about his life and in so doing tells you about himself and the principles he lived by. I feel there are valuable lessons to be learned here. I'll just take two quotes, \\"...the thing to do, when one feels sure that he has said or done the right thing, and is condemned, is to stand still and keep quiet. If he is right, time will show it.\\" I believe Jesus sent the same message. I heard that the great scientist, Robert J Oppenheimer, became depressed after being condemned as a Communist. If so, I guess he hadn't learned this lesson. The second, \\"Few things help an individual more than to place responsibility upon him, and to let him know that you trust him.\\" This was illustrated over and over again in the book. Other great men have also said this, but if it has been heard by most people, in the workplace and at home, it is ignored so much of the time. This book is inspiring. I wish all young people would read it and heed it; then this would be a better world."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"Up From Slavery is the classic autobiography of Booker T. Washington. Washington gives an interesting, alternative perspective regarding slavery and slave owners. This is what Mr. Washington stated regarding his boyhood owners: \\"My life had its beginnings in the midst of the most miserable, desolate, and discouraging surroundings. This was so, however, not because my owners were especially cruel, for they were not, as compared with many others...........One may get the idea, from what I have said, that there was a bitter feeling toward the white people on the part of my race, because of the fact that most of the white population was away fighting in a war which would result in keeping the Negro in slavery if the South was successful. In the case of the slaves on our place this was not true, and it was not true of any large portion of the slave population in the South where the Negro was treated with anything like decency.\\"Washington is here saying that although many slaves were mistreated by their owners, many were treated relatively well.Not only does Mr. Washington offer an interesting perspective on slavery, he was an early black educator. Washington believed that black people should have no privileges because of their color. He believed that it was the fault of the black man if he did not succeed and it was not because of the white man. He urged the people of his race to work for their living and not depend on others for help. When times were the very hardest for the black people, Washington helped lift them up and get them on their feet. He founded Tuskegee Institute in Tuskegee, Alabama. This school began as a small night-school for black people. Washington build a fine institution for the black race by the sweat of his brow.Booker T. Washington did not view his race as mistreated victims, instead he took a great amount of pride in the black race and wanted others to understand what a privilege it was to be a part of it, as this quote seems to indicate:\\"From any point of view, I had rather be what I am, a member of the Negro race, than be able to claim membership with the most favoured of any other race.....This I have said here, not to call attention to myself as an individual, but to the race to which I am proud to belong.\\"Booker T. Washington's Up From Slavery is an American classic. It is the true life story of a little slave boy who grew up to become one of the finest leaders for his race."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"Booker T.

I loved it and have since bought 6 books to give as gifts."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"Booker T. Washington was born in slavery, and he describes the first seven years of his life as a slave in enough detail to raise the hairs on your neck. Suddenly emancipated after the Civil War, his life saw no improvement until he finally made his way, broke at times, to the Hampton Institute -- which changed his life.Others have mentioned his work ethic. He had one of the strongest work ethics ever seen in a human being. He graduated from Hampton with flying colors, and was subsequently chosen to found the Tuskegee Institute. On Day One, that amounted to a shanty next to a church. (!)Washington's message, repeated over and over, was \\"learn a useful trade.\\" As he correctly reasoned, human nature being what it is, if you are the best blacksmith, brick maker, or furniture maker in your community, your community is going to respect you and want to keep you.In the year 2012, this advice strikes me as eerily prescient. Certainly it's excellent advice for the American underclass, but suddenly -- with the explosive bubble in college charges -- it's beginning to make sense to a lot of Americans, whether they be black, white, or magenta. Which is the better path? Skip college and qualify as a first-rate plumber, electrician, carpenter etc. -- or go to college and wind up unemployed with $100,000 in student debt?There's a lot more in this book! It's an excellent portrait of America in the late 19th century, and it will surprise you at many turns."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"I devoured this book on my newly purchased Kindle! I'm a Southern African American woman who can identify with so much of what was written. Our communities are in need of men of Booker T's caliber.I loved his description of life as a slave and then as a free man...his expositions on the virtues of the tooth brush and bathing...describing what it was like to sleep in a bed with two sheets...how to get along with Southern Whites and further the cause of the Black community.I can see how folks have pegged him as an 'Uncle Tom,' because of the tone taken in the book; almost too forgiving considering what he's been through. Nonetheless, I value his perspective, because in the end one cannot realistically expect to excel among those you bash every chance you get, even if the bashing is well deserved.I appreciate his repetitive statements on work. In this regard, it seems that things might be worse in today's society with modern advances possibly adding to the laziness--poor work ethic--spiteful attitude toward work exhibited by some folks regardless of race. We still have a ways to go. Book sense and manual (I'd add computer/technological) labor can still take us further as a race.Lastly, he spoke out against injustices in a tactful way that built bridges rather than destroyed them. I can dig that.Overall, this was a great read! A great start to my kindle love affair! :)"},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"This book has opened my eyes to the socialization of the so called \\"Negro \\".

He was simply another unfortunate victim of the institution which the Nation unhappily had engrafted upon it at that time. - Booker T. Washington's Up From Slavery (Chapter 1)Booker T. Washington gives us all the blueprint for how an African man can succeed in the American system. He must forgive any person in power who wrongs him, his family, and/or his community. In the 21st century the African man must perform more acts than forgiveness. He must: erase the bass from his voice, tighten his lips and the rest of his body to minimize African features, show hatred of African people or an indifference to their suffering. If an African man shows any of the attitudes mentioned or a combination of those attitudes, he will succeed in the current American system.

I was fascinated and inspired by Washington's quiet and humble manner as he describes what it was like to be a slave as a youth. Washington traces his struggle for an education, and his later challenges and trials as an educator. His account of the building and molding of the Tuskeegee Institute is one of the most inspiring stories I have read in years. Washington did not want to have anything handed to him. He wanted to earn every goal he set for himself, and earn them he did. His influence was and continues to be incredible.

Washington. I could easily recall reading about him in US history. Interested, I decided to buy it.. Well I ended up staying up all night reading this book... Washington entails his life story of endeavers and prosperity gained. He describes of how he raised himself up from slavery through sacrifices and struggles. With the self-reward of obtaining education he decided to develope the Tuskegee Institution to help further educate his peoples. As well he established a bond between, not only blacks and whites, but southerners and northerners (during post-civil war times). He talks on how as people, one should educate themselves not only in books but in labor as well. In doing so, one will achieve full-on success. &quot;Up from Slavery&quot; enlightened me so much more on Washington. I have gained an enormous amount of respect for this intriguingly compelling man. I really do feel a great sensation of pride in our history when I think about Washington and his achievements for this nation. Beautiful."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"This is an excellent book. I am amazed by the insight and intelligence of Mr. Washington. He created a very powerful legacy. The autobiography shows the desire, of a man fresh from slavery, to succeed and in turn help others do the same. Many of his thoughts are applicable today. Throughout the book, he emphasizes the need to use one's talents and abilities to increase prosperity for not only the current generation but also for the next one. This is a necessary read for anyone desiring success and especially for those that find success in mediocrity."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"If you feel like you have it bad and life has passed you by.... READ THIS BOOK! I usually avoid biographies and autobiographies because they often seem to boast and be egotistic. Booker T. Washington did not strike me as a selfish individual. His whole life centered around education (life-long learning). Think about what a wonderful world we would have if children (and adults) followed this concept. The majority of people never open a book (non-fiction) after they leave school! I have had a solid determination for the past four or five years, to improve my life through books and tapes, and I feel as though I've found my true calling in life... learning! This book is primarily about raising the black race from being enslaved to an educated and highly skilled race. The author was highly instrumental in bringing this process about. He was educated and completed his schooling at the 'Hampton' school with honors. He then built and directed the 'Tuskegee' school in Alabama, and devoted his whole life to service. While this book was very informative, and is considered a milestone by a true pioneer, it is a little bit monotonous, thus four stars. I would highly recommend it nevertheless. Many of the thoughts, attitudes, and sayings of Booker T. Washington have been used by modern authors and speakers, and will live forever. Our country and the black race are forever in his debt for the legacy he left behind. I certainly feel better about life after reading this book. You will too."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"Alina Stanton Nov.15Up From SlaveryThe author of this book is Booker T. Washington. This book is about Booker T Washington. It's an autobiography of how he grew up as a slave and as a free man. It shows the struggles that a lot of poor slaves had when they were freed from slavery.When Booker was young he lived with his mom on one plantation, his dad lived on another. He lived with his mom, half brother, half sister and step dad. Booker really wanted an education, so he started to teach himself to read. He had an English dictionary that emphasized on the alphabet and he read it all the time. Soon the slaves were freed. Booker started going to a day school once it opened up. He was not able to go to school later on because he had to work in a coal mine with his dad. He made a deal with his dad to work on the coalmines early in the morning till nine then goes to school. When he was a little older he decided to go to a school called Hampton Institute in West Virginia. You can live there and work as well as go to school.While he lived there he had to work hard. He had to make money all the ways he could. He worked as a waitress a maid and a janitor. He met a general by the name of Armstrong. He respected this man a lot because he was very important. Booker felt honored to meet such a wealthy man, he liked the general a lot because he was very kind. General Armstrong gave Booker a personal check, which he had been saving for his own use, to help Tuskegee. That summer after his first year in the institute he had to work to pay off a sixteen-dollar debt. His mother died during the summer, he knew that he would never see her again. He graduated that year and then went to teach at the school that he attended when he was a boy. In 1878 he entered Wayland Seminary in Washington D.C. for a year of study. While he was there he made speeches in West Virginia for General Garfields presidency campaign. He graduated first class in Tuskegee in 1885.In my opinion, this is a descent book. It shows how the poor slaves grew up in a white world and how they struggled. It has a lot of information on Bookers life and how he struggled to make a good living and get a good education. I think Booker T. Washington is a well mannered, honorable man."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography","review":"As a 21st century African American, I must take issue with Mr. Washington's statement regarding how in all things social we can be totally seperate and unequal.Even though I can understand the practicality and expediency of making that sort of concession At That Time in history I still must question whether or not a statement such as that is a representation of true liberty and justice for all. In my mind it is not. It wasn't true then and it still isn't true today.Despite the tremendous Economic strides that have been made by people of color globally and particularly in the U.S., thanks in no small part to the efforts of great people like Mr. Washington, the society at large has remained very stratified. Attitudes though much improved have largely remained the same. Statements like the esteemed Mr. Washington's have too often served to dismiss the responsibility of offenders to remedy past wrongs which still have impact in the present day. They also serve to deny true equality of opportunity to all citizens. It also accomodates the offenders far greater than is deserved and does grave injustice to black and white alike. Mr. Washington makes reference himself to how injustices done to the black populace are just as injurious to the white population. Yet he does not view social seperatism as an injustice. With that I must take issue.All that notwithstanding it is an interesting, informative, and enjoyable read. Many of the principles by which he lived are as true today as they were during Reconstruction. However, certain opinions that he expressed could have the effect of limiting economic opportunity by confining Blacks to the ranks of laborers rather than entrepreneurs, managers, and other professionals if too stringently adhered to. These pursuits require concentrated study and effort by themselves.So read it but be sure to place it in the proper context."},{"Title":"Workbook/Lab Manual Part B to accompany Dos mundos","review":"I purchased this book thinking it was the one for the work I am currently doing.

These stories seek to explain and understand the repressed, often depraved, desires each of us have hidden deep down in the blackest regions of our soul. The theme of female sexuality, with its power to manipulate, over-power, and seduce is also apparent in his many femme fatale characters.

It was a lovely affair by all accounts, but there is one thing in particular that we will always remember, and that I suspect everyone else in attendance will always remember as well: the toast by the best man. The best man was a rather nondescript looking man in his mid-30s. Even now, I couldn't tell you what he looked like other than to say he was about 5'10&quot; and had curly hair; he may have had glasses. When we were all gathered in the banquet room, he took the microphone and began to speak. And, for the next 10 minutes or more, he held us all in the palm of his hands like I've never seen before in my life. He was charming, he was witty (he told one joke about how the groom once claimed to like to brush up on his Spanish by watching CSPAN), he was self-deprecating, he paused at the right moments and for exactly the right length of time. He was, simply, brilliant. Then, when he had us laughing loud and long, when no one dared to move because they might miss something he said, he pulled the carpet out from us like a magician and ended with such a sweet and touching comment that left most people in tears. It was stunning, absolutely stunning, and he clearly understood that by making us laugh at first he was softening us up for the good stuff later. As soon as he was done, he was mobbed like some kind of pop star. I've never seen anything like it before, particularly at a wedding. Everyone had to talk to him. We asked who he was, and got a number of answers: he was Mike Kun, the groom's brother; he was some hot young trial lawyer; and, finally, someone said, &quot;He's the best writer you'll ever meet, but he doesn't write anymore.&quot; My wife was too nervous to talk with him, but I grabbed his ear for about 5 minutes and left wishing I had a daughter to introduce him to. He's a remarkable young man, as I've since confirmed by reading &quot;A Thousand Benjamins,&quot; his first novel. I've recently learned that he in fact hasn't stopped writing, and a new book called &quot;The Locklear Letters&quot; will be out shortly. I understand it's something of a comedy. If it's half as charming as his best man's toast, I'll bet it'll be a bestseller."},{"Title":"A Thousand Benjamins","review":"I was just checking in to see if Mike had written a new book when I read the last two e-mails.

Anytime you tried to get him to speed up, he'd say the same thing -- &quot;I've got some pretty precious cargo with me&quot; -- then, when you smiled, he'd pretend he wasn't talking about you, but about something in his trunk. But I'd heard the rumor about the car accident, too. In fact, we here in Baltimore have heard a lot of rumors about Mike since he disappeared a few years ago, most of which aren't even remotely plausible. Died of a drug overdose? Yeah, right -- Mike doesn't even drink. Died in a mountain-climbing accident? Mike wouldn't go mountain climbing for a million dollars -- afraid of heights, don't you know. Drowned on a vacation? Well, I guess that could happen to anyone, but we would've heard about it. And that rumor about him dating Jewel? Are you on crack? Sure, she looks like the kind of girl Mike would date, but have you read Jewel's poetry? The truth of the matter is that Mike wrote two great books -- A Thousand Benjamins and Our Poor Sweet Napoleon -- then stopped writing. He won't talk about it, but he had his heart broken by a girl he went to law school with and just lost the desire to write. Don't remember her name, but she's one stupid chick. Maybe he'll write another book someday, which is why I check this website every once in a while, but I wouldn't bet on it.

Sad, funny, sweet, well-written. Not sure I see the comparisons to J.D. Salinger, but that's not a bad thing. Already looking forward to his next book."},{"Title":"A Thousand Benjamins","review":"I was very sad to read about Michael Kun's death. I actually met him about 10 years ago in Powell's bookstore in Portland. I had probably finished reading his book about 2 months earlier, and it was still very fresh on my mind -- that's the kind of book it is, the kind that stays with you. So, I was in Powell's, and I saw this guy I recognized looking at John O'Hara books. It took me a couple minutes before I realized that it was Michael Kun. I caught my breath, got my courage up, then introduced myself. He couldn't have been nicer. This might have been the sweetest, funniest man who ever walked the earth. He was shocked that someone recognized him -- did I mention how incredibly cute he was? -- and then we just joked around and talked about books for the longest time. I think he was there on vacation. When he had to leave, he told me to give him a call if I was ever in Baltimore, and I actually thought about making up a reason to go there just to see him. The guy was an incredible writer. It's a shame he only wrote one book before he died, and even more of a shame that it wasn't a huge hit. If you haven't read this book yet, find a copy somewhere. The language is so beautiful."},{"Title":"A Thousand Benjamins","review":"What an overlooked gem. I haven't seen a better rookie performance since Tony Conigliaro.

I also LOVED &quot;A Thousand Benjamins&quot; and have looked everywhere for anything else by this author. A friend of mine tracked down a book he wrote called &quot;Our Poor Sweet Napoleon,&quot; which was serialized in an East Coast newspaper about 10 years ago. It was absolutely amazing -- a wild, funny, sad story about people struggling with the essence of truth. I still have a photocopy of it, which I hope doesn't violate some copyright laws, and I still go back and read chapters every now and then just to laugh. I don't know if &quot;Our Poor Sweet Napoleon&quot; was ever published by anyone in book form, which is a shame -- it's even better than &quot;A Thousand Benjamins,&quot; if you can believe that. Anyway, I haven't seen anything from the author since. Friends of mine had also heard the rumor that he died in a car accident, as well as a rumor that he was very ill. On the other side of things, they'd also heard a rumor that he was dating Jewel (the singer) and had co-written some of her songs. Who knows what really happened to him. But I agree with the last reviewer -- if you know the author, please tell him to write another book! Soon! I promise to buy 100 copies myself!"},{"Title":"A Thousand Benjamins","review":"This is an absolutely incredible novel! I found it in a used book store a few years ago and have read it no fewer than four times. It's graceful and poetic, yet funny. It's impossible to put down.

Each time I read the book, I pick up something that I missed the first time -- some subtle wordplay, a joke, a hint about what might happen. I didn't want this book to ever end.Does anyone know why this wasn't made into a movie? It would've been great. Does anyone know if the author has written anything else? I've heard rumors that he died in a car accident or that he quit writing to teach law school. Does anyone know what happened to him?

In addition, she mentions items like African nations' presidential reigns, independence dates; she touches on some of the history and the geography. This makes the book an excellent reference book for the average reader and the reader who simply to take a peripheral and generalized glance at Africa and African names. The book, more so, incolves brief but symbolizing excerpts about Africa and African names, other than specific and academic content. Stewart, however, displays through the avenue of names, a lot of commendable creativity with presenting to those who are quite ignorant of Africa. The cultural and historical wealth of Africa is generally presented. stewart suggests considerations and ways by which the African descended can take on African names. She offers suggestions as to how some of the long names can be shortened or likened to American names. The suggested bibliography on Africa, in general, is quite extensive. Stewart's sister volume, \\"1001 African Names,\\" involves much more academic research, including an additional array of African names and a lot more information on Africa. Here, Stewart employs more resources specific to onomastics than she did in her previous book. But with both books, one would beg to defer on a lot of the pronunciations that she links to the names; perhaps a consequence of her limited expertise in African linguistics. The two books function as good handbooks and resource guides on African names, and on Africa in general."},{"Title":"African names: Names from the African continent for children and adults","review":"i liked this very much...it helped me ou"},{"Title":"American renaissance;: Art and expression in the age of Emerson and Whitman","review":"It is hard to find a more seminal work on American Literature than American Renaissance. Until today, any self-respecting American Studies scholar or expert for American Literature has to come to terms with this massive shedding of ink on some of the best American texts ever published.Though I find myself at times lost in the wealth of Mr. Matthiessen's allusions and remarks, especially when he weaves all too great a narrative from the swatches he collected, I remain fascinated with this genuinely passionate account of a harmony where many believed (and still today believe) to hear only cacophony. Suspiciously quiet about his personal leanings and politics (a fact that, with all due respect, could simply not remain untouched by more recent cultural, gender, and Marxist critics), Matthiessen takes us back to an age that holds more of today than we sometimes think, and that already foreshadows in its depth what more superficial ages would later repeat ad nausea.It is not a novel, nor a Michener book, but if you are seriously interested in 19th century American literature (and he does give Whitman the respect he deserves), this may very well be one of the most readable studies on the subject. Sadly shortcutting Dickinson, Poe, and other authors that are excavated only today, this book still points calmly and self-assuredly to those novels and poems that stand out. All these dead, white men wrote texts that we simply cannot ignore, and whether we love Cervantes, Joyce, DeLillo, whether Tan, Faulkner, Burroughs, or Lacan, we have to see that the whale's whiteness and Walden's silence are with us always."},{"Title":"American renaissance;: Art and expression in the age of Emerson and Whitman","review":"The American Renaissance 1850-1855 was the time in which American Literature truly came into greatness. Melville( Moby Dick 1851) Whitman ( Leaves of Grass 1855) Emerson, Thoreau, and Hawthorne. Matthiessen identifies the phenomenom understands that this is the real birth- note of American literature not simply as an insular provincial form but as a world- waking work. He writes with great understanding of the works themselves.It has been many years since I read this work in graduate- school but I have no doubt it holds up , despite the waves of various critical schools that have tried to undermine its authority.It is as literary criticism a great work which identifies and interprets great creative works.It is an essential item in the American library , and a real help to anyone who wants to understand one of the great moments in the history of world- literature."},{"Title":"American renaissance;: Art and expression in the age of Emerson and Whitman","review":"F.O. Mathiessen's \\"American Renaissance:Art and Expression in the Age of Emerson and Whitman\\" (1941) is a painstakingly detailed historical study of how form and content, style and meaning, merge with a new unity in the works of key representative American artists - Emerson, Thoreau, Hawthorne, Melville, Whitman - to create a re-birth of a distinctive American artistic imagination that ripens to maturity in the 1850s. This uniquely American moment in the history of art is described with breathtaking eloquence, critical insight, and exegesis by a brilliant stylist and scholar.Mathiessen traces the primary influences that lead up to this American renaissance of artistic expression, citing classical, medieval, renaissance sources (Thomas Browne, Milton, Dante, Plato) as important determinants of style and expression. The guiding assumption here is that America, in its essence, can only be revealed in the works of its greatest representatives, who inevitably remain its greatest artists. Mathiessen examines the journals, notebooks, marginalia of key authors, along with other secondary historical and critical sources, to trace influences between them and their common tie to one progenitor - Ralph Waldo Emerson - to show how the democratic cultural ethos, the radically new natural landscape of America, the overlooked spaces of the commonplace, and the intellectual clash between transcendental and tragic ideals inspire the form and content of the representative works in this new artistic enterprise. Emerson and Thoreau's more reconciliatory vision is made to stand in contrast with the darker tragic vision of life in the novels of Hawthorne and Melville, before the book transitions back to the Emersonian optimism of Whitman's poetry.The unique landscape of Concord inspires Emerson's transcendental vision in \\"Nature\\" (1833), along with a new stress on self-reliance and individualism in a series of lectures and essays culminating in \\"Representative Men\\" (1850) and \\"English Traits\\" (1860). This radical quest for a return to the self in Emerson's project will take new emphasis and direction in Thoreau's \\"Walden\\" (1854). Thoreau's isolation in the makeshift hut in the corner of Concord will forge the New England imagination with the moral worldviews of the larger religious history of the world. The reaction to transcendentalism will emerge in the symbolic and allegorical tragic novels of Hawthorne and Melville. The provincial life that is symbol for all life in its totality is depicted with a new consciousness of evil in Hawthorne's deeply symbolic \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" (1850) and \\"The House of the Seven Gables\\" (1851), while Melville's more allegorical tragedies will emerge in a Shakespearean metaphysical quest in \\"Moby Dick\\" (1851) and \\"Pierre\\" (1852). The ever widening, more inclusive, artistic vision will make the business of artistic creation inseparable from the daily business of living in Whitman's Leaves of Grass (1855) and the old breadth of humanism that once animated the vision of man in renaissance Italy will return with an inspired eloquence in Emerson's study of great human beings in \\"Representative Men\\" (1850).The central importance of \\"Man Thinking\\" and the breadth of vision and meaning that this uniquely American democratic vantage point commands for the individual will usher in a re-birth of art and culture in a uniquely American grain. This vision is a genuine alternative to the narrowly specialized function of art and culture emerging from the aristocratic, class oriented, cultural tradition of Europe. The broader expressive strokes in the art of mid-nineteenth century America will be a renaissance similar in artistic tendency to the broader humanistic \\"re-births\\" in artistic movements earlier in Britain and in the continent. This short burst of artistic inspiration from 1850-55 will thus rival the summits of human creativity in history.One issue I have with the book is an important aspect of Mathiessen's critique of Emerson that culminates on page 184, just before the transition to the sections on Hawthorne and Melville. Emerson's transcendental vision is depicted as incomplete, superficial, since it is dismissive of the tragic sense of life. Mathiessen implicitly endorses the strain of the tragic in the novels of Hawthorne and Whitman as a deeper vision of life. Transcendentalism is derided as an early, naive, movement in largely ignoring the \\"problem of evil\\" broached by the novelists. Emersonian optimism and the picture of life it evokes is judged as incomplete since it stops short of depicting one driving fact of American culture, the darker subterranean religious consciousness of sin and evil, and the radical separation of the ideal from the real that emerges from that consciousness.Here Mathiessen does not evaluate Emerson; he implicitly restates the criticism of Emerson by Hawthorne and Melville. Mathiessen's a priori commitment to the architectural and thematic arrangements of his history, this alternate depiction of the light of transcendentalism and the dark of tragedy, impedes him from recognizing the skeptical strains of thought that inform Emerson's transcendental vision. The result is a rare misstep in Mathiessen's evaluation of Emerson. Emerson's famous quote: \\"To the poet, to the philosopher, to the saint, all things are friendly and sacred, all events profitable, all days holy, all men divine\\" is the classic Emersonian affirmative, and inclusive, stance. It is in this spirit that Emerson finds a place for the \\"tragic\\", the \\"fall of man\\", and thus his acknowledgement of this consciousness of evil. As Mathiessen acknowledges, Emerson's essay \\"Experience\\" will detail his sense of the tragic in the form of biographical details of loss, and accentuate the division between the ideal, the infinitude of private man, from the real. Emerson's response to the tragic, how he chooses to overcome the tragic, his legendary reconciliatory attitude, while affirmative, is still colored by tragedy. The strained affirmation is belied by the stately calm of his prose. This reserved approach to the tragic is interpreted by his contemporaries, and reiterated by Mathiessen, as naive. But the tragic dimension is very much present. Emerson's philosophy of confronting life in all its range, without negation, requires a full meeting of the tragic. The Olympian depth of self-overcoming in Emerson commands the respect and reverence of his greatest reader, Nietzsche, the tragic philosopher, par excellence. What Mathiessen, and the two central tragic novelists, have missed about Emerson is this deeper tragic cast of mind.Mathiessen's pioneering work amply demonstrates that even without acknowledging this important tragic dimension of transcendentalism, his Emerson emerges as the dominant voice that the younger tragic generation is importantly reacting against. As such, he is a steady and massive influence through the major periods of American history charted here."},{"Title":"American renaissance;: Art and expression in the age of Emerson and Whitman","review":"good book--was a little older/worn than i expected but no real damage so its still a good copy. fast delivery & a great price. solid purchase."},{"Title":"Swedish Style: Creating the Look","review":"This is a lovely book with beautiful color pictures from what I think is authentic interiors.

No other Civil War book has a richer breadth of imagery than this tome. This should be your second book after Battle Cry of Freedom, and your next should be Shelby Foote's trilogy. After that, pick books on narrower topics of interest to you.There is only one reason for not making this your first book. As its title implies, it focuses on the pictures of the Civil War, and as such it has little room for more than an overview of the events in the words accompanying the pictures. However, there truly is only one failing of this book, and that is that it is out of print as I write this; a fault that will probably be remedied soon."},{"Title":"The American Heritage Picture History of the Civil War","review":"This was my second Civil War book, which I received for Christmas when I was 12 (thanks Mom!). My love of the subject probably has a lot to do with this excellent volume, which I pored over for many years. It is loaded with photos, illustrations, and maps as well as Bruce Catton's EXCELLENT narrative. While this narrative does not go into extensive detail (the enormous scope of the war prohibts this), it is clearly written and a treasure trove of knowledge for those interested in a one-volume overview of the Civil War. Catton was a much respected Civil War historian who influenced many of today's historians. This book (which had been out of print for years) has recently been reissued with all new photos and illustrations while still preserving the original Catton text. As these new illustrations tend to be more informative to the Civil War student than the original version's (the original had a lot of photographs of Civil war battlefields as they appear today, which are of limited usefulness), this is the preferred edition. The new edition has a white dust jacket, while the original had a grey dust jacket. Either edition, however, will serve you well in studying the deadliest war in United States history. HIGHLY recommended, especially to beginning Civil War buffs or anyone who would like to read about one of the most important chapters in our country's history."},{"Title":"The American Heritage Picture History of the Civil War","review":"Flipping through this big book, you lose yourself at times in the feeling that you were there. The destruction displayed (have you ever seen an entire hillside covered with dead men?) exists side by side with accounts of desperate valor."},{"Title":"The American Heritage Picture History of the Civil War","review":"Allow me to add a different perspective on this book.You see, I hail from the small south american country of Bolivia. Why the connection you will ask? Because when I was 8 my father returned from post-graduate studies in the USA. One of the many things he brought back was this book. At first, my only interest was the gorgeous overview illustrations of the most important battles. They captured my imagination completely as I tried to recreate them in my own drawings. I do remember reading some strange sounding names such as Shiloh, Antietam among many others. But it was the pictures that captivated me. Time and time again I would pull it out of my father's study and spent countless hours with it.My father had meant the book to be an introduction not only to American history but to the whole northern culture as well. And by northern I mean all of the USA. A culture, my father would say, that would not hesitate to trade blood for time when it came to solving difficult issues such as national unity, slavery and later, civil rights.Many years later, by then a resident of the US, I found this book at a used book store in Memphis, TN. Was I elated!!! It was like going back in time. Except this time, the experience was different. This time I read the book completely intent on understanding the content. Needless to say I purchased the book and literally ran home to start devouring it. It was the start of a 20 year quest to understand the ACW.Many countries have had internecine wars, but none captures the essence of the human struggle like the American Civil War. And as such, this book should be obligatory reading, in my honest opinion, even if the word obligatory may have un-democratic overtones.The book stands the test of time, my friends. In its simplicity it manages to do what countless other works cannot. It introduces one of the most serious of topics to a universal audience. There is no bias in it, although some of my southern friends do feel like it falls short of conveying the Confederate side and the reasons why the average southerner went to war. I respectufully disagree. You must read the narrative carefully to appreciate that in short phrases the author managed to captured so much meaning. From First Bull Run to Appomattox, to Andersonville, and beyond, this book will take you there as if it were a time machine. Printing technology has long surpassed the state of the art when this book was first published, but make no mistake: it is still literary gold, even after all this years and dare I say it for the foreseeable future.I've since come to own bookshelves worth of ACW material, but this one, this great book, the work of a great historian still holds a dear place in my mind and heart. You will surely find more in-depth studies, perhaps more technically adept writers, certainly works without the oversimplications that Mr. Catton had to make in order to appeal to a wider audtience. But it s the grandest introduction you can have to the ACW. And in this Mr Catton succeeded like no one other before or since.A few years ago, I visited my dad and found this book still in his library, the original. By now the pages were yellowing with age, some of the pages with hints of my childhood presence. Must confess to being teary-eyed. Regrettably, Mr. Catton passed away in 1978 which means I -like countless others undoubtedly, cannot express my eternal gratitude but in thought.This book is a treasure and I truly look forward to introducing it to my 8 year old son. May the legacy continue."},{"Title":"The American Heritage Picture History of the Civil War","review":"This book was precisely the book I was looking for.

One can learn much from author Bruce Catton's readable prose, or by merely viewing the hundreds of photo's and illustrations. Readers get a feel for the tragic conflict, from its pre-war controversies to the sad days when North and South were at each other's throats. We learn about military leadership, strategies, army life, battles, morale, slavery, sociology, politics, etc. Catton has done an excellent job, although this book is more overview for general audiences than detailed history. For that reason Civil War buffs will want this volume as a companion to detailed writings from authors like Catton, Shelby Foote, James McPherson, etc. Still, this is a superb effort, one that should be of equal interest to general readers and aficionados alike."},{"Title":"The American Heritage Picture History of the Civil War","review":"I was given this book back in high school, or maybe college, and to be honest I did not find it all that interesting. I held onto it, though, and now after picking it up again in my forties, and I find it fascinating!First, Bruce Catton is a great writer. His prose is a pleasure to read. So you get a beautiful collection of Civil War paintings, illustrations, and photographs, plus a great written history of the Civil War at the same time.Catton seems to have a sympathy for the South, compared to some other Civil War materials I have read. He seems to have much affection and admiration for the southern soldiers, while being more stingy in showing the same for the northern soldiers. He also seems to have no feeling that the North were the \\"good guys\\" and that the South were the \\"bad guys\\" due to slavery. He seems to stay neutral as to any good guys or bad guys, and just gives a history of the war. (Or maybe he just objectively feels that the southern soldiers were more skilled and faced more challenges than their northern counterparts, and I perceive that as sympathy.)This book is a great way to get a solid overview of the entire Civil war from beginning to end.Now that I think of it, this book has a lot of similarities to a modern Civil War television documentary. You get a written history in bite-sized pieces (which would correspond to the narration in a television documentary), combined with images that help you understand what happened even more deeply."},{"Title":"Danforth's Obstetrics and Gynecology","review":"This book is not like an ordinary medical textbook. It is more like an intermediate type between a medical text and a medical periodical. It gives considerable space to progresses of many medical-scientific research and the names of their authors. While on the other hand, it provides extremely concise outlines of etiology-manifestation-diagnosis-treatment for many common diseases, sometimes even skip certain important topics. As far as I am aware of , the following common topics are not or barely mentioned by this book: physiological changes of pregnant women; rubella infection during pregnancy; breast feeding of mothers with mastitis; the route and rate of mother-child transmission of HIV; the differential diagnosis of ruptured ectopic pregnancy; contraindications of the use of IUD; forceps use in labor; APGAR; There are also quite a few mistakes in the rear index."},{"Title":"Eleanor Hill","review":"My daughters (ages 10 and 12)and I are in Mother Daughter book clubs that both have read Eleanor Hill and loved it!

It took me back to my own days of &quot;Judy Blume&quot; books but gave it a refreshing look from a whole new perspective. Wonderful!

The off center views of the characters are incredible and vivid. I found meaning and peace of mind in THE MATYR. This story especially showed the best in the worst of people. This is the best collection of stories I have come across and a great surprise as well. I recommend this book highly for anyone looking for something short and sweet."},{"Title":"Wolves in the city: The death of French Algeria","review":"Such a masterful recount of the whirlwind of events involving France's last days in Algeria! I have now picked it up for the third time in almost as many decades. The book concerns a failing, teetering colonial policy and its impact upon a military sworn to carry it out. The result is a shock wave, where policy ambiguity clashes with the dedication (in some cases, fanaticism) required by a military mindset engaged in the midst of a civil war. The author even follows the detritus from this clash down to the individual level, giving fascinating portraits of the key individuals involved. It is a arresting, breathtaking piece of writing! Nor is it all so far-fetched either in place or time. The book can add a new dimension of perspective to events in places like Northern Ireland today. The work is timeless."},{"Title":"Wolves in the city: The death of French Algeria","review":"Henissart details the last year of French rule in Algeria which resulted in the General's Putsch and the formation and destruction of the OAS. If the reader is looking for an account of the fight of the FLN, you will not find it in this book. This is strictly an account of the OAS and pied nor fight for French Algeria.This is a account of the guerrilla role played by the OAS in their fight for French Algeria. Henissart details the brutalities of the OAS, especially of the Delta commandos. Salan's role in the uprising is also examined. Since the struggle occurred mainly in Algiers and Oran, this is where most of the history of the conflict is written. The author also summarizes the politics of the Fifth Republic and De Galle. Since the Fifth Republic was so divided politically by the war in Algeria, Henissart gives the reader an overview of the opinions of the French public.This is an excellent book on the last days of French Algeria. Again I would caution the reader that this book is about the OAS and not the struggle of the FLN. One only gets pieces of info on the FLN, and thus an incomplete picture of their struggle. For a more complete read of the struggle in Algeria, read Alistair Horne's excellent book A Savage War of Peace."},{"Title":"Wolves in the city: The death of French Algeria","review":"The story of the last years of French colonial rule in Algeria. In the epilogue, Henissart says, \\"What they ( French Algerians ) really wanted was some sort of guarantee that they could remain on viable terms in their birthplace, whether it endured under French sovereignty was secondary. The strongest ties were to a specific piece of real estate, not to the tricolor.\\"He suggests that the settlers' best chance would have been to support a new Algerian state, but in reality they overwhelmingly hoped for an apartheid regime backed by a French military coup. When this didn't happen, the OAS chose outright terror against the Muslim population and at independence most of the 1.000.000 Europeans (out of a population of 9.000.000) fled the country.I needed patience but Paul Henissart effectively shows the disconnection from reality of the \\"pieds noirs\\". He wrote this memorable book only 10 years after the events and it's based on first hand interviews with the main actors."},{"Title":"Jackson Family Values: Memories of Madness","review":"I bought this book wanting to learn more about the secretive lives of the Jacksons, but what I found as I read it was actually the tale of an inspirational woman who was able to rise above the madness that is the Jackson family and find her true self and her own independence.Margaret bares no grudge against the Jacksons, and you can tell in the way the book is written, as if she almost has to laugh at the insanity of it all now looking back. And it is insanity. The Jacksons have long been known to be dysfunctional, but never have I seen such an in depth account of the chaos that is their world.The book really makes you see how little respect the Jackson men (with the exception of Marlon and Michael) have for women, and how backwards Katherine is in her thinking. People speak of the effects Joseph Jackson's abuse has had on his children, but few point out that Katherine has possibly been just as damaging. Like LaToya's book, Hayvenhurst comes off as a prison with the inmates often subjected to physical and emotional abuse.You see how much the family leeches off of Janet and Michael, and you can begin to understand why the Jacksons have a distinct distrust of each other, Jacksonian paranoia as Margaret calls it.You're really rooting for Margaret in the book and you really feel for her. Through it all though, you can tell that her children are always her main concern.I hope Jermaine has sorted out his womanizing issues and has started paying his child support (although that seems unlikely as I don't know what source of income he would have).And I am truly, truly happy to see that Margaret has moved on her life, creating a successful agency to her name with her new husband.All the best of luck and happiness to you Margaret, you are an amazing woman and an inspiration to any woman who has ever suffered from abuse and dead-beat dads. You prove that it is possible to stand on your own two feet with enough creativity and will power."},{"Title":"Jackson Family Values: Memories of Madness","review":"Margaret first starts the book off by giving a short biography about herself, to let the readers know where she comes from. She talks about her past drug uses, and how she met Jermaine at a restaurant in L.A. After meeting Jermaine, he would call her and talk to her every day, and she would just open up on her life to him, about how she was a drug addict, and is a 10th grade dropout. That alone, would have made me steer clear of her, but as discussed throughout the book by Margaret, the Jackson brothers are into low quality, uneducated , and financially strapped women whom can be easily controlled and manipulated. Jermaine was a married man when he met Margaret, and when she would call Jermaine, his wife would always answer! Eventually Margaret gets pregnant by him and gives birth to Jermaine's son, 3 months apart from his wife giving birth to their child! Jermaine's wife soon enough finds out about his mistress and divorces him, taking everything in the divorce. Margaret and broke Jermaine then move back home to mom and dads house on hayvenhurst which when all the fun begins. I never knew the Jermaine I saw on T.V. giving interview after interview about brother Michael's death was actually a wife abuser, liar, cheater, and overall dirt bag.Father Joseph sleeps with every woman that he can, and even sleeps with them in the couples bedroom! Latoya even informs mother that father Joe is sleeping with a member of one of the girl groups that he is managing, and mother just turns a deaf ear to all of his infidelities. Katherine isn't so innocent herself. Its amazing how she can just let her husband cheat on her with so many different women, even sleeping with women in the couples bedroom for crying out loud, and she could care less. Now that's what you call an obedient wife! The brothers have no respect for women whatsoever by cheating on their wives left and right, and sometimes even have 2 girlfriends! And their mother Katherine backs up all her sons when they are accused of cheating by their wives. Probably because they always saw their dad doing it growing up and didn't think it was a problem. Tito's wife even warns Margaret that Jackson wives aren't forever, and to save money for a rainy day as eventually she will get kicked to the curb herself! There is hardly anything written about Michael here, probably because he wasn't living at the house the time Margaret was living there.The urban legend floating around that the Jackson family is broke beside Janet and Michael are reinforced in this book. They have no money left, because their ex wives took it all in the divorces. Overall, very informative book, and I have no reason to believe she is a lying disgruntled ex wife trying to make a few bucks, nothing is written out of bitterness here."},{"Title":"Jackson Family Values: Memories of Madness","review":"I will start off by saying book has the ring of truth to me, whatever the motives for writing it. Margaret Maldanado Jackson doesn't spare herself, Jermaine, or the Jackson/Maldanado families of her criticism. The fact that she addresses her past drug addiction, affair w/ a married man, remaining in an emotionally/physically/sexually abusive relationship way past it's sale by date, and struggles to move forward as a single mother (at that time at least, don't know about the present) manages to explain some of the behaviors we see from the Jacksons w/o demonizing them in the process. IOW, she seems to have tried to tell of her experiences in a fairly balanced way. The mistakes the author's made are common ones that MANY women make, no matter who the man in their life is, how much money they have, or what they look like. I THINK this was her point in writing this book. By the end, one feels as if she has learned from her experiences. However, I digress.....Despite the terrible proofreading and typesetting of the book (hardback edition), it's an intriguing and sometimes hilarious read. You really feel as if you've entered the gates of Havenhurst and are dealing w/ flesh and blood people.....as opposed to stars and legends. She does an excellent job of portraying everyone as extremely human while at the same time showing us how different the celebrity world is from our own. While she portrays Jermaine almost as \\"her favorite mistake\\", she does so w/in the context of his upbringing and celebrity. She does not excuse his bad behavior (or hers, for that matter), but putting it w/in the context of this surreal world paints a vivid picture. IOW, the Jacksons are NOT your \\"average family\\" in ANY way! Knowing this is one thing, but this book addresses the extent and the nature of how celebrity affects everyone and everything around it.Margaret and Jermaine's involvement came at very interesting points in their (respective) lives......she was at the beginning stages of recovery from drug addiction and he was facing the ending of his career (as he knew it) and of his marriage. While one can question HER morals for being involved w/ a married man, it's a fact that HE was the married man......who had both his wife and Margaret pregnant at the same time. The start of this relationship was all about (from her presentation) seeking new lives, both for Jermaine and herself.....and this they got, new lives.The initial stages of going from \\"a nobody\\" to \\"a Jackson woman\\"/ mother seem to go by in a blinding flash. They literally went from \\"just met\\" to prospective parents in a matter of months...all while he was still married! She was obviously starstuck and he struck by her looks and neediness. This relationship seemed to happen in the reverse of what's normally expected.....they only get to know each other AFTER they had a child (as permanent linkage), rather than the opposite. What they got to know about each other was apparently not appealing to EITHER of them. This MAY explain alot wrt how this relationship ultimately ended up, IMHO.Margaret's situation w/ Jermaine gives alot of insight into how this family really lives vs. how they like to portray themselves. There was apparently very little condemnation of Jermaine in this religious family for the having made 2 women pregnant (apparently he and his wife at the time, Hazel, actually show up at his parents house w/ Margaret's baby son.....Hazel about to deliver her own son any minute), little condemnation for leaving his wife for her, they allowed them to live UNmarried for several years at Havenhurst, and supported him in his lack of (financial) support of his children. This same sort of \\"family culture\\" seems to have been extended to the other brothers as well. IF this is true (have no reason to believe otherwise), it says alot about how the Jackson's REALLY operate and perhaps explains a bit of why they are facing what they presently are (tho Margaret defended MJ in the 1st allegations). One thing that's clear is she was expecting the PR Jackson family and got something ENTIRELY different. For all of author's apparent neediness, the sense of isolation unique to celebrity comes clearly thru. It's obvious that she had a difficult time adjusting (as well as some of the other wives/girlfriends), but the Jacksons haven't fully come to terms w/ it either. This overall lack of adjustment played a part in her finally leaving and taking control of her life. Unlike the Jackson's, w/ this book, she's seemed to have opted out of the celebrity machine.....Margaret took her two sons (Jeremy and Jourdynn) and left the big top....seemingly w/o many regrets.\\"Jackson Family Values\\" was written in 1995, so what's happened in her life since isn't known to me. As for Jermaine, not too long after Margaret moved out of Havenhurst, he took up w/ his brother Randy's ex girlfriend (and mother of Randy's 2 kids) and apparently remains w/ her to the present.This book is a good read if you could get it at the library or a cheap copy. For nothing else, the stories about Madame Bongo of Gabon and her somehow relative Leah Bongo are worth the 2nd hand price for the laugh factor alone. LOL....this part CAN'T be anything but true.....it's just too weird and hilarious!Even if you are a diehard Jackson fan (which I am no longer...still like them OK), this book really gives some insight that has never come to light before. The author is the only Jackson \\"wife\\" to publicly speak/write in depth of her experiences and interactions w/ the man in question and his extended family. Whether or not you choose to believe everything/anything she says, her unique position makes for a very interesting read."},{"Title":"Jackson Family Values: Memories of Madness","review":"I only put down this book twice, because it was that good. Page turner doesn't describe how enthralled you become in the lives of the Jacksons. I always wondered why Janet and Michael rathered distanced themselves from the rest of the clan, now I know. However to state from what I read in this book that the family is dysfunctional would be a compliment, because from some of the accounts they are insane. The questioned was answered as to why Jermaine all of a sudden became jealous of Michael and his fame.Also I discovered the reason the Jacksons are so broke is that Berry Gordy owns all the rights to their music which means they have no income except for what Michael and Janet provide."},{"Title":"Jackson Family Values: Memories of Madness","review":"Wow, first I would like to say that the prices listed for all these Jackson related books are ridiculous! I was so interested in reading this one, but refused to pay over a hundred bucks for it. It pays to be patient because I actually found over 15 Jackson books online for free! If you are interested in the link let me know.Margaret's book is sooooooooo good! I finished it in one day! I believe every word of her book because not only did she give away alot of inside information about the Jacksons, she also spoke about her drug habit, and not so squeaky clean past. She also mentioned embarassing moments that any wife or mother would be ashamed to speak about.Jermaine was definately a deceiver and wore many masks. I could see her reasons for wanting to write this book. These people are not what they seem and they came across very paranoid and insane. She spoke very highly of Michael, and didn't utter one bad word against him. Mostly the men got it the worst, which she had witnessed many of them cheating. (With the exception of Marlon and Michael). Alot of Katherine's advice to Margaret regarding how a wife should treat a husband also explains why katherine is still with Joe to this day. I never knew Jackie dated Paula abdul while he was married, and the scene with his wife and her was one of a kind..lolI don't want to give away too much of the book, but it definately takes you behind the gates of the Jackson compound and lets you become a fly on the wall during the times the family were smiling for the cameras."},{"Title":"Jackson Family Values: Memories of Madness","review":"This was such an interesting and enlightening read. To anybody who has played close attention to Michael, Janet, and LaToya over the years, it all more or less makes sense. To me, I think Margaret tries to give a fair, balanced account of what happened. Of course, she probably held some animosity toward the Jackson family, so I take some of the more incriminating accounts with a grain of salt. Personally feel sorry for them rather than angry. These people have some seriously f**ked up values. I actually think Katherine was the more dangerous than Joe. Granted, Joe was physically and mentally abusive to his children. But Katherine.... I think she did more damage than any whipping or belting possibly could. Her Jehova's Witness idiologies, combined with her insitence that her babies could do no wrong, combined with the fact that she allowed her children to live with her well into their 30s, combined with the fact that she found it perfectly appropriate to allow her youngest children to provide financial support for thier older brothers... it's insane! Joe was surely physically and mentally abusive, but Katherine... man. Well, I hope Michael's kids will be ok with her.All I have to say is... congratulations to Janet and Marlon for being able to get the hell out of there! Damn."},{"Title":"Jackson Family Values: Memories of Madness","review":"I received my copy in the mail from Amazon.com today and I'm already on page 149. This book is something else. Everything from suicides, various children out of wedlock, STD's to Katherine, Janet, and Randy marching in Joe's office and beating his mistress bloody. And I'm not even half way done yet, This book is EXPLOSIVE. A great read and a must have for Jackson fans and collectors who want a glimpse into the REAL life of the Jackson clan."},{"Title":"Jackson Family Values: Memories of Madness","review":"I thought this was the most honest depiction of the Jackson Family that's been written. I was more inclined to belive what was written in this book because Maldonado actually lived at the Jackson house for about 4 years.The majority of the book follows the theme of the Jackson brothers (sans Marlon and Michael) being adulterers and dead beat dads.Now, while Maldonado insisted she harbored no bitterness towards the family as a whole, she apparently wasn't too fond of her common law husband Jermaine. She put ALL his business out there...and I mean ALL OF IT! From plastic surgery to STD's... Her depiction of him appeared truthful some times and other times it seemed dramatized. Was/is Jermaine Jackson as egotistical/vindictive/controlling as was claimed by Maldonado? Maybe...maybe not.She also doesn't hold back when revealing Joe Jackson's exploits with women and foolish business ventures. However, Katherine Jackson wasnt entirely depicted as a saint. While Maldonado never claimed anything seemingly outlandish such as Katherine staging the kidnapping of her own daughter as part of a master plan to keep her at home (according to La Toya's biography), Maldonado's depiction of Katherine acting two-faced and turning a blind eye/deaf ear to her family's infidelities/shortcomings was surprisingly consistent with claims made in LaToya's book.I like that Maldonado doesn't bash Michael at all. It was refreshing to read that, while not perfect, Michael did love his family and was the sole bread winner; repeatedly bailing his family out of one financial mess after the other. Furthermore, she affirmed that MJ was NOT a child molester, stressing that she left her and Jermaine's kids alone with him on many occasions and \\"knew that they would be safe and well taken care of,\\" and that Michael was the only Jackson that inquired about the well being of her and Jermaine's kids on a regular basis. I also think Maldonado does a good job in shedding light on the brothers' (especially Jermaine's) jealousy of MJ's success.While she spends a great deal of the book laying out Jackson family dirt, she also discussed some dirt of her own, mainly her drug abuse before meeting Jermaine; but could there be more to her story than what was revealed? Probably. Maldonado did mention some strengths of the family at the end of the book (I mean theoretically she could've only written negative things).Overall, I thought the book was well-written, scandalous, tantilizing, and perhaps a bit embellished all at the same time. I've read other reviews saying she was a scorned groupie who got involved with a married man with children then complained about it after things started going badly. These people raise a valid point...how much of it was Jermaine being untruthful about his marital status and how much of it was Maldonado knowing full well Jermaine was married but simply choosing to pursue a relationship with him anyway??It's very likely that this book is yet another example of someone using the Jackson name to make some money, but in the end, you can't knock the woman's hustle!"},{"Title":"Jackson Family Values: Memories of Madness","review":"This book made me feel like a fly on the wall in the Jackson household. The author does a great job of revealing Jermaine's dysfunctionality. Yet she still did so without bashing him, keeping in mind he is the father of her children. A must read for Jackson curiosity-seekers. The book is a bit one-sided. The author freely discusses Jermaine's infidelity, but fails to go into detail about her adulterous relationship with him during his union with Hazel Gordy-Jackson."},{"Title":"Jackson Family Values: Memories of Madness","review":"I read this book in one day. I advise to take in consideration that is one person's side of the story, which is funny many times. Poor Randy, Jermaine did him wrong marrying his children's mother. There are many misspelled names but if you are familiar with the entertainment industry you will who Margaret is talking about in the book for example Lela Rochon, not Leela ReShawn. I always wanted to know what happened to Tito's wife. Margaret described and explained how Dee-Dee was murdered. Margaret also adds to Joe Jackson's abuse claims. Tito said to her that Joe would put salt in his wounds.It's just typical in-law perspective dynamics. If I write a book about my in-laws, it would share the similar tone.I hope she received enough profit from this book to help her financially with her sons. I say read it if you ever wanted to know background information about the Jacksons."},{"Title":"Jackson Family Values: Memories of Madness","review":"A waited quite some time to find a reasonably priced copy to add this to my MJ collection. Margaret comes off as credible and not overly sensationalized. The short book is her attempt at narrating life inside the gates of Havenhurst from her point of view. I also enjoyed the inside information as to the making of \\"The Jacksons: An American Dream\\" movie which she produced.If you are hoping for a good read on inside information specifically about Michael Jackson, this is not the book for you. Although she does mention Michael a few times, he was not her focus then or in the book. For many, insight into the Jackson family will inspire deeper thinking into the affects on all of them individually."},{"Title":"Jackson Family Values: Memories of Madness","review":"I was first introduced to Michael Jackson and The jackson 5 when Diana Ross introduced the group to the world on The Ed Sullivan Show and Hollywood Palace. Diana was a regular guest on Ed Sullivan and her popularity at the end of the 60s was undeniably massive. She was the host of Hollywood Palace when the Jackson 5 appeared and had several skits with Michael on the episode.Fast forward to the late 80s/early 90s, and I actually met the author, Margaret Maldonado. I worked closely with Jermaine jackson on what would become his last recordings to date. So my interest in reading this book and learning more about the jackson clan, with Michael's transition, has been renewed to an even more intense level than before.Jermaine was always a perfect gentleman and extremely easy to work with though by that time, he had been in the public eye for well over 2 decades. Therefore, I am really intrigued to read this book following the almost uniform comments about his personal life and behavior. Margaret was soft spoken and also kind and professional. At the time, I did know that Jermaine was separated from Hazel, but, I didn't know the back story of his failure to pay child support and impregnating so many women. But why would I know, we were out promoting his projects, not his personal life. I had thought him to be the more sane member of the eclectic Jackson clan. Seems I have more to learn. What I do know is, he recorded a scathing rebuttle to Michael at that time. A song called \\"Word to the Badd\\". The original version was eventually taken off of the album due to its truly controversial nature. His original lyrics spoke to Michael's maniacal behavior at the time including the skin lightening fiasco.I am usually not engaged in trivial gossip but having been so close to a small portion of their lives, human curiosity has gotten the best of me.....and now, I cannot wait for confirmation that the book is on its way to me. Amazon really wins too because I also decided to take the plunge and get Taborelli's book on Michael."},{"Title":"Jackson Family Values: Memories of Madness","review":"It was indeed a very good book, it lived up to what I expected, it came quickly and was in good condition, thank you."},{"Title":"Jackson Family Values: Memories of Madness","review":"The content in this book may be a little true but over exagerated with a number of things, but it's an O.K I guess"},{"Title":"Jackson Family Values: Memories of Madness","review":"This book was incredible. I would have never imagined that the personal lives of the Jackson Family could have been so bazaar. At times I could not stop laughing. I was actually in tears from laughing so hard. However, there were other incidents that were very sad and yet other incidents that were simply incredible. I was unable to put this book down. A must read!!"},{"Title":"Jackson Family Values: Memories of Madness","review":"After MJ died I have been reading books about his life and those around him. Even though Ms. Maldonado probably didn't have an on-going relationship with MJ after her divorce from his brother, her story is an interesting glimpse inside this family. People have the right to have their privacy but it's always interesting to get a glimpse in the rich and famous world. She really focuses her attention on Jermaine and his irresponsible behavior, and she speaks about her relationship with the matriarch of the family, Katherine Jackson. She speaks highly of Michael Jackson and appeared to support him during the inital charges against him in 1993. What I found really interesting was her relationship with Jermaine's first wife, Hazel Gordy (Berry Gordy's daughter). I read Latoya's book before this one and there were some similarities except for an incident involving Katherine, Randy and Janet supposedly 'beating up' one of Joe's girlfriends. I have read in one of MJ's biographies and this book that Janet was involved but in Latoya's book she said Randy's then girlfriend was with them not Janet. I am more incline to believe Ms. Maldonado's story than Latoya, even though Latoya's book was an interesting read as well. It's interesting that no one writes much about Janet. She is mention very little in this book and Latoya's book. Both speak highly of Michael."},{"Title":"Jackson Family Values: Memories of Madness","review":"I read pages of this book on a site deciated to Michael Jackson and I couldn't believe what I was reading! Either Margaret is for real or just another bitter ex-wife of Jermaine's but if she's being honest in that book? then Jermaine ought to be ashamed of himself. The man's got issues and finally it's hypocritical of him that he's doing all those informicals to feed hungry children when he don't want to pay to have his own children fed with a roof over their heads and clothes on their backs.He's no longer with Randy's ex-girlfriend/babysmoma and has remarried I know but still if Margaret's telling the truth then I feel sorry for his current wife."},{"Title":"Jackson Family Values: Memories of Madness","review":"First of all I have to say that this is a must read for anyone who wants to know more about the Jacksons. All of the Jackson men are absolutely DISGUSTING, except for Michael and Marlon. The rest of them cheat on their wives and have babies with girlfriends on the side like it's an everyday thing.Jermaine,Jackie,Tito, and Randy have absolutely no respect for women. Now on to Jermaine....he is an absolute monster. I cannot believe that I used to have a crush on him. He is a liar,cheater,he is manipulative and he is abusive. And even worse, he is a deadbeat father. In this book you get to see how jealous he was of Michael and how big his ego is. Some people might think that Margaret is doing nothing but bashing the Jacksons in this book, but that's not the case. Margaret had absoulutely nothing bad to say about Michael. She really had nothing bad to say about Janet or Marlon either. I think that this book is nothing but the truth and I respect Margaret so much for doing what she had to do to make a better life for her and her children. All I have to say about this is that you really get an inside look into the lives of The Jacksons and see what kind of twisted beliefs and values they have."},{"Title":"Jackson Family Values: Memories of Madness","review":"This was a good read, more smuttier than Latoya's and I don't know if I believe it all.but a good read I bought on Amazon used. worth the $ 10."},{"Title":"Jackson Family Values: Memories of Madness","review":"i bought this book a few years ago i found this book to be quite interesting and shocking, and very hilarious it seems to me like the jacksons have some major issues they don't seem to have any morals or values espiecially jermaine. i can;t seem to comprehend how someone can impregnate their wife and mistress at the same time and go to their brother's birthday party with their pregnant wife and bring his infant son who is the product of an extramarital affair.. i would be so ashamed and embarrassed if i were in his wife's shoes. i think that jermaine jackson should be sterilized he makes so many babies with different women but yet can't afford to pay child support and while living in his mother's house and i think these women are even more stupid to pick up a man like that who is trifling and cheating dead beat... this family give a whole new meaning to the word dysfunctional i think more books should be published like this to expose the real character's of celebrities behind closed doors and that money and fame doesnt substitute for happiness"},{"Title":"Jackson Family Values: Memories of Madness","review":"Margaret starts off this book by telling a little bit about her life before she met Jermaine and how she was a drug addict and ran with the wild crowd for a while and eventually cleaned herself up. Then she meets Jermaine and they fall for each other. Margaret tells us how he would call her everyday and then she finds out that hes married. But Jermaine told her that he was going to leave his wife. But of course that was a lie and Margaret ends up pregnant. I realize that Margaret broke up the marriage but really she didn't know he was married for a while because really Jermaine was famous for being part of the Jackson 5, but he wasn't as famous as Janet and Michael. But Margaret talks about her experiences with the Jacksons and it wasn't a pleasent experience. Jermaine at times was abusive to her and their children and she tells us of how Jermaine would have another mistress and show her off to everyone. Jackie Tito and Randy were also guilty of having one sometimes 2 girlfriends on the side. But then you have to expect that because their father would cheat on their mother on the road and I don't think the brothers thought it was a problem. This book shows how big the Jackson male egos were and how they would live off of Janet and Michael, and like royalty yet claim they were penniless. I'm glad that Margaret left Jermaine and is now a successful buisness women in the fashion industry. Thank Goodness she didn't marry him. I hope to God that Jermaines current wife Halima leaves him and doesn't have children with Jermaine, because I wouldn't be surprised if Jermaine cheated on her. Hopefully Margaret will write a sequel to this book and tell us a little bit more of life after Jermaine. I actually read this book online so if anyone wants to know the sight I'll give you all the link."},{"Title":"Jackson Family Values: Memories of Madness","review":"The author went into great detail of what it was like living with the Jacksons, especially her partner Jermaine.She went onto explain what Katherine and Joe Jackson were really like on the homefront without the cameras on them.This is when you don't want to put the book down, cause its like 'wow' on Katherine an Joes attitudes with everyone that was under their roof.All the family members are covered on what it was like interacting with them, what really went on in their lives, including Michael.I highly recommend this book, it has drama, and suspense throughout the pages.An excellent read."},{"Title":"Jackson Family Values: Memories of Madness","review":"I wasn't exactly sure what I would get when I started this book, but it turned out to be one that I couldn't put down. Parts were funny, especially the name calling. Primarly because it made her so real. She would admit to be immature about it but haven't we all been where we just wanted to call people names sometimes, especially when they are creating havoc in your life. With anything there are always 2 sides to the story, but more than likely her story probably leads more to the accurate events that took place. You wonder how she stayed as long as she did (yes, money was probably a big part of it), then you realize how many of us have been in some sort of relationship always thinking it would get better. And its not like she is bashing all of the Jackson family. She brags on Janet and Michael and has her moments for Katherine as well. But, it wasn't them she was married to. Bravo to her for moving on and making something of her life. Life after Jermaine..."},{"Title":"Jackson Family Values: Memories of Madness","review":"Maldonado's book is definately unsung. This book was a real page turner and it was hard to put down. Although someone fell short in the spell-check department, it is still a good read. I admire the way Maldonado came across in the book, she was honest, funny and very detailed on many issues during that time. I wish she would do a follow-up book since so much has happened since 1995, most recently with Michael's passing. She did not write this book in malice of the family, she just told it like she experienced it. It is amazing to see how she progressed from a drug-addicted runaway into an independent business woman with integrity that is lacking in the entertainment industry. Another thing that I admired was the way she stood up for Michael during the allegations and she frequently showed how set appart he was from the rest of the family, his continued generosity and financial support to his family, including his continued kindness and concern for her children's well-being when the rest of the Jackson family seemed to have forgotten about her children. I really wish she would do a sequel, it would definately do great and encourage other women and mothers dealing with dead-beat dads as well."},{"Title":"Jackson Family Values: Memories of Madness","review":"I've been an admirer of the Jacksons for many years, and it's so sad to hear of the layers of dysfunction that exist in this family. At the very least, this book talks about the other Jacksons besides Michael, which is a refreshing change. It is also the story of a woman who discovers that even celebrities are not immune from problems, and that fame and fortune are no substitutes for a healthy home life. What is WRONG with these folks? According to the author, it seems that Marlon and Tito are the only ones among the 'other' Jacksons who have made a life for themselves apart from sponging off of Michael and Janet (thank God Marlon and his wife Carol are still together; the smartest thing they did was to leave the whole dysfunctional bunch to themselves at Hayvenhurst!).I have seen Jermaine Jackson on Feed the Children Informercials, defending his famous brother in interviews, and heard of his supposed conversion to Islam. I sincerely hope that by now he has dealt with his issues of abuse and womanizing, and that he is paying child support for the two sons he had with the author. I would love to see Margaret Maldonado write a revised version of this book, with updates as to whether or not things have improved between her sons and their father, as well as how she has rebuilt her own life."},{"Title":"Jackson Family Values: Memories of Madness","review":"If you can snag a copy from Amazon marketplace, you are in for a treat. This book was written by a true Jackson insider--a former girlfriend/common law wife of Jermaine Jackson. It explains why Michael separated himself from the family, as well as Janet. The Jackson family is highly dysfunctional; Jermaine Jackson never matured beyond age 14; like his father, he felt philandering was his right and privilege. He even installed another mistress in the house and flaunted the relationship in front of Margaret. Margaret managed to leave the Jackson compound with only her two kids and the clothes on their backs. Jermaine lets her go, but later harasses her and threatens her with lawsuits. She became friends with wife #1, Hazel Gordy, and tried to help her has well with custody payments from the loud-mouthed, irresponsible Jermaine. Margaret saw how both parents were enablers, always backing up Jermaine's bad behavior or having an excuse. She was in a no-win situation and knew that she had to give up the luxurious mansion and lifestyle in exchange for her sanity and self-esteem. She tells her story in a balanced way, so it is not all about trashing the Jacksons. Rather, it is simply what she observed and experienced when living with one of America's most famous but dysfunctional families. Her story is intense and gripping; I couldn't put the book down, it was that good."},{"Title":"Jackson Family Values: Memories of Madness","review":"I had been searching high and low for this book and I finally found it on Amazon!!!! at a great price. Anyway, I am a hugh Jackson Family Fan (even before Michael died) and this book really tells about them all pretty much, especially about the stuff that you do not read in the magazines or see on tv. If you really want to know the dirt about the Jackson Family and all of their issues and madness, you should really read this book!!!!"},{"Title":"Jackson Family Values: Memories of Madness","review":"this is a good honest book...the Jackson family has been known to be dysfunctional...from an outsider view and having researched some information, this book is inline with my findings...IMO, the author did a good job!"},{"Title":"Jackson Family Values: Memories of Madness","review":"This book left me kind of confused and wondering about some of Ms. Maldonado's statements and motives. First, why does she use the last name Jackson? Jermaine never married her. Second, I don't understand why she didn't use some of her producer's fee she received from the miniseries to move herself and her children from the \\"house of hell\\". Instead of paying Jermaine's back child support, storage fee, etc., which was well over $65,000.00, she should have used the money to leave. Third, she claims to have suffered physical, mental and emotional abuse, then why did she stay in this relationship for so long? There were organizations that she could have turned to for help. When she first found out that Jermaine was still a married man, that should have been her clue not involve herself any further. Not only did she have one baby by this married man, but she allowed herself to become pregnant the second time! I think she thought she would live the life of glitter and glitz when she found out who Jermaine was, but unfortunately, she didn't prosper as well as she thought she would because he was not the Jackson with the money ... Michael was.Ms. Maldonado sounds like she is extremely bitter, vindictive, suffers from a bad case of low self-esteem and in desperate need of cash (as she alludes to in the closing lines of her epilogue). She is also a notorious name-dropper and this book was filled with many typos and grammatical errors. Some of it just didn't make sense and I question some of her accounts. She REALLY tried to make herself sound like a saint! Hmmmmmmmm......I presume her telltale account of some of the Jacksons' private affairs and \\"dysfunctionality\\" did little to heal her relationship with the Jackson family. I think her overt viciousness only served to further distance the Jacksons from her boys ... how sad for the children."},{"Title":"Jackson Family Values: Memories of Madness","review":"I also am left a bit bewildered by this book. It is very easy to read and most reviewers make this comment. However I tend to agree with another review that Margaret is somewhat impressionable and thought she was going to live the high life at Hayvenhurst. She likes to mention about all the hired help and amenities at the house. Katherine Jackson did not wish her to move in and it was Joe that persuaded Katherine to let it happen. It also seems to be Joe that was instrumental in helping to make her feel uncomfortable and make her move out with her children after about 18 mths. I have read other Jackson books and some of the incidents that Margaret describes such as Joe assaulting La Toyas's future husband, appear over dramatised like some other incidents. Would Katherine let another 18 year old live in the house while being 'serviced\\" both by Joe and Jermaine. I find this far fetched. Katherine would not be that stupid. The truth sometimes lies in the middle, however I feel Margaret's is bent a bit far to one side. She tends to portray Katherine as a huge enabler, supporting her adult children in all their adventures. Not sure this is entirely true.Margaret certainly has blown the lid off some of the brothers and their lifestyles, such as Tito, Jackie and Jermaine's philanderings. However I cannot help feeling that some of her story is coloured or it is 'sour grapes' as things did not turn out as she wished. The Jackson family did take her in, but she did not reward them very well for their hospitality."},{"Title":"Jackson Family Values: Memories of Madness","review":"This is now year 2012. Jermaine still lags so much behind in child support. Michael's Estate has asked Jermaine's children to leave Hayvenhurst and has put them up in a condominium owned by Michael Jackson. jermaine remains as opportunistic as before.Margaret Maldonado has not only moved on but has made a name for herself. Not only is she the Founder and CEO of a an agency that dresses Celebrities, she also owns her own successful and chic clothing line.Woe to you, Jermaine!A truly inspiring book."},{"Title":"Jackson Family Values: Memories of Madness","review":"I admire Margaret Maldonado for escaping from her rocky and abusive relationship from Jermaine Jackson. I have no reason to believe this woman is lying and i believe everything she wrote in this book. I must say i was shocked to learn about some ofJermaine's behavior and Katherine's too."},{"Title":"Jackson Family Values: Memories of Madness","review":"This is a wonderful story on how Margret tells the tails of her ''memories of madness'' while being married to Jermaine Jackson and her experiences while living in the Jackson Family home in Encino California. For people who are or have always wanted to know what it would be like to live in the Jackson family home or who have always wanted to know what the Jacksons are like,this book is a must read for you. I am 13 years old and was still intrested in it. So if it can please me. I am absolutly,positivly sure that you will like it too."},{"Title":"Jackson Family Values: Memories of Madness","review":"Sounds like she was angry and only wanted to tell the bad things and it was not what I think she should have narrated in these tapes, because she lived with the Jackson's. Maybe she was mad because Jermaine moved on to someone eles. But I was dissapointed and look at the title, I bought this a couple of years ago and I had nothing nice to say about it then nor now."},{"Title":"The Humor of Christ","review":"A very slim, easily readable volume in which Trueblood carefully goes through every saying of Jesus's in the New Testament and argues that many of them are humorous, often very witty sayings. For example, he argues that the saying that looking at someone with lust in your heart is the same as committing adultery was not meant to be taken as literally true. What Jesus was doing was mocking the arrogant and self-righteous of his age, who considered themselves as so superior that they were beyond mere lust. In our age own, everyone is familiar with certain preachers who act as if they are beyond all sexual temptation or desire...then get caught with hookers. (Apparently human nature doesn't change.) Another instance that Trueblood writes about is the curious exchange between Jesus and a woman whom he refuses to cure, insulting her with the comment, \\"It isn't right to give the children's food to the dogs.\\" On the surface, this is an appalling comment. Trueblood argues Jesus was teasing her, and that she bested him by coming back with, \\"Yes, but even the dogs can eat the scraps that fall from the table.\\" I can imagine the smile on his face as he says, \\"If you can give me an answer like that, I will cure you.\\" This book is an eye-opener for those who have been curious as to why so many of Jesus's sayings didn't make much sense...unless you see them as wit."},{"Title":"The Humor of Christ","review":"This is a profound book. The whole body of Christ needs it desperately. Its point is simple and beautiful: Christ used humor and irony in his teachings. Not all (or even most) of his statements are meant to be taken literally. The other reviewer gave two of the best examples--the &quot;foreign dogs&quot; thing was actually teasing, and the &quot;lust is adultery&quot; thing is actually meant to mock excessive righteousness, not literally tell people that lust *is* adultery. This could and should bring about major changes and clarifications in our understanding of Christ's message, and it is badly overdue. As he himself said to his disciples (paraphrased), &quot;Can't you people see I'm not talking about bread?&quot; He wants us to understand him. This book is a major help in that purpose."},{"Title":"The Humor of Christ","review":"When I spotted this book on my library's shelf, I was immediately intrigued by its title, having shortly before noted a major toning-down of sarcasm on Christ's part in the NIV translation of John 16:31. Trueblood's book is as intriguing as its title, although it tends to a rather serious tone, an irony given the nature of the subject matter. He perhaps goes a little too far on occasion, finding humor where none may be intended, but the book is worthwhile for its original analysis of the parable of the unjust steward in Luke alone. It is also an easy read for a work of evident scholarship."},{"Title":"The Humor of Christ","review":"I came across a reference to Trueblood's book in \\"No More Christian Nice Guy,\\" and immediately had to have it. A lot of what Jesus says in the Gospels can range from baffling to rude -- if you mistakenly deprive him of one of his best evangelistic tools, his wonderful sense of wry wit. There is some reading between the lines, and perhaps Trueblood pushes one or two points too hard. But I'm convinced that this book, and a sense of humor, has helped me to unlock some of the more difficult parts of the Synoptic Gospels."},{"Title":"The Humor of Christ","review":"I came across a copy of this book in the library and the title drew my attention. I read it in three hours, at one sitting though the experience itself was no fun. Trueblood is advocating a re-reading of the synoptic gospels focusing on the humor of Jesus Christ found in his wit, banter and irony. In this approach of seeking humor, he seems to adopt a Bultmannian approach to the interpretation of the gospels. I am afraid that in his eagerness to find humor in the saying and parables of Jesus, he has to be guarded not to end up doing disservice to the message itself. But Elton Truebllod has brought out a wonderful area worthy of further exploration and possible research."},{"Title":"The Humor of Christ","review":"I had this book years ago and lost it. Now, I bought it again as reference for a book I'm writing, \\"Jesus - The Man (What a Guy!)\\" The Humor of Christ is not a \\"funny\\" book or book of jokes told by Jesus. I take that back - so much of what He said was said \\"tongue in cheek\\" but full of Truths. In spite of what we have been told and taught, Jesus told stories - parables, things that were full of irony and various lighter ways to present what we otherwise would overlook or forget. (ie Who can remember the 10 Commandments? - but who can forget the prodigal's son? or man alongside the road, beaten and neglected by all the holy and righteous - but rescued by a plain, simple man with a heart?)I sometimes fall asleep reading Humor of Christ - but usually go \\"Wow, I didn't understand that before!\\" One discovers the meaning of stories that once were obscure - by seeing that they were said with that subtle humor Jesus was a Master at(no pun intended).I highly recommend this book - it's been around for ages - and will continue to be, I'm sure.[...]"},{"Title":"The Humor of Christ","review":"This little book changed the way I view Jesus as I read the New Testament, as well as how I view life. Seeing the light touch that Jesus often used in dealing with difficult people and circumstances helps me to try to do the same thing.I am not afraid to smile, or even laugh out loud, as I read the Bible as I have found much more humor - a light touch - there than I did prior to reading this gem.It helps to appreciate humor more with the realization that it is how joy can be manifested in our lives.A humorless Christ (or Christian) is, indeed, an oxymoron. And Jesus was like His Father.(Ron Smith, husband of Jackie)"},{"Title":"The Humor of Christ","review":"Although this book seems a little too basic for someone who has spent time reading the new testament, it should serve its purpose for a person new to the subject."},{"Title":"The Humor of Christ","review":"Absolutely no problems with the book or delivery.

It is not just a story here, but a reference book that you can read many ways. There are interesting boxes of information, samples of his work on every page, and text for the confident young reader. Although the text will challenge young readers the images will captivate them, so the book has many levels within it: visuals for the young, a challenge for the confident child, and loads of information for the supporting adult.Would be great for school projects and developing a sense of art appreciation in a child."},{"Title":"Pablo Picasso","review":"This book was very helpful as I was preparing to present Picasso's art to elementary school children. It takes a long, prolific career, and organizes the different periods of Picasso's art so that it is more succinct. The wording is very understandable yet not condescending for older readers. This is a great series for adults, like myself, trying to help children understand why an artist was so great."},{"Title":"Immortal Poems of the English Language","review":"When a friend of mine wanted to know what volume of poetry I could recommend, adding the caveat that he wasn't going to wade through a thousand pages. I immediately thought of this book, 'Immortal Poems of the English Language', edited by Oscar Williams. This is an absolutely superb anthology.The poetry is arranged chronologically by poet - it begins with Chaucer and contemporary anonymous compositions, and proceeds through the various literary time periods to the present day. All of the greats are to be found here: Chaucer, Shakespeare, Byron, Yeats, Wordsworth (the list can go on and on) as well as some lesser-known but nonetheless great versifiers such a Peele, Cowley, and Landor.These are pieces of the English language, from the Middle English of Chaucer (presented without translation or notes) quickly getting to more modern recognisable texts. The poets come from all around the world; English as a literary language was carried forth by the British Empire, and English poetry now belongs, as a product and as an instrument of creativity.As befits his status as the greatest of English poets, Shakespeare has more pages than any other (29 pages), and some pieces come from the plays rather than his poetry proper. Some poets of giant stature (Chaucer, the first poet in the anthology) seem to get short-shrift here (none of the Canterbury Tales is included; Longfellow and Elizabeth Barrett Browning have less than one page each). However, taken as an accessible, overall compilation, this gives a great insight into the pattern of development of a poetical language.Being available as a portable paperback, this book has been a frequent travel companion. One of the things I traditionally do on airline flights is to pull out this volume and memorise poems; over the course of time I have memorised hundreds of poems, all from this text.Perhaps the one thing I would wish for would be a bit more biography about the poets themselves (they appear only as names and dates; one can place them with other poets into time periods). This would, however, significantly increase the size of the volume. Williams has provided a very brief essay on the importance of poetry. Williams himself is represented as a poet in these pages.While one can quibble at the exclusions and inclusions, it is true that no anthology can ever be complete, and that is true of this one. One unfortunate thing is that it has not been updated to include poets of the past thirty years. It is true that it is difficult to determine what poetry will be honoured and enduring, a nod to some of the more acclaimed poets of this generation would be a welcome addition.If one is going to have but one book of poetry, it would not be a far stretch of the imagination to believe that it might be this one, and that the owner would be well-served for the acquisition."},{"Title":"Immortal Poems of the English Language","review":"As with all anthologies, there will be a number of reviewers sniffing in an offended manner at the dearth (or glut) of Cummings, Yeats, Aiken, or Pope, but any 600 page anthology, by it's very nature, must be incomplete. I purchased this compilation three years ago for long flights and such and it has yet to disappoint. For the size and price of this work, one would be hard-pressed to do better.As for content, all the major poets are more or less liberally represented. Cummings gets short shrift, and several of Yeats' most memorable pieces \\"An Irish Airman Forsees His Death\\", for one) are excluded. Yet I am certain novice and old hand alike will find this work passes the time admirably.Having been with me through several housheold moves, military action, and cramped backpacks no self-respecting piece of literature should have to endure, my copy is now fairly falling apart. Yet when it expires, I will buy another copy. No other anthology, especially in terms of price, convenience, and memories, could ever compare."},{"Title":"Immortal Poems of the English Language","review":"I too love this anthology. A passionate love of poetry has been part of my upbringing. Let me say that both my mother, Gene Derwood, and Oscar Williams, my biological father, contributed to the selection of the greatest of the great poetry of the English language. Thus we have the contribution of a husband and wife team. Reviewers have mentioned updating this volume, but what has happened is that modern poetry writing no longer follows a firm tradition. Modern poetry is a shotgun blast. There are no recognizable standards for universal selection. Plath is recognized because you cannot divorce her from her suicide. Ginsberg you cannot divorce from his beard and little clanging bells, a media invention. Bob Dylan you cannot divorce from his being a song writer and media invention. If you are not a media invention and only a poet, what chance do you have? So Immortal Poems represents classic taste before media took over the American mind. The media is immortal these days, not poetry. Selecting from contemporary poets not using traditional standards would be difficult to do. I would still love to do it. For those interested in Oscar Williams there is information now available on the web. Just search it with oscarwilliams and see what their world was like in the twentieth century."},{"Title":"Immortal Poems of the English Language","review":"As other readers have said this anthology contains selections from the great poets of the English language from Beowulf to the middle of the twentieth century. It is the kind of book which can be read and reread for years upon years. I would however take exception to the claim that it is the best anthology of its kind. It does not have explanatory material provides no introduction to the poets, no interpretation of their work. There are other anthologies ( Among them ' The Concise Treasury of Great Poems' by Louis Untermeyer) which do so. Nonetheless the bottom line is that this Anthology contains very much of the greatest poetry in the English language."},{"Title":"Immortal Poems of the English Language","review":"I own various anthologies of American, British, and modern poetry, but none of them are as portable and densely packed with soul-moving poetry as this six dollar book. You may find it regrettable that the book lacks some of your favorite poems. Sandburg appears but without Chicago, and Poe but no Raven. However, each one of the poems stirs in such a way that you will find the titular adjective &quot;immortal&quot; quite apropriate. My copy has traveled with me over three continents, and now rests on my nightstand. As someone who loves poetry, its the one book that I don't leave home without."},{"Title":"Immortal Poems of the English Language","review":"Unless this anthology of poetry has been seriously altered since 1965, (that being the edition I borrowed from my mother four years ago and do not plan to return), it a wonderful collection. I have returned to old favorites and discovered poets and poems countless times in its yellowing pages. Whenever I travel it has a place in my bags, wherever I stay it has a place on my shelve until sheer age and use make it fall apart."},{"Title":"Immortal Poems of the English Language","review":"The poems are listed in chronological order of author birthdate which gives an interesting perspective of the history of the english language.

Although he had an edition that was dated back in the 50's, it was very worn out with its brown loose pages.

I decided to get my own copy and got a new edition for my friend and was thrilled with emotion. I knew I gave my friend a renewed treasure that he can now read without worrying about the pages falling out of its binding. I truly recommend this book of poems to anyone who really wants to feel well written words in verses that are truly beautiful and memorable. Get this book!"},{"Title":"Immortal Poems of the English Language","review":"I have several books of poetry at home, but this one is my favorite. It is a good collection of poetry from the time of Middle English to almost to the present. There are a few modern poets I would like to see included that haven't been yet. Maybe someday someone will update this wonderful volume.It starts with Middle English poet extraordinaire Geoffrey Chaucer, with excerpts from the Canterbury Tales and other writing. I would like to have seen Beowulf and some Old English poetry included. There are excerpts from anonymous poets of Middle English leading into the &quot;Shakespearean&quot; times where English is becoming more modern.Shakespeare of course is well represented, with passages from plays as well as poems and sonnets. This is true for some others like Marlowe, too.By the time after the Elizabethean period, English poets were not confined to England. There are Celtic poets like Robert Burns of Scotland, Dylan Thomas of Wales, and several Irish poets and American poets well represented in the later part of the book.The poets are arranged chronologically in the book, but there is are indexs of titles and poets alphabetically at the end of the book for cross referencing. This book has over 600 pages, but it is still a small paperback and will fit in a coat pocket, which is where my copy often lives, dog eared and highlighted all over the place!I had heard of most of the poets in this collection before I got the volume, but there are some I hadn't heard of and am glad to know.

My high school English teacher introduced me to it, and I bought my first copy when I was fifteen, in 1954. I literally wore the book out, and eventually bought another one. I remember noting Dylan Thomas's death in it.Oscar Williams' poetry anthologies - there several others - sold millions of copies. The Wikipedia article about Williams will tell you a lot more than I ever knew about him. Immortal Poems is a large book for a paperback, and collects poems from Chaucer to Williams' contemporaries up to around 1950. In general its choices of poems are conventional and unexceptionable.I'd recommend Immortal Poems to anyone wanting a first-rate collection of English poems from around 1400 to around 1950.

Overall, I thought it was a pretty useless book and I feel I wasted my money because I was looking for a book to give directions for making window treatments."},{"Title":"Designs for Window Treatments","review":"As the title states, this is a book of designs and styles.

Thorough instructions are provided in the author's other book, appropriately entitled, &quot;Curtain Making Course.&quot; (The one downside of ordering books on-line - you can't flip through the book before you buy!)I found this book very useful. For me, the line drawings are preferable to photographs. The lack of pattern makes it easier to either scan or photocopy the curtain style and fill in with colors/designs from my fabrics. The line drawings also made it easier to understand the construction of each curtain since nothing was hidden by fabric patterns.The author's placement suggestions were very helpful (i.e, certain designs should only be used with tall, wide windows). It's advice that designers provide - at a cost of $100 an hour or more.All in all, this is a terrific resource book."},{"Title":"Designs for Window Treatments","review":"This book is pretty specialized for a limited audience. If you like to make your own curtains or valances for windows or beds, then there is likely something of value for you herein. If not, this won't do anything but gather dust on your bookshelf. This is not really a how-to book, but rather something that will give you ideas of what could be done if you have the skill or know somebody who does."},{"Title":"The Fixer Upper (MIRA)","review":"Director of Admissions at Manhattan's prestigious Hudson School, Libby Kimmelman loves the place and obviously respects it as a center of learning since she enrolled her daughter Reva at the school. The divorced Libby enjoys her job though at times she feels frazzled especially when the bribes to get in and thank you gifts after getting in arrive during open season.Normally she skims over the application essays written by parents who believe hyperbole is the key, but the one written by Eric Donovan intrigues her as he is a ten year old new city resident just in from Woodstock, Vermont. Libby thinks the straightforward preadolescent would make a fine student. His widower father Ned is not pleased as his son used his credit card to pay the application fee over the net without permission and he cannot afford the $25K annual cost. Ned visits the school to withdraw Eric's application and get a refund, but he and Libby surprisingly feel an attraction to one another. She has doubts that he truly desires her instead of just using her to gain a scholarship while he wonders why a beautiful intelligent lady would fall in love with a carpenter.THE FIXER-UPPER is a fine Manhattan contemporary romance in which the Hudson School serves as a matchmaker and potential match breaker bringing the lead couple together, but also school costs linger in their minds. The story line is character driven as the audience sees up close the frustrations of Libby with her job and her daughter, and Ned with starting over and his son's adjustment problems. Though there is little action, fans of urban family dramas will want to read Judith Arnold's astute tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Fixer Upper (MIRA)","review":"...to find an author who is better able to bring the reader into the story than Judith Arnold. What a fabulous story-teller, and \\"The Fixer Upper\\" is a true delight!Libby Kimmelman is an Admissions Director for an elite K - 12 school in Manhattan. When admissions season rolls around, Libby finds herself on the receiving end of countless \\"gifts\\" of flowers, candy, etc., but she is scrupulous to maintain objectivity.Libby, a single mother with a 13-year-old daughter, is in a financial bind - she has to buy the Upper West Side apartment she has lived in since her daughter was born or else move to Queens (banishment indeed). Her ex, a big-time lawyer, may or may not help with the down payment, but Libby worries that her independence might be at stake if he does..Ned Donovan, newly relocated from Vermont, is surprised to learn that his 10-year-old son, Eric, has used his credit card to apply to the Hudson School. Eric's not thrilled with his public school, and he when he notices that the students at Hudson leave each day with smiles on their faces, he decides that is the place for him. Since Eric has never asked for anything before, Ned wants to ensure that he gets into Hudson, so he goes to the School to plead Eric's case to the Director of Admissions....What with truant daughters, gorgeous marble fireplaces, kibbutzing relatives, and a truly hilarious attempt at having a dinner party, Libby and Ned's road to romance is funny, endearing and fraught with anxiety. This is the Upper West Side, after all.Ms. Arnold is without peer in her ability to make the mundane occasions of life fascinating. Her dialogue is utterly believable. She never strikes a false note. And she is funny! She is so descriptive of the environment her characters inhabit that the reader feels she has actually been living in Manhattan right along with the characters who, by the way, are so on target that I finished the book feeling as though I'd made life-long friends.This was a great read - light and amusing; however, don't miss my favorite Arnold title, \\"Barefoot in the Grass,\\" a lovely, quiet book about two people falling in love despite the fears of one who has been seriously ill and another who must discover if he has it in him to love someone he might lose.Thank you, Ms. Arnold, for another great read. I hope the next one is soon on the way!"},{"Title":"The Fixer Upper (MIRA)","review":"Wow this book was bad. I am an avid reader--- everything interests me. (from Charles Dickens to Jennifer Crusie) But this book... the plot was rambling and repetitive. The characters unappealing (although the children were more three dimensional than their lackluster parents). I don't know how it made it thru publishing. Tedious, boring, and some of the metaphors... the heat in her womb? Give me a break. I always finish them (so as not to judge hypocritically) but this one was truly painful.

The plot line was OK, the children of the romantic leads added some interest, but here's the thing:the heroine spends the entire book just exhausted by her strenuous position in the admissions office of a private school (!!). Honestly, she is the most tedious woman! Just tired, and defeated, with no clue about her daughter. I lost interest in her right away, and skipped about the middle two hundred pages of the book. If you're looking for something comparable to the humor and engaging heroines of the books by Jennifer Crusie, or Suzan Elizabeth Philips - don't pick this one!!!"},{"Title":"The Fixer Upper (MIRA)","review":"...but Libby Kimmelman's not sure that Ned Donovan is for her.

Since these books are mostly composed of information sourced from the official factory publications the credit for the flawed information rests with VW.For example:The procedure to replace a headlamp bulb is incorrect but is the same as the information supplied in the owners manual. The book tells you to move a release lever upward and then remove the headlight case to replace the light bulb.If you try this on an actual vehicle you will find the lever seems stuck in the down position. If you force it up you will break it off. The book and owners manual do not mention that there is a checked plastic slot just to one side of the lever that must be pushed in to release the lever.The book and manual additionally do not mention that there is also a wire safety catch forward of the headlight assembly that must be released before the headlight assembly can be moved out of the car to service.Also this book applies only to the 1998 and 1999 vehicles. The warning to disconnect the battery before performing any work relating to vehicle wireing should be heeded but if the system voltage drops to zero the computers on the car will need to be reset and many of these functions cannot be reset by the owner. There are significant changes in the electronic controls on the year 2000 vehicles. In year 2000 models sold in North America they may not start even with the correct key inserted because a part of the anti-theft system is triggered by a dead battery and must be reset at the dealer before it can be started."},{"Title":"Volkswagen New Beetle 1998, 1999 : Service Manual, 2.0L Gasoline, 1.9L Tdi Diesel, 1.8L Turbo","review":"I own a 1.8L Turbo Beetle and was disappointed to find that this book DOES NOT cover the 1.8L Turbo Models.

This is to be expected, I suppose. Giving Elizabeth another child, giving her powers she never posessed and creating a Bathory family legacy that would probably offend any surviving descendants just to spice up the story is all well and good, but it is misleading. At the beginning of the book the author claims to have written a lot from fact, but I disgress- the story is what I'm supposed to be reviewing. It's an interesting story and it passes the time, but apart from that I can't give it more than a lukewarm reccomendation. The love story between the nun and our blind hero is sappy and sickly-sweet, but descriptions of Elizabeth's crimes, though exaggerated, can almost make up for it."},{"Title":"Signs In Our World","review":"My son is three and a half and is in love with this book.

In \\"Before I Die\\" a crime boss brings a blackmail case to Wolfe, never expecting to die. But just in case, he makes Wolfe the executor of his estate, thereby making Wolfe and Archie Goodwin the prime suspects in his murder. Wolfe's task: solve the crime boss's murder before he and Archie are erased by the boss's vengeful hit man. In \\"Help Wanted--Male\\" Wolfe blows off a prospective client who has received a death threat mere hours before the man's brutal murder. Then Wolfe receives an identical death threat. Wolfe is as concerned about the threat against himself as he was unconcerned about the threat against his prospective client. He goes to remarkable lengths to preserve his skin, makes the biggest blunder of his career, and discovers his mistake just in time by inspecting furniture. \\"Instead of Evidence\\" presents a situation where a prospective victim hires Wolfe for $5,000.00 to avenge his impending murder by his business partner. When the man dies horribly, Wolfe has a ready-made suspect but a paucity of evidence. It looks as though the killer will go unpunished, but at the last minute Wolfe gets the picture. At least two of these stories (\\"Before I Die\\" and \\"Help Wanted--Male\\") have been televised on the A&E series \\"Nero Wolfe\\" (long may it run)."},{"Title":"Trouble in Triplicate","review":"One of the 3 short stories herein is set during WWII, after those of _Not Quite Dead Enough_, the others in the 18 months following. Wolfe spent the war working for U.S. Army Intelligence. Archie was in the Army as a major, but couldn't wangle a transfer to a combat assignment; he was assigned to Wolfe, essentially doing his normal job, and General Carpenter said that's where he'd stay. General Carpenter and Wolfe's Intelligence connections appear occasionally after the war, as in _The Silent Speaker_ or \\"Home to Roost\\" in _Triple Jeopardy_.To date (the beginning of the 2nd season of Nero Wolfe), A&E; has adapted 2 of the 3 stories herein. I've sorted them here by chronological order rather than as they appear in the book.\\"Help Wanted, Male\\" - May 1944. Adapted for A&E;'s 2nd season. Wolfe isn't taking any private cases while working for Army Intelligence (and anyway, Archie is technically in the Army rather than doing legwork for Wolfe in his private capacity). When Ben Jensen (having met them during the court-martial of a man selling Army secrets for political purposes) comes to Wolfe asking for help after receiving anonymous death threats, Wolfe turns him down - although he would anyway, since there is ultimately no protection against a determined assassin. It's material, though, because Wolfe himself receives similar threats after Jensen's murder. (Granted, his first reaction is that Archie provided these last as a gag.) Then when Archie gets to Washington to request a combat assignment yet again, he sees a *very* unusual newspaper advertisement, seeking someone matching Wolfe's description.\\"Instead of Evidence\\" a.k.a. \\"Murder on Tuesday\\" - October 1945, 1 week after Archie is officially out of the Army. Many attempt to hire Wolfe to keep someone from killing them, but none have ever been accepted - because a sufficiently determined killer can always succeed (and with enough patience, maybe not even be caught). Eugene Poor owns half of Blaney & Poor, manufacturers of novelties, but Blaney is determined to get sole control without paying full value for Poor's half - so Poor says. Mrs. Poor would rather see Eugene sell out for a pittance than run the risk of being murdered. Wolfe, in the end, undertakes only to see that the cops are tipped off properly if Poor is murdered - and the neatly typed list of facts is called for before bedtime by Cramer of Homicide, now that a bomb disguised as a cigar has blown Poor's face off.\\"Before I Die\\" - Adapted for A&E;'s 2nd season. 7-8 October 1946, when Wolfe is desperate for a controlled substance - meat, under post-WWII rationing. Another desperate man - Dazy Perrit, king of the black market - can provide a quid pro quo, if Wolfe can protect his daughter. Even Beulah herself (through a combination of circumstances) doesn't know that Perrit is her father, but some of his underworld associates have been trying to find her, so he hired Angelina Murphy to play the role of daughter. \\"Violet Perrit\\", however, has become greedy, blackmailing Perrit by threatening to expose the charade. He's come to Wolfe to get him out from under without endangering Beulah.The title quote is actually from Archie, who's really scared by this case, since they now know far too much of a dangerous man's secrets for comfort."},{"Title":"Trouble in Triplicate","review":"Trouble in Triplicate is a collection of three novellas. The common theme in each is that a man is murdered shortly after visiting Wolfe.Before I Die: The first story begins with gangster Dazy Perrit telling Wolfe that he has been hiding a daughter who would be in danger if rival mobsters knew where she was. Perrit has hired a girl to impersonate his daughter as a decoy but she has begun blackmailing him with the secret he hired her to protect. After Perrit is murdered, his gangland friends suspect Wolfe and Archie in the crime. Archie is more worried about staying alive than solving the case, but Wolfe is unperturbed.Help Wanted, Male: Ben Jensen receives an anonymous letter in the mail threatening his life. He comes to Wolfe for help, but Nero turns him down flat. When Jensen is killed hours later, Wolfe is unconcerned. Until he receives an identical threat the next day. This leads him to hire a body-double... no mean feat for a man of Wolfe's dimension. Using the man as a decoy, Wolfe tries to solve the murder before he can become the next victim.Instead of Evidence: Eugene Pool and his wife Martha state that his business partner is about to murder him. Pool gives Wolfe $5,000 not to prevent the death, but to catch the murderer if it happens. When a cigar fatally explodes in Pool's face that afternoon, Wolfe is forced to earn the money, however reluctantly.All of the books containing multiple stories are built around some theme or other, but this one may be a bit too strong a connection. There's something a bit repetitious as each of these men is not only killed, but Wolfe doesn't really want to investigate any of the crimes until circumstances force the issue.Fortunately, each of the tales is entertaining enough in its own way. It also helps that the cast of characters varies considerably and so do the specific circumstances of each crime. The humor that characterizes the series is solid, if not quite at its best.Trouble in Triplicate is a good collection of Nero Wolfe stories. Each story is about 70 pages long so there aren't a lot of slow parts, things tend to move right along. Veteran fans of the series should be happy with it. Those looking for their first look at the corpulent detective might do better to start withBlack Orchids (Nero Wolfe Mysteries)if looking for a compilation orSome Buried Caesarfor a full-length novel. Both exhibit Rex Stout's writing at it's finest."},{"Title":"Trouble in Triplicate","review":"Two of these - \\"Help Wanted, Male\\" and \\"Before I Die\\" - were made into an A&E; episodes. All three of them, though, were more than strong enough to be adapted successfully.\\"Help Wanted, Male\\" happens during WWII, when Archie is a major, and Wolfe has volunteered to help military intelligence. Archie is assigned to Wolfe, which he does not like, but cannot get General Carpenter to reassign him.A&E; really bungled this badly. Rex Stout was a patriot, and, while a libertarian, would not have wanted to depict the military as A&E; did. None of the senile, babbling foolishness demonstrated by Gen. Carpenter is depicted in the story itself.The story is strong, innovative and clever, with good character development and imagery.\\"Before I Die\\" was also adapted for A&E;'s 2nd season, to somewhat better effect. Wolfe is more sympathetic to organized crime here than anywhere else, because he believes that he can get fresh meat in deiance of rationing requirements. We are all slaves to our own appetites, and Wolfe is no exception. It's a clever plot line, although the gangland depictions do not ring very true. The characters here, though, are not as well formed; A&E; actually beefed them up a little for TV.\\"Instead of Evidence\\" - A&E; did not try this one, perhaps because of limitations on their special effects budget. Read the story to see why..."},{"Title":"Trouble in Triplicate","review":"I like Nero Wolfe novellas, whereas I have read reviews where people prefer his longer work. I think they are both equally as fun, and sometimes the novellas are a bit faster paced. I recommend it to any Nero Wolfe reader, or someone who likes character driven novels."},{"Title":"Trouble in Triplicate","review":"the Nero Wolfe stories in this collection do not disappoint the reader, they are a very good read. Very thankful for the entertainment, renewing my love for reading."},{"Title":"Trouble in Triplicate","review":"I don't enjoy Rex Stout's novellas as much as I enjoy his novels, but I thought this set of three was better than most. The first story involves a gangster client who has a daughter the world doesn't know about: he wants to protect her from a rival gangster, who has discovered her existence and threatens her. Wolfe is willing to work for the gangster because Wolfe is craving meat, but there's a meat shortage due to the War. The gangster, however, has connections and can get Wolfe the meat.The second story involves characters from a previous collection. It's particularly enjoyable because, when Wolfe receives a serious death threat he sends Archie out of town and when Archie returns, there's somebody else sitting in Wolfe's chair, pretending to be Wolfe: the fat detective has hired a stand-in.The third story centers around two business partners, one of whom wants to buy the other out at a mere 10% of the value of the business. The partner who doesn't want to sell for 10% feels he will be murdered. In fact, he is murdered: by an exploding cigar. It's up to Wolfe and Archie to determine if the surviving partner committed murder.An enjoyable collection."},{"Title":"Trouble in Triplicate","review":"I love Nero Wolfe mysteries, and this is one of my favorite trio of Nero Wolfe novellas. I will not attempt to review the work itself, rather I feel compelled to comment on the Kindle Edition's few, minor short-comings. The Kindle text was obviously scanned in from a printed source. It may have been spell-checked, but it was evidently not read by a human proofreader.At location 765, I was surprised to find that Wolfe was described as being dressed in \\"... yellow silk pajamas and yellow suppers with upturned toes.\\" Really? Wolfe was wearing his food? Interesting ... And again, at location 1,412, Archie complains to Cramer, \\"You scold us when we He, and you scold us when we tell the truth.\\" There are other unsettling instances as well, things which should not have been allowed to make their way into any edition in any media, and would not have passed a human proofreader. The above two instances are clearly a common scanner problem of reading the letter ell: \\"suppers,\\" is, of course \\"slippers,\\" and \\"... when we HE,\\" is clearly \\"... when we lie.\\" I can understand a scanner's difficulty with these characters, but I really cannot understand why no one proofread the Kindle edition before offering it for sale. A published edition is, after all, a published edition, and even Kindle books should be held to the the highest standards.This observation being made, I am quite pleased to be able to tote a variety of Nero Wolfe mysteries with me in the convenient Kindle format!"},{"Title":"Trouble in Triplicate","review":"While I'm a longtime Wolfe fan, this is the first time I've read him in a short story collection. It really worked for me. Fritz, Archie and Wolfe are all in fine form. The truncated storylines do not mean diminished character involvement. The plots are tense, the villains are neatly and economically drawn. I had a fine time with it."},{"Title":"Trouble in Triplicate","review":"Rex Stout had important duties in World War II, so he apparently couldn't devote much effort to the first two of the three stories here, and it shows. (It also shows how much effort he put into his better stories, something his imitators don't seem to manage.) The third, set shortly after the war, is less bad, but still weak. As (minor spoiler) Inspector Cramer notes, the murderer is an idiot, which is how Stout got the plot to work. But it has certain points of interest for completists; the tone is slightly coarser and more real than in most of the other Wolfe stories."},{"Title":"Trouble in Triplicate","review":"Classic American with the two awesome characters of Nero and Archie.

This is the most useful book on joinery I have read to date. It's not the prettiest (no color photos), but I find Sam Allen's several years' experience working in a furniture repair shop to be invaluable. He has seen many failed joints and analyzed the cause of the failure, and he describes these in the book. He describes the forces that joints are subject to, and how to design for them. The book is well-organized, and the drawings of joints are very clear. I disagree with a previous reviewer that methods are not shown...actually handtool methods and machine tool methods are both shown. Probably not every method known to man (you wouldn't be able to lift the book), but I think if you can see a drawing of a joint and read a description of it, you should be able to figure out how to cut it...that's part of the enjoyment."},{"Title":"Wood Joiner's Handbook","review":"Many possibilities, different ways and methods of joining wood are beautifully illustrated in this book.

Don't get me wrong, the photos work well to support the text but they are some times &quot;muddy&quot; black and white images (I'm a photographer so I tend to be picky about this sort of stuff.). I am relatively new to joinery and find this book one of the best I've read - and I've read probably close to fifty woodworking books in the past several months.If you are new to joinery like me I think you'll find this book one of your best tools.Have fun."},{"Title":"Wood Joiner's Handbook","review":"this is a fine book if you are looking for constructing a house using Japanese type joints on your wood. Maybe it was my mistake but I was hoping to get more joints used on furniture rather than house building."},{"Title":"Wood Joiner's Handbook","review":"Overall, I didn't like this as much as \\"The Joint Book\\" by Terrie Noll and some others. There are some good drawings and useful methods, but it wasn't great.Chapter 15, however, added something sorely lacking in most joinery books. It's titled \\"Joints from China and Japan\\". Simply amazing. I've since ordered several books on this subject and am trying (slowly) to learn."},{"Title":"The Yellow Room","review":"All ingredients of a first class Mary R. Rinehart are displayed in the first pages of the Yellow Room. A huge house in the country, belonging to a wealthy family : the first daughter is a \\"jet-set\\" woman, far from ordinary human feelings ; the second daughter Carol, the heroine, is more engaging, unaffected, a lovely girl. It seems the boy she was engaged to was killed in the Pacific, but it's not so sure. Her brother is a WWII hero, but it appears there's something not so clear in his past. The corpse of an unknown young woman is found in the house, and we discover she's connected with the family. Incidents and accidents, attempts of murder and murder occur more and more often at night, and the police net closes on Carol. Well, of course, here comes a man, an ex soldier but not a super-hero, who'll help Carol and solve the mystery. The girl falls obviously for him, and all's well that end's well, but there's no preciousness in the story. The conclusion, as always, is unexpected and great. Old fashioned, yes, but to be read with great pleasure."},{"Title":"The Yellow Room","review":"I personally love mysteries set in the \`40s and earlier with a female heroine. This fits the bill! I love the details of the era and the writing style that comes along with writing in that time period."},{"Title":"The Yellow Room","review":"Mary Roberts Rinehart wrote some terrific mysteries dating back to the early 1900's. The Yellow Room, originally published in 1945, is one of her best. It is old-fashioned in a good way. This is a classic and very entertaining example of the mystery genre. There is a pretty young girl, a murder, suspects and intrigue involving the young woman's family and, of course, a dashing war hero in love with the heroine and only too willing to use every means at his disposal to get her out of the jam and solve the mystery. Rinehart creates a fun and exciting atmosphere for mystery lovers to enjoy, as well as a pretty good brain teaser.Young Carol Spencer is a likable heroine trying to recover from the loss of her fiance in the South Pacific. She longs to keep busy and wants to make herself useful in the war effort. She has been forced to care for her mother, however, as her selfish sister Elinor is too busy in her society functions to help. When Carol leaves New York for Maine to open up their home there, she discovers many unsettling mysteries.Lucy, the maid, is mising, and it is discovered that she is in the hospital with an injured leg. Someone chased her in the night and she fell down the stairs. Someone has been staying in the yellow room, even though no one was living in the Spencer's Maine home. Worse, there is a very dead young woman in the closet. When it is discovered that she came there asking for Carol, she becomes a suspect in the eyes of the local police.Dane is the war hero staying next door while he recovers from a leg injury before going back to his men. His past is a bit of a mystery also, and his meddling in the case is unappreciated by the local police. Carol doesn't know who to trust, and when her brother, a war hero as well, arrives, the mystery becomes murkier.Her snotty sister's car was seen the night of the murder, even though she was supposedly in New York. Was Carol's brother involved somehow? Who has been stealing her mother's fine china from the house? What was the dead girl's relationship to her brother and sister? Dane uses every man and instinct at his disposal to root out the killer and get to the bottom of things. Shots in the night and the mysterious actions of someone unknown, yet moving easily among her Maine neighbors, spell danger for Carol.The mystery is old-fashioned and so is the romance. Dane loves Carol before there is even a kiss. He puts himself in harm's way even though his future is uncertain, not wanting to put Carol through a long wait, and perhaps break her heart once again. This is very much a mystery where you can sense WWII and the changes it made in young men. The mores of a bygone era are in the forefront in this enjoyable and atmospheric mystery from one of the greats in the genre. For those who enjoy their mysteries in this vein, The Yellow Room is a lot of fun."},{"Title":"The Yellow Room","review":"That's what Agatha Christie had Hercule Poirot to state in one of her own great cozy murders, \\"The Clocks,\\" (1963). I agree with Agatha, (and with Hercule).Mary Roberts Rinehart was known for her complex plots and surprise endings (\\"Had I but known!\\") and this one is no exception. I also especially enjoy her mysteries because she almost always shifts the focus of the plot on to some edifice, usually a semi-spooky summer home, as the scene of her various cozy murders.In this case, a young woman is murdered and found, partially burned, in the summer home of an aristocratic lady, (the latter being yet another chief feature of Rinehart's stories). At first, the prime suspect appears to be evident but as the story evolves, the reader sees that there are others who might want this mysterious lady out of the way.Mary Roberts Rinehart lived from August 12, 1876 to September 22, 1958. She wrote \\"The Circular Staircase\\" in 1907, a spectacular mystery which launched her to national fame. That work sold over a million copies and is still a good seller today. \\"The Red Lamp\\" (1925) is another of her more compelling mysteries.\\"The Yellow Room\\" was written in 1945 which conveniently allowed Rinehart to produce the most sympathetic of all prime suspects: a military flyer. This is one whodunnit which pretty much stumps even the most ardent of mystery readers in their efforts to anticipate the ending. It's my favorite of all time.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Yellow Room","review":"This is a great old fashion murder mystery, which is my favorite type. It was quick and enjoyable, I look forward to reading more by this author."},{"Title":"The Yellow Room","review":"Mary Roberts Rhinehart never fails to deliver a great story, filled with characters who elicit emotional reactions from her readers. This story is set in the midst of World War II; Carol Spencer's fiance has been reported missing in action, presumed dead, and she's traveling by train with her mother from Manhattan to her sister's house in Newport, RI, and from there to the family's summer home in Maine. When she arrives in Maine with only one servant, she discovers that the staff in Maine is not around for various reasons, and then discovers evidence of murder in the yellow bedroom. Typical of Mrs. Rhinehart, the book takes several twists and turns before reaching its satisfactory conclusion."},{"Title":"The Yellow Room","review":"It\`s the middle of World War II. The setting is the Spencer family\`s sumptuous summer house in Maine. Young Carol Spencer has gone ahead of her family to open it up for the season, with a cook and two maids. But nobody meets them at the station. When they finally get to the house, the housekeeper is missing, nothing is ready, and the phones have been pulled out.On top of all this discomfiture, one of the maids finds a body in the linen closet!Two parallel searches for the murderer are soon underway. Floyd, the self-important village chief of police, would enjoy pinning the crime on a member of the wealthy Spencer family. But Jerry Dane, recovering from a war wound in the neighborhood, intends to look deeper. Dane is a mystery man - handsome but unsociable, watched over by a another wounded soldier.Dane is delighted to have a puzzle to unravel while he convalesces. But matters get complicated when he begins to fall in love with Carol Spencer.The convoluted plot is a feast of cover-ups, accidents and misdirected suspicions. Just about everyone seems to carry a gun, and the guns go off rather easily. Everyone smokes incessantly, too. The rapid-fire dialog has flashes of humor.I enjoyed the portrayal of upper-class civilian life during wartime: rich people suffering from the lack of servants, no porters at the train stations, grave shortages of gasoline and gardeners, complaints about rationing and thin cream.Mary Roberts Rinehart has been called the American Agatha Christie. I find her less polished than Christie, and her characters more on the surface. But there's a dashing American quality to her writing that has its own unique appeal. The Yellow Room makes me want to read more of Rinehart. I'd definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"The Yellow Room","review":"This book is vintage Mary Roberts Rinehart -- upper-class family, grand summer home, all kinds of surprises and plot turns -- with an observant heroine who rises to the occasion and ends up escaping her stifling life as well.

What was unique about this book was its appearence during his presidential campaigns. It stood out and well against the more typical rush biographies or issues books many who run for the presidency squeeze off the presses and hand out to anyone who will take them in Iowa, New Hampshire and Delaware.The size of Alexander's booklet increases the chance that aspiring pols will actually read it.

The all-encompassing success of German writer Cornelia Funke's \\"The Thief Lord\\" has certainly garnered the most attention, but a certain amount of credit should be handed to British writer Mary Hoffman as well. After all, she's the one responsible for \\"Stravaganza: City of Masks\\", the first in her Venetian minded \\"Stravaganza\\" series. A writer adept at evoking the most romantic and mysterious elements of Venice's past, she is slightly less than able at plot and moral aptitude. But with a package as beautiful as \\"City of Masks\\", it's doubtful the reader will really care.Hoffman's premise is, initially at least, a shaky one. Lucien is a boy recovering from the chemotherapy that comes with his cancer treatments. He's fifteen years old and one day receives a gift from his father of a beautiful blank book with marbleized covers. Lucien falls asleep with the stories of Venice his father has told him, only to awake in a world that is like and unlike Venice itself. This is Bellezza, a canal based city ruled by a ruthless leader known to all as the Duchessa. Here Lucien (or, to the people here, Luciano) is free from disease. It seems the mysterious book he held is the answer to this mystery of stravagation (the means by which a person travels between two worlds). While he is in Bellezza, Lucien's other body remains in his own world in a kind of coma. In no time, the boy finds himself in the center of a political thriller involving the Duchessa, assassination attempts, masked balls, mirrored rooms, and a villainous family that will stop at nothing to gain power over the land.As I said before, Hoffman has created her alternate land perfectly. Here, silver (rather than gold) is the metal of the most worth. Words are slightly different and what we would call magic in our land is considered science in theirs. There's a lot to love in this story as well. From the idea of using lace as a means of secret messages to a permanently masked ruler that will kill anyone who sees her face. But to be truthful, it was the Duchessa herself that was the biggest problem the book had. Hoffman works very hard to make it clear that the Duchessa is brilliant and beautiful but utterly ruthless. When we first meet her we know that she is, at least, a sexual predator. She chooses her gondoliers (here called mandoliers) from the handsomest young men in the city to be her lovers. For a moment it almost looks as if Lucien himself will be roped in as one of her many partners, though this idea is quickly averted by the author. Soon, however, it's clear that the Duchessa hasn't any problems at all with coercing the ones who love her into doing her bidding and that torture is a routine form of getting answers out of prisoners. The final straw, for me, was when the Duchessa knowingly leads a stupid if simple-minded girl to her death and then feel zippo remorse about the fact. The horrible thing is that the reader is supposed to be unequivocally on the Duchessa's side through all of this. Lucien thinks several times how happy he is to not be the Duchessa's enemy. I suppose this is supposed to be some sort of relief to the reader as well, but it just means that our hero has allied himself with a different kind of evil. If Hoffman acknowledged that the ruler of Bellezza was evil or twisted it wouldn't be so bad, but she stands firmly behind all the Duchessa's decisions. The Duchessa's closest equivalent in children's literature might be Mrs. Coulter from the \\"His Dark Materials\\" books by Philip Pullman. The difference being, of course, that Pullman had the guts to acknowledge that Mrs. Coulter was evil if also containing the capacity for change. Hoffman fails to make this concession and the book is weaker as a result.Just the same, this is a fun read. Ignoring the Duchessa, all other plot points and moments in the story are enjoyable and lovingly rendered. I can say with certainty that you will look forward to reading the other books in this series after reading \\"City of Masks\\". And I give Hoffman points for including a note on the science of Stravagation at the back of the book. If nothing else, she is very adept at keeping her book free from loopholes or mistakes in the narration and storyline. Also, of the four websites Lucien explores in this book, one of them (VirtualVenice.com) does actually exist. I highly recommend it as well. From this book's beautiful cover design to its gorgeous descriptions and well-wrought characters, readers will be clamoring for more. They are certain to be pleased."},{"Title":"Stravaganza City of Masks","review":"I loved this book.

I am reading the sequel to it. If you do not like this book, (...)."},{"Title":"Stravaganza City of Masks","review":"\\"City of Masks\\" is imaginative, and could have been fantastic if not for a few major flaws.First of all, the premise of the book really doesn't make sense. Authors can often get away with a faulty idea if they do a good job convincing the reader with details and explanations to back it up. However, as Lucien \\"stravagates\\" between our world and Talia, the only explanation Hoffman offers is that the concept of stravagation is relatively new, even to the Talians, and that its subtleties are as yet unknown. Sorry, but that just doesn't cut it. There are so many unanswered questions about this phenomenon that \\"City of Masks\\" poses, that I won't even begin to list them here.Secondly, Hoffman has little to no character development. Lucien, a typical British teen, has almost no apparent personality. And Arianna, Lucien's Talian friend, who is a major character at the beginning of the novel, disappears for about a hundred pages, and then resurfaces as a completely new person. Even at the end of the book, the reader doesn't really have a good sense of her. Granted, some characters are more memorable, such as the devious Duchessa, and the sensible senator Rodolfo, but is it too much to ask to have a main character who is just a little bit interesting?Finally, Hoffman's writing style is not particularly dazzling. Some popular writers, such as J.K. Rowling, can get away with a mediocre writing style, as long as they make up for it with brilliance or creativity. Unfortunately this is not the case with \\"City of Masks.\\" In addition, Hoffman tells her story in a very disjointed fashion, switching points of view as often as every half page. This adds to the lack of characterization mentioned above, as Hoffman jumps quickly from one person to another.Overall, \\"City of Masks\\" is a fairly average book. I admit I was impressed by some of Hoffman's plot twists towards the end of the book, but the first 200 pages were fairly dull, and not very well written."},{"Title":"Stravaganza City of Masks","review":"Just look at the world around youRight here on the ocean floorSuch wonderful things surround youWhat more is you lookin' for?\\"--Sebastian the CrabThat's what came to mind after reaching the end of STRAVAGANZA--the fulfillment that enveloped me at the end of Disney's Little Mermaid. Come on! Tell me you didn't feel totally great after all of Ursula's evil schemes were thwarted and the two young lovers got it together? STRAVAGANZA is even better, because you get all that intensity and scary stuff, but you also get seriously strong female characters who don't intend to put up with any of that \\"only boys can do it\\" nonsense, and who don't go meekly mooning about playing with their \\"whozits and whatzits galore.\\" And on top of that, to provide a truly feel-good happy ending to a book about a boy with a brain tumor is certainly one masterful feat in itself!That boy, Lucien Mulholland, a young, 21st century resident of North London, is having a terrible time enduring chemo when his father turns him on to a salvaged old notebook with thin pages and a beautiful, marbled cover that comes from Venice. His father also tells Lucien stories of visiting that mysterious land of islands and canals in his own youth. But, when Lucien falls asleep and awakens in a Venice-like setting, it is not the city of his father's memory but, instead, a 1577 parallel version called Bellezza which is ruled by The Duchessa. Lucien's first contact in this new land is Arienna, a feisty girl his own age who has snuck into town dressed as a boy in order to be chosen to train as one of the Duchessa's mandoliers--the heralded guys who pole her royal mandolas (gondola-like crafts) around the city.\\"I can't stand this indecisionMarried with a lack of visionEverybody wants to rule the world\\"--Tears for FearsThere is a large cast involved in the palace intrigue that Lucien falls into when he unexpectedly arrives in Belezza. That intrigue involves a wealthy family trying to do in the Duchessa since she won't play ball and yield the City over to their megalomaniacal schemes. And don't think that the women have a monopoly on the smart-and-strong-yet-sensitive characters. Lucien acquires two great father figures in Belezza, one of whom speaks in Elizabethan English.The title, STRAVAGANZA, comes from stravagation, the time travelling that Lucien practices. This joyful and magical tale is the first volume of a trilogy. Hopefully, by the time Mary Hoffman completes the second book CITY OF STARS, the word will be out big-time and young readers will join me in wishing they could be part of that world."},{"Title":"Stravaganza City of Masks","review":"I love this book it's abouit a kid named Lucien and how he travels from world to world learning about other people and how he is in great danger.

The author intertwined many plots and sub-plots that all pop up suddenly somewhere to add suspense to the book.

Lucien is a boy with cancer who just had chemotherapy. When the chemotherapy was so bad that Lucien could not talk, Lucien's dad found and gave him a red and purple swirled notebook to write in instead of talking. When Lucien first received the book, he fell asleep with it in his hands and suddenly found himself in a city similar to Venice, Italy. Lucien looked around at the marble colonnade and thought he was dreaming. That thought changed when a boy about Lucien's age pulled him fiercely into the shadows and hissed, \\"Are you mad? You could be killed!\\" Normally a touch like that would have Lucien screaming in pain, but this was a different universe where Lucien was healthy. To confirm that this wasn't a dream, Lucien reached up and touched a head full of curly locks when just a minute ago all he could feel was a bald head from the chemotherapy. The boy that had pulled him into the shadow was taking off his clothes and mumbling to Lucien about how Lucien had ruined his plans that had taken almost a year to come up with. The boy was now stripped down to his underclothes and gave his clothes to Lucien. Lucien took off his changed into the boy's clothes and watched as the boy slipped on a dress and took off his hat. The boy was a girl! Lucien and Arianna introduced themselves and Arianna led Lucien down to a caf&eacute;. There Arianna explained to Lucien that today was the forbidden day to be on the island of Bellezza and they could be killed if the pair didn't blend in. That was why Lucien had to change into different clothes. After eating two crumbly pastries and two cups of chocolate, the pair headed down to a river and watched as the Duchessa picked new mandoliers. The Duchessa rules all of Bellezza and picks mandoliers to attend her school and eventually drive the boat the Duchessa rides in. When the Duchessa turns around and picks out a boy in the crowd, Arianna storms away. The boy the Duchessa picked was Lucien, the person who ruined Arianna's plans of becoming a mandolier. Every day, Lucien returns to his sick body and falls asleep to visit Bellezza. This book takes you through the journey of Lucien a sick and healthy boy at the same time.Mary Hoffman's style of writing is full of analogies and \\"juicy\\" words. She keeps the pace of the book at a comfortable speed and loves to switch scenes very quickly. This book jumps around a lot without losing the reader. I loved reading this book because it kept me wanting to read more the whole time. The characters were very credible and their actions were understandable. I also enjoyed reading this book because the plot kept on making exciting turns while keeping it easy to follow. I would recommend this book to people who love fantasies and like to keep reading the whole afternoon because they can't put the book down."},{"Title":"Stravaganza City of Masks","review":"This book was amazing and had me on my toes through most of the book.

I really felt for the characters and could visualize the settings. City of Masks is entertaining and exciting. I couldn't put it down. I loved all the characters and the unique settings. I finished the first book wanting more."},{"Title":"Stravaganza City of Masks","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect with the first book in Mary Hoffman's \\"Stravaganza\\" series, but what I got was a suspenseful, exciting, imaginative and satisfying tale populated by vivid characters and set in a beautifully realized alternative-world. If you enjoy the world-traversing adventures found inThe Chronicles of Narnia, then \\"City of Masks\\" and its sequels will be right up your alley.Lucien is recovering from intensive chemotherapy when he's given a marbled notebook by his father to help him communicate if his throat is too sore to speak. With the book clasped in his hands, Lucien dreams of a beautiful city of columns and fountains, cathedrals and basilicas, canals and courtyards - and even stranger, a young girl dressed as a boy who insists that he's in grave danger. Her name is Arianna, and she's disguised as a boy because she wants achieve her ambition of being chosen as a mandolier (what we would call a gondolier) to the Duchessa, sole ruler of the city of Belleza.Arianna tells Lucien that on this particular day, only citizens of Belleza are allowed in the city, and both of them are risking their lives by being there. Still convinced that the whole thing is a dream, Lucien tags along with Arianna to where that year's candidates are selected by the perpetually-masked Duchessa. In this world, Lucien's dark curly hair and handsome face have been restored to him, and both successfully catch the Duchessa's fancy.From there the story flows back and forth between the two worlds. By day Lucien succumbs to the aftereffects of his cancer treatment, but by night he is free and healthy in the wonderful country of Talia, the otherworldly version of sixteenth century Renaissance Italy (with Belleza standing in for Venice). He learns that he is a Stravagante, someone who has the ability to transport (or \\"stravagate\\") himself between worlds with the help of a talisman; in this case, the marbled notebook. Under the tutelage of the Duchessa's scientist and former lover Rodolfo, Lucien begins to explore his powers, and thanks to the companionship of Arianna, he learns more about the beautiful city of Belleza and the intrigue that seethes below its surface.From there things just get more interesting as Lucien finds himself drawn into the world of political espionage, assassination attempts and rival factions working against the Duchessa. With the added dangers of his stravagating abilities, Lucien struggles to help his new friends whilst retaining a relatively \\"normal\\" life the waking world.Mary Hoffman has written a fantastic story that ticks all the boxes of what makes a satisfying read: an interesting premise, a range of likable characters, a rollicking story, and a world that you wish you could explore for yourself. As many others have mentioned in their reviews, Hoffman's gift is her wonderfully rich and descriptive writing. You don't just read about Belleza, you visit them along with Lucien, and are just as impressed by its beauty as he is.Likewise, it's hard not to fall in love with her characters; not just the spunky Lucien and Arianna, but the wise and gracious Rudolfo, Arianna's long-suffering parents, the conniving Rinaldo di Chimici, and of course, the grand, charismatic, imposing, ruthless Duchessa. There's even room for the real-life historical figure of Doctor William Dethridge, a man who disappeared mysterious in 1556 after facing charges of witchcraft and who is here made out to be the first Stravagante to appear in Talia.Equally innovative are the rules and restrictions that encompass \\"stravagating\\". Whilst visiting Belleza in his sleep, Lucien's body remains comatose, meaning that it's only safe for him to stravagate at night when no one will notice. Whilst in Belleza, he has no shadow and so must be careful not to attract undue attention to its absence. Finally, the Stravaganti must remain a secret, for there are those that would exploit their powers to import technology and knowledge from other worlds that is far beyond their ability to control or understand. Naturally, each one of these problems are faced by Lucien during the course of the book.To top it all off is an unexpected and bittersweet ending that will stay with you long after you've closed the book. Much likePhilip ReeveandMeredith Anne Pierce, Mary Hoffman is a fantasy writer for young adults who is woefully unrecognized."},{"Title":"Stravaganza City of Masks","review":"A good friend had recommended the Stravaganza series to me, but now I wasn't sure it was such a good idea. I stood in the public library, having just read the excerpt for City of Stars.\\"[Lucien] struggles just to sit up, plagued with exhaustion brought on by the treatment for his cancer,\\" I read. Uh-oh. I hate books about cancer patients. I go out of my way to avoid them. I believe that books shouldn't make you deal with the things that happen to you in real life; they should help you get away from them temporarily. My sister had just been diagnosed with cancer, and I really, really, didn't want to hear about it any more. I read on and was increasingly disgusted as I realized that this was all probably just a crazy dream Lucien was having, brought on by chemotherapy. Let me just say, prospective readers: I WAS WRONG. Dead wrong.Lucien is actually going to the city of Bellezza in Talia (an alternate Italy). The friends he meets there --Rodolfo, Arianna, la Duchessa, Leonora, Gugliemo Crinamorte-- are very real. unfortunately, so is the power-mad family of Talian nobles called the di Chimichi. The di Chimichi ambassador to Bellezza, Rinaldo, and his far-too-clever spy Enrico will stop at nothing to get the Duchessa to join the Republic, under the authority of the Duke Niccolo di Chimichi...and it's bonus points if they can find out Lucien's secret along the way.As is to be expected from any book, I laughed with the Duchessa's (ever-so-slightly dirty) jokes, yelled with fury at Rinaldo and Enrico's schemes, shuddered deliciously at the action scenes and nearly wept in chapters 17 and 20. But there was more. I felt as if I had been to Bellezza. I have watched Rodolfo's fireworks from the cathedral balcony, I have made lace with Paola Bellini on Burlesca, I have cheered at the Ducal election and danced at Carnival.Mary Hoffman has created a masterpiece, a cinema-clear blend of humor, solemnity, action, magic and (very slight) romance. I was prepared for an Alice in Wonderland-type dream and wishy-washy ending; the true plot (especially the end) completely blindsided me."},{"Title":"Stravaganza City of Masks","review":"One of my students thought this book was terrific but since she isn't over 13, I said I would give it five stars for her. It has adventure and a bit of mystery. She said adults, boys, and girls would enjoy it. It's a good read-aloud."},{"Title":"Stravaganza City of Masks","review":"I read this book years ago when I was a freshman in high school. Now, I'm a 19 year old history major, and I still keep an eye out for any new installments in the series. It's a wonderful read, and a very intersting story line. I'm a big historical fiction lover, and I adore the fact that this book combines history with fantasy and real life. It's fabulous. Hoffman continues the story in the following books. Yes, the stories are all different, but she still manages to connect them in one way or another. It makes reading them that much more enjoyable. Arianna and Luciano make you want to enter Bellezza as well, combined with the author's description and the walks that her two main characters take. In a way, the reader can find some type of connection with each character. I HIGHLY suggest and recommend that you read this book if you like history and fantasy. There's a good balance of both without the fantasy being too overwhelming and overpowering."},{"Title":"Stravaganza City of Masks","review":"This is my 2nd favorite book of all time! First favorite you ask? That would be the next in the series- City of Stars. Mary Hoffman creates a beautiful and intruguing world that I want to visit myself! I want to meet the characters and have those kinds of adventures. Towards the end, the plot almost seems to be too unpredictable- or not so unpredictable, because it crosses your mind, but you think \\"No, that couldn't happen!\\" but it does. All in all- this is a MUST READ! They will make movies of this and you can be the first of your friends to have read it and force them to go to the movies with you."},{"Title":"Stravaganza City of Masks","review":"Personally, I'm not much of a science-fiction person, but with an intriguing plot like the one in Stravaganza City of Masks, it's more fiction than science. To myself, I must have thought, \\"Where's the science?\\" There are no mad scientists, but there is a man whom is researching many topics and can be considered a mathematician, astrologer, anything. The cover of the book has a nice appeal with a beautiful picture of the city at the bottom, and what appears to be a carnival mask in the middle that looks as though it is simmering like rainbow sequins. Although it seems to be an odd title, the plot sucks you in. This is one story you can't put down.Start with a man sitting alone in a dark room. He is flipping through a deck of cards trying to predict the future-note this is not an ordinary of cards. No matter what he does, the Death cards keeps popping up; not a particularly good sign. Change scenes. You find a boy lying in bed, currently going through chemotherapy. He's name is Lucien. David, the father, has given him a nice looking notebook covered with red and purple swirls. Soon tired, he falls asleep, clutching the book and is then transported to Belleza. Here he meets the man who was going through the deck of cards, Signor Rodolfo, who, like him, is a Stravagante. Stravaganti -Lucien and Rodolfo- are capable of traveling between worlds, like London and Bellezza, in two different time periods.The problem is that Lucien must keep the notebook with him and safe at all times. Lucien cannot let the Chimici family get it or there will be chaos and havoc. Lucien also must be careful because in this world, he does not have a shadow. Pretty odd if someone saw a boy standing in the sun with no shadow present. Hiding the fact that he didn't have a shadow was like protecting dust from a vacuum, not too easy.Lucien is now a Stravagante; or from a group called Stravaganti, and is capable of traveling between worlds. There he meets a Bellezzan named Arianna, for whom I believe he is developing feelings for. This is not a challenging book to read. Not a bad science fiction at all. One great book that I believe gets six out of five stars. Read it, if you don't, you'll never know what you're missing, just read it all right? Extraordinary, amazing, outstanding, and more describe this book."},{"Title":"Stravaganza City of Masks","review":"This book is about a 15 year old boy named Lucien who has Cancer. While he is ill , his father gives him a book that happens to be a kind of key through a portal that leads him into another world. This world is a couple centuries behind him, and the people of this world need him to save them. He is aided in this quest by Rudolpho, the Duchessa Silvia, Arianna, and Dethridge. Little does he know that the evil Chimici family are going to stand in his way.I enjoyed this book very much because it talks about the struggles of a boy with one of the deadlist illness's known to man, becoming a great hero. I love stories that show supposably weak and fragile people or animals overcoming their obstacles and leaping onto the back of the lion. Also there was much suspense and action in this book such as when the Duchessa was almost murdered by a man hired by the Chimichi's and man times when Lucien had to sneak into the other world and then return quickly so that his parents would not suspect him of any strange behaviors. Some things that made the book more interesting was that it was set in a place much like Italy. I got to learn more about the Italiens system of canals and boats that glide ever so softly across the glass that is the canal. About two structers where death sentances were carried out.My most favorite part of the book was when everyone began to find out that Arianna was not the daughter of a aged couple, but that of the Duchessa. Arianna is the kind of character that grows no matter what into what she was destined to be and books that emphasize these characters are the ones that I enjoy the most. So after Arianna was found to be the Duchessa's daughter everyone began to wonder about who her father was and I was very ,very curious also. This part of the book really made me want to read on, and thats why it's my favorite part of the book."},{"Title":"Stravaganza City of Masks","review":"Stravaganza; City of Masks is an excellent book. It counts as one of those rare books you stay up reading into the late hours of the night. I would certainly reccomend it to anyone who enjoys historical fiction or science fiction.When a young, cancer ridden, 21st century boy, Lucien, is thrust back in time to the 16th century, he hasn't the slightest idea what has happned. One moment he was in his bed, the next he was in a large, bustling city that resembled Venice, able to speak Italian. He is there on a forbidden day however. A young girl who is also forbidden to be in the city that day, Arianna, comes to his rescue. He explains to her that he doesn't know where he is or what has happned. She believes him, but is sceptical. She takes him with her to the grand event in the city, the choosing of mandoliers (gondoliers) by the Duchessa. Arianna feels betrayed when Lucien is whisked off in the blink of an eye to be a mandolier, which was Arianna's dream.

But will Lucien remember that he is still in his real world while in Belezza?This book is a great read for anyone who loves a good story with suspense; I liked this story because it really was a wonderful read with equal amounts of drama, action, excitement, and a good old-fashioned love story.Mary Hoffman leads the story very similar to Michael Crichton's Time Line, and Madeline L'Engle's, A Wrinkle in time. They all have people traveling between words, back in time or in the future.Luciano, (his name in Talian), comes in touch with many new acquaintances in Talia. Like the daring Arianna, and genius Rodolfo. He even becomes friends with the Duchesse of Belezza. This book may not be the best choice for any adult readers, but is great for teens.

I felt it was truly different from some of the other books out there. Venice is my favorite city of those I've traveled to and to read about Lucien's trip to Venice as well as the parallel world of Bellezza is wonderful. If you love Venice, this is a must-read. I really liked the character of Lucien/Luciano and it is hard for the reader to let go of Lucien when he dies in London. This novel is about court intrigue, power struggles, magic, history and, of course, stravagation (AKA time travel). Lucien travels between the two worlds as he clutches a notebook his father gave him. It is very suspenseful when he can't get back to his own world in time. And the suspense builds when his enemies steal his notebook. It is great to see how some of the characters get out of the predicaments they find themselves in. Some of the characters I really liked but I did find the Duchessa to be rather ruthless. To be truthful, there are a few times when the book is a bit slow moving (as the Publisher's Weekly review stated) but this shouldn't deter anyone from reading it. My thoughts are that you will sit down and read it every moment you can and thoroughly enjoy every minute. Mary Hoffman is a gifted author. If you don't know her picture book \\"Amazing Grace,\\" pick that up for your younger children. It is a modern classic, as \\"Stravaganza: City of Masks\\" is destined to be.

But Bellezza isn't without hidden dangers and Lucien gets caught up in efforts to save the city's Duchessa from enemies plotting to murder her and rule in her place. Lucien can travel between his world and Bellezza only when he is asleep and has the notebook in his possession. While in Bellezza he is free of his illness, enjoying complete good health. But what will happen to him if he can't get back to his own world in time ...?Mary Hoffman deals sensitively with Lucien's illness, making this fast-paced and enthralling time-slip novel very moving as well. While adult readers will know exactly what is going to happen to Lucien back in his own world, and this novel is intended for \\"young adults\\", it's likely to also have readers young enough not to guess so easily. The story is told in multiple viewpoint, which changes quite frequently, but the plot unfolds mostly through the eyes of the two main characters so few young readers are likely to be annoyed. A great read for young and not-so-young alike.Another reviewer here mentions the stunning cover. Unfortunately, the dull reproduction above doesn't do it justice.

His father finds a beautiful marbled notebook that's blank, and gives it to Lucian for him to write in. The notebook, however, is a tool used to stravagate -- or travel -- to parallel worlds.

In the book City of Masks a young boy named Lucien does. Lucien lives in London, England and is very sick with cancer. One day when his father brings him home a diary, he learns that he can travel to a different world. This other world is still in the sixteenth century, and is now known as Venice, Italy. The citizens there called it Belezza. Lucien is very confused when he first gets there, but soon he realizes that he isn't sick in Belezza. He meets a man named Rodolfo, and learns that he is a \\"Stravaganti\\" (which means that he can travel from Belezza to England). After many attacks in Belezza, he learns that being a Stravaganti isn't as fun as he thought it would be. I didn't like this book very much, but just because I don't like it, that doesn't mean you won't.This book was written for people ten and up. It switched around from one part to another, and younger children would have a harder time understanding it. \\"He began to dream of a city floating on the water, laced with canals, and full of domes and spires...\\" (in England) \\"Adrianna watched the whole procession from her brother's boat.\\" (In Belezza)The book included many characters. Some examples would be Lucien, Adrianna, and Rodolfo. There where many times were you would have to closely pay attention in order to understand who was speaking.The book was written in second person, and was easier to understand that way. \\"Much to her surprise, Adrianna was bored.\\"Although I didn't like this book very much, you might like to read it."},{"Title":"Stravaganza City of Masks","review":"City of Masks, the first book of a projected trilogy (does one even need to say that anymore when discussing fantasy?), is an \\"other world\\" novel, one where characters from our world can travel back and forth to another, in this case an alternate history 16th century Italy known as Talia. These travelers (and it works both ways) are known as \\"stravaganti\\", thus the series title. While this book takes places in this world's version of Venice (Bellezza), others in the series will range elsewhere (book two for example is set in an alternate Sienna).City of Masks is young adult fiction and has the thinness that one expects from books aimed at younger readers. One pleasant exception to this is the detail of the city of Belezza itself and later Venice itself as the main character first reads up on the parallel city then visits it with his parents. The physical descriptions of Belezza, its festivals, and some of its rituals and religion are all vividly drawn, allowing the reader to truly feel he/she is entering a solid place along with Lucien, the young teen main character.Unfortunately, the underlying magic which allows for Lucien's travel isn't handled as strongly. He enters Belezza via a \\"talisman\\", an object from Belezza brought by a Talian stravaganza to our world for this purpose. Beside the difference of four centuries between Talia and our world, the movement of time itself isn't always dependable; one may spend a day in the real world while a week passes in Talia. All of is covered a bit sketchily, as are other examples of magic (viewing mirrors, teleportation, etc.). The same scarcity of detail is evident in the discussions of the \\"brotherhood\\" of stravaganti, who are aware of one another and meet now and then. Young adult doesn't necessarily mean things have to be stripped down or simplified, witness the very detailed and precise explanations of magic in Leguin's Earthsea series or Harry Potter or more recently the Bartimeus series. This book suffers in comparison to those in its fullness and depth.Characterization is solid if a bit thin. Lucien, one of two main characters, has cancer in our world and so his journeys to Talia, where he is hale and healthy, are not simply adventures to be enjoyed but something much more important to him personally. On his first visit, he meets 15-year-old Arianna, a vibrant, headstrong girl who has little care for stultifying rules and regulations, such as ones saying only boys can be \\"mandoliers\\" (gondoliers for the Duchessa) or that young unmarried women have to wear masks. He also meets the Duchessa and Rodolfo, the Stravaganza who brought Lucien's talisman to earth and the Duchessa's lover and advisor.Lucien has entered Belezza at a time of great danger for the Duchessa, who is trying to keep her city out of the clutches of Talia's most powerful family, the di Chimici, who have managed to force all other cities under their rule. There is a lot of political maneuvering (including use of violence) between the Duchessa and the di Chimici ambassador, and Lucien finds himself repeatedly caught up in the middle, sometimes willingly and sometimes accidentally. On top of the politics, the di Chimici are aware of the Stravaganti (though not of specific ones) and wish to turn this ability to travel between worlds to their own nefarious ends. Like the magic, this facet of the book, the di chimici's knowledge and their purposes, suffers from being overly vague. The political infighting, however, is fully and clearly explained.So Lucien and Arianna find themselves taking part in the fight to keep both Belezza and the Stravaganti independent. Meanwhile they have their own personal issues to work out, both individual ones as well as the question of their own attraction to one another. Finally, there is Luciens' plight back home with regard to his illness.The female characters truly stand out as the more vivid and interesting, particularly Arianna and the Duchessa, though a few others as well stand out despite their small roles. Lucien's character is a bit weak and somewhat predictable, and Rodolfo as well isn't as strong a presence as it seems he's meant to be. The political intrigue is exciting and interesting, the background battle over the magic less so, mostly due to the lack of detail. Older readers will probably see much of the plot coming, but in a sign of some strong writing, that won't really detract much from some of the book's later emotional impact.Overall, the book is solid with its weaker points well-balanced by the strength of the rich description of Belezza. It isn't a great compelling start, but it is interesting enough and shows enough flashes to keep you reading along. The second book, City of the Stars, shifts locale and main character somewhat (though Lucien, Arianna, etc. all play large roles in it, just not as the major characters) but continues at about the same level. The plot is stronger and more compelling, the characters a bit less so, and the descriptions of parallel Sienna equally as rich as those of Belezza. If the third book can employ that same vividness with regard to the characters and story of the third book, it will be a winner. As is, City of Masks is somewhat recommended (more strongly for those seeking strong female characters), but it isn't as strong a young adult fantasy as some others out there, both classic and contemporary (such as Leguin's Earthsea and McCaffery's Dragonsinger series for older works or the Amulet of Samarkand and Gregor the Overlander for newer ones)."},{"Title":"Stravaganza City of Masks","review":"Not normally the kind of thhing I read, but recently caught my eye at a book fair.

Can't wait to read those, too!"},{"Title":"Stravaganza City of Masks","review":"This wasnt the most wonderful book I have ever read, but still worth my time. The books storyline was quite appealing but the book just didnt have that extra something to keep you interested the whole time. My advice is to read it, because many people find it appealing. If you want my advice for and awsome series of fantasy books, read the wind on fire Trilogy. Now those books rock."},{"Title":"Stravaganza City of Masks","review":"STRAVAGANZA: CITY OF MASKS, by Mary Hoffman, is a the first book in a brand new fantasy series which has all the signs of someday being a favorite. Through Hoffman's writing the characters and setting come wonderfully to life, and the result is a story that readers will want to revisit many times over, simply to drink in the magic.The story is spun around the character of Lucien Mulholland, a boy living in modern-day London of our world, where he is bedridden from being treated for brain cancer. When the chemotherapy makes his throat so sore that he cannot speak properly, Lucien's father brings him home a blank book with a beautifully marbled cover so that Lucien can write whatever he needs to say. However, when Lucien falls asleep with the book in the pocket of his pajamas, he wakes up to find himself in another world entirely. What's more, in this world it is as though he has never had cancer in his life.In Bellezza, a Venice-like city state in the country of Talia, Lucien finds himself swept up in the political undercurrent of the city, who's people and mysterious Duchessa are working with all their might to keep free from the clutches of the Chimici family. Lucien is taken in by the \\"scientist\\" Rodolfo, who explains thta the book was a talisman made to help people like Lucien travel, or \\"stravagate\\" between the two worlds. Lucien's companion and guide in Belezza is the beautiful 15-year-old girl named Arianna, who will wind up playing a bigger role in the city's fate than one would imagine.I myself had never even heard of this book up until my attention was caught by its flashy cover as it sat on one of the shelves at the local bookstore. Now, however, I look forward eagerly to the publication of book two so that I can revisit the world of Talia and stravagation, a world that has not yet left me after my first reading about it. I recommend this book to readers of all ages, for I think that this is one of the better books that has been published recently.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Stravaganza City of Masks","review":"Stravaganza: City of Masks by Mary Hoffman is the first of three books in a wonderful fantasy series.Lucien is sick with cancer; he cannot go to school or even get out of his bed, but when he receives an Italian journal from his father, his whole life changes. If Lucien holds the journal while he sleeps, his mind is taken to the city of Bellezza. When he is there, he is completely well, and the more he visits Bellezza the more real it seems. Lucien then finds out that he is able to travel between two worlds; he is a Stravaganza. The problem is, the more he travels to this extraordinary city, the more he seems to vanish from his own world and his family. Will Lucien continue to travel between the two worlds or will he be stuck in a world that he barely knows forever?I loved this book and can't wait to read the next in the series. Once you start reading, Stravaganza: City of Masks draws you in and you just can't wait to see what happens. You can fall in love with all of the characters and you really start to care about them. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to escape into another world; people of all ages can enjoy a book like this!"},{"Title":"Stravaganza City of Masks","review":"My son was assigned this book for a 6th grade reading group and I came to amazon.com to find out more about it.I am writing this review in response to E. R. Bird's review. That review made me question the appropriateness of \\"City of Masks\\" for 6th grade group discussion. My concerns came from a)the use of the word \\"sexual predator\\" for the Duchessa and b)describing the Duchessa as the moral equivalent of Mrs. Coulter in Philp Pullman's \\"His Dark Materials\\" books.After reading \\"Stravaganza, City of Masks\\" I believe this book is indeed a young adult book (grades 5-7) and the content is appropriate for 6th grade group discussions. The Duchessa is characterized as typical of her historical period without too much detail. The book explores a 15-16 year old boy's struggle with cancer. The setting isn't perfect and the characters aren't perfect. It isn't a literary masterpiece but it is a fun read for a 12 year old.\\"City of Masks\\" is an action book that tries to gently discuss dealing with cancer. I think the author is good intentioned and the Duchessa is an unrefined tool of the plot. I liked this book, it presents some interesting topics for young adult group discussion."},{"Title":"Stravaganza City of Masks","review":"Lucien has been diagnosed with cancer. Undergoing chemotherapy is very tiring, and soon he finds himself falling asleep while clutching a beautiful notebook. Unbeknownst to Lucien the notebook is from a parallel world called Talia, similar to Renaissance Italy. Lucien finds himself in the beautiful city of Bellezza, similar to our Venice. Ruled by the powerful and beautiful Duchessa, Lucien soon finds himself being drawn closer into this world. But all is not right in Talia. The powerful di Chimici family is determined to take over all of Talia, and the Duchessa is in the way. Can Lucien help save the Duchessa before it's too late?This is my new favorite book! I absolutely enjoyed it! Part historical, part fantasy, part mystery, and part political intrigue, this book has everything. The author has crafted a wonderful mystery perfect for any fantasy lover. Check it out, it's really good!"},{"Title":"Stravaganza City of Masks","review":"Stravaganza: City of Masks, by Mary Hoffman, is a novel featuring fantasy, intrigue, romance and time-travel as it follows the adventures of a young boy named Lucien Mulholland and the captivating inhabitants of Bellezza.In his 21st century home in London, Lucien must undergo chemotherapy treatment in order to overcome his ever-increasing brain tumor. His father gives him a notebook in which to write in when his throat is too sore to speak and when Lucien falls asleep clutching the book, he is transported or \\"stravagated\\" to another world, a world in which beauty and pleasure mesmerize the beholder, while danger and deception lurk precariously among the shadows.Bellezza, comparable to a 16th century Venice, is a colourful city, rich with magic and political conspiracies and is the backdrop for this other world. When Lucien arrives in Bellezza he is as full of strength and life as he had been before cancer interrupted his lifestyle. But, there is danger from the very moment Lucien steps on to the island and he soon realizes that his life is in jeopardy. When he uncovers a plot to murder the Duchessa and overthrow Bellezza, both of his worlds get mixed up in the process and there is no turning back.A suspenseful yet fun read, Stravaganza is a book that I would recommend to most teenagers, even young adults. As page after page flew by, I realized how real this strange world had become in my mind. Mary Hoffman describes Bellezza in such a wonderful, riveting way that it almost became natural to me to think of women walking down the streets wearing elaborate masks tied back with satin.Although rather predictable, the well stated descriptions captured my attention and imagination and threw well rounded characters at my feet. The fact that this is the first part of a trilogy brings excitement to me and I am therefore encouraged to keep reading. A complex plot, an intriguing setting and characters overflowing with life make Stravaganza a book to be applauded."},{"Title":"Stravaganza City of Masks","review":"This is a new and exciting fantasy book about a boy named Lucien living in England.

As a mother who screens everything her 13-year-old daughter reads, I couldn't believe *my* luck when I came across \\"City of Masks\\" by Mary Hooper. By the first three pages I was totally hooked, and before I'd finished the first chapter, I'd bought all the Kindle-available books. As far as middle school literature is concerned, I haven't yet come across one since Cornelia Funke's \\"The Thief Lord\\" where all the colours, sounds and smells of Venice are so vividly described - and that is done this book way more so. My only gripe in the series is how each section switching back and forth between Bellezza, London and Venice is so abrupt - but I suppose it adds to the \\"stravagating\\" experience. Having helped said daughter with her research article on Isabella D'Este (\\"The Bed and the Throne\\" by George Richard Marek is an invaluable guide, sadly out-of-print) this past school year, too, I found some familiarity between that Italian historical figure and the Duchessa.Naturally, since the cover was so Mills-and-Boon / Harlequin-Romance, I had to screen it first, but the second said daughter got her hands on the first book after I read it, that was it: she went on to finish *all* the books on Kindle to date in one long reading spree! Happily, because we've always discussed the books we read together, she was actually able to tell me if all the other books in series are appropriate for her age (heh) - and the only thing that came up was a younger-than-currently-socially-acceptable engagement, on which the author took pains herself to comment.So, in fairness to our joint reviews, I, the mother, can only say I found the first book fine for middle-school: there was no inappropriate language, and the hints of romance between the 16-year-old protagonists were off-set by fantastic adventure and touching family moments. I am myself looking forward to reading all the other books in the series - while said daughter waits impatiently for \\"City of Swords\\" to be loaded on 21 August 2012 ... Said daughter's review of \\"City of Masks\\" follows:\\" 'City of Masks' by Mary Hooper is the first book in the wonderful \`Stravaganza' series.\\"15-year-old Lucien is a normal, everyday London boy - with cancer. When his dad gives him an old notebook, and Lucien falls asleep with it, Lucien wakes up - with no cancer, and in a whole new world and time - literally. And it couldn't have been a more dangerous time: during the celebration of the Marriage of the Sea, where the ruler, the Duchessa of Bellazza, must perform a ceremony to grant her people good fortune in the upcoming year. And only people born in Bellazza are allowed in the city to witness the ceremony. But then he is rescued by a boy who's actually a girl - and *she* isn't suppose to be in Bellazza either!\\"15-year-old Arianna has been planning this day for a whole year - this is the day when she's going to disguise herself as a boy and become a mandolier for the Duchessa, even though a) only boys can become mandoliers and b) Arianna wasn't born in Bellazza. But then her whole plan is ruined. Why? Because she was softhearted enough to save the cute-but-clueless boy who swore that he had no clue where he was.\\"Arianna and Lucien soon find out that Lucien is a Stravaganza - a person who can travel between Bellazza and the twenty-first century. And that little notebook? Well, *that's* his talisman, and without it he's stuck in Bellazza. And if he is stays in Bellazza for more than a day, his body in London will stop breathing. Add this to the facts that the Duchessa might not be all that she seems; Bellazza's age-old rival, the Di Chimici's, are trying to kill the Duchessa, *and* are trying to figure out the Stravaganza's secrets; Lucien-in-London's brain tumor is coming back, and you have the fantastic 'City of Masks.'\\"I got the first five books of the Stravaganza series at one go, and I am *sooo* thankful I did! 'City of Masks' ends in a cliffhanger, and the next four books are just the same. Of course, my favorite character was Arianna (I seem to have a soft spot for adventurous, always-getting-into-trouble type girls!) and Lucien was pretty cool as well.\\"I would give the book five stars: two stars for the plot, two stars for the characters and one star for the way that Bellazza is based on history, sort of, and the author tells you what is and isn't true. That is pretty cool - and it means that I can say, when my mum complains about me 'reading too much', that it's for history! :-)\\""},{"Title":"Stravaganza City of Masks","review":"\\"He turned the other way and looked out over the water, this is the most beautiful place he had ever been in. But a moment later, the dream changed completely.\\"Mary Hoffman's book, Stravaganza, City of Masks, is a fantacy about a 15-year-old boy named Lucien. He isn't expecting adventure in the hospital while he is having chemotharapy treatment for his cancer. It all starts with a simple, but very precious little notebook. When Lucien's dad gives him the notebook and Lucien falls asleep with it in his arms he enters a world of enchantment, danger and excitment. Lucien soon learns that in his new world he doesn't have cancer. He has discovered that he has landed in Bellezza in a time before he was born. Bellezza is a very attractive place with women wearing masks, gondolas being skulled down canals and and huge festiveparties. Lucien thiks that he has landed in a dram, until he appears in Bellezza several more times after returning home. As he explores his new world he makes friends with a caring scientist, a conciderate young girl and their friends. Lucien finds out that Bellezza has some pretty creepy people that are willing to do anything to to be able to go from world to world like he can with the power of his notebook. He also finds out that the Duchessa (ruler of Bellezza) is a very mysterious person. Can Lucien stay out of the way of these people who want his precious notebook? Does he find out what the Duchessa is up to and will he survive the cancer at home?This description of how Venice looked at that moment really paints a stunning picture in my mind. \\"The sky was an incredibile postcard blue, swirled with sudden flights of pigeons over the square and wheeling white gulls out over the lagoon. Elegant black gondolas bobbed on the water along the Piazzetta and the Saint and the winged lions stood on their tall columns guarding the city.\\" The words used to describe how the sky looked and the gondolas looked made me feel calm, like I was in Venice soaking up that gorgeous sight.Stravaganza, City of Masks is one of the most outstanding books I have ever read. I really got drawn into the story. It was suspenseful at times and I couldn't wait to find out what happened next. This story is a really excitng read for anyone who likes adventure, suspense, and fantacy. The ending wasn't what I predicted. If I could change the ending, I wouldn't because I enjoyed the suprise.

In Belleza he has no shadow and, more importantly, no cancer.Lucien is befriended by hot-headed young Arianna, and taken under the wing of Senator Rodolfo who reveals that he too is one of the Brotherhood of Stravangazas, travellers between worlds. Quickly the intrepid Lucien and Arianna become embroiled in conspiracies, affairs of state, assasination attempts, and magic.The premise is somewhat predictable - a teenager transported to another universe where s/he discovers special powers within themselves - but the execution is exceptionally good. The characters are well drawn and the alternate version of Italy is fascinatingly detailed and intriguing (for example, in Talia's timeline Rome does not exist because Romulus was defeated by his brother Remus, who founded the city of Remora instead).Hoffman writes realistic teenagers - reserved Lucien and stubborn Arianna are great foils for one another - and never underestimates or patronises her audience. This is a world with consequences: along with the adventures and triumphs, there is death and loss, and Hoffman acknowledges these darker aspects with a poignancy that avoids oversentimentality. A really excellent read."},{"Title":"Stravaganza City of Masks","review":"If your interested in time travel, you should read Stravaganza, City of Masks. This book was very exciting to read.

I'm on book 17 of 18 and they've all been sleep-stoppers for me.

If you are French or Spanish, you might be offended. I'm not sure women will enjoy these books as much as men, since there are a few cliche seens involving the hero and beautiful women that make the novels seem somewhat chauvinistic.

This book offers almost nothing in terms of branding your business in the B2B marketing, which is disappointing considering the title of the book.

There are many brief case study illustrations but not really any sort of systematic evaluation and dissecting of the the criteria used in determining the desired brand and the target audiences. As the author states, B2B marketing and branding is often made up of numerous influencers and parties involved in the decision. He missed an opportunity to describe these various parties for the each case, the various parties involved in the decision, the key factors of concern for each party (e.g., warranty, serice follow up, etc.), and how the company went about addressing these in its brand positioning and marketing strategy. Instead, most cases are general overviews with little indepth analysis."},{"Title":"The Case for B2B Branding: Pulling Away from the Business to Business Pack","review":"I'm the Director of Communications for a technology firm, so I don't have a lot of time for outside reading on my own time. But I ended up reading this book in one evening, because it answered some questions our company was facing.The 7 steps are good, but the real meat was the case studies. They showed how real companies approach branding, and I liked the down to earth, practical approach. My own firm is in the process of developing a corporate brand, and this book came at a much-needed time; it showed how businesses can target other businesses without a lot of \\"fluff\\" (which I hate), and instead had lots of \\"how it's done\\" (which I like).

What little else that's out there is academic sophistry written by professors who've never peddled anything other than a consulting gig or a research project to a business decision-maker. Lamons has been to the books and the battlefields. As a marketing executive, agency owner and American Marketing Association columnist, Lamons knows how to tell the \\"how to\\" in a way that inspires deep appreciation of the unique fundamentals of B-to-B marketing and an understanding of how to put those fundamentals to work, right now.

General Electric did it by building its brand identity around trust. When customers attribute such personality traits to a corporation and its brand, that attachment translates into millions of dollars in revenues. This is why corporate positioning and brand building is so important, yet powerful branding remains as elusive as the marketing Holy Grail. Author and branding expert Bob Lamons' road map to building your brand is a very usable resource for navigating your way to a brand strategy that works. Lamons breaks down the brand-building process step-by-step, from wooing management to finding a position to measuring the results. He avoids market-speak and illustrates his points with motivational anecdotes and case histories from business-to-business companies with successful brands. Lamons does seem to concentrate more on branding and less on B2B, but we feel this would be a welcome, well-used addition to any marketing professional's resource library."},{"Title":"The Case for B2B Branding: Pulling Away from the Business to Business Pack","review":"This is the best b2b branding book that I have read.

Lammons writes to that audience and knows it well -and explains patiently and with concrete examples why business-to-business branding is important, different, and can have a profound impact on the bottom line.

I fought getting into it but soon found the characters voicing thoughts and feelings that I had thought were only hidden inside of me. Maud's questioning of why people have children, on page 203, and Lizzie later on thinking how it would only take 2 steps to reach out and touch Jake really hit me hard. How we find and lose, build and break and rebuild relationships, whether they are with the family we are born with or the family we create was so right on. These relationships were so real I felt like I knew them and had been there. I saw my friend in several of the characters and, of course, thought of my sister and myself. There was the good stuff I see in myself and others but I also saw the underbelly and selfish side of myself and others in this book. WOW ! This was a book I couldn't put down but made it last through 3 days so I could savor it bit by bit. I finally finished the last few chapters in a deluge of tears and am ready to read it again with a clearer head, this time. I am so pleasantly thrilled to find a book I want to give as a gift. I wanted to write this review as I was reading it. I want to write Sands and thank her. If Laurie hadn't given this book to me, I would have given it to her. I look forward to what Sands has to write next. I look forward to that journey of discovery."},{"Title":"Catching Heaven","review":"&quot;Catching Heaven&quot; is a wonderful book that caught my interest from the first page and held it until the last. It relates the story of Maud, a disillusioned actress who has left the bright lights of Los Angeles, and her sister Lizzie who lives in the small town of Marengo, New Mexico. Maud, yearning for the stability of family and a more quiet life thinks she can find serenity in the desert with Lizzie. Lizzie on the other hand envies Maud's hectic lifestyle; after all, she has given up her dreams of being a successful artist and is the busy mother of three young children making a living painting pictures for a greeting card company. The interaction between the two sisters should strike a familiar chord in anyone who has grown up with a sibling that has taken a completely different path in life. But the book doesn't only tell the tale of Lizzie and Maud; we also meet Jake, the father of Lizzie's youngest child. Jake had left two years earlier for Nashville to try and break into the song-writing business. Unsuccessful, he returns to Marengo with the desire to become part of Lizzie's family. The three central characters weave their own interlocking tales throughout the book; Maud's chapters begin with Shakespearean quotes, Jake's begin with bits of poetry, and Lizzie's begin with &quot;notes beneath the magnets on her fridge.&quot; I can always judge how well I like a book by how easy it is for me to put it down. &quot;Catching Heaven&quot; was nearly impossible for me to leave; I couldn't wait to return to my friends in Marengo. I encourage everyone to buy this mesmerizing novel; devour it as I did, become a part of Maud and Lizzie's life, you won't be sorry you took the journey."},{"Title":"Catching Heaven","review":"Read Catching Heaven slowly.

The book deals with a most important issue in South America's history, which is the &quot;Cisplatina War&quot;, where Brazil and Argentina fought against each other, trying to incorporate a Spanish-speaking province to their own territory, against its province inhabitants will. It was a draw between Brazil and Argentina, and that province turned into our neighbor country called Uruguai. Well, when we notice that at the same time Belgium was created between France and the Netherlands, we see the huge political importance on what was held here, and why. The &quot;Cisplatina War&quot; was the final breath between portuguese and spanish expansionism on the River Plate, and the book shows pretty well all the important facts connected to it, the &quot;corsair wars&quot;, the battles, the campaigns, and mainly the skills, courage and struggle of the Britons (sailors, admirals...) in it, such as John Pascoe Grenfell (who lost an arm against the argentinians) and John Taylor, amongst others... A beautiful point in this book is that it also brings back the name of all british-brazilian naval heros, as far as it is actually taken for granted by most of our historians. You MUST buy it!"},{"Title":"A War Betwixt Englishmen: Brazil Against Argentina on the River Plate","review":"Hi, This book suprised me a lot, i started reading it with not much enthusiasm as this is not my favorite history era but i felt it wouldnt hurt to learn a bit more about my own country's history (Argentina). It surpassed my expectations, it is really well written and the reader cant get bored at any time. The missions and actions performed by both navies are incredible, it opened my eyes to this conflict between the newly independent and powerful Empire of Brazil against the smaller and recently independent provinces of the River Plate (Argentina). If you like navy battle stories or are curious about the history of South America you can't miss this book."},{"Title":"Notable Men and Women of Spanish Texas","review":"This book is a series of biographies of people who played important roles in the Spanish Colonial Era in Texas. The authors' thesis was that many different types of people had great impacts on the development of the state. They include saints and sinners, military and religious leaders, and even include a chapter on women. Chipman and Joseph use impresive archival sources to give a largely unbiased account of the era.The first chapter is about Cabeza de Vaca, the first Spaniard to survive and tell his tale about his years in Texas. He was shipwrecked near Galveston and stayed in Texas for eight years. His experiences were published, giving us an ethnohistorical view of many Indian groups otherwise lost to history. The second chapter is about Alonso de Leon who came to Texas looking for LaSalle and his French colony. The French were enemies of the Spanish at that time, so the Spanish were desperate to keep the French out of Texas. De Leon's searches and the fear of French encroachment led to real Spanish settlement in Texas. The third chapter tells about the two men most responsible for that fear and that settlement, Francisco Hidalgo and Louis Juchereau de St. Denis.The chapter on Antonio Margil de Jesus does not come right out and claim sainthood for the Franciscan friar, but tells of his accomplishments in New Spain, many of which appear miraculous. Two high-ranking Spanish officials, the Marques de San Miguel de Aguayo and Pedro de Rivera y Villalon had tremendous impact on how Texas was settled in the early 1700s.One of the more scandalous chapters is about Felipe de Rabago y Teran and his intrigues - including alleged rape and murder - before his supposed reformation and tenure as Captain of the presidio at San Saba. Another interesting chapter concerns Athanse de Mezieres, a Frenchman who worked for the Spanish dealing with the Indians. The Spanish era ended with Mexican Indiependence in 1821, and the authors include a chapter on one of the main filibusters trying to accomplish Texas independence from Spain, Jose Gutierrez de Lara, and the Spanish officer who dealt so segverely with such uprisings, Joaquin de Arredondo.The last chapter is on women, and tells about some of the more interesting women, including the fabled Woman in Blue who may have been a Spanish nun. This chapter also tells how the colonial Spanish women had many more legal rights than other colonial European women because of the Spanish legal system. This is especially interesting for anyone who is concerned with the role of community property.All in all, this is a well-researched, well-written book. It gives the information about these people in such a way as to keep the reader interested. If you want to know the kind of people who helped create Spanish Texas, read this book!"},{"Title":"The Black Death;: A chronicle of the plague, (Ballantine Books, 379K)","review":"Johannes Nohl wrote and compiled an interesting work entitled \\"The Black Death: A Chronicle of the Plague,\\" which revealed eye-opening contemporary accounts of the Black Death during the Medieval Europe. With roughly 270 pages and twelve chapters, this book gives one a new and shocking perspective on the history of the Black Death: the reactions of the people to the plague.The Black Death was one of the worst disasters in the history of humankind to which it killed off the third of the whole population, beginning in the year of 1348. And, this book brought forth the personal experiences and official documents to give the reader to deeply understand what the people of that ill-fated era were experiencing. Nohl's work is rather unique because of its degree to the aspects of historical, sociological, and geographical nature.The book begins with the aspects of the plague, including the victims and the deaths, to the causes of the plague, to which some believed it to be of a divine origin or other forms of superstitions or beforehanded seen \\"fateful comets.\\" Then, the author goes on to bring to light of the medical profession and its role during the plague, the detailed accounts that might prevent the plague, the precaution measurements by the Church and the governments, the role of the Church, and moral collapse and other elements. And, the rest of the book deals with the issue of persecutions of the Jews and their role, the issue of sexuality and the appearance of respectability where it \\"had disappeared after the terror of the Black Death had swept away not only all law courts and police, but had destroyed the last conventions of decency\\" (p. 207). Finally, the discussion of the role of flagellants and the personal accounts surrounding them during the plague, and then the author finally wrapped up the book with a brief aftermath of the plague where the \\"joy\\" returned.Personally, I found this book to be quite an eye-opening and shocking to which I felt it was very important for one to read the contemporary detailed accounts, both officially and intimately, from the people who lived through or died in the Black Death. When one read the history about the Black Death, a very little can be understood about the magnitude or the impact of the plague on the people until one personally experience the detailed graphic accounts from the people who lived and died during the deadly plague.I believe this book to be one of the most important works for the study of the Black Death because it surly brings the powerful lessons on how medieval people reacted to the plague and how the few survived such a worst disaster."},{"Title":"The Black Death;: A chronicle of the plague, (Ballantine Books, 379K)","review":"Analysis:The book is divided in 12 chapters. None of which are set to any chronological or geographical order. The lack of order, plus the authors \\"skipping around\\" made the book an unpleasant experience to read.A lot of the material was taken from letters written during the different plagues, in different parts of Europe and at different times. While this gives the reader a good source of first hand information, the letters are not organized in any certain order.One paragraph might be discussing the 1665 - 1666 plague that hit London and the very next paragraph be about a plague in Germany in the year 1348.There were a lot of changes that happened between the 1340s and the 1660s. It was difficult to keep the correct time frame, ideology, theology and technology separated.Another difficulty during the reading was the misspelling of common words. As mentioned before, a lot of the information in the book are direct quotes taken from letters written during the different plagues and at different times. Between the 1340s and the 1600s a lot of changes went on in the education system. So one letter from the 1350s might have a lot misspelled words, the next letter from the 1600s was written better, then the author skips back to the 1400s. The writing style was under constant change, making reading uncomfortable.Information contained in the book:A lot of the content contained in the book came from letters written during the plagues and at different times. There were several truths that were conveyed over hundreds of years.Whether the outbreak of the plague was in 1350, 1450, 1550, or 1650, the effects on society were the same. Every time period conveyed tales of love, passion, death, religion and destruction.The effects of the plague were so tragic, so devastating it is impossible to discuss them in their entirety here.Anyone looking for realistic, honest and accurate information on the plague should find this book to be a good asset.However, the author does not cite a lot of his sources. Example - on page 87 the \\"Plague Remedies\\" chapter begins. If the reader wanted to verify some of the remedies mentioned in the book, the sources are not noted. So independent verification of the information contained here in would be difficult.Out of 5 stars the book gets a 2.5 - 3."},{"Title":"The Black Death;: A chronicle of the plague, (Ballantine Books, 379K)","review":"Very interesting and touching compilation of a lot \\"historians\\" from different era's of the black death starting in de 1300's, but the plague over the centuries. It is amazing how fast the spreading was in villages and a lot of people also died of starvation because life simply stopped in the area. It makes you wonder this was not just spread by rodents, if at all. It seems more like a gas or airborne virus."},{"Title":"The Black Death;: A chronicle of the plague, (Ballantine Books, 379K)","review":"I read a book about the Black Death over 20 years ago .I can't remember the name of the author;but I recall that it was a good sized hardcover about an inch or so thick with a fair number of illustrations.What I remember was ; I thought it was very good ,but the thing that remained with me was the effect it had on the feudal system.Until the 1350's people felt that the upper class,aristocracy,feudal lords,etc.;were special and the common people were beneath them.When the Plague devastated Europe people saw the disease took everyone regardless of station in society and they realized they did not have to be subjugated to the rulers;therefore the feudal system collasped,never to return.In other words the Black Death created the birth of the free man.When I saw this book by Nohl,I thought it would be much the same.Actually this book shows the Black Death affected much more. It affected everything,how medical practioners were helpless,lawlessness,morality ,witchcraft,religion,family life cannabilism,persecution of others,children,music and dance;andthen after it had run it's course an explosive recovery occurred.The population increased rapidly,music and dance exploded,clothes became colorful,elaborate hair styles were everywhere and life became victorious again.This rapid recovery bore testimony to the indestructibility of the human race.Believe it or not;no matter how far humanity descends,there's always a light at the end of the tunnel."},{"Title":"The Black Death;: A chronicle of the plague, (Ballantine Books, 379K)","review":"The author approaches the subject from the different angles.

Many people who buy more than one guidebook end up liking this one best!Blue GuidesWithout doubt, the best of the walks guides.... the Blue Guide has been around since 1918 and has extremely well designed walks with lots of unique little side stops to hit on just about any interest you have. If you want to pick up the feel of the city, this is the best book to do that for you. This is one that you end up packing on your 10th trip, by which time it is well worn.Let's GoLet's Go is a great guide series that specializes in the niche interest details that turn a trip into a great and memorable experience. Started by and for college students, these guides are famous for the details provided by people who used the book the previous year. They continue to focus on providing a great experience inexpensively. If you want to know about the top restaurants, this is not for you (use Fodor's or Michelin). Let's Go does have a bewildering array of different guides though. Here's which is what:Budget Guide is the main guide with incredibly detailed information and reviews on everything you can think of.City Guide is just as intense but restricted to the single city.PocketGuide is even smaller and features condensed informationMapGuide's are very good maps with public transportation and some other information (like museum hours, etc.)Rick Steves' books are not recommended. They may be an interesting read but their helpfulness is very poor. They don't do well on updates, transportation details, or anything but the first-time-tourist routine and even that is somewhat superficial on anything but the mega-major sites."},{"Title":"Frommer's Road Atlas France, Fourth Edition","review":"At first I was like, \\"no way can they pull this off.\\" But after skimming through the first few pages, I could see that they really put their heart and sole into this atlas.

Satisfied with order, quality, delivery, and product."},{"Title":"Cheyenne Autumn","review":"I was really disappointed by this book. I had read \\"Crazy Horse\\" by Sandoz and was impressed. But not here. If there was ever a book that needed editing, detailed maps, a good timeline, a list of characters explaining their relationships, dates in the texts, and footnotes, this was it. This book had one map that was as close to useless as possible and a brief (one page) timeline that was hard to follow. I read a 1992 University of Nebraska publication. The writing style is convoluted. Plus there are so many characters here involved in some many different incidents that it was painfully confusing to try to figure out what was happening, what had happened to each character, when it happened, where they had been, and what their relationships were. I can't figure out why I labored to finish it. Reading this was like slogging through quicksand. I am sure that the tragedy of what happened to the Cheyenne is a great story, deeply moving and revealing. I just can't believe this is a good telling of it. My recommendation is to find a more enjoyable and informative book on this topic."},{"Title":"Cheyenne Autumn","review":"Cheyenne Autumn is a very educational book. I learned many new things about the Cheyenne and their way of life. It was so very disturbing for me to have to learn the actual hell these people were put through.

When the time came for a character to be introduced, I had already forgot who they were. The only other major problem I found was that I was very confused with the transitions of paragraphs. This novel jumped time periods between paragraphs quit frequently. I am the type of reader who prefers to know exactly what is going on and with who. When so many things are going on that I can't comprehend them all and understand them completely, I get frustrated. This story takes a lot of time to read because you have to read it slow. In order to read this book all of the way through, you have to want to read it and you have got to be patient. This is not the type of book someone should read because they have to.

She thoroughly reconstructs the characters and so completely immerses herself and the reader in events that reading Cheyenne Autumn is better than any movie or play could ever be -- you see and hear and feel as though you are part of the journey, rooting the Cheyenne on and on, and (even if you know going in know how things turn out) hoping against hope that the US government and the military will just leave the poor people alone. However sad the story is at its base (and it is tragic), the dignity and resourcefulness and love among the Cheyenne is overwhelming. Truly, they were the &quot;civilized&quot; people, and Sandoz conveys this without every stepping a foot on a soapbox. It's a must read for anyone who has an interest in Native American history or culture. It's also a must read for anyone who doesn't have such interests, because their ignorance will be washed away completely."},{"Title":"Cheyenne Autumn","review":"Mari Sandoz, one of the greatest American writers, amazed me once again in Cheyenne Autumn. A heartbreaking story of injustice and cruelty, Sandoz brings out the heart of the people through vivid imagery and insights that will make you feel you are on the trail with the Cheyenne.Sandoz sees through the heart, and in this remarkable book takes the reader back in time. The book does not simply recount a tragic story, but rather reveals a people's life and their struggle to regain it. I highly recommend this book to anyone concerned with the human condition."},{"Title":"Cheyenne Autumn","review":"I have tried to analyze how it is that Sandoz manages to take a story, the mere facts of which I have read many times, and make it so powerfully moving that you find it haunting you long after the book is finished. Besides her expert ability to write in the language of her subjects, she develops all characters to their fullest. We follow them through their every day lives, through their hopes and fears, and most of all through their relationships to each other, until we feel we have become a part of it all. When lives end, usually tragically, we not only feel the loss ourselves, but we grieve for the pain of those left behind. When I read Sandoz's biography of Crazy Horse, I felt each loss he felt, from the death of his brother, to the agony of the decision to bring his followers into the agency. In this book, when the Cheyenne died in their last stand, I felt as their survivors must have felt, both grieved at the loss, but proud that they had died fighting in the tradition of their people, Also, once again as with Crazy Horse, I felt, as no simple telling of the facts could get across, what a great mistake it was not to let these cultures survive, and how foolish and arrogant the whites were to spend lives, money and ammunition to keep a few hundred impoverished people from returning to their homeland."},{"Title":"Cheyenne Autumn","review":"I began reading this book expecting to plod through it but it was so compelling that I stayed up until dawn to get to the end. It is a sensitive, thought-provoking portrayal of the Cheyennes as they doggedly tried to resume their way of life after being carted of to a reservation in the Oklahoma territory. The book recounts how a group of them trekked 1,600 MILES to get back to their homeland in the northern plains. It is an exciting, intelligent and heart-breaking read. Looking at historical maps after reading this will never be the same. Forget Westerns and read this instead!"},{"Title":"Cheyenne Autumn","review":"Documents the flight of the Cheyenne from the Indian Territory in Oklahoma back to their home in the north.

To read is to absorbthe rhythms and images, to feel an illusion of becomingmore Indian as chapter follows chapter, to understand withan Indian mind the genocidal subjugation and impoverishmentof a tribe that hoped for peace.This is a story of chiefs, warriors, women and children. Itis a story of tragic misunderstandings, murders, fights,flights, and survival. Written in 1953, long beforepolitical correctness, and based on solid research and achildhood spent in the company of Cheyenne who survived thewars, the narrative does not indulge in cheap moraljudgements - the stories of the Indian men and women wholived and struggled and died cut straight into the reader'sheart in a way that is beyond judgement."},{"Title":"Cheyenne Autumn","review":"Sandoz does in this book what a hundred modern authors bound by Political Correctness could never accomplish.

As I read the book I felt that I was part of those unfortunate people, whose only crime was that they wanted to live their own way on their own land. Any student of Native American History must add this to their library."},{"Title":"Cheyenne Autumn","review":"Mari Sandoz writes with feeling about issues and people important to her. When she wrote this history of the last gasp, so to speak, of the Northern Cheyenne, she clearly felt deeply the injustice and tragedy of the way the West was settled by displacing and eliminating its indigenous people. Quite a remarkable feat at the time."},{"Title":"Cheyenne Autumn","review":"Ever since I saw the film Little Big Man as a child, I have wanted to read more about the Cheyenne. It was for this reason, with very high expectations, that I bought this book, now as an adult fascinated by history. It was completely satisfying, with clues about their culture, their fate, their system of values, and their behavior. The best part is: I feel very hungry for more.The story begins a few years after the battle of the Little Bighorn, when the Cheyenne have been taken to a reservation far to the south. They are starving, dying of malaria in a foreign climate, and bitterly disillusioned. On the strength of a promise that they could always leave - which was explicitly denied them when they tried to claim the right - they set out secretly to return to their homeland. The result is a brutal journey that essentially marks the end of their way of life, though some survived to live on reservations. As vengeance, they kill on their way, taking what they need, waging war in accordance with their codes, and suffering mightily in their vain search for freedom and their past way. It is what it is, the final clash with the white man's culture and not sugar-coated or romanticized in the slightest.This is a very difficult book, in large part because the language is masterfully crafted to reflect the rhythm and manner of Cheyenne speech. It must be read slowly and carefully, almost out loud and perhaps multiple times, like the best Nabokov novel, for narrative texture and aesthetic. There are also very many characters who appear, disappear, and then reappear, which is hard to keep straight. But they are brilliantly drawn, subtle yet consistent, and representatives of pieces of a vanishing culture.According to the introduction, Sandoz was scrupulous in her desire for accuracy, though many of the supporting documents - some the only copies in existence - were destroyed in fire. It is horribly bleak."},{"Title":"Double Happiness","review":"Don't let Shiga's simple line drawings and succinct dialogue fool you, this novella is stunningly heartbreaking, funny, and deep.

The author in a very methodical way details how America's National Security Apparatus of decision-making simply stalemated over Vietnam, not due to blunders but to positions that were well argued from both stand points. One group of advisors recommended no withdraw at any price. The other could not agree on how to win a victory and then exit. In the meantime, four presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon tried to win and escape at the same time as American boys blood reigned on the soaked soil of Vietnam. Although few blame Harry Truman's mistake by forcing a limited war to save South Korea, fewer know Truman started us in Vietnam as well when he first gave $10 million in Military Aid to the French in 1947. However, every president after him escalated the war to win it, only to see all attempts for peace evaporate when trying to stop it. What you find is the explanation in this book on why such outstanding advisors to five presidents could only agree to escalation to prevent withdrawal but develop no victory strategy at the same time. Leslie Gelb answers and details the blunders at the very center of National Security Council points of view. If you want to see how decisions were made back then, this is the book for you! In the end, you will question why so many failed leaving so many to die and few excuses to remember."},{"Title":"The Irony of Vietnam: The System Worked","review":"This is an excellent, balanced, and well-written study of American foreign policy in Vietnam by two unusually able scholars. It refutes the modern mythology that LBJ and/or Nixon &quot;dragged Congress kicking and screaming&quot; into the conflict, and notes that a plurality of New Hampshire voters who supported McCarthy in Feb. 1968 went on to support George Wallace and Gen. Curtiss (&quot;Bomb Hanoi back to the stone age&quot;) LeMay in the November election--that is, they were Hawks protesting a &quot;no-win&quot; policy rather than Doves who wanted to abandon South Vietnam to the Communists. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Irony of Vietnam: The System Worked","review":"Very well-researched book regarding American policy towards Vietnam. The authors explore the constraints of each president, especially LBJ, when they had to deal with Vietnam. Especially incisive is the authors' view of &quot;minimum necessary&quot; vs &quot;maximum feasible&quot; constraints on US presidents w.r.t. Vietnam. This is not a conspiracy book or a first-person account. It is geared towards the academe who wants to learn about how US foreign policy was conceived and implemented wrt Vietnam."},{"Title":"The Irony of Vietnam: The System Worked","review":"Since 1945 through 197? the U.S. was in S.E. Asia; firstly financially, then advisory, then militarily. All cold war thinking with an eye on China and Russia to the east. Ho Chi Minh surfaced as the Communist liberator of his country shortly after WW II and, after routing the French at Dien Bien Phu in 1954, his perception as a serious threat to the eyes of the Western World took on more weight. The Domino theory became the sales pitch and American aid increased and increased. America increased support to the corrupt Diem regime in the south and, supported reneging free elections in 1956. Quagmire is an understatement. But, we have to remember, at the time, our leaders were reacting to an unfolding situation and their decisions were shaped by policy and events that were happening then. We have hindsight to benefit from and form our opinions.Gelb & Betts have painstakingly pieced together hours and hours of research and created a very detailed analysis of Vietnam from World War II through the fall of Saigon in 1975. Their hypothesis is sound and supported concretely with credible sources.This stuff is fascinating and highlights one major thing, the U.S. could never win given its self imposed limitations and fears concerning S. E. Asia. The U.S. escalated as reaction to the ever increasing power of the Vietcong and, other than bombing, U.S. plans never involved invading the north, Cambodia or Laos. The U.S. never really took control of the situation other than to react. This kept USA on its back foot and denied it the initiative. In a nutshell, the Vietnam war took place on the enemy's schedule and they protracted it knowing the U.S. would eventually tire.The book is broken into 5 parts:1. Decisions getting into Vietnam2. Goals: The imperative Not to lose3. Means: The minimum necessary and the Maximum feasible.4. Perceptions: Realism, Hope and Compromise.5. Conclusions.Each part has 3 - 4 chapters within and the conclusion wraps up and summarizes all the analysis. It's very detailed and at times complex.

Gutierrez, a Latina and Lewis, a Black woman of the African diaspora, have taken on this auspicious task by developing a model for social work practice. They present the historical, cultural, political and socioeconomic factors which have contributed to the problems and struggles faced by women of color. By use of example, some of them anecdotal, they relate the methods by which women of color can be empowered by drawing upon the strengths of their ancestors, raising their consciousness, building confidence, connecting with others and working in concert with nature, tradition and spirit. We are told that although racism, sexism and discrimination have contributed to the poverty of these women, they are a hopeful rather than a hopeless people who can be empowered when the practioner has used the methods outlined in this book. This book should be in the hands of every practitioner who works with women of color."},{"Title":"Under Three Flags: Anarchism and the Anti-Colonial Imagination","review":"Under Three Flags is in many ways the antithesis of Benedict Anderson's Imagined Communities. This book claims to seek to analyze the impact of anarchists on nationalist movements and the transmission of ideas. However, the book never really focuses on anything. Rather, the book is really about nationalist literature, mostly from the Philippines. And the book goes into detail about the literature and authors, so if you haven't read the original books you're out of luck.I realize this book probably wasn't meant for me, but the title seemed to suggest a much more interesting project about anarchist and anti-colonial discourse. Anderson never makes a convincing argument about these linkages.

The characters in these many short stories are all too human, from the man who liberates his wife from her sister only to suffer the consequences of a newly independent woman, to the psychotic cowboy who laughs at his pathetic state and battles a woman who keeps her deformed son under lock and key. The situations are almost all surreal, but the characters seem like people you know, only more honest. Hannah shows us the delight people take from cruelty, but also shows us how these people are no worse than us, and their transgressions simply make life more interesting. It's been a few years since I read the book, but I constantly find myself remembering stories, characters, and even lines. Where else would you find a story about a thinly-veiled William S. Burroughs that becomes a South-American voodoo tale? Where else do you find a story that is written solely to fit to the title, &quot;Upstairs, Mona Bayed For Dong&quot;? Also notable is the one about the man whose friend longs for a tragic ending, but the narrator himself ends up involved with the mistress of a German Nazi in the American South. The stories' endings are also worthy of comment: never does a story end the traditional, fairy-tale way, but somehow the stranger, more cryptic endings seem perfect. I admit that there are a few I had to trudge through, but there are also enough gems to make this a necessary purchase."},{"Title":"Bats Out of Hell","review":"The visceral description for which Hannah has rightly been praised in the past degenerates here into bad-taste verbosity and sophomoric prurience. \\"High-Water Railers\\" concerns fishing and old men, one named Sidney Farte, as they share sexual secrets and confessions of missed opportunity. \\"Scandale d'Estime\\" begins with great promise in Kosciusko, Miss. (Hannah's home state), as old reprobate Harold befriends teenage George and takes him to a production of Waiting for Godot ; the story line (which also includes the young man's infatuation with an older woman) disintegrates into short takes on paregoric addiction, attempted suicide, the Klan, and bondage equipment. The best story, \\"The Spy of Loog Root,\\" pairs the telescope-toting scion of a white-trash clan with the owner of a tobacco and magazine shop in Montana, and shows what Hannah is capable of in terms of characterization and emotional insight. For the most part, though, he seems to have invested more time in pompous, overwritten story titles--\\"Upstairs, Mona Bayed for Dong,\\" \\"Hey, Have You got a Cig, the Time, the News, My Face?\\"--than in polishing the pieces themselves (some of which consist of only a few paragraphs). Half of these 23 stories have been published in magazines; a few aren't ready to be published anywhere.

If it wasn't his last book, it must have been nearly so. It's a presentable mystery with a bit of romance thrown in. The murderer is fairly obvious early on, but I still found the story enjoyable. Wallace included some intentional self-parody, as when the characters several times remark that a particular turn of events was worthy of being included in a fictional thriller. This edition is very handsome with the cover reproducing what I assume must have been the original dust jacket.At one time, Edgar Wallace was I believe the best selling novelist in the world. Today he is largely forgotten and most of his books are out of print, at least in the United States. So, if you have never read him, this book is a reasonable place to start."},{"Title":"The Feathered Serpent","review":"Old-fashioned (1930s) murder mystery.

Huntington, a young Harvard professor of government, focused on policy problems concerning civilian direction of the military under the terms of the Cold War. Basically, he contended that traditional American liberalism was outdated and in fact had begun to pose a national security danger. Until this era, the absence of an overt military threat to American security allowed for a policy of civilian control of the military compatible with liberal democratic values. Traditionally, liberal solutions to domestic problems had likewise been applied to military problems, frequently resulting in failure.Huntington offered a theoretical framework for modern civil-military relations. He insisted that liberalism was fundamentally opposed to the proper military ethic; the application of subjective civilian control over the military actually aimed at weakening military professionalism, which was viewed as a threat to democracy, liberalism, and American values. The Cold War, though, required America to keep a large national army during peace time; the army could not return to its traditionally subordinate role. There was perpetual tension between the demands of national security and the values of American liberalism: either American security must be compromised or the influence of liberalism weakened. Only a conservative environment allowed for equilibrium between political influence and the military professionalism that ensured national security. This balance could only be achieved, Huntington argued, by objective civilian control of the military. By maintaining independent spheres of power, with no fusion of civil and military control, national security goals could be maximized with a minimum sacrifice of social values. Objective civilian control allowed for the proper growth of military professionalism while keeping the military a subordinate tool of state policy. The fulcrum of civil-military relations was the relation of the officer corps to the state.Huntington was successful in presenting the military as inherently conservative and unwarlike. The military prepared for war but never sought such engagement. Huntington encapsulated the premise of the military mindset as conservative realism. This mindset \\"holds that war is the instrument of politics, that the military are the servants of the statesman, and that civilian control is essential to military professionalism.\\" This military ethic contrasted with the stereotype of the military as dangerously warlike. A weakness of the book is Huntington's description of military trends between the Civil War and the Great War. Huntington argued that the officer corps remained isolated during this period, allowing it to develop a professionalism free of civilian interference. This isolation theory has been largely disproved by pointing to the military's involvement in putting down labor strikes, relations between officers and the business community, etc. This defect should not detract from the importance of this book as a virgin exploration into a comprehensive history of the American military tradition. With its conservative thesis, it remains in my mind the seminal work on civil-military relations."},{"Title":"The Soldier and the State: The Theory and Politics of Civil-Military Relations","review":"Though growing dated in many ways, Huntington's 1950's history of the development of US civil-military relations is extremely instructive to both civilian and military readers alike. Huntington uses a comparisons with the German and Japanese pre-WWII experiences to contrast the American, as well as to develop his own theory as to what the ideal form of civil-military relations should be. Huntington's book should be a must-read, even in its dated form, for anyone who could possibly exercise political influence that could result in military action."},{"Title":"The Soldier and the State: The Theory and Politics of Civil-Military Relations","review":"Incisive and remarkably relevant. Huntington delves into the role of the military in shaping and protecting a society. A MUST read for anyone who is in, or deals with the military."},{"Title":"The Soldier and the State: The Theory and Politics of Civil-Military Relations","review":"Samuel Huntington's writings have always been incisive and animated by a spirit of the author's stupendous labor and a burning desire to project a true perspective of topics. The Soldier and the State is no exception.Every human society and for that matter every human civilization have evolved round this single issue of striking a balance between the civilian and the miltary sector and hence the debate rages round key political thoughts like liberalism and realism. This age old riddle is diificult to solve and the lone super power of the new millennium is still searching for an answer to this on a national and international level: whither hard power or soft power?Huntington's account of civilian and military history is studded with hard facts and comprehensive research works and this makes the book so interesting. He has picked up a topic that he felt from the core of his heart worth discussing.On a deeper level the issue strikes right into the heart of the American political thought. This is also dealt with in the opening chapter of the undersigned's book : Tracing the Eagle's Orbit.Professor Huntington is an institution by himself and this topic and this book is a must read for everybody.

Its price was fair and it came fast. Thank you all."},{"Title":"The Soldier and the State: The Theory and Politics of Civil-Military Relations","review":"Everything is bad news if it comes with a deadline that isn't met. This book, THE SOLDIER AND THE STATE: THE THEORY AND POLITICS OF CIVIL-MILITARY RELATIONS by Samuel P. Huntington, a young Harvard professor in 1957, when the book first appeared, attempted to establish assumptions that would allow respectable consideration of policies that, in our world, might be used to define who we have become. My differences with this book might be ascribed to a theological framework in which this book is seen as having assumed the existence of hell on earth as the situation which people who voiced political aspirations that did not coincide with the prevailing superpower mentality would have to put up with. The famous Winston Churchill once said something about assumptions up with which he would not put, and the success of this book might be measured by how its views are assumed to be the American views in those parts of the world where America as a superpower is most unpopular.This review is being written in a short window of time in which the rulers of Saudi Arabia, whose success, so far, has been contingent on the opposite of liberal policies (they previously granted religious authorities who were considered the most conservative element within Arabian society a veto power over anything the government might do) are hoping that an American victory in Iraq might allow all American troops to be removed from Saudi Arabia, so that democracy might be granted to the people of Saudi Arabia (at a time when the average age is 15 years old) without fear that the anti-American views of Arabian young people will be the dominating political force determining the shape of the parties who will soon be able to demand more control than their government has ever been able to apply to society. As the situation in Venezuela at the moment illustrates, fights over how much oil is being pumped, and who ought to benefit from the economic miracle that oil provides, can do strange things in a nation with a democracy that attempts to let a majority of the people rule.Huntington considers America an exception to such class considerations. Though not specifically concerned with the role of Blacks in American society, he assumes that their politics has been entirely liberal in nature. \\"No nascent group ever developed a radical ideology challenging the established order: it was always too quickly assimilated into that order. . . . Radicalism and conservatism were equally superfluous. Incipient and established groups both adhered to liberalism.\\" (p. 145). The few attempts to establish conservative values in American history were mainly ignored by a society that was exuberantly growing in spite of any ideology which might attempt to exercise some form of control. The early part of the twentieth century had produced few instances in which policy had needed an exit strategy, and any attempt to find one in the index of THE SOLDIER AND THE STATE leads to the following entries:Expertise, a characteristic of a profession, 8-9; of officership, 11-14Extirpation, U.S. policy of, 155-156Even page 154 has a bit on professionalism. As Woodrow Wilson said during World War I, \\"America has always boasted that she could find men to do anything. She is the prize amateur nation in the world. Germany is the prize professional nation in the world. Now, when it comes to doing new things and doing them well, I will back the amateur against the professional every time.\\" The lure of popularity in a liberal society can easily produce this result. \\"In domestic politics each liberal group tends to identify the military with its own particular enemies. Without any recognized function in a liberal society and standing outside the ideological consensus, the military have been a universal target group.\\" (p. 154). Extirpation is the name given to such a policy in this book. \\"Liberalism's injunction to the military has in effect been: conform or die. On the one hand, American liberalism has supported the virtual elimination of all institutions of violence and thus has attempted to do away with the problem of civil-military relations entirely. This is a policy of extirpation. On the other hand, when it has been necessary to maintain armed force, American liberalism has insisted upon a rigorous subjective civilian control, the refashioning of the military institutions along liberal lines so that they lose their peculiarly military characteristics. This is a policy of transmutation.\\" (p. 155). There are no entries in the index for hyperbolic topics like sex, soldiers, or swearing, so there is little opportunity in this book for the ideas which strike me most, considering the unique psychic characteristics of the transmutation of the typical swinging Richard into a short-term ...assassin at Waco, Texas on April 19, 1993, or less notoriously, of any Naval doctor who kept a copy of the Kennedy autopsy photographs at Bethesda Naval Hospital in the ten years after this book first appeared, but I'm convinced that such ideas are within the realm of what is considered conservative in this book. Some people are sick of this kind of thing, and keep projecting its insanity on me, of all people, who tries to keep tying everything to the new direction of American society. I wonder if this makes us the entertainment capital of the world, or what?"},{"Title":"Four essays on liberty (The Classics of Liberty Library)","review":"Agreed. Berlin's book is not the easiest in the world to read. But, then again, neither is Plato, or John Locke, or even Mill for that matter. He writes in a 19th century style, but one which, I think is beautiful and elegant. This is not a book to be devoured, but to be savored. Each word is carefully crafted. To me, Berlin is like diving into a pool of the english language, and just floating in ideas and language. And the ideas are wonderful. More than any other political philosopher, Berlin has diagnosed the problems, and the dangers, of modern social and political thinking. When he argues that those who advocate limits on liberty, in the name of justice, or equality, or another ideal, are in fact diminishing the amount of liberty in society as a whole it is hard not to agree with him. His analysis of the problems of modern philosophy and political thought is as acute. These are the ideas that I now find most compelling in this book. The essay of the two types of liberty is wonderful, as is the one on Historical Inevitability. But it is the essay on Political Ideas in the 20th Century that has become my favorite over the year, for the simple reason that he was incredibly prophetic. In the 19th century, Berlin argues, conservatives and liberal, even socialists, despite their differences agreed on the fundamental questions of politics; who should rule? What is the basis of authority? Why should I obey? What are the obligations and responsibilities of citizenship? In the 20th century, we no longer even consider the questions to be important, or relevant. All political problems have been reduced to either technical matters, of social or economic engineering, or are treated as psychological disorders, that need theraputic treatment. We accept the lost of liberty because we no longer think of it as important, as a question that needs solving. Problems like poverty, or equality, or a cleaner environment, which are suseptible of technical solutions. Anyone who worried about liberty in the face of all of these problems was, ipso facto, crazy, and a refusal to face reality. Hence, prozac or lithium is the prescribed course of treatment, to remove the source, or at least the feeling, of discontent. It is time to take another look at Berlin, not merely as a defender of liberty, but as an analyst of modern political and social thinking, and the dead ends to which it is leading us."},{"Title":"Four essays on liberty (The Classics of Liberty Library)","review":"Do you dislike 20th century totalitarianism and the putrid odor which determinism and the &quot;modern&quot; social sciences have brought to the world?

Do you hate the condescending attitude of &quot;progressives&quot; who would deign to make decisions from on high for the rest of us? - knowing better than we do, of course. If so, then the incredibly erudite and eloquent Sir Isaiah Berline is for you. Political pluralism need not give up the field to Marxists and determinists rampaging like vandals through the modern research university.I read recently how in today's &quot;advanced&quot; scholarship Berlin only rehashes &quot;ancient&quot; arguments about free will. Well, if you are one of &quot;those who value liberty for its own sake, believe that to be free to choose, and not to be chosen for, is an inalienable ingredient in what makes human beings human,&quot; then you want to make Berlin one of your intellectual supports and companions.

While he is that, this book is fertile with ideas, old, new, original and daring. What start out as four essays on liberty, turn out to reveal an astute world view. The one quoted above is taken from the third essay, his famous &quot;Two Concepts of Liberty.&quot; In it he argues that the division between 'freedom from' and 'freedom to' is a subtle intertwine, more delicate than we often suppose. In the end, we must err on the side of 'freedom from' for one important reason; while the abscence of coercion might leave loose ends, by trying to tighten all loose ends, the rope loses all slack. Without the metaphor, by coercing others, we assume that our viewpoint is the only correct one and force others to live uniform to our ideas.This is the theme that runs through all four essays. The first, &quot;Political Ideas in the Twentieth Century&quot; examines the failure of all the isms then en vogue; communism, fascism, socialism. Same idea. They preached of a graspable absolute truth that in the end, proved not so handleable. The second essay, &quot;Historical Inevitability&quot; tackles the problem at the root; the belief that our actions are determined and that free will is an illusion. Berlin, while not trying to disprove it (try, you can't do it!), exposes it as untenable. Every thought, action, word and concept we evoke is dependant upon belief in human autonomy. This essay is quite long and began to repeat itself a bit. Fight off the urge to skip through it. Very meaty!!The last essay, &quot;John Stuart Mill and the Ends of Life&quot; is something of a recap of the ideas presented in the book. It is Berlins tribute and critique (Mill would've approved) of Mill, his philosophy and his life which unlike most philosophers, was lived in complete accordance with his views.Great book. The only problems I had were the length of the second essay and Berlin's annoying habit of turning every sentence into a twenty-one lined, 12 comma, infinitive after split infinitive beast. Although his language is beautiful (a la Barzun), this was hard to get used to. HIs thoughts, though, are classic."},{"Title":"Four essays on liberty (The Classics of Liberty Library)","review":"Liberty is a very precious and rare quality of a living condition.As I. Berlin states, \`The periods and societies in which civil liberties were respected, and variety of opinion and faith tolerated, have been very few and far between, oases in the desert of human uniformity, intolerance and oppression.'I. Berlin explains clearly that liberty has two faces: a positive and a negative one.Positive liberty is the answer to the question: who controls? Am I my own master?Negative liberty circumscribes the area wherein a third person can prevent anybody to make a free choice.On these bases, a free society can be organized, with 1) absolute rights (not absolute powers) and 2) frontiers, defined in terms of rules, within which men should be inviolable.For the author, freedom is not an end, but a means to create \`room for personal ends', for happiness. He rightly criticizes E. Fromm: freedom is the opportunity to act, not action itself.Philosophically, freedom has been ferociously contested by the determinists, the defenders of \`historical inevitability' (Hegel, Marx, Bacon, Fourier, Comte). The author remarks judiciously that if the world is ruled by determinism, nobody is responsible: there is no free will, no morality, and no justice. Individual choice is an illusion. Determinism represents the world as a prison.A more brutal kind of determinism is presented by those who believe that there is a final answer, a unique goal, a central principle that governs our life. This principle and its executioners provoked barbarous consequences.Isaiah Berlin's reflections on liberty are profound and still very actual.Not to be missed."},{"Title":"Four essays on liberty (The Classics of Liberty Library)","review":"The four essays in this work are 1) Political Ideas in the Twentieth Century 2)Historical Inevitability 3) Two Concepts of Liberty 4) John Stuart Mill and the Ends of Life.\\"In the first essay Berlin laments the tendency of twentieth century thinking to deprive the great questions of their significance and substitute for them technical questions alone. In the second Berlin argues that the notion of historical inevitabity is untenable and that our everyday life and historical experience require a kind of liberty . In the third he makes his famous contrast between freedom from, and freedom to, or for. And in the last he explores the political thought of John Stuart Mill one of his great predecessors and through Mill's mirror develops some of his own ideas.First and above all Berlin stands against the idea that there is a single system or idea an absolute which all Mankind should be coerced into obedience to. Berlin in his thinking points to the plurality of ends and values in life, and the contradictions between various systems of values. He is a liberal philosopher who connects the dignity of Mankind with this liberty from external coercion and oppression.His writing is profound and yet somehow conversational and flowing .This work contains the heart of the thought of one of the great political thinkers of our time."},{"Title":"Four essays on liberty (The Classics of Liberty Library)","review":"Sample of Berlin at rhetorical heights -- If you like this you will like this book ---- \\"One belief, more than any other, is responsible for the slaughter of individuals on the altars of the great historical ideals -- justice or progress or the happiness of future generations, or the sacred mission of emancipation of a nation or race or class, or even liberty itself, which demands the sacrifice of individuals for the freedom of society. This is the belief that somewhere, in the past or in the future, in divine revelation or in the mind of an individual thinker, in the pronouncements of history or science, or in the simple heart of an uncorrupted good man, there is a final solution. This ancient faith rests on the conviction that all the positive values in which men have believed must, in the end, be compatible, and perhaps even entail one another. \\"Nature binds truth, happiness, and virtue together as by an indissoluble chain,\\" said one of the best men who ever lived, and spoke in similar terms of liberty, equality, and justice. But is this true? It is a commonplace that neither political equality nor efficient organization nor social justice is compatible with more than a modicum of individual liberty, and certainly not with unrestricted laissez-faire; that justice and generosity, public and private loyalties, the demands of genius and the claims of society, can conflict violently with each other.This is a book that reads easier if pre-read in condensed version (Cliff notes)Note: For those who wish to pursue this type of issue in more detail --1) J S Mill & the Utilitarians' 'greatest good / happiness / pleasure for greatest number' proposed a view more sympathetic to 'positive liberties' as freedom of opportunity. (in my opinion) Berlin's championing of negative liberty is probably a response to his time in history - a time when human rights abuses of totalitarian regimes, based upon Nazism & communism, were perpetrated in the name of 'the super-race' or 'the people' or 'classless societies.'2) Mill & Utilitarians profoundly influenced American pragmatists,i.e., W James, J Dewey etc. American public education, as we know it today, is based upon Dewey's practical reform of curricula. This is an empirical science-based, practice-based, common-sense kind of curricula that Dewey believed befitted a democracy -- as opposed to antiquated, irrelevant British classical education based upon Greek & Roman classics."},{"Title":"Four essays on liberty (The Classics of Liberty Library)","review":"I won't review the four essays, except to state the obvious: They concern liberty, and what liberty entails. But that much one could ascertain from the title.What the title does not reveal is how penetrating Berlin's analyses of the myriad subjects he comments on. His prose is exemplary, and his style endearing. Many learned people think Lionel Trilling, Erich Auerbach, Jacques Barzun, etc., are the men of letters for the 20th century reader. As enjoyable as many of these and other authors of the 20th century have been, I am amazed at how infrequently Berlin is listed among them. Yet, his mind is keener, his prose more mellifluous, and his ideas more interesting than almost anyone else of his Age.Berlin is not a difficult read, but he is a challenging one. His weave of ideas and his elaborate critiques will require attention, but give him your attention, and he'll reward you plenteously. He is a genuine philosopher who deals with issues of the common man, not the nuances of linguistics; he is concerned with freedom, the life well-lived, and ideas that are important (not just fasionable). This collection of four essays is as good a place as any to introduce yourself to one of the 20th century's true giants of belle letters."},{"Title":"Four essays on liberty (The Classics of Liberty Library)","review":"My professor said that Isaiah Berlin was as big in his circles as Elvis was in his.

If you want to read this book, or any of Sir Isaiah's work, give it a shot. Be warned, though, you'll have to read it very carefully about four times before you understand what he's trying to say.

Yeah? Are you willing to undergo the rigorous, austere training necessary to become a real lone swordsman, such as having no friends to speak of (especially no girl friends, since the Way of the Sword eliminates such trivial pursuits), traveling lonely roads through rain and snow with nary a place to call home, stopping at obscure run-down country inns to shovel rice in your mouth with chopsticks at a rapid pace (think Woody Allen in \\"Play It Again Sam\\", without the correct comedic timing), and speaking in limited, stilted dialogue to all questioners with a scowl and a low grunt, like there is something caught in your throat that you just can't seem to get out, similar to a drunk stumbling home at 2:00 a.m. down a Kyoto side road after too much sake?Heck yeah you say, you bet, sign me up!I guess you need to read this book, then.You may ask, \\"Why are you always picking out these obscure books, Jimbo?\\" Answer: \\"Because the vast majority of martial arts books available today are overpriced fluff material, you know it, I know it, and I see that hunger in your heart for decent books\\"- that's why. Thank me for it later.In short, this is the kind of book every martial artist wants to read- fun, entertaining, and provoking all kinds of romantic notions in one's head about shucking off all one's daily responsibilites and hitting the road (on foot, no less) in a personal search for life, meaning, truth, justice and cracking the essence of swordsmanship in this very lifetime. Nevermind none of this has the slightest relevance to anything this day and age, we're trying to evoke a romantic image here, so work with me.Japanese call this personal pilgrimage \\"musha-shugyo\\", and it is what feudal swordsmen such as Tsukahara Bokuden and Musashi Miyamoto did back in their day. Now you can travel with them.The book is a product of The East Publications, and the author, Makoto Sugawara, did a fine service for Westerners in his attempt to weave together historical bios of some of Japan's most famous swordsmen. I say \\"attempt\\" here, because, alas, even the history experts in Japan have trouble sorting out accurate historical fact from the many legends and stories surrounding these old warriors. Japanese feudal history tends to be like any history of the Far East, which is to say, long on legends and short on historical accuracy or consensus. And, if the Japanese experts can't separate fact from fiction all the time, reliably, neither can you nor I.Be that as it may, included in the book are colorful bios of your favorite cast of characters, such as Tsukahara Bokuden (readers will recognize Bruce Lee stole a story about Bokuden for his movie \\"Enter the Dragon\\"); Musashi, who we surprisingly learn evidently fell in love late in life; the Yagyu family (Muneyoshi, Munenori, Mitsuyoshi); Ito Ittosai (founder of the influential sword Ryu bearing his name) and his disciple Ono Tadaaki, on down to more recent figures such as Otani Nobutomo and Yamaoka Tesshu (the latter arguably Japan's last master swordsman of the caliber of these other feudal giants). And there is even Takuan's classic Fudochi Shinmyo Roku in the Appendix! (usually translated \\"Record of Immovable Wisdom\\", but for us more picky folks, it should be expanded to something like \\"Record of Immovable (fudo) Wisdom (chi) & Divine (shin) Mystery\\" (or \\"Wonder\\"- myo)).In short, fascinating reading for anyone interested in Japan's martial history.I assume YOU are, dear reader, or you wouldn't be here reading this review. Right? Right!The only problem now is the book is out-of-print; although I see some used copies available on Amazon for a hefty price. Luckily, I got mine years ago when you could actually get it at face price. Not so today, you folks will have to shell out some big bucks to get ahold of a copy. But, you should. It's a great book for the collection.I noticed another reviewer saying it was possible to get the book from the publisher (The East Publications). Not sure if this is still true. But it might be worth trying. Grab the book however you can before your neighbor buys the last used copy and you'll need to go over to his house and start a sword duel to settle the matter.Oh wait, we're not in feudal Japan...

Old men in geriatric homes throughout the US were claiming to be the 'real' John Wilkes Booth, Jesse James, Billy the Kid and other notorious figures in the history of the American west. Berger created a spin-off character, Jack Crabbe, who claimed to be none of these, but managed to be present for a surprising number of pivotal events of the 19th Century. He also claimed to know many of the characters involved, including Sitting Bull, Wild Bill Hickock, Calamity Jane, Wyatt Earp and his brothers, Bat Masterson, George Armstrong Custer and others.In addition to being a great read and informative piece of historical fiction, this novel became a model for the anti-hero of a number of other historical fiction series and works. The most notable of these is the George MacDonald Frazer, Flashman books.Berger has done a signal job of turning over the rocks of history, finding twists and turns normally not part of the legends, and weaving them into a character and plot unsurpassed in American historical fiction."},{"Title":"Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"Long before Micheal Blake's politically correct tome \\"Dances With Wolves\\" gave voice to other side of the American West, Thomas Berger wrote the expertly crafted, humourous, tragic and down right entertaining \\"Little Big Man\\". Written in 1965, when it was still fashionable to portray the Native American as a \\"in the way savage\\", Berger deftly blended the genres of tall tale and history in a manner that really has yet to be matched.The character of Jack Crabb is cut of classic cloth. His story may very well be pure hogwash, but it is filled with touching humanity that underpins all the comedy. Berger portrays The Cheyenne people, or the \\"Human Beings\\" as possessing many of the same foibles and warts as their European counterparts. They are not painted as noble savages as in Blake's new agey work, but rather as complex characters deserving of respect and honor.Berger's General Custer is a wry study of madness that somehow avoids cynicism. One of this book's many virtues lies in its ability to lend the Western myth a critical eye, while avoiding the nihilistic pessimism that frequently goes hand in hand with such work (something the film version couldn't avoid).\\"Little Big Man\\" is a must read to all who love good yarns spun with a big heart and a bigger mind."},{"Title":"Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"Like many others who reviewed this book, I first read it (in high school) after seeing the movie. The movie was a real eye opener for me, for the first time giving me a sense of Indians as real people, struggling to stay themselves and maintain their way of life against the relentless &amp; overwhelming campaign of conquest, destruction &amp; genocide by Whites. It inspired me to read this book, which I found to far surpass in richness, character development and detail what I had thought to be an excellent movie. After reading it the first time I think I read it annually for the next ten years, and several more times since. Each time it has moved me to laughter, anger, and without fail tears at the end. I can't begin to do it justice, even trying gives me &quot;...a pain between my ears...&quot; and some of the reader reviews have already done a fine job of describing it. There's just a couple of points I'd like to add. Jack Crabb has always reminded me Huckleberry Finn. Through close personnal experience, each character evolves in his understanding and appreciation of a race he'd been raised to believe inherently inferior to whites (Jack Crabb's rearing by Indians does not begin till his tenth year). Niether Jack nor Huck are saints who always &quot;knew better&quot;. Along the way, both struggle with feelings of doubt, guilt &amp; shame when they find themslves favoring the Indians or Blacks over Whites. Both think badly of themselves for doing so. Like Mark Twain, Thomas Berger puts us into the head of a White male who struggles with the conflict between his own experience and the stereotypes he'd been raised on and which shape the White society of his time. Both books are marvels of insight into human nature. &quot;Little Big Man&quot; goes further in brighing alive actual historical events Jack experiences first hand. Read the history book by Dee Brown, &quot;Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee&quot; to afirm how well Thomas Berger captured and related such notorius events as the Washita massacre and the Battle at the Little Big Horn. My other point to new readers is to be sure and read the Forward, which is actually part of the novel and provides valuable background and insight into Jack's character and wisdom. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"I just re-read this for the first time in forty years, when I read it shortly after seeing the movie. I had always rated it among my favorite novels and my estimation has not diminished. It is like a lost Mark Twain novel, in many respects surpassing most of Twain's own novels. It is a major accomplishment and the forerunner to Zelig and Forrest Gump and any other 'little nobody just happens to be present at many major world events' stories that have come down the pike subsequently. Jack Crabb is a quintessential American Everyman...literally, as he lives alternately in the white world as well as the Indians'. He can literally see multiple points of view from a vantage point that few, if any, could ever acquire. This is the tall tale to tower over all other tall tales, one of the ultimate American epics. Ironically, this novel, like Jack Crabb himself, seems to be inexplicably neglected in any discussion of major American novels, to which select company this certainly belongs."},{"Title":"Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"After becoming mildly obsessed with the film version, I had to read the book and so glad I did. There are some startling and wonderful differences between the versions - the book triumphs. Berger's writing style brilliantly aids the imagination in creating a breathtaking backdrop. The dialog evokes gut-busting laughter and the most sincere sobs. The detailing of each character and setting leaves the reader truly wondering if this is an actual biography or fiction work. Jack Crabb, his fellow \\"Human Beings\\", his adopted white family, his long-lost niece, his white wife, his Cheyenne wife, become nearly touchable and all are loveable. Life is short, money is as scarce as spare time. This book and the time it will take to read it are surely worth the expenditure.

A few paragraphs later: \\"I never suspected it at the time, being just a young boy, but I realize now that my Pa was a lunatic,\\" and I was a complete goner.Little Big Man is an extremely humorous novel of the American west, wonderfully narrated in a breezy, informal style, peppered with humorous colloquialisms and directness, reminiscent of Huckleberry Finn, by the 111 year old Jack Crabb, a (so he claims) surviver (and the sole survivor) of Custer's last stand.But it's also touching and heartbreaking at times, and with tension as he rides with Custer to the Little Big Horn.As Crabb recounts his life, moving between the white man's world and that of the Indians, stopping at many stations along the way in the kaleidescopic West, we are often given a detailed pictured of what various aspects of life were like back then. From what it's like eating dog in the tepee to Hickcock's advice on gunfighting, to the traveling snake oil salesman and his occupational risks.In this way also it's much like the Last of the Mohicans, giving an inside view, hopefully a researched, accurate one, of the frontier to those of us safely and comfortably ensconced at home in greater civilization.Definitely high in the echelon of American novels I've read."},{"Title":"Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"I have my students read this book as a supplement to an American history survey course. It is an good source because Berger's fiction mirrors what often happened during the European-American conquest of the West. From hemanahs to Custer's band playing during the Washita attack, Berger shows that truth and fiction are often separated by a very thin line. At the same time he illustrates that during the battles over the plains, no one group had a monopoly on civility or savagery.

Journeys include encounters with Wild Bill Hickock, Wyatt Earp and George Armstrong Custer. Simple idea but to pull it off is another matter entirely. Berger succeeds. Crabb is an engaging character whose wit and wisdom permeate the narrative.The reader also becomes familiar with an important slice of American History, gaining a fresh perspective on the tragic fate of native tribes. This is not a strictly politcally correct interpretation but it is senstivie, and realistic.Coincidental encounters are so frequent as to become expected but they always delight. &quot;Little Big Man&quot; is thought provoking, educational and most of all a whole lot of fun.(The 1969 movie of the same name starring Dustin Hoffman, is a nice supplement to the book, whether seen before reading the book , after, or during.)"},{"Title":"Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"I read this book last year and it quickly became one of my favorites.

If you read it as if it's funny, the book is funny.But even if you do, it's very likely that you're going to hate it. Jack Crabb is not a character that is easily liked - and considering he's the only character who stays around for very long, it makes the book hard to stomach. The film version, directed by Arthur Penn, makes Dustin Hoffman's Jack Crabb much more bumbling and perhaps even lovable.It covers some thirty-five years, perhaps more, and squashes in every possible bit of the American West you can imagine, and -somehow- it all feeds into Jack's life. When the book was all said and done, I found that there had been no plot, no continuous main thread of anything save Jack's dilemma between being Indian or white (which he never solves nor admits that he can, perhaps, be both). The story could have kept on going forever had it not ended where it did after the Battle of Little Bighorn. In that sense it was a true biography in its style, but it left something to be desired in terms of dramatic interest.What I -did- like about _Little Big Man_ was its unsentimental portrayal of the Indian culture. It didn't paint the whites as bad guys and the Indians as saints. It didn't do the opposite, either. It showed that whites have their cultural good points and bad points, and Indians have their cultural good points and bad points. It was true, and didn't pander to one side or the other - the film, however, completely changes it to be sympathetic to the Cheyenne, which was highly disappointing.All in all, _Little Big Man_ is pretentious and overambitious, only worth reading if you have to read it. I don't believe that it deserves to be called \\"a singular literary achievement that, like its ancient hero, only gets better with the years\\" (back of book), or \\"the very best novel ever about the American West\\" (New York Times). It's pretentious praise for a pretentious novel that is extremely hard to muddle through, and even harder to really enjoy - and this is coming from someone who loves to read and can always find something worthwhile in almost any book. It does have good points, like I said, but otherwise . . . it was not at all to my tastes and does not come recommended at all."},{"Title":"Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"Little Big Man is a great book for a fun read. I had to read it for a class which pressured me to read it in a certain amount of time so I wasn't able to enjoy it as much as I had hoped to. However it was still a good book. It gives great factual information about the old West and about the Indians and their fight to keep their homeland, but at the same time it was fun to read because of some of the crazy adventures that Jack takes part in. Over all I gave this book a three because it was decent and yet had excessive detail in some spots."},{"Title":"Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"This book was okay, but somewhat boring. Also, some of the events were highly improbable."},{"Title":"Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"This story as told is not meant to be taken seriously - it is clearly a tall-tale, a humorous weaving together of history and legend. That said, it is a remarkably fun ride, taking the reader on a trip through the Wild West as viewed through the eyes of its host, Jack Crabb. Jack is one of those good-old-boy adventurer types you imagine when you think of the time period, hopping from scrape to scrape and relating it all to you in his dry, matter-of-fact way.While the story isn't meant to be taken seriously, the writing certainly is, and Berger proves himself a master of the craft in this novel. The prose, told in Crabb's down-home vernacular, is perfect. Others point to jarring notes in his jargon - phrases and words that don't belong in the mouth of Jack Crabb - but the author presents some explanation for this in his forward, and I did not see a problem with this.My only complaint is that the book begins to feel repetitive - while I enjoyed the first half of the story immensely, I found myself ready to be done before the author was. The last part of the book felt much the same as the first - the quality didn't degrade, necessarily, but it went longer than it should have.All in all, however, an enjoyable novel."},{"Title":"Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"I read this years ago, and enjoyed reading it again. It is part imagination, part real events, and woven together to be a credible story, so you being to think --\\"it could have really happened......\\"(enjoying the fantasy of it)I reccommend it."},{"Title":"Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"I started reading the western novels - True Grit, The Big Sky, Lonesome Dove, teh Oregon Trail... this has been my favorite. Berger was quite ambitious with this - trying to make it convincing that his character, Jack Crab, could actually befriend the people he does - but it works largely because Crab is so very likeable. No one can resist him - least of all the reader. On this score, I thought the book was much more convincing than the movie, which I watched as soon as I finished reading the book.(Let's face it, Dustin Hoffman is no Jack Crab.) For starters, the book is apolitical and amoral - Crab strides between the cultures and is sympathetic to both, which in and of itself is quite remarkeable. Again, this is done much more successfully in the book. The movie makes a lot of changes to the chronology of events and the narrative in general - largely painting the Cheyenne in a much more sympathetic, moral light - almost like a holy people. In the movie, Crab's upbringing by the Cheyenne serves as his moral center, whereby the snakeoil salesman, Merrieweather, (who was a much minor character in the book)complains that Crab isn't cut out for American life because of his moral ideas about the universe and man's place in it. This never is said in the book or otherwise expressed. In fact, in the book it is the Cheyenne who attack and kill little Jack Crab's family and then later adopt him. In the movie it is the Pawnee who attack and the Cheyenne who then rescue him. I understand a film has to streamline the narrative - but it is changes like this that, in my opinion, do a huge injustice to the larger point Berger was making. Berger isn't trying to annoint one people as superior over another (as in the case of the movie, the Cheyenne vs the Pawnee and everybody else)- but rather show what happens when two very different cultures run up against one another and the trajedy that results.I watched the movie years ago and loved it. But after reading the book and re-watching the movie - I wouldn't even recommend the movie, which today feels dated and miscast.

Berger also draws a remarkable portrait of the psychology of being trapped between two cultures and belonging to neither. A book worth reading and re-reading"},{"Title":"Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"Thomas Berger's most famous novel may well be one of the longest Western tall tales ever written (and there's a sequel!), featuring the most longwinded frontiersman in the history of American literature. At its best, Berger owes much to Cooper and less to Twain and otherwise to the many historical and anthropological sources he consulted. Even Walt Whitman, in his guise as a nurse in love with a drummer boy, gets an unlikely two-paragraph cameo (\\"I ain't going to mention [his name], for he got quite a reputation in later times for his robustious verse, some fellow told me once\\"). The concoction is both episodic and epic, and the adventures of anti-hero Jack Crabb make up a considerable and compulsively readable yarn, beginning with his boyhood kidnapping by a Cheyenne tribe through a lifetime of allegiances alternating between Indian warriors and white frontiersmen, punctuated by run-ins with the likes of Wild Bill Hickok, Wyatt Earp, Chief Black Kettle, George Custer, and any number of women claiming to be Calamity Jane.Given Berger's imaginative and deliberately ludicrous storyline, it's disappointing how predictable and repetitious much of the plot is. Twists and secrets are so ham-fistedly veiled that what Crabb divulges as if they were surprises or revelations are anticipated pages and chapters in advance. Adding to the obviousness, Berger seldom passes up a chance to rustle up a supposedly forgotten character or long-lost relative at a convenient (or inconvenient) pass. Similarly, the humor is not the sort that sneaks up on you unexpectedly; rarely deadpan, Berger's comedy has all the subtlety of a tomahawk employed in a full-frontal assault. Much of it is the kind of knee-slapping, countrified corn those of us old enough to remember \\"Hee-Haw\\" will recall. \\"If he ever would introduce a drop of water to his face, he might have come out fairly good-looking\\"--cute enough, but that's about as good as it gets. I found myself rolling my eyes far more often than I was chuckling.Then, too, the colloquial patter employed by Jack Crabb seems artificial and flat. He \\"talks\\" in a semi-drawling voice many Easterners probably imagine when they conjure up a cowboy with a college degree, or at least the kind of prairie poke who knows how to toss around his god-given share of colloquialisms, with a few ten-dollar words thrown in for good measure. To account for this oddly bookish lack of tonality, Berger frames his account with a fictional scholar who says he cleaned up the old-timer's prose to make it more palatable to readers' tastes--but this metafictional ploy can seem a cop-out rather than a cleverly ironic technique. In an introduction to the latest paperback edition, literary scholar Brooks Landon argues that this dissonance is intentional, that the \\"vernacular ring\\" of Crabb's prairie-talk masks \\"the sophistication of the Jack's narrative technique\\"; I would suggest it's the other way around, but either way strikes me as an excuse rather than an explanation for the prose style. Berger certainly doesn't expect you to trust most everything Jack Crabb says, but I was unable to believe even in how he said it.Berger leaves open the question of whether Crabb is an unsung hero or \\"a liar of insane proportions.\\" Which, if you think about it, begs the question: who is really spinning the tale we're reading: Jack Crabb or the \\"man of letters\\" Ralph Fielding Snell? And: what's the point of a literary hoax if it's transparently incredible? Furthermore: are we expected to appreciate the inescapable paradox that the entire \\"transcription\\" couldn't convincingly be read aloud by anyone? Such questions suggest the issues I have with this exercise: where some readers see irony or ambiguity or even parody, I see a lack of authenticity. The preposterous plot and the stylistic excesses require a suspension of belief I was never able to achieve. It may be a fun read at times, but a 450-page caricature (and a sequel!) is an awfully long endurance test for a story so calculated in its telling, gaudy in its humor, scattered in its satirical aims, plodding in its postmodern winking. Nevertheless, one has to acknowledge that the book's panoramic sweep and the everywhereness of its polymorphic narrator will continue to appeal to many readers, especially those who enjoy Western epics and historical fiction."},{"Title":"Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"A fine book, pithy and funny...

Or at least overly familiar. The retelling of history through the eyes of a character who has been at all major events has been done endlessly, and mind you not as well, by George MacDonald Fraser in his Flashman series. This format doesn't work for me because the author typically tries to push in too many characters and extra narrative rather than developing the main character into anything close to being realistic, and such niceties and clever dialogue and plot twists are not even ventured. So in 'Little Big Man' we have someone who allegedly grew up among the Cheyenne Indians, hunted buffalo, met Wild Bill Hickok and was with General Custer during his final day. Sorry, but I found it all very contrived early on.Bottom line: probably best left to those truly fascinated by the latter days of the Wild West."},{"Title":"Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"I am going to have to check out his other works!

His father is killed and he ends up going with the Indians because of is mad sister.We then have the account of his life living with the Indians, leaving the tribe, several marriages and children. He meets Wild Bill Hickok, watches his sister fight Calamity Jane and has a run in with Wyatt Earp.The story ends with him being the only survivor at Custer's Last Stand.This is a fascinating read- (from what I have read about the novel itself, it is very accurate regarding Indian customs and the history of the times.)I am guessing that this was the inspiration for George McDonald Fraser to write the Flashman series i.e dress up history into a rollicking good yarn.There is great humour and humanity in this novel. Parts of it are very very funny.It also puts those spouting off regarding colonisation in their place - Crabb reminisces and states that looking back everybody made bad choices regarding events and the way people were treated, but at the time it was believed to be the correct way to behave and now you can't change what has happened, its happened so move on.I think this is nicely put, it is always very easy to look back and be an expert, but much harder to do the right thing at the time.I thoroughly recommend reading this, you a have little bit of history and some great laughs."},{"Title":"Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"I remember seeing the film version with Dustin Hoffman years ago, and it really stuck in my mind. Finally got around to getting a copy of the book- it's a wild ride, at times both heartbreaking and hilarious.

Thomas Berger is a master storyteller, and his characters come alive in the many twists and turns he employs.For readers, this is an entertaining, illuminating, worthwhile read. For writers, it's like a course in fiction writing.Highly recommended.Gerald GillisAuthor ofShall Never See So Much"},{"Title":"Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"What a wonderful literary adventure is Little Big Man. This is a genuine American saga as told by a genuine historical novelist, Thomas Burger. While this is a work of fiction, Burger allows the reader the impression that it is a true story. The source of this story is one lovable, sagely old man, Jack Crabb. Crabb, interviewed by the author in his wheelchair in a nursing home, at age 111; delivers a recollection worthy of a raconteur of royal proportions. Each of Jack's adventures and misadventures, childhood through manhood, are told with uncanny wit and wisdom; in the unrefined nuances of a wise old geezer who has literally seen it all.Jack's story begins at age 10 when heading west with his family in a wagon train. Jack's dad is fascinated with the Mormon faith's concept of multiple wives. So, it is for Salt Lake City they are headed. Furthermore, Dad believes, as do the Mormons, that American natives are a lost tribe of Israel and therefore speak Hebrew! When the wagon train is stopped by a band of Cheyenne, a failure to communicate of titanic proportions ensues, directly resulting in Jack and his sister being kidnapped by the Cheyenne. Thus begins Jack's life as a Cheyenne Indian, \\"Little Big Man\\". Six years later, during a losing battle with the 12th Calvary, Jack abandons the tribe, deciding it is better to be white than dead.Jack specialized in the art and craft of coincidence. At age 17, he was taught the quick-draw by none other than Wild Bill Hickok. Later, he had the distinction of facing down Wyatt Earp, yelling, \\"Draw, you belch you\\". Jack called Wyatt \\"belch\\" because he said his name sounded like one.At age 18, he joined the Calvary, serving under General Custer at the fateful battle of Little Big Horn. Owing to his acumen as an erstwhile redskin, Crabb was the only survivor.Aside from the plethora of twists of fate and fancy, this heartwarming story is replete with trivial, yet fascinating facts of the lives of American Indians during the most tumultuous era of their history. These facts will paint the \\"redskins\\" for you, as for me, in a very sympathetic light.The lives, loves and lore of Jack Crabb, Little Big Man; deserves a conspicuous place in every one's library of classic American literature."},{"Title":"Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"Thomas Berger's humorous, horrifying and touching tale of the American West will live forever in my heart and mind.

There's never a dull moment in this tale of a man who is sort of the Forrest Gump of the old west, only shorter."},{"Title":"Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"I got this book as an Easter present from my parents when I was [...], back in the late 1970's, so the book was at least 15 years old then. I think I had not long before seen the film with Dustin Hoffman. I'd always had a fascination with American Indians as they were known then and at that time was just about beginning to read/ see more than what I had been exposed to through John Wayne style westerns - about the same time one of my uncles bought me 'Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee'.The book is - as usual- far more broader in its scope than the film, although the film is excellent too. It begins with an amateur researcher tracking down a survivor of the Battle of the Little Big Horn. The 111 year old survivor begins the story in 1852 when as a ten year old boy he (Jack Crabb)and his elder sister end up living with a small group of Cheyenne who have killed his father and the other men on their wagon train during a drunken mistake. The elder sister runs away the first night leaving the young Jack with in his own words \\"newly joined a pack of barbarians\\".The book takes the reader through Jacks life up to the age of 34 in 1876 when indeed he survives the Battle of the Little Big Horn (Custers Last Stand) - saved by a complex relationship to a Cheyenne playmate from his youth. Throughout the intervening years between 1852 and 1876 Jack oscillates between living with the Cheyenne and frontier society. Often feeling fundamentally 'white' when among the Cheyenne, and feeling fundamentally 'Cheyenne' when among the whites.The book is laced with great humour, great characterisations (Caroline Crabb, Old Lodge Skins, Little Horse, Younger Bear, Lavender, Reverend Pendrake, Sunshine, Allardyce. T. Meriweather and Botts for example) and moments of pure reflections upon the great and most mundane things all of us encounter within our lives. I especially liked the fact that the whole book is written in the vernacular of the American frontier. That and the historical accuracy of the book are testament to the research Thomas Berger put into the work.Read it and hopefully you'll love it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"I can't say that I read this genre very much.

Glad I read this one."},{"Title":"Little Big Man (Isis)","review":"'Little Big Man' is Thomas Berger's classic anti-Western that tells the tale of 111-year old Jack Crabb. Actually, Berger has Crabb narrate his own story to Ralph Fielding Snell, a writer who appends his own foreword and afterword.Crabb lived a marvelous varied and remarkable life in the Old West. He arrived in the West at age 10 and was taken captive (or volunteered due to a misunderstanding by Jack's sister) by the Cheyenne - the Human Beings. Jack moves back and forth between the Indian and the white worlds. He tended to prosper when living with Old Lodge Skins's band of Cheyenne, but he retains his white man's view of the world. As the introduction to the Delta edition by Brooks Landon states, Jack's aspirations were white, but his achievements were Cheyenne.Berger's characters, some famously historical, but most fictional, represent many Western archetypes. He marries a Swedish immigrant, befriends the card-playing gunslinger Wild Bill Hickok, goes into business with the bunco artist Allardyce T. Merriwhether, becomes a drunk, hunts buffalo with Wyatt Earp, rescues a niece from whoredom, falls in love with Mrs. Pendrake, the wife of the proselytizing minister, and fights with Custer at his Last Stand (not in that order). In the Indian world, Berger gives us the noble Indian, the fighting Indian, and the free Indian, but mostly shows the Indians living with an entirely different moral code than the whites, whom the Indians view as being crazy. Jack also turns up at two specific events: the massacre at the Washita River and the Battle of the Little Big Horn.Berger's use of the fictional Snelling as Crabb's editor introduces a couple elements of uncertainty as to the veracity of Jack's story. Snelling is somewhat skeptical of parts of Jack's story and after all, he is the one who interviewed Jack. And Snelling may not be all that reliable himself given that he delayed publication for ten years due to his own emotional collapse.Berger's characters are archetypes, but not stereotypes because he gives them a twist of his own. Little Big Man is a tour through the history of the Old West, sometimes sardonic, sometimes sobering, and always entertaining. Like most people I saw the movie well before I read the book and it was impossible not to hear Dustin Hoffman's voice throughout. The movie and the book tell very similar stories in very similar but not identical ways. For once I can say that the movie is as good as the book. Read it and watch it.

This is one of the funniest, most heart-rending stories ever concocted using historical fact and brilliantl imagination; Berger gives the reader some idea of what it must have been like to live in the American West during the submission of the Plains Indian tribes, and doesn't spare our feelings in the process. Not that it's a diatribe. LBM is a novel, first and foremost a wonderful read.

What we now take for granted, i.e., US govt (read: white) anhilation of native Americans, Berger presented to us from another perspective: the Indians'. I was about 12 years old when the movie came out and can still remember how it was much discussed at the time. Make no mistake - for all the wit and humor in this story, it is a very serious subject and for its time was very powerful. Imagine the days not so long ago when George Armstrong Custer was a national hero. This book caused rethinking and revision of white treatment of Indians and Indian culture. Mr Berger's use of a fictional character inserted into historical events was a masterful tool. The humor that our narrator, Jack Crabb, uses to get his point across is infectious, his downhome wisdom sage, and his tender heart touching.

With the second chapter the hilarity begins (with some lapses in the regional speech). There is a minimum of a laugh per page. The tragedy is a man caught between two cultures. He admires the Cheyenne, his adoptive people, but is carrying so much baggage from his original upbringing that he feels shame and guilt. Consequently he belongs to neither. He is a man lost to both as circumstance moves him back and forth between them. The book is culturally, but not historically accurate.

If you saw the movie with Dustin Hoffman, be assured that the book is just as good, even better.

Cookbook","review":"Do you love peanut butter? Are you looking for different ways to use peanut butter in recipes? Do you love quirky cookbooks?If you answered yes to any of these questions, than this just might be the cookbook for you. I picked up this cookbook on a whim at my local library, and decided to see if I could find any new recipes for my peanut loving son. Included I found several great recipes including Peanut Butter Banana Bread, Peanut Butter & Jelly Cupcakes, Peanut Butter Barbecued Chicken, and Thai-Style Shrimp Skewers. Also included but not personally tested by me include the basics of making your own homemade peanut butter (with several variations), S'more Sandwich, The Elvis (yes, with bacon, bananas, and honey), Peanut Butter Hot Chocolate, and Peanut Butter Tiramisu.My only comments regarding my 3 star rating is that the cookbook might be too specialized for some, and that in order to improve, I would suggest a picture of each recipe and a spiral binding. However, the recipes included were unique, and yummy. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Peanut Butter & Co. Cookbook","review":"This book cleary states it is for peanut butter lovers only. And they're right, if you don't like peanut butter, you have no business getting this book, though that much is obvious.The recipes in this book are all very quick and easy, and most are favorites with just a peanut butter twist. Though there are some, mainly sandwhiches, which I can only reccommend for adventurous eaters to try, though most are much more kid friendly. Some recipes are quite obvious, and aren't really needed, like the classic peanut butter and jelly sandwich, though the book would be incomplete without it.All of the recipes in the book use peanut butter, but some use special Peanut Butter and Co flavors, that you can buy online or at certain realtors, (a list is included.) There are also recipes on how to make the special peanut butters at home, though the recommend their own brand.The book starts with a foreward by Jerry Seinfeild, who was of course made famous on his namesake tv show, Seinfeild. His intro seems slighty out of place, since he really has nothing to do with peanut butter, or the rest of the book, and seems to talk more about bagels then peanut butter.The book's introduction by the author, Mr. Lee Zalben, is much more fitting, interesting, and better written, as he tells of the start, and success of Peanut Butter and Co.There is then a section entitled Peanut Butter Basics, which is basically an endosement for buying Peanut Butter and Co products, but also gives the recipes for making your own versions of their peanut butters. There is also a somewhat interesting timeline of the history of peanut butter.The recipes are divided into five chapters.The first chapter, Breakfast Treats, is full of baked goods and batter based breakfast dishes, including peanut butter and jelly french toast, in which the peanut butter is in the toast, and the jelly is featured in the syrup. Seven recipes are included.Chapter two is devoted entirely to sandwiches, of which there are fourteen, ranging from the original PB&J; to innovative ones such as cinnamon raisin swirl, to obscure ones such as the Elvis.Chapter three is entitled after-school snacks, but it is almost entirely devoted to cookies, though there are other sweets included, such as; peanut butter swirl brownies and peanut butter banana bread. Twenty one recipes are included.The next chapter features fourteen recipes for using peanut butter in entrees such as peanut butter bbq chicken, spicy peanut butter burgers, and two recipes for peanut butter soup.Chapter five is full of desserts, featuring cakes, pies, and pastries. There are twenty-two recipes total including; peanut butter - caramel cheesecake, peanut butter and strawberry shortcake, and peanut butter - berry crumble.At the back of the book there's a helpful list of where their products are available, though it contradicts with their website's store locator.Lots of color photos make this fun to look at as well as to read."},{"Title":"The Peanut Butter & Co.

Cookbook: Recipes from the World's Nuttiest Sandwich Shop and published by Quirk Books.The author tells the story of him making his college dream come true of having a peanut butter sandwich shop, and I loved the part of the story where soon after opening he had a packed house and his main sandwich maker quit. Luckily, his wonderful mother came to the rescue and received a huge round of applause from the crowds! The recipes in The Peanut Butter & Co. Cookbook encompass all kinds of delicious ways to use peanut butter, including breakfast, dessert, savory and even his famous sandwiches (like the Fluffernutter and the Elvis). The Thai Peanut Soup and the Maple Peanut Butter Mousse also look excellent. Mr. Zalben even kindly shares his expert tips on how to make your own peanut butter.The Peanut Butter & Co.

One thing I absolutely love is that the book provides recipes for the actual peanut butter flavors, so you don't HAVE to buy their products. I will keep right on buying because I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!

Scout Driggs is a master of the writed word, Scout Driggs is a bard among non-bard peoples or animals, an effervescent fizzing soda in a world where there is no soda because it has all gone flat and is now just sugar water. It's the gaseous bubbles that make soda good, so i ask you where is the gas in this Pony Dress-Up Day book? And plus, none of the pictures were colored and I had to color them in myself with my little sister with crayons and markers (but if you use markers don't push hard or else it seeps through to the other side and ruins the next page which is so annoying!) But a book with no story where you have to color the pictures yourself? I was reading about things like this in Thomas L. Friedman's \\"The World is Flat.\\" Friedman says that in this day and age if you fly on a plane you become your own ticket agent by printing out your ticket and checking in for your flight on-line before you even go to the airport. Effectively you become an employee of the company you're buying from!

As a previous reviewer has already noted, this book is a feast for devotees of the written word.I cannot claim to have fully understood every page of this novel. It is not an easy read. It forces you to read each and every paragraph carefully and even then you need to apply yourself to understand the words on the page.The Divinity Student is thrown out of the seminary after he is apparently struck dead by lightning. He is brought back to life by a mysterious group of people who gut his corpse and stuff him full of pages from a mysterious book. He is put to work as a word-finder. He soon learns that there is a book full of lost and possibly forbidden words; 'the Catalog'. He is approached by a representative of an underground organization who tells him that he, The Divinity Student, has been chosen to do something or other with the Catalog.The Divinity Student soon finds that the Catalog has been destroyed. He learns of 12 deceased word-finders who were the authors of the Catalog. He, along with his butcher, finds the corpses, drains them of their essence and begins recreating the Catalog._The Divinity Student_ is a dense story, but it is very, very fascinating. Cisco changes scenes often which makes it difficult to follow the story. His writing style is gorgeous. It makes this story worth reading for the subtle nuances of the English language alone. As I said, I did not fully understand this story. I suspect it will benefit from a re-reading or two. I do not understand the significance of the cats in the street. I am perplexed by the apparently sentient cars. Many passages in the book are made up of dream sequences, which makes it difficult to determine what is real and what is not.I would love to read a definitive description of this book, to know what it's all about. Until I find one, I will remember this book as a masterpiece of literary wordplay. Most of this book appears to be written in the present tense, which is strikingly different from the norm. I look forward to finding more of Michael Cisco's writings. Check this book out. It's different. It's neat. It's good. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Divinity Student","review":"There is a short author's note at the end of \\"The Divinity Student\\" where Michael Cisco describes his notion that the act of reading induces a trance-like state, and how his ambition was to produce a work that made one feel as if the words were being dreamt rather than read.He succeeded. Brilliantly.This work stands as a bizarre exploration of the surreal and macabre. The story, set in a time and place which are indeterminate, revolves around a divinity student who has been reanimated from death. He is given a mission to move to an old city and take up work as a \\"wordfinder\\". That is to say, one who finds and records words which exist but are not official components of language. They are unconsciously written and spoken but never recognized or defined. This develops into a deeper quest to recover the contents of the Book of Words, which had contained the diction of a powerful, pure, and divine language but has since been destroyed. To do this, he must employ strange, mystical techniques on the decomposing corpses of the book's original compilers and thus retrieve this knowledge. As more information is acquired, the divinity student drifts farther and farther from our world into supernaturalism, black magic, and ghoulish power.The narrative proceeds with an entirely unique cadence as there is a disquietingly smooth flow from one bizarre event to another. The pace and candor, which are sleepy and strangely matter-of-fact, sharply contrast the content, which is immensely dark and bloated with odd, frightening events and with starkly hallucinatory sequences. The reader feels as if they are drifting effortlessly and naturally from one deranged moment to the next, much as they would in a dream. Imagine a lake with a floor made from a giant kaleidoscope that is backlit with powerful lamps and has a black octopus living in the center; or perhaps a priest with eyes painted over his closed eyelids who can induce visions by blowing formaldehyde onto your face.The details are blurry and vague at best, and much of the plot must extrapolated from the weird collection of information presented. The characters are strange and mostly two dimensional, but this level of depiction, I believe, is necessary to support the foggy, half-real atmosphere of the writing. The prose is, at times, absolutely gorgeous.I do not recommend this book to anyone interested in a gripping narrative full of strong, memorable characters. I do not recommend this book to anyone who seeks explanation and closure from a story. I do not recommend this book to anyone with a weak stomach.I do recommend this to someone who is willing to experiment with this odd form of escapism and experience the unique sensation of dreaming through the pages. The images that Cisco evokes are bizarre, but also fascinating in their frightening and psychedelic un-wordliness.And then, at some point, the book ends and you simply wake up."},{"Title":"The Divinity Student","review":"Wow. I was genuinely blown away by this little novel. I have heard Cisco compared to Ligotti (there is even a Ligotti blurb on the back), but his work is entirely unique, a bizarre marriage of disturbing surrealism and dark fantasy rendered in a highly original prose style. The book is worth reading for the prose alone, which replicates the effects of a dream, at times blurry and indiscriminate and sharpening to crystalline detail at other moments. The imagery is some of the most simultaeneously beautiful and nightmarish that I have ever experienced save in the work of Kafka, Schulz or Ligotti. The plot moves with a raw, pulsating power, and the book induces bizarrre emotions in the reader which have their only corollary in dreams (or nightmares). The last chapter is one of the most bleak and moving pieces of prose that I have encountered in weird fiction. Simply put, if you are a lover of surrealism or dark fantasy, YOU NEED TO READ THIS BOOK.NOTE: This book is being reprinted in The San Veneficio Canon, to be published by Night Shade Press. The San Veneficio Canon will also include the sequel to The Divinity student."},{"Title":"The Divinity Student","review":"Of THE DIVINITY STUDENT acclaimed master of the horror tale, Thomas Ligotti, has said, &quot;Festival of unrealities, an entrancing body of hallucinations mutilated with surgical precision by a masterful literary maniac.&quot; For my money, truer words have rarely been spoken! The _singular_ voice of this gifted wordsmith delivers page turning, titillating romps that will have both readers and critics alike singing his praises for a long time to come. In an era when mountains of the same-old clutter the shelves of the horror section, few novels can be called a breath of fresh air, but Cisco's ingenious tale of the uncanny stands as a radiant beacon to those of us who have long enjoyed the dark wonders of the weird tale."},{"Title":"The Divinity Student","review":"Michael Cisco, The Divinity Student (Buzzcity Press, 1999)I had somehow gotten it in my head that The Divinity Student was a horror novel. I have no idea how that happened, for it is anything but. This is a fantasy, almost a steampunk novel, that put me in mind more than anything of K. J. Bishop or Ekaterina Sedia, but with the obsession with language more commonly found in Catherynne Valente or China Mieville. (And if you're a fan of any of the above and haven't discovered Michael Cisco yet, do so at your earliest opportunity.) It is beautiful, fascinating, thought-provoking.As we open, the nameless Divinity Student of the title is struck by lightning and killed, but we soon see that this is some sort of common (or at least understood) ritual in this world; the body is returned to the seminary, eviscerated, filled with pages ripped from sacred books, and plunged into water. (I now want to be buried like this.) He then returns to consciousness and is given an assignment by Fasvergil, the head of the seminary; he is to go to San Veneficio, a nearby city, and get work as a word-finder while he waits for further instructions. When he gets them, that's truly amazing (and it's there the plot really kicks off), but just think about the idea of a world where you can go to a city and find work as a word-finder.There are so many wonderful things to say about this book that I'm not even sure where to begin. There are some I can't talk about, because we'd be getting far into spoiler territory, but the writing is just phenomenal; Michael Cisco has a love affair with the language, and it shows. The downside to that is that typographical and proofreading errors made by the press tend to come through more in books like this (and it didn't help that this was the second book in a week that used the odd, but somehow appropriate, phrase \\"door jam\\"; as it is spelled right in other places in the book, I'm giving Cisco the benefit of the doubt and blaming the press), but that's not something for which I can blame the author. And the plot here is one of the most original, and pleasurable, I've come across in years.The book is not perfect, though if you're going to err, better to do it this way than the other; if anything, it's shorter than it should be. There are a few chapters that begged to be further fleshed out (\\"The Final Interview\\", especially, could have been twice as long as it is). Still, there's so much about this book to love that you can't go wrong. This is by far one of the best books I've read this year, and I can't recommend it highly enough. Find it and read it as soon as you possibly can. ****"},{"Title":"The Divinity Student","review":"Brilliant and dark, just how I love it. This book strung together words in ways that I have never laid eyes on before or since. Interesting story and GREAT imagery. I love the structure and combination of words just as much as the tale they are weaving."},{"Title":"The Divinity Student","review":"Michael Cisco has in The Divinity Student performed the feat declared impossible by the only other member of his sub-sub-genre, Thomas Ligotti: he has wrought a nightmare vignette of depressive elation, nihilistic revelation, in novel (okay, novella) length. It is a weird journey to be compared only with the eerie and stunning impact of reading Ligotti's own Songs of a Dead Dreamer. I wish Cisco's new fans good hunting as they now go in search, as they must, to find his several short stories, including &quot;The Reliquaries,&quot; &quot;Translation,&quot; &quot;He Will Be there,&quot; &quot;For No Eyes,&quot; &quot;The Water Nymphs,&quot; &quot;Firebrands of Terror,&quot; and others. His Divinity Student is like Ligotti's Vastarien, the book that is not about a thing, but is that thing."},{"Title":"The Divinity Student","review":"The Divinity Student lives in a miasma of incredible images, a world of moments and sensations that are described with a truly amazing marriage of meticulous detail and subtle understatement. The plot is dark and intriguing, as the Divinity Student exposes the true purpose and power of the quest on which he is sent, and as that quest slowly overcomes him with a life of its own; but the enjoyment in reading this book comes from the author's exquisite description of each individual moment. A must-read for anyone who takes joy in well-crafted wordsmithing."},{"Title":"The Divinity Student","review":"Although not entirely blown away by Cisco's first work, I am appreciative of his project as an author; combining literary traditions and siting influences including Tolkien and Lovecraft, two of the 20th-century's greatest \\"genre\\" writers, Cisco can count me among his target audience. His ultra-bizarre, seductive, psychedelic and trance-inducing prose lends a certain conviction to his otherworldly backdrop and story. Most of the action and story elements occur between the lines, and what the reader's imagination creates from these suggestions is the magic and power that make this work remarkable. Recommended for all those who constantly wonder, \\"How real is the 'real world'?\\""},{"Title":"The Divinity Student","review":"What Michael Cisco did with The Divinity Student is he created a name for himself in the dark fantasy realm. This novel chronicles the journey of a man who is simply known as The Divinity Student. In the first few chapters of the book, you can already tell that this is going to be an interesting read. The Divinity Student is made up of book pages instead of body parts. His job is a word finder. He begins working in the city of San Veneficio and meets a lovely cast of characters (a mystical clown, something that reminds me of a chesire cat called an &quot;oro&quot; and many others). He soon realizes his task is to disinter the 12 bodies of the greatest word finders. He must look into their memories and write down every word they knew.Stunning, surreal, undefiable--Michael Cisco has written an amazing piece of literary work here.

The title is VERY misleading, in that it is titled with as a guide to sport climbing the \\"Canadian Rockies,\\" although it only covers the SE Canadian Rockies and includes lots of trad in some areas listed.For the areas it covers, it does a pretty good job, showing bolts and such so you aren't stuck counting them on your own and hoping you have enough draws. The directions to getting to some of the areas isn't too great, but it is managable.If you go to the SE Rockies, be sure to visit Grassi Lakes just outside of Canmore!!! It is bolted and offers 1-pitch climbs along with one 2-pitch climb (which you can pull off as a 1-pitch if you have a rope that is 70 m long, and I have heard 60 m works for a single pitch on that climb, too, but don't hold me to it for the 60 m!). The rock in that area is limestone and has lots of pockets... very nice =) ."},{"Title":"Sport Climbs in the Canadian Rockies","review":"This guide did the trick, what else can i say?

A series of beautifully-written and well-supported essays covers, very quickly, the turn-of-the-millennium status of research on the subject of how life got started at the very, very beginning. How did 'pre-biotic' molecules ever get started replicating themselves, eventually turning into 'biotic' molecules? The answers aren't all in, but there's some really exciting work going on; scientists are relentlessly chipping away at the problem and they have made a surprising amoutn of progress. You know, these days the creationists are getting a lot of press. And they keeep hammering on the idea that the pre-biotic genesis of life is simply impossible; it had to require some sort of divine intervention. This is a lie. Take astronomer Fred Hoyle's famous simile -- that the accidental genesis of life would be like a tornado ripping through a junkyard and assembling a 747. While I read 'Life's Origin', I thought often of Hoyle and how much I'd like to throttle him. The origin of life requires NOTHING like the accidental assembly of a jet aircraft. It requires something much more like the lifting of two magnets into the air, so they can snap together, each magnet's noth pole snapping to the other's south. Molecules have natural affinities. They were 'born' to snap together. 99.9% of all the matter in the universe is either carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, or nitrogen: the stuff of life. Once the Earth had cooled down from its fiery birth, life couldn't wait to get started. And once it got started, it was by its very nature almost unstoppable. This is not an easy book. It's written for a lay audience (and there's a helpful glossary at the back), but there's a ton of orgo in it, so if you're not a chemist you had best be a quick study: the kind of layperson who, having once heard (for example) the word 'racemic' defined, can use it in a coherent sentence the following day. If you're that kind of smart, you will get a real kick out of this book. This crazy world is more beautiful -- life is more strange and fantastic and marvelous, than we ever suspected. Read and enjoy."},{"Title":"Life's Origin: The Beginnings of Biological Evolution","review":"The articles in this book are by scientists, well respected researchers in their fields, the real guys. They were not written by journalists, science writers... this book is a primary source.Other reviewers have described the immense scope of this book from the lifecycle of stars to, finally, biochemistry.I want to focus on the article by Leslie Orgel, \\"The Origin of Biological Information\\" (Chapter 5). RNA is critically important for ribosomes which are the builders of proteins. Proteins are the central theme of biochemistry. The phrase \\"RNA World\\" is found in several parts of the book, but Orgel's article explains why that concept is, to me, the central answer to the origin of life, the interface between inorganic and organic.Vastly simplified, RNA is able to catalyze replication, on its own. It offers a 'solution' to the 'paradox' of replication first or metabolism first. It is the foundation for the incredibly hopeful, fabulously rich and fascinating research on ribozymes.In addition to reading this book, I strongly suggest readers watch the 90-minute Science Channel program (Science Channel Specials) that covers roughly the same material with narration and commentary by many of the same authors and some others. William Schopf is prominently featured; maybe this book was the basis for the TV program? The video presentation makes some of the concepts easier to grasp (and more simplified) and is more entertaining.For those who want to know more but find the copious scientific references too dense or out of reach due to subscription fees for research journals, I suggest you read- the article in Wikipedia about ribozymes- the Nobel lectures (nobelprize.org) by Cech and Altman- Lynn Margulis' book \\"Early Life.\\" Several hypotheses are equivocal, such as symbiosis for the intra-cellular organelles mitochondria and the role of cyanobacteria, but that's what makes it interesting."},{"Title":"Life's Origin: The Beginnings of Biological Evolution","review":"In a word: disappointed. I came to this book expecting to see more of the excellent work displayed in Dr. Schopf's previous book,Cradle of Life: The Discovery of Earth's Earliest Fossils(1999). Instead I found a rehashing of some of the standard, and in my view time-worn theories about the origin of life -- all of which end up rather indefinite, speculative and unsatisfying.Some of the stuff isn't even accurate: it is not true that \\"Miller's experiment showed for the first time that amino acids can be produced under simulated 'primitive Earth conditions'.\\" (p18) Never mind the fact that Miller's simulated conditions are a far cry from primitive conditions (see the discussion, pp67-68). Miller wasn't even the first to do these experiments: See Yockey,Information Theory, Evolution, and The Origin of Life, page 125ff; Miller's was a repeat of \\"experiments of Walther L&ouml;b et al in 1922.\\"Incidentally, I would think that the composition of the early earth environment would naturally come from a study of planet formation by accretion - a natural topic of astrophysics. I think the answer is: NOT an ammonia/methane environment!! for reasons that have to do with the chemistry that results from the cooling of a molten inner planet. One of my favorite books on this subject is Peter D. Ward and Donald Brownlee,Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe. See also Christopher Wills and Jeffrey Bada,The Spark Of Life: Darwin And The Primeval Soupand Wallace S. Broecker,How to Build a Habitable Planet.I assume that this book is a compilation of papers that he uses in his college courses. Nothing wrong with that, but I had anticipated something much better. I have great respect for his work in Cradle of Life, and his participation in the 1998 NRC Symposium,Size Limits of Very Small Microorganisms: Proceedings of a Workshop (Compass Series (Washington, D.C.).). I had hoped for some further insights that follow on from the implications of that symposium, in particular.The most interesting chapter concerns the \\"Tree of Life\\" written by Dr. Schopf himself. Genetic research has constructed its own tree based on the recurrence of similar gene packages. Widely different animal species share the same \\"hox\\" gene packages for appendages (legs, antennae, etc.), eyes, etc. Some packages appear to have been in place and largely unchanged since (at least) the Cambrian Era, some 500 million years ago. Barely noted in his book is the ultimate \\"package\\" that is essentially the same for all plants and animals: the so-called \\"central dogma\\" that determines the genetic coding in the DNA, and the elaborate process by which this is transformed into the useful life chemicals.If one insists on evolution by purely natural processes, this recurrence of similar gene packages is a powerful \\"proof\\" that these diverse species share a common ancestor, and in particular that all of life evolved from an original first living cell \\"[s]ince any complete biochemical system is far too elaborate to have evolved more than once in the history of life....\\" (p.163). This is of course no explanation of how the packages came to be in the first place -- and the book's probes into this issue (which is after all the subject of the entire book) come to singularly weak and unconvincing conclusions.There will always, I think, be a chasm between Creationists and Naturalists, regarding life's origins. The Creationist sees natural descent as a possible but not necessary conclusion of the genetic tree of life: similar gene packages may just show that the Creator re-used them. Proof of a natural process is not just asserting \\"it must be so\\" but in showing such relatedness in the laboratory or in mathematical simulation based on demonstrable assumptions about physical or chemical processes. Otherwise, the claim is metaphysics or religion, but certainly not science.In my view, the theory of evolution has made great advances exactly in proportion to the effort it has given to such experimentation. I love to discover (with the help of great authors) new things about the power of natural processes through laboratory experimentation, for example in Sean B. Carroll'sEndless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science of Evo Devo- a book that I recommend highly. I would similarly look forward to a demonstration of relatedness by simulation (at one time I conjectured that evolution of the trilobite phacops eye can be explained by simulation on the basis of a combination of arrested development and environmental pressure).I look forward to another book by Schopf that will similarly expand my understanding of Life's Origins -- but without the tired \\"just so\\" stories found in this book.HMSChallenger"},{"Title":"Life's Origin: The Beginnings of Biological Evolution","review":"I have had this on my shelf for a while, and then in the stacks of good books to review for Amazon. J. William Schopf is not only a skilled scientist, but this book shows his skills as an editor and author. He assembled a distinguished group of origin of life researchers and each chapter takes on a key issue they were significant contributors to over decades. This can have some negatives. The most obvious is that the authors do tend to favor their contributions over those of others, and certainly not every important researcher is represented.One example of the first problem is chapter 3, \\"Formation of the Building Blocks of Life\\" by Stanley Miller, and Antonio Lazcano. These long time collaborators are major proponents of an atmospheric origin of prebiotic organic molecules, Miller being the first ever to publish experimental results on this in 1953. However, their discussion of hydrothermal vent, and cosmogenic sources to early earth's environment is barely more than their objections to these ideas. The major papers by the senior proponents of these substantial hypotheses are barely mentioned.The level of some chapters is about that of a college undergraduate with at least some course work in chemistry. This is a bit higher than a general reader's comfort zone. There is a very helpful glossary, and the finer details of chemical reactions can be skipped by most people."},{"Title":"Life's Origin: The Beginnings of Biological Evolution","review":"The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of five is simply because it is a little rough around the edges as far as a \\"page turner.\\" I suppose it's all in the way you look at it but none the less, this book is packed with facts about research. It's the presentation of the research, I suppose, that I found to be a little anticlimactic.Onto the book. Wow! Page after page of research and facts! For a guy like me, I couldn't appreciate it more. One thing I loved about this book is how honest it is. First, it will lay down all of the research done in a certain area, then, only to go back and raise the issues with its plausibiliby regarding the present theory on the actual process it must undergo.I believe that we were created. I really enjoy reading books of this caliber due to the fact that it only further strengthens my belief. On the chapter pertaining to the origin of biological information, this book is completely silent. Only giving current theories on how it is possible that information could have begun to be \\"stored,\\" not the origin of information. The section regarding The RNA World, it reads \\"The idea that there was once a protein-independent biological world, the so-called RNA World, has now come to be widely excepted (although it remains unproven).\\" (Life's Origin pg142)In regards to natural affinities that molecules have for one another. This is quite true. But to examine this issue further one must look at its role on the origin and/or expanding of information. In digital information, like we see in RNA and DNA, natural affinities of molecules would be completely detrimental to its production. When a programmer writes a program, if he/she were restrained to only writing code in a certain order using only predetermined texts, there is no way that they could produce new information via evolution.Racemic mixtures. This book hints at a few ways to get around it but again, the odds are insurmountable.Actually, this book shows many techniques and procedures that have contrived many organic molecules independently. The astronomical task is having all of these perfect conditions present at one period in time to bring them all together. It's not that I'm pessimistic. I know my biochemistry.This book is a great tool to have if you want to further your knowledge in using biochemistry to try and explain the origin of life through natural, undirected processes.Of course I HAVE to promote \\"Darwin's Black Box: The Biochemical Challenge to Evolution\\" by Dr. Michael Behe. To all you biochemists, read this book, it will change your lives, promise."},{"Title":"Crossing the Color Line","review":"Maureen T. Reddy explores her personal experiences as a white mother of biracial children in Crossing the Color Line: Race, Parenting, and Culture. She convincingly explores the ways that reproduction between two races is still a controversial issue in a nation which needs &quot;a serious, sustained, meaningful dialogue about race.&quot; (p. xi) Reddy describes her experience as a mother as bridging two races in a culture where racism still exists. The personal experiences of Maureen Reddy support her consideration of racial issues. Previously unaware of the implications of her racial identity, Reddy realized in her cross-cultural marriage that the doctrine of whiteness is &quot;the norm against which all differences are measured.&quot; (p. 12) Her newfound awareness of whiteness as a social category moved her out of the mainstream of whiteness into uncharted territory. Reddy eloquently discusses t5he fact that in the U.S., &quot;for both blacks and whites, there is an automatic presumption of underlying pathology in interracial relationships&quot; (p. 10) because of such forces as segregation and normative whiteness. Parenting brought to light issues of discrimination which her marriage had not yet uncovered. After the birth of her son, she needed to work towards racial equality because the future of black Americans was now the future of her progeny. Perhaps the most controversial and logical part of Maureen Reddy's discussion is the societal motivation for whites to ignore race as a social force. Reddy believes that &quot;[m]ost white liberals are willing to 'add in' blacks, but many are not willing to step aside in order to stand next to blacks.&quot; (p. 138) If whites acknowledge racism and seek social justice, there children would lose privileges currently inherent in &quot;whiteness&quot;. Maurren Reddy's experience as a white mother of biracial children led her to examine the forces of racism at work in our society. She implies that these racist forces are visible to all who want to see them."},{"Title":"Voyage from Yesteryear","review":"On the brink of nuclear war, Earth launches an Alpha Centauri probe that contains blueprints for DNA in digital form, hoping to start a human civilization that can escape the holocaust. Now, decades later, the New American Order (which sounds pretty fascist) sends the first mission from Earth to the new colony, only to find that its society is quite different from Earth's, and in some surprising ways. This is an excellent book, featuring some very imaginative hard SF concepts and far-reaching social commentary. In essence, it amounts to a libertarian manifesto, but in some ways Hogan goes farther than that. I have doubts about how workable his concept would be with a society numbering more than a few hundred thousand souls, but it certainly sounds attractive. Hogan's writing is expert, and his ear for the voice of the military grunts who are the focus of much of the book's action is unerring--kind of an interstellar MASH or Catch-22, if you take my meaning. This is one that I really didn't want to end."},{"Title":"Voyage from Yesteryear","review":"This is a novel well worth reading because it makes you think. As always, Hogan is trying to think outside the box, and he tries to make the reader to do the same. In that, he succeeds in this very worthwhile novel.The time is the late 21st century. There has been a third world war, and America and the world has more or less recovered from the aftermath. But America is transformed into a near-fascist state. There are hints that the Asians are practicing liberal democracy and that the Europeans are more or less junior rivals to America.The novel involves a race by the three powers (America, Europe, and Asia) to re-establish contact with a colony established on Alpha Centauri's main planet--the colony had been jointly established prior to the war. The Americans arrive first, and the clash between the Americans and the colonists is the central theme of the book.The main notion of the book is that people and nations carry their prejudices from generation to generation, and that it may take some form of \\"fresh start\\" to eliminate these prejudices. Hogan notes that America represented such a fresh start when it was founded, and Americans have shaken off much in the way of class structure and other undesireable components of European culture. Likewise, in his novel, the colonists have made a \\"fresh start,\\" and have abolished racial prejudice (or even racial awareness), as well as any concept of a market economy or of the anglo-saxon justice system.Hogan's basic premise makes sense--that a fresh start such as took place in America might help eradicate ancient prejudices. As he writes elsewhere, if we could somehow get one generation of the folks in Northern Ireland away from their parent's prejudices, this ancient quarrel would doubtless end for all time.Unfortunately, some of Hogan's speculation fails to hold water. His replacement for a justice system is having people shoot bad guys out of hand. Only trouble with this is that it is exactly what people used to do a couple of centuries ago. This caused feuding and an endless cycle of family reprisals. So we invented courts. Here, Hogan has us going backwards, candidly probably due to his lack of historical knowledge in this regards. Similarly, Hogan postulates that the Centaurian colonists would abandone money and a market system because everyone would work their fair share and take their fair share--the notion is that productivity is so high with modern technology that there is no need to ration resources. Nonsense, as the fall of socialism/communism has shown. Human greed is limitless and there will always be a need to somehow ration labor and resources. Here, Hogan makes a nice try that falls flat. These are not major quibbles, by the way.As a novel, Voyage From Yesteryear is so-so. The characters are not well developed, the storyline is murky, and the book rambles. In one sense you always know where it is going--a clash between the Americans and the colonists. But other than this broad theme, the book rambles erratically. You might think that these flaws render the book mediocre. That is not true. This novel's strengths are its ideas and speculations about both science and human societies. It is quite readable and does constitute a good read.This is an interesting book with interesting ideas and speculation. It is well worth reading whether or not you agree with all of Hogan's speculation. This one gets 4 stars. That ain't bad."},{"Title":"Voyage from Yesteryear","review":"I find this book a great story, easy to read, diffiuclt to put out.Of course, there are some flaws, technology moved since the book's been written, but the story does not suffer from that!I've read it several times and still come back to it from time to time.The author's beliefs in evolution and mentioned ani-God bias may tweak the noses of some (mine too a bit) but let us be honest - that's how many people see &quot;The Institutions&quot; ot the state and the church. And the ideal society of Chironians - ;-) ... it is good to see that some people still believe we humans can escape from our &quot;bad nature&quot;"},{"Title":"Voyage from Yesteryear","review":"One of the foundations of SF is examining the consequences of science and technology on society. Here Hogan creates two diametrically opposed societies - those of Earth founded on limited resources and those of the newly colonized planet Chrion having unlimited resources. You won't find deep character development in this book, the focus is on the effects of technology on society - what we can become. Telling the story from the viewpoint of solders on the second colonization starship traveling and landing on the planet Chrion, Hogan explores his vision of what humanity can be. Chrionians value and trade respect, possessions are in abundence and free from automated factories. On the second colonization starship traveling from a militarized Earth, imagine the consequences to those powers to be when character matters! Unlimited resources you ask? Hogan postulates, the mind is a unlimited resource."},{"Title":"Voyage from Yesteryear","review":"This story is about what could be built in the future if only we put away our old ideas.

Almost wish there was a sequel!"},{"Title":"Voyage from Yesteryear","review":"A few years ago I bought a second hand copy of this book. During this time I must have read it at least once a year. I like it that much.It is a book about what humanity could aspire to become if we can put away the mistakes of the past and present.The arguments I've read that this is a unrealistic fantasy.... this is a book of fiction that portraits the thought and maybe the wishes of the author. You can agree with them or not.This is one of the few books that I would recommend to a beginning SF reader. It is not too difficult and a pleasure to read, and unlike many other books you are not left with a feeling of light depression because every main character died or had some other terrible fate happen to them.If you are interested in other works of Mr. Hogan I would recommend 'The Giant Novels' and 'The Genesis Machine'."},{"Title":"Voyage from Yesteryear","review":"I loved this book, and have read it many times. I especially love the quasi-utopian society it depicts. I really think that a society like that could work, at least in basic principal. The Chironians are all very decent, logical, interesting people. I do think their habit of always carrying guns, and being very free in their use of them, although only for self-defense, is a bit troubling. That would be something that would definitely require a major change in the characters of our society's individuals. But that, along with the idea of trading in respect, rather than money (as long as their are sufficient commodities to satisy everyone--and that too would take some modifications in character, which would require teaching people through media and education), I think could and would be a very good thing."},{"Title":"Voyage from Yesteryear","review":"One of my favorite books.

( Foxconn, the Apple manufacturing plant in China will be installing one million robots in 2013.)In that society, capitalism is long gone and is both unnecessary, unworkable and unwanted.Yes there is quite a bit of militaristic brutality and exhibitions of immorality and imperialism so as to villify the bad guys but it all goes together quite nicely and I thought the surprise at the end was just perfect.Not for Ayn Rand fans."},{"Title":"Voyage from Yesteryear","review":"You are drawn in by the people and there various lives aboard a giant star ark The main characters are slowly drawn together to save whats left of mankind"},{"Title":"Voyage from Yesteryear","review":"Hogan is a member of that group of sci-fi writers who present bold ideas but don't particularly write well or develop characters (Isaac Asimov is the first, and best, member of that school of Sci-Fi writers.)

We have had thousands of years of war, sexism and the exclusion of various \\"outsider\\" groups (based on caste, race, tribe, income, etc.) Even studies of chimpanzees, humans closest relatives, have shown certain \\"outsider\\" males are physically abused by the \\"alpha males\\" of the group.

Matriarchy might be the only real answer to the world's problems."},{"Title":"Voyage from Yesteryear","review":"Though the book had some good plot points, I found the overall tone offensive. Mr. Hogan is apparently an atheist or agnostic, and believes in evolution. In his book he consistently bashes religion, making anyone who is religious appear to be either a fanatic or inclined towards greed and other base emotions. None of the protagonists ever mentions God or His place in the universe.I also found his arguments for Chironian society riddled with flaws. The most glaring - that Chironians place no value on stable family relationships, have no sense of commitment to a spouse, and there is never any jealousy or contention among family members or society in general. Just because the original Chironians came from computer programs and were raised by robots does not eliminate human's genetic leaning toward violence and confrontation.I read another of Mr. Hogan's books recently and found the same anti-God bias.

Years later, when the distance finally becomes manageable, what is discovered is nothing short of pure utopia; a society unencumbered with politics, greed, and pride, living far more advanced in so many ways.Hogan has a firm grasp on science and provides interesting characterizations with equally compelling story lines.

Hogan's entertaining novel, humankind has settled a planet orbiting Alpha Centauri's primary star. The planet is called Chiron, after one of the few \\"good\\" centaurs in Greek mythology, and is settled by robots who use stored genetic information to create the first generation of human Chironians. Decades later, after a devastating world war, a newly fascist America sends a starship to claim its colony. Predictably, the Terrans and Chironians come into conflict.This book probably offers the best exploration of an anarchist society in science fiction since Ursula LeGuin's The Dispossessed. Although some reviewers have criticized Hogan's depiction of a noncapitalist society, they are clearly stuck in the old-fashioned mindset of communism versus capitalism and incapable of appreciating anything outside that paradigm. The description of the interaction between Terrans and Chironians is evocative of the early European explorers' accounts of Native America and Hogan's descriptions of the American's rationalizations for their encroachment on Chiron are reminiscient of some of the worst chapters of history as well eerily predictive of recent events. His account of the nonthinking aquiesence of some segments of the Terran population to the powermongering of the upper \\"echelons\\" is similarly spot-on.The book suffers from a large cast of characters, none of whom are really given a chance to develop although this is a criticism often applied to science fiction.Overall, an excellent book. It's influence can be seen in the popular computer game Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri."},{"Title":"Voyage from Yesteryear","review":"VOYAGE FROM YESTERYEAR depicts a libertarian utopia coming into contact with a sort of neo fascist, conservative American dream gone awry.

Several things struck me after my last reading.The culture described is similar to the culture of open-source software programmers. This culture has been described by Eric Raymond (an open-source software guru) as a 'gift culture' as opposed to an 'exchange culture'. A gift culture is one where a person's worth is judged by how much he or she gives away. An exchange culture (the conventional Amerison/western economy) values a person by how much power and money he or she possesses. In a money economy it is easy to do bad things: just give them more money or power. Pimping, murder, politics, spying, down-sizing, advertising, etc. (All these professions would still exist, but much less.)After this last reading I recognized that Hogan is speculating on 2 cultural developments: 1. A society that didn't inherit all our hang-ups and conditioning. 2. A society with limitless energy and material resources.I share the doubt of another reader that the Chironian culture could function beyond some natural limit (200,000...2M ?) While goods may be be freely available to people, land will become a limited resource. What happens when all the Centauri planets are terraformed and filled up? They will need to invent a method to move huge numbers of people to other star systems.Each time I read Voyage from Yesteryear I speculate on how the Congreve and crew will manage when it returns to a shattered and hate-filled Earth. I try to 'think like a Chironian' and see the path. As yet, I'm still tripping over my American conditioning before I get very far.

S. Army following mobilization of the U. S. Forces in 1940. The 2d Battalion of the 131st Field Artillery, destined for the Philippines, diverted to Australia when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. From there they went to Java to aid the Dutch in holding the Dutch East Indies. When the Dutch surrendered Java to the Japanese, the captured men took a lengthy and uncomfortable voyage by rail and sea, ending up in Thailand. The Japanese objective was control of India, and for that they needed an overland connection across Southeast Asia through Thailand and Burma. Prior to the war, the British had abandoned plans to build a railroad across that forbidding terrain, but the Japanese tackled thejob with prisoners of war and workers captured in countries they had overrun as WWII began. The public has heard of that railway in the story and movie, The Bridge Over the River Kwai, one part of the same railway. Mr. Thompson tells of the good times of which there were few and the bad of which there were many. He praises the comraderie of the men that helped offset the cruelty of their captors. He describes the miserable living conditions lacking in even a minimum of food, clothing, and shelter. He speaks of the long hours of back breaking labor and nights made sleepless by heat and insects. He tells how the men kept their courage up by listening to a forbidden radio ingeniously rigged to bring in news of help on the way. He communicates the joy of final liberation of the men who remained, and he lists in the book the names of the many who died of tropical diseases, neglect, and malnutrition. The book strikes at the heart of any American conscious of the debt owed to courageous men such as Mr. Thompson who endured so much to ensure freedom for all. It reminds us of the need to review th story,to remember the heroic deeds, to express gratitude for the wartime service of this great generation."},{"Title":"A Thousand Cups of Rice: Surviving the Death Railway","review":"This story is about a young man from the Texas National Guard who gets captured by the Japanese.

Accessible to students and yet still offering challenging insights for more advanced scholars, Coats's work is elegantly written and ground-breaking. I recommend this book to all scholars in the field."},{"Title":"Looking Glasses and Neverlands: Lacan, Desire, and Subjectivity in Children's Literature","review":"I had mixed feelings about this book. Its worth getting. It is beautifully written, clear, concise, and conveys a ton of difficult material on Lacan in a very lucid manner. Its probably one of the best academic writings I've encountered on Lacanian theory--to some extent (that is, the most basic and elemental aspects of Lacan).However, I was not happy with the way the writer brought her impeccably controlled and \\"authoritative\\" theoretical apparatus to bear on children's literature. Not once did she address the problem that children would never be able to process their literature in Zizekian or Lacanian language. She never discusses the immense gap between the theoretical technology she commands and the audience for the books she writes about, to the point where it got absolutely ludicrous to read about the perverse psychic structure of Curious George. She simply has to address the problem that children don't have a clue what \\"the Other\\" is. They do not have these terms at their disposal. Therefore, it seems to me, one must find and seek out the structural translations that might lead us to really understand how how the \\"Other\\" or the \\"phallus\\" translates to someone without this verbiage. It seems to me that children's lit demands a purely structural Lacanian approach so that we may find the things that truly are at work and transmitting to children. I don't think she gets at this level at all, except, maybe, when she is talking about early picture books. Then she actually discusses the differences between words and things, images and story. That is concrete. But when she gets to the older literature, she loses her grip.This is not to say that one can't use Lacan to talk about children's lit, but her readings are way too didactic. She spends way too much time expounding and explaining her theory, and hardly any time at all reading the texts. A la Zizek, they simply become \\"transparent\\" demonstrations of her theory.So I would recommend this if what you're interested in is an \\"authoritative\\" rendition of Lacanian theory; it really is very clear and very interesting. But I would not recommend it if you're interested in children's literature or a truly Lacanian reading of children's lit."},{"Title":"Information Literacy Instruction: Theory and Practice (Information Literacy Sourcebooks)","review":"Information Literacy Instruction: Theory And Practice is an exhaustive textbook (450 pp.) with a CD-ROM supplement.

This book was excellent. The plot and character development were wonderful. It pretty much had something for eveyone. Joey does a great job of drilling down to the essence of what all these characters need. I only had two complaints and they really aren't complaints. Just personal likes or dislkes. The first being Mac always calling Violet \\"Sugar\\" Does anyone really call a mistress sugar? Secondly, I would have liked to have seen Mac humiliated & degraded more. I liked very much what the twin Doms did to him Tamara & Kiera. However how nice would it have been to have Mac really degraded by having to pleasure other males at the party on his knees. Just a thought. All in all an excellent book though."},{"Title":"Nature of Desire - Natural Law","review":"In more ways than I can ever remember having happened before this book left me breathless. I hadn't ever read such an intense foray into BDSM and I love a hot steamy sex-scene as much as anyone, but I have been known to shy away from the more explicit authors like those from Ellora's Cave, yet I have been tempted to read Mz. Hill and so this one really caught my interest.Natural Law was so unexpectedly fulfilling and emotional it left me breathless several times during the book and blew all my preconceived notions out the window...Mz. Hill, you were definitely worth the read and you can be sure I am as I type searching out more of your work.from\\"a New Fan...\\""},{"Title":"Nature of Desire - Natural Law","review":"I wanted to like this book more. I believe the reasons I didn't love the story are because:1. The murder mystery really detracts from the developing relationship. With a man that dominant, the power struggles would have needed to be titanic, frequent, and long lasting. I was distracted from their communication and bond by the suspense subplot.2. Too much vanilla sex. Not that D/s couples don't have straight sex, but who wants to read about it?3. I'd just finished reading 'Rough Canvas' which is gut-clenching, awesome, inspired work. It is a story by which I will judge other Erotic BDSM fiction, straight or gay. This doesn't come close4. She didn't capture the dominant male cum submissive with this story nearly as well as she does with Beloved Vampire. Perhaps that is because the vampire isn't physically weaker. It makes the power exchange more believable when it's technically possible to make the sub surrender.5. Added onto #4, the main character is too alpha to buy him as a sexual submissive with such a tiny woman. The author didn't really sell it to me.Still, all told, the book was reasonably enjoyable."},{"Title":"Nature of Desire - Natural Law","review":"Joey W.

As Violet helps Mac to search for the killer, the two are drawn irresistably to one another and their sessions take their relationship to a whole other level of play. Mac finds that he wants to give Violet more than just his submission, he also wants to give her his heart."},{"Title":"Nature of Desire - Natural Law","review":"I loved this book, and I've read it again and again. It's a BDSM novel, so if you're aren't ready for that, be forewarned. But besides that (I'm not much into BDSM myself), the love story between the two main characters, Violet and Mac, is so stunning, so captivating, so touching and beautiful, not to mention sexy as can be... it's one of my very favorite novels.Violent is a Dominant, and Mac -- a sexy, hunky alpha stud homicide cop -- is a sexual submissive. Mac, investigating a serial killer, goes undercover at a BDSM club where Violet is a Mistress. They feel an immediate attraction to each other and quickly pair up. Some readers may not like the idea of a submissive male main character, but don't let that fool you. Even though he is sexually submissive, he's still a walking hunk of alpha male testosterone. The sexual pull between Violet and Mac is explosive, and Mac isn't always submissive. ;) I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a strong romance, with very well developed characters, a strong sexual story, and lots of suspense. It does contain several scenes of graphic BDSM sexual activity, so it's not for the faint hearted. But even my sister, who's VERY faint hearted, read this book and was blown away by the story of Violet and Mac. She's read it again several times, too. After reading this book, Violet and Mac will stay in your head -- as well as in your heart. The love between them feels so real -- and the romantic suspense is excellent, too. The good news is that the author, Joey Hill, has a new book coming out later this year (2005) that is a loosely related sequel to Natural Law. This new book, The Ice Queen, features an appearance by Violet and Mac. So for those of us in the Violet and Mac fan club -- and there are lots of us -- we'll get to see a bit of them again in The Ice Queen. I can't wait!!"},{"Title":"Nature of Desire - Natural Law","review":"Almost every review mentions Mac, an alpha male, as a submissive. His character IS incredible. Also mention how the book and the characters remain with you long after reading it. True. Joey W. Hill has an incredible talent in portraying emotion-packed characters and situations. After my third or fourth time reading it, I found myself wincing at what Violet put Mac through. One reviewer said she never hurt him or degraded him, but, read it again. Violet did both, rather viciously. The more I thought about it, and the more I read it, the more I wondered just what the devil Violet got after finally breaking Mac. His character was as incredibly fantastic at the beginning as he was at the end. I couldn't really see any great change in him that would have justified her treatment of him. Oddly enough, I didn't find the sex scenes as hot or as riveting as the characterizations and the movement of the story line, because with a few exceptions where they were making love, the balance was Violet putting him thru some pretty ugly things to break him. There was absolutely no question that Mac loved Violet, but I never felt that Violet really loved Mac. Oh, there was no question that she WANTED him, after all she was a newbie to the \\"Mistress\\" role and he was her first sub. Unfortunately, with each reading of the book I liked Mac more and Violet less and less and less. And yet the story and characters stayed with me and gripped me as few books have ever done. I even wanted to give the book 4 stars because of some of the horrific violence due to the murder story line, but I just couldn't do it. This is real 5 star material. Bravo Joey!"},{"Title":"Nature of Desire - Natural Law","review":"Natural Law: By Joey W. Hill... I am not sure why I waited so long to read this author.

I am not 'into' BDSM, but how could I resist and ALPHA male who is a sub? I had to see if Ms. Hill could pull this off. Not only does she pull it off, she does so in a remarkable and beautiful fashion! I have to say that sometimes I find authors of Ellora's Cave books to be heavy handed with the 70's porno terminology stuffed into a romantic plot and some character development, but Hill makes all of it flow so gorgeously that you never stop, wince and go 'yikes'. Brava, Ms. Hill. I picked this up to read a few chapters before bed and next thing it was 7 am and I was finishing it off bawling my eyes out and feeling like i had a millimeter's worth of talent in comparison. I also packed it and shipped it to my best friend within the hour and will keep shipping it and touting it (I called my editor and agent about it)til I am blue in the face. Mac is sooo freakin sexy! I could eat him up with a spoon. The book is brave, bold and as out there as can be. You get the point across, you feel the difference between a lifestyle and how the lifestyle is perceived. (My only caveat was it almost got a little preachy) This is the kind of work that makes me rush out and buy every single title an author has out there. I will have you on my TBB list for life Ms. Hill. You are my first review on here after buying hundreds of items over the years. If you read this, take satisfaction in that, smile like a fat cat, and go with it girl."},{"Title":"Nature of Desire - Natural Law","review":"Like many romance readers these days, I generally prefer the alpha male who always wants to be in charge, and who cherishes and protects his lady whether she wants him to or not (although she ALWAYS gets what she wants in the end). So, to this day, I don't know why I decided to get this book, because the hero is a sexual submissive. But something persuaded me to try it, and I am SOOO glad I did.Mac and Violet are amazingly well drawn characters, and their relationship is explosive and passionate. It is one of the deepest I've read in a long time. Watching Violet peel away Mac's resistance is sometimes painful, but it's clear that the reward is going to be well worth the effort. Their ultimate devotion to each other is heart-wrenching.The sex in NATURAL LAW is BURNING HOT but never gratuitous. It genuinely moves the story along, helping to uncover both Violet's and Mac's deepest desires. The sex in this story is NOT for the faint of heart, as it involves public sex and dominance and submission. But while Violet is ruthless in cutting through Mac's resistance to what she knows he really wants, she never hurts or degrades him, nor uses pain as a means of pleasure. The relationship is ultimately extremely tender and loving, despite the unconventional way of expressing it. NATURAL LAW also has a convincing murder mystery which ends up playing a huge part in Mac's and Violet's relationship. The mystery moves their relationship along, as the relationship assists the investigation.NATURAL LAW is among the handful of books that I've reread immediately upon finishing it because it just wouldn't let me go. Mac stayed with me for a very long time. In short, I loved, loved, LOVED this book. Joey Hill is a very, very fine writer and I can't wait to read her next publication."},{"Title":"Nature of Desire - Natural Law","review":"There are not enough stars here for this book.

The story of Mac and Violet is so loving and beautiful that it will melt your heart. I have read many other erotic romance books, and not one so far has come even close to the depth of emotion this book touches.

I love the role reversal,(dominate female to submissive male), and there is just not enough good ones out there. The book was very well written, the charaters were complex, (even the secondary characters), and the sex scenes, WOW. I don't recommend this for anyone, but if you like something a little more different and a little more spice, I suggest this book. If you've read and enjoyed Diane Whiteside \\"The Switch\\", you will definitely like this one too. I am happy to hear about the new book coming out 2005, and will watch for it. In the mean time, I am ordering her older books."},{"Title":"Nature of Desire - Natural Law","review":"This book has changed my entire view on erotica - the bar is now at an impossible high. Joey W Hill has a gift: she creates meaningful stories that enchant and enthrall. Throughout, you find grace, courage, faith, redemption. Love. And while these books are erotic (and HOT), you almost find it secondary to the tale of two people walking that path of love.What is especially refreshing is that JWH tells erotic stories without needing to fall back on the repetitive wording and plodding story lines you might find in other books of the same genre. The scenes are rough (if you're a bit reserved, these books can present extremely emotional, violent situations with BDSM as the backdrop), but emotionally wrenching.You won't be disappointed. I'm eagerly waiting for her next release."},{"Title":"Nature of Desire - Natural Law","review":"Joey Hill was a discovery for me in 2006. Very explicit sex, be warned, not for the faint hearted. But also, a well written romance with characters you care about - not a combination that is all that easy to find.

I'm busy buying up all her books, and though some are better than others, she is consistently good."},{"Title":"Nature of Desire - Natural Law","review":"This is the first time giving a review but this had me wanting to. I have never read any of Joey W. Hill books, and boy did I pick a great one to start out with.

I saw a great difference! He was at peace with his submission to Violet. He gave her what she wanted willingly, without hesitation or conflict, because he had given her the gift of his complete trust. He had broken down the walls between them. This book is one of my favorites of Ms Hil. I don't usually like to read about male submissives but Mac Nighthorse is a real turn on. I could almost be a Dom to a submissive like him. I highly recommend this book. The love story works and the caractors hold up to the end.

Also, it is unusual in that the Dom character is female, which kept tweaking me all through the book.I think Mahlet at [...] ([...]) says it best in her review of Natural Law:\\"Natural Law, part of Joey Hill's Nature of Desire series, is probably one of the most realistic, well-written depictions of the more extreme side of BDSM that I have encountered. It's also the first \\"alpha male as sexual sub\\" or just \\"male-as-sub\\" erotic romance that I've read. I definitely prefer to read about males that stay alpha, in and out of the bedroom, but Joey Hill's writing captivated me anyway. \\""},{"Title":"Nature of Desire - Natural Law","review":"A one-star review of \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" introduced me to Joey Hill, and a flurry of generally positive reviews for Ms Hill's forays into BDSM convinced me to give her a try. My three-star rating is for her competence with language and story, despite such vulgarisms as \\"the long length of him,\\" \\"gnoche,\\" (a phonetic rendering of ganache, which she clearly didn't stop to look up in a dictionary); and \\"dominatrixes.\\" Though many romance novelists were capable of faultless grammar and impressively rich prose during the 60s, 70s, and 80s, Hill is a better prose stylist, overall, than most of the people writing in this genre today, a fact which undeniably places her above a lot of romantic shlock glutting the market; but, alas, this is just romantic shlock, after all.This observation may be less idiosyncratic than it may seem on the surface, but, for me, the cardinal difference between romance fiction and Romantic literature is that the latter is generally tragic, or involves a healthy dose of loss, depletion, inanition, and poetic mourning. \\"Natural Law\\" is, all said and done, a ridiculously happy book; and that, to me, is what fails to elevate it far enough above the pedestrian, despite its generally well-written BDSM elements.At the end of the whole thing, these two are madly in love with each other, and all irony, paradox, and cynicism have fled--leaving me bored and impatient for something edgy. I went in expecting BDSM Noir and I got spicy Harlequin. The murder mystery which frames the novel--and runs a secret thread behind its dirty colors to hang it on the generic wall--is, to put it mildly, as lame as the lamest Nancy Drew mystery. And without Nancy's lovely pumps, pearls, and swing skirts to excuse the kind of plotting that would make Dame Agatha Christie blush. So that leaves you with a pair of lovebirds who like to play with whips and strap-ons, but who are, at the end of the day, as far from truly liberal--in their configuration of chivalry and monogamy--as the blandest Hallmark wedding card."},{"Title":"Nature of Desire - Natural Law","review":"I love this series, but hated this book!

She's very attracted to him, but Violet wants more than his body he so freely offers her. Violet wants to understand his mind and she wants to crawl into his soul. Mac tries to fight her off but eventually he's got to submit. Their relationship is a bond of trust, and that trust should never be betrayed. Mac thought it was about strength and power. It isn't though because it's about surrender for both of them.\\"It was something I didn't know, didn't understand. Not until I met you. I was looking for you. My Mistress.

Mac is incredibly sexy and mesmerizing, very caring, protective, tender AND he can cook! Yum! He is such a nurturing, straight male submissive cop with powerful alpha tendencies. Mac wants a woman to dominate him in the bedroom, but he feels it's a man's responsibility to protect a woman, keep her safe from harm. It's a paradox only a Mistress could understand. Violet is all to Mac - Mistress, lover, woman. It's humbling, terrifying, and exhilarating all at once. She looked at him and at a certain point she knew it was a confirmation of something clearly present and it could only be love.The love story between Mac and Violet is hot yet very emotional, sensual, and tender. I really enjoyed to read about their life beyond the club scene. I think it's important because I'm sure that people who are into BDSM have a \\"normal\\" life, too.What didn't work for meI had a bit a hard time to accept Violet as a Dom. Furthermore, I felt that Mac was a tad too alpha to be recognized as a true sub. That's how I see it but I could be wrong though. The play at Tyler's home was too much for me. I didn't feel comfortable and I could have done without it. I think it would have been nice to get a bit more background information regarding the main protagonists, too.And then there was Mac's problem to open up to Violet.\\"All the fears he had, of never having a complete relationship with a woman because he could not offer all he was to her, the light and the dark, dissolved in her arms.\\"Well, I get it that as a homicide detective he had to work gruesome crime scenes and he had to deal with a lot of baggage. But this angle should have been explored more. The story about his skateboard when he was seven years old didn't do it for me, either. I was always waiting for the big revelation but there was nothing really uncommon to discover.***************The suspense part of Natural Law is rather minor, but still. And the final highlight is nicely done and definitely thrilling. Natural Law is wrapped up by a beautiful and emotional epilogue.\\"It's over, Violet,\\" he said, and his voice was rough. \\"Don't let it take any part of what we were from us.\\" He caught her hand from his stomach and bit her fingers, not gently. \\"I'm yours. I never stopped being yours.\\"Overall, it's a well written and very engaging story. If you'd like to read about a male sub then I'd recommend you to give Natural Law a try!"},{"Title":"Nature of Desire - Natural Law","review":"A must buy for all erotic romance fans.

You too will become a JWH fan!"},{"Title":"Nature of Desire - Natural Law","review":"If you've ever had any questions or just wanted to know the emotional and spirtual side behind BDSM then this is a must read novel. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Nature of Desire - Natural Law","review":"Someone is luring and killing men in the safety of their homes, in the intimacy of their bedrooms. Someone is winning trust and then betraying it in the worst way possible and to Mac Nighthorse, that is obscene. He knows the lifestyle and understands the Total Power Exchange between Mistress and Slave and for someone to betray that beautiful and freely given gift while in his city drives him into action. He risks his Sergeant's moral reaction when he tells her his plan to catch the woman known as the S&M; Killer, but he's willing to let himself out of the closet, so to speak. He's going to go undercover within the alluring club known as the Zone as a sexual submissive. His sergeant laughs, sure that someone of Mac's build and standing would never pass for a sub, but that's what he is. A sexually submissive male who craves the power of a Mistress's touch.Mistress Violet is prowling the Zone when she sees Mac. His powerful build and self assured masculinity screams out to her. As do the submissive wrist cuffs he wears. She wants him. She's attracted to him, but she wants more than the body he so freely offers her. She wants what no woman, no mistress has ever been able to touch. She wants his soul. She wants to tear open his body and crawl right in and once she has him by the balls, figuratively and literally, she's never letting go.Seriously, there are not enough words to express how much I love this book. I should say that the idea of femdom scares the bejesus out of me. I can't explain it but the idea of a woman breaking down a man just gives me the creeps. If I had a man strapped down to a rack, I wouldn't know what to do. But not Violet. She doesn't break Mac by just relentlessly lashing him, oh no. That would be too easy. She relentlessly breaks down all his emotional armor, past all the bullsh*it as she says and gets right to the man within, and it was seriously erotic as hell. Even though some of her methods had me squirming in discomfort, I was still absolutely one hundred percent fascinated. The relationship between Mac and Violet was so believable and so amazing that I closed this book with a sense of awe.Don't be like me, scared off by the idea of femdom. It's true that Violet holds the reins but Mac is no lightweight. He's no lap dog or doormat, and as he so charmingly tells her, he's nobody's pony. He's the pit bull who runs his own yard and he's delicious. He views his forays into BDSM almost as a workout. An exercise regiment. He normally looks at each Mistress with narrowed eyes and basically tells her, \\"do your worst, I can take it.\\" He's like a soldier caught behind enemy lines, facing torture, who is screaming that no one will break him. Until Violet.Once Mac and Violet get past the power exchange their relationship really heats up. It was an incredible courtship and I adored it. Mac is just unbelievable. I am so in love with him. I don't care if he's a fictional character, I am in love. The level of their intimacy just blew me away and ye gods, I want that. You must read this book. Now."},{"Title":"Nature of Desire - Natural Law","review":"Natural Law is an amazing book. It was one of the best books I've read in a very long time (and I read a lot). Strong independant woman, strong alfa male whose afraid of turning complete control over to his Mistress, but can't help but to let go to his 'TRUE' mistress. I highly recommend this book, as well as anything else Joey W. Hill has written. She is very talented and understanding of human nature.Can't wait for ICE QUEEN Joey!!"},{"Title":"Nature of Desire - Natural Law","review":"This is the story of two characters who also appear in The Ice Queen, a story that I enjoyed a lot more than this one. Violet is a sexual dominant, and Mac, a cop, is a sexual submissive, even though he is controlling male, alpha-type outside of the bedroom. It turns him on to have the woman be in control, though in practice, he is caring and controlling in other ways.Mac comes to the club where Violet 'plays' because he is undercover, looking for a female dominatrix who he believes is responsible for a string of deaths of male submissives.I really like this author, and have been reading all her material. Unlike many erotic books, she writes with a plot and includes great characterization. This is not just a story about sex, with a little plot thrown in. This book, unlike some of her others, is not about troubled characters, however. Both Violet and Mac are comfortable with who they are. The suspense comes from the murder mystery, and there is just not quite enough of that crime element for this to get 5 stars from me. It is a very good story, nonetheless, and definitely one for fans of Joey Hill to include in their reading list. It is interesting to compare Mac with Jacob from The Vampire Queen's Servant, another character who is a dichotomy interms of a strong male who is a submissive."},{"Title":"Nature of Desire - Natural Law","review":"I have read several romantic erotica books and there are those I like and those I don't, but I have never been emotionally touched by an erotica story until this one! I read the book cover to cover as soon as I received it. I can't stop thinking about these characters. I think it is too far and few between that we read stories that express a strong alpha man's emotional loss of control to the right woman, because there is nothing sexier than that loss. Ms. Hill expressed that loss so vividly in through Mac's actions and in his dialogue that I literally had chills! This is my first written review because I just couldn't help myself from telling others how great this book is.And the other reviewer is right - 5 stars is not enough for Natural Law!"},{"Title":"Nature of Desire - Natural Law","review":"Somebody recommended this to me--I wish I could remember who, so I could thank them.Mac Nighthorse is a cop, investigating a series of murders connected by a BDSM club. He's also a sexual submissive. When he goes undercover at the club, he meets Violet, who's new to the scene, but a natural dominatrix.Fem-dom is not my kink. However, Natural Law sucked me in, and I had a terrible time trying to put it down, even for a moment. The characters were just so vivid and the emotions so realistic that it didn't even matter that their kink wasn't mine.The sex scenes are very graphic, but they're also utterly integral to the plot. Each scene marks a change in the relationship between Violet and Mac and shows emotion as well as mechanics.I think the main reason why Natural Law resonated so strongly with me was that at its core, it wasn't about fem-dom or BDSM, or even sex. It was about emotional surrender, about a relationship of complete trust. On both sides. At that level, it was easy to relate to the story regardless of the inclinations of the characters.One thing that I found refreshing and a bit surprising was that both Violet and Mac are portrayed as strong, competent individuals. Mac's struggles with sexual submission--he fought it even as he wanted it--echoed the more usual romantic conflict of emotional submission, and didn't make him seem wimpy or damaged.The murder investigation did take a back seat to the erotica/romance plot, but it didn't get forgotten, and its resolution was satisfying, surprising, and logical.I'll definitely be looking for more of Joey W. Hill's books."},{"Title":"Nature of Desire - Natural Law","review":"Warning: This review might contain what some people consider SPOILERS.Rating: 8/10PROS:- I like that Violet is such an inexperienced Dom and we get to see her uncertainty and her struggles with deciding how to handle an inordinately feisty sub.- At first it kind of bugged me that Mac calls Violet \\"sugar\\" all the time, but it's used as a bit of a plot device later in the book, so I didn't mind it at all by the end.- The sex is hot, and Hill depicts orgasms particularly well: they're almost impossible to describe, really, because there's nothing concrete about them, but Hill manages to use abstract language without sounding silly or overly flowery.- Good plot, if a little too dramatic to be strictly believable. I got sufficiently into it to want to read the last third of the book in one sitting. I didn't find the final battle-with-the-baddie scene anti-climactic, and I enjoyed seeing some of the fallout from that encounter 9 months later in the epilogue.CONS:- The characters fall in love REALLY quickly, but I actually believed that part of the story (surprisingly). What I didn't believe was how perfectly Mac slips into the role of flawless submissive immediately after Violet finally breaks down his walls. He has virtually no learning curve when it comes to his words and actions toward her, especially around others in the scene.- Like I said above, I liked the epilogue because it details some of the emotional trauma Violet and Mac go through after the final events of the story. But I found the final sex scene disappointing: it just...wasn't. Wasn't as charged as some of the earlier ones, wasn't what I wanted/expected, wasn't exactly what I thought the characters needed from each other, etc.Overall comments: I certainly enjoyed this enough to recommend it; I'm impressed enough with Hill's writing to read the later volumes in this series. The BDSM element is pervasive and fairly heavy/graphic, so if you're not a fan of that, you probably won't make it through this book."},{"Title":"Nature of Desire - Natural Law","review":"This was the first book I've read with the female in Dom role. I didn't think I'd like it, but I did. The book was smoking hot. I will say that the plot toward the end bored me, but the rest of the book more than made up for it.... I could have just been in a mood the day I read the last quarter of the book, who knows. This one is another keeper, and I am definitely buying more of her books. She just writes beautifully. FYI the entire book is BDSM and I would not describe it as \\"lite\\", so if you like it vanilla and can't warm to it, then it's not for you."},{"Title":"Nature of Desire - Natural Law","review":"I ordinarily find BDSM erotica degrading and it makes me uncomfortable. Not this book. I did enjoy it. The charcaters were developed beautifully. I could see the romance/affection//love between them. Not like Most BDSM erotica I have read where Dom meets sub; they engage in sex and other things and you get no character insight."},{"Title":"Nature of Desire - Natural Law","review":"Joey Hilll has an incredible gift for reachng into the sould of her heroes and heroines and putting them down on pages. She does more than tell a sotry - she captures the heart of the reader. Violt Siemanzki and Mackenzie Nighthorse are two cops struggling to come to terms with their individual needs. A chance encounter at The Zone (Mac is on undecover assignment), an elite BDSM private club in Tampa, brings them together and sets them on a path to accept not only the nature of their relationship but their deep emotional feelings for each other. This is a book you won't be able to put down."},{"Title":"Nature of Desire - Natural Law","review":"This review is not an \\"if you don't have anything nice to say, say nothing\\" type......I started and re-started to read this book about 20 times in the past month since I bought it. I just could not get past the abrupt introduction of \\"Violet- the world's MISTRESS\\".....who was she, why was she a mistress (she didn't even know what compelled her). Ms Hill writes great men, her book \\"Branded Sanctuary\\" has Brendan...possibly my favorite hero of all books, this book had Mac. Mostly, I read romance books because I identify with the heroine, if she has some substance to her, even if I don't agree with her point of view (tstl moments), I can still feel for her. In this case, Violet did nothing for me and I felt sorry for Mac, he carried on about his \\"powerful pixie\\" or some such drivel all through the book. Got tired of it pretty quick. I see all the good reviews this book received and can't help but feel that I missed something, but remember, I tried some 20 times to start the book and finish it, Violet \\" the-Mistress-who-wasn't\\" did not let me. I have two other issues with Joey Hill's writing.....she tries to make D/s like a religion, like a calling, which is pure bull. Just because some people like it and like it very very much should not make it a cause, its just a personal preference. No need to pontificate!!!! The last issue I had with this utterly stupid book was the moment where Violet faced the murderess (is that even a word?) and the \\"murderess\\" has two men all strung up and beaten and is dithering about whether she should label herself a sub or a domme. In this moment Violet comes in and starts dithering a bit herself and is told to undress or some such nonsense (because that makes so much sense at this time), she starts making some stupid statement.....since both men are natural subs and since the murderer was a sub but became a domme and so she was the only true domme in the room, so give me your gun. Sounds like some bdsm version of an immature conversation kids would have in a playground......If the world of D/s, depends on idiots like her to call out to emotions in others, I despair of the so-called message we are supposed to get from this, what high-falutin message is here? It was just annoying. Please Violet, take your little pixie self and lump it. Give me Chloe and Brendan anyday, now there's a book I would re-read 20 times!!!"},{"Title":"Nature of Desire - Natural Law","review":"That was ducking amazing...this was my first fem Dom book but definitely won't be my last. It was beautifully written. The sex & bondage scenes caused smoke to come out of my kindle. I was reading this one while waiting for the kids to come out of school & one of the other mums thought I had a temperature 'cause my face was so flushed! I didn't really enjoy the first book in this series (Holding the Cards (Nature of Desire, Book One)) but I'm glad I revisited the series & read this book. I would happily recommend this book. Just awesome.Originally posted on Goodreads.com"},{"Title":"Nature of Desire - Natural Law","review":"Natural Law is a sexually explicit BDSM erotic romance thriller. Mac Nighthorse is cop, he goes undercover to a BDSM club looking for a female dominatrix who he believes is responsible for a string of deaths of male submissives. Here he meets Violet, who captivates in more ways than one. A highly enjoyable sexy thriller, with BDSM scenes. Highly recommended.Also, my my all time favorite Joey Hill books are Ice Queen, and the sequel Mirror of My Soul. Outstanding books!"},{"Title":"Nature of Desire - Natural Law","review":"Homicide detective Mackenzie goes undercover as a submissive in a BDSM club to find a Domme serial killer. This is not a stretch as he is a closet submissive in his real life. He meets new Domme Violet and it's love at first tether.Pros: A hulking male submissive with alpha tendencies being tamed by a petite female Domme is a unique approach. Though there are very good physical descriptions, this book focuses on the control and trust aspects of the lifestyle, and the growing love between the couple. I found it fascinating and really well-handled, easily one of the best books I've ever read about the BDSM scene.Cons: This is a really good book. My cons are nit-picky writer stuff. The POVs are clearly delineated through most of the book, but in the last 40 pages Hill flip flops POV within a section a few times, which slowed me down as I had to reread them. She didn't lose any pacing in the story, however, just had some odd POV shifts. Again nitpicky, but she referred to Jonathan Powell by both names, often in the same paragraph. She should have picked one name.Readers, such as myself, who aren't familiar with the standard BDSM equipment, may have trouble visualizing a \\"spanking bench\\" or a \\"cat-o-nines\\" or any of the myriad props and furniture mentioned in this book. Even if you'd rather die than google \\"anal plug\\" or \\"strap-on,\\" don't let the sex toys deter you, the focus really is on the romance, power struggle and emotional connection. It is a very fine love story and an entertaining read. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Nature of Desire - Natural Law","review":"I have never read BDSM themed books before this one and I couldn't have asked for a better book to start with.Not only where their great, intense and satisfying sex scenes but I felt that each sex scene had a purpose and not just meaningless sex that other erotic books relied on purely for the readers' entertainment.I enjoyed the storyline as well, the struggle within the main character and some page turning suspense towards the end which was very entertaining.For me it didn't feel too over the top and I loved the dynamics between the characters.The main theme of the book (and why I couldn't resist reading it, as well as enjoyed it so much when I have) is how to \\"break a stallion/alpha male\\" so that he fully embraces what he is and from that truly find himself. If anything JH romanticized this genre in this book with great expertise.I don't think that this is the reality of BDSM or maybe it is for some, but it was so greatly written that anyone who is not familiar with it would come out with some level of appreciation for this lifestyle none-the-less.I don't think I have any plans for moving deeper into this genre but if you want a taste of the world of BDSM this book is a great option and satisfying read."},{"Title":"Nature of Desire - Natural Law","review":"BDSM that doesn't gross one out or scare the innocent. Emotions are so very vivid and potent, like all of Ms. Hill's novels. Control is explored in depth, what makes it so important and the trust that is tied into it all. A great read that all who read it will love. This book introduced me to the world of BDSM, thankfully! I am ever so grateful!"},{"Title":"Nature of Desire - Natural Law","review":"I have read several of Joey Hill's books and by far this is my favorite. This book offers plenty of sex and Sub/Dom behavior and even includes a murder investigation. Mac and Violet are such good characters you really hate to see the book end. The book will keep you glued to your seat till you finish. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"Nature of Desire - Natural Law","review":"This was a spectacular book. It was the first book I'd read by this author, but now I'm just sad that it took me so long to discover it. It was great plot with well developed character. I love how the author is able to create a dominant woman and a submissive male without making the woman so aggressive that she's unlikeable or making the male so whimpy that you start to dislike him for it. She writes characters that could have been mainstream romance characters if not for their unique role reversal. If you want to a good story that'll heat you up, I highly recommend this one."},{"Title":"Nature of Desire - Natural Law","review":"I loved this book! I fell in love right along with Mac and Violet.

As a new erotica reader, this was a compelling introduction to the genre. Mac and Violet's story was hard to read at times, especially for those not familiar with BDSM, yet so moving, I couldn't put it down. It gave insight into the D/s lifestyle, and a whole new way of looking at those involved in it. I see many more erotica purchases in my future, especially by Ms. Hill."},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"I have been a big fan of Franken, and this is one of his best books,if not the best.Nobody,but nobody exemplifys Liberalism as well as Franken,and he should be the Democrat's choice to run in 2008.To choose anyone like they did in 2004 or others that are jockeying for nomination now, would be nothing short of an injustice. This book shows there is no topic that he doesn't have an astute knowledge of or an ability far exceeding the \\"luminars\\" who have hijacked the great Democratic Party of the past.Remember Kennedy and Truman ,then why not Franken?In the last Election ,the Democrats skated all over the map trying to tell what they would do to confront the War on Terror.Franken gives the solution on page 119.Just deal with Terrorists the same way as with disgruntled employees;study and smoke out your enemy,and find \\"places to hide once the shooting starts\\".Another great asset he has over other candidates is being Bilingual;English and Profanity.He won't have to search for the politically correct name or description to tag someome who is giving him a hard time.He can respond with both barrels and they'll wish they'd taken their venom out on someone else.By the way,as you read this book,make a note of these names;they'll come in handy to you too.He has another great talent seldom found in Democrats;he can tell a Republican something and it will be listened to and acted upon.Look at his wonderful book,\\"Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot\\".Obviously,Rush read it,took action and look at the fine specimen of humanity he has become.See,he can even reach out to opponents,a crucial benefit to a President.If he has a little spare time ,he could do wonders for Ted Kennedy and even Michael Moore.He has also shown on page 109 ,that he understands the progression of life . If given the opportunity,he'll to breathe new life into the Party.His cycle of life \\"is not a steady progression,but falls into distinct phases:youth,middle age,old age,decrepitude,senility,round-the-clock geriatic care,and prolonged agony before death\\". After the last two elections it takes someone like Franken to keep the Party from sliding into the final stages of progression.Now,I believe Al has shown us his high intelect and superior grasp of wisdom.But even at that, he has one thing that is holding him back;and it is strikingly evident on the book's cover.Al,needs to do something about his hat.Remember President Kennedy and his top hat on Inaugration Day,President Truman and his hats,President LBJ and his Stetsons,Prime Minister Churchill and his Bowlers,and the grandest of all, Napoleon and George Washington.If any more is needed to convince him, think about Al Capone and the master of hats, Frank Sinatra (\\"The Way You Wear Your Hat\\".Then, there's President Clinton and his Baseball Hat..see what I mean?It just doesn't make it.Can you imagine President Franken holding a a press conference with the White House Press Corps.When being hammered by the press over torture of prisoners,he'll tell them what toture really is.I leave it to you to find it in the book.Anyway,Al has put it all in this great book;he's done his part;now it's up to the Party.A terrific book,a great entertaining read;especially for all those people and countries outside America;especially Europe,who think they know better how to run America than the Americans themselves.If they think they have all the answers,they have plenty to work on at home.Canada included!God Bless America"},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"Some of his insights are very good, but I still cannot believe this guy has his own liberal radio show, that is supposed to be serious opposition to Rush or Sean Hannity. He is in some ways a disgrace to liberals, because he makes fun of everything. Any serious attempt to have a liberal side to talk radio should include a more serious approach. Franken is a clown, and he is very funny..but he doesn't belong in politics.Jeffrey McAndrewauthor of &quot;Our Brown-Eyed Boy&quot;"},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"This is not Al's best work. It's more rambling than usual and not so pithy. I got it for cheap and got enough laughs to justify my purchase."},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"If you're expecting one of Franken's biting political satires, you'll be disappointed. If you're expecting Stuart Smalley, you'll be disappointed. If you have no expectations whatsoever, and your sense of humor is even remotely in tune with Franken's, you'll have a blast (plan on a) chuckling a lot, b) laughing hysterically only slightly less, and c) even (who knew?) being moved from time to time). Though it is mostly wiseacre (no slight intended), OTIK is, in places, also quite wise. It is a very quick read, more entertainingly digested in one fell swoop, IMHO, than piecemeal. OTIK is proof positive, as though further proof were necessary, that Al Franken is one very funny (and thoughtful) guy. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"I had a setback at work and felt depressed. Despite my poor mood I decided to read this book. It had me laughing out loud and tremendously cheered. Some of the advice is even worthwhile. I read several passages to my husband and he had a good laugh as well."},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"Al Franken's latest offering takes the form of an advice book supposedly targetted at college graduates. But unlike his previous books, Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot and Why Not Me?, which were filled with the humor of a true political junkie, there is relatively little political humor in this book. Instead, it is replete with joke after hilarious joke about the roller coaster ride of life.The book is relatively short (I read it from cover to cover in a couple of hours), but just about every page elicited a hearty belly laugh. Franken is a master of understatement and satire. More than any humor book I've read before, most paragraphs have been written as their own carefully crafted, self-contained jokes. But Franken ties them all together so as to weave a coherent whole.Be warned: like Franken's other books, some of the humor is a bit off-color and risque. But unless you're a complete prude, you'll love it. Also, although the book lampoons some current figures of popular culture, most all of the humor should stand the test of time relatively well. My only complaint with the book is that it's relatively expensive for its length. However, the laugh-to-dollar ratio is quite high..."},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"This is quite possibly the worst guide to success ever written; however, it is by far one of the funniest! Full of all kinds of twisted information, the trick is realizing that there is truth in there; it's just not spoonfed to you. The ideas are fairly sound - it's just that the examples are so off the wall, you'd have to be crazy to believe them.If you read this for the humor and not the advice (as I'm almost positive it was intended), then you're in for a treat. If not, well, you've been warned."},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"Oh, he's done better. I agree with earlier comments that this book is not up to Al Franken's usual standards. He spends what seems like half of the book reminding the reader his primary reason for writing the book was to generate some revenue (yes I know he's trying to be funny, it just doesn't work), and the rest of the book boring the reader with less than stellar attempts at humor. I have always enjoyed Al Franken's humor, but this book leaves me shaking my head."},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"This book made me laugh at least five and a half times every page and a quarter, which is a remarkable achievement.

Truly a funny book!"},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"If Dr. Suess could order from Amazon.com from where he is now, he would be rolling -- with laughter -- in his grave. Al Franken spoofs the title of The Doctor's hit book and sticks it to the many self-help and inspirational books along the way.Franken is the early 21st century's perfect satirist, mixing late 20th century irony with HUGE vaudevillian, television and comedy club-style belly laughs. I liked this book better than his most popular book, Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot. Franken's genius is that he never overexposes himself so each book is a deliciously fresh comedy morsel -- and he keeps getting better, more perceptive and FUNNIER.The laughs start early, when he talks about his pipe-smoking, good-humored father and how \\"this quantity time spent with my father, laughing and coughing phlegm...inspired me in choosing my life's work: making people laugh and raising money for the American Lung Association.\\"Chapter titles are hilarious. Among the many: \\"OH! The People You Must Trample to Get Ahead!\\" \\"Oh! The Weight You Will Gain,\\" etc. He throws in heaping helping of advice on such wide-ranging matters as sex, home ownership, religion, idiot bosses,marriage, politicians, international long distance phone calls (complete with area code list)-- and Northern Canada.He constantly lampoons tiresome exercises many self-help books have at the end of chapters. At the end of his chapter on advice he tells readers to make a list each night of all advicegiven and gotten and at the end of a year \\"take a day to go through your 365 advice lists.\\"He offers observations, such as how people don't change: \\"The person you marry will be the same person you will want to murder five, ten or twenty years hence..\\"And it's worth the price of the book to read his MANY (many more than can be quoted here!)running-gag references to people such as Oprah, fired Enron CEO Kenneth Lay (\\"If an investment sounds too good to be true, Kenneth Lay is probably involved.\\") and Maria Shriver (\\"If I wanted something to read that didn't make any sense, I'd just read Maria Shriver's book.\\").And what about conservative talk-show host Rush Limbaugh, who provided him with considerable material (and a title) for a best-selling book? In an extensive section Franken offers this (limited) olive branch: \\"When I wrote a book calling him a big fat idiot, he lost weight and became slightly more accurate.\\""},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"My mother, God love her, purchased this book for me (not having read it herself). I can only imagine that she came upon Al Franken (or ALF, as I will forever refer to him from this day forward) pitching his latest offering on an episode of Oprah while flipping through channels, and decided I might enjoy it. Out of respect for mom, I read the book. ALF may bode well on a talk show, but in this case please save a tree. I could not, in good conscience, pass this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"This is supposed to be a sharp and witty satire of inspirational books. Franken followed the self-help format well, but I never really laughed at his self-deprecating witticisms. His other books are much better. Throughout this, I couldn't help but think that Dave Barry could have done this topic much better.Franken fans may well enjoy this, but I don't think it has wide appeal.One funny passage was on [p. 73]: \\"My son...plays...Grand Theft Auto III, in which the object is to pick up a prostitute in a stolen car and murder her. It's not my kind of thing. But when I was young, I listened to the Beatles, which my parents viewed with equal horror. Today, the Beatles are cultural icons, revered around the world. By the time my son is my age, the same will probably be said of the wizards behind Grand Theft Auto III.\\""},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"Al has done it again with a laugh-out-loud book on loads of everyday topics.

This book I read on paper, but it's just as funny -- and, which I didn't expect, has some semi-poignant, actually useful advice in it."},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"I like Al Franken, the comedian, and, based on some of his other books, I generally like Al Franken, the writer. This book has just enough of each for me to give it, what certain TV movie critics call a &quot;reluctant, or borderline, thumbs up.&quot; Franken has certainly done better in other books.Sometimes I just can't figure out if he really means for us to take the advice he gives seriously, or if it is the bad advice he has promised to occasionally slip in, or if it is, purely and simply, an attempt at comedy. Hence my ambivalence.For the moment, I am going to concentrate on some of the more meaningful of his comments: In a chapter titled &quot;Oh The Loneliness, The Loneliness,&quot; he comments that we are born alone and that we die alone, even though we may be surrounded, in both cases, by family and friends. Unfortunately, this truly describes the human condition, and the happy man or woman is one who has learned to accommodate this existential (my description, not his) loneliness.Another bit of good advice is that we should prepare for our declining years by anticipating the possibility for the future need of a nursing home or &quot;assisted living facility,&quot; and check them out and pick one that we might like if we ever need one. This should be done while we are still young enough to make a valid assessment.These are just two exmples of the better advice he gives.Of lesser value are things like his discussion of the &quot;inevitable&quot; really horrible experiences during the middle years of a marriage. He apologizes to his wife in the afterword, but I think that, even if these chapters were meant to be humorous, they missed the boat.I also found his advice that one must pick a religion in order to get through the tougher parts of life to be less than valid. He never seems to have considered such secular answers to life's so-called mysteries as Humanism. One can get through life's downs without resorting to answers from the god of his or her choice. Thus, it is my opinion that there are other ways to get survive these tough times than by resorting to an organized religion. He also has listed modern religions in order of usefulness. These rankings might be subject to questioning.In summary then, the better and poorer suggestions tend to counterbalance one another, and the discerning reader will probably find some ideas that are of use to him or her."},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"Al Franken is a long-time star of big and small screen, who has chosen to focus on writing books instead of Saturday Night Live skits in the last few years. This is one of his weaker efforts. Clearly the \\"Al Franken Decade\\" has long since passed into history.Franken had the clever idea to write a parody of advice books, but unfortunately, the cleverness wears off after about 20 pages, in other words, there is enough here for a Bill Murray skit but not a full-length film. Franken is funny, and puts some clever comedic moments into this, but I got the idea that he was writing it as fast as I was reading it.What works well here is his chapter summaries. Early on in the book, he provides Maria Shriver/Oprah Winfrey type summaries with action items, journals, and topics for monthly discussion with one's mentor. As the book progresses, the summaries degenerate into excuses for why the chapter was not very good, new information that Franken forgot to put in the chapter, and material totally unrelated to the chapter. Franken is a natural comic genius, and adds some other nice touches, such as references to non-existent chapters (he later explains that the editor deleted his books 4-7 from the manuscript, leaving us with only books 1-3), his cut-outs of handy information such as the country codes for dialing every nation, and his reasons for ranking religions into a Top Ten list.But in the end, this is a jumble of un-related rants and random thoughts. There is no story to this and it does not hold one's interest, even for a fan like me. One is almost concerned for the well-being of the Franken family, if this is what the mighty have fallen to."},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"This is a deeply funny book. Perhaps it's not up to par with Franken's other work, but it is certainly one of the funniest things I've read all year... especially if you've read any of the self-help and career books that he parodies. I intend to pair it up with a genuine self-help book for certain troubled youths that I know, to make the pill go down smoother.It is filled with advice excellent for elbowing your way to the top, whether in the corporate boardroom, the kindergarten, or the discount liquor store. True, he probably wrote most of it in the bathroom. True, this is not a finely crafted work redolent of the artist's dedication. True, he subtly mocks us for spending money on a book he pulled out of his bottom. But who cares? I enjoyed it and have read it at least twice with amusement."},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"While reading this book I got the strange feeling that he was doing this for money. I might have been the shortness of the book. Or maybe the roughness of it. But I think I got this feling from the fact that he tells me, the reader, on numerous occasions that he needs the cash. And furthermore, I had read Rush Limbaugh just before this and noticed many remarkingly similar, infact identical, jokes. If you want a classic Franken book, don't get this one."},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"This book is really funny. I've read a lot of humorists' books, and the jokes mostly sit there and die. But this made me laugh out loud, a lot of times. To put it in Gene Siskel terms, this thin book is fat with laughs.Parents, this is about a good a graduation gift as you can find. And everyone else should buy it too--they won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"Al Franken creates an enjoyable read once again. Not politically focussed, Franken shows that he is more than just a political comedian. His latest book gives his take on life's lessons and truisms. The book reads in no time, and is sure to bring a smile to your face throughout. Absolutely would make an excellent gift.My only wish was that there was more material from this brilliant, funny mind. Here's hoping Al gets a forum which allows more regular exposure for us."},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"I think fans of Franken's political satire books will find this book a sad change of pace. While certainly not the worst book of the year and even funny in some places, Franken's trademark bite is curiously lacking.Perhaps one of the strangest things Franken tries to do several times throughout the book is to change pace abruptly from comedy to serious advice. It does not work well, and is almost a pardoy of itself in that sense. Although the sections on marriage are often well-written and humorous, Franken partisans should know they aren't getting Al at his best here. True fans won't mind, but the casual reader will want to wait for another book in the political medium Franken seems to save the best of his talent for."},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"I thought Why Not Me was pretty tired, but this book is great. It's truly hilarious! By the way, he is not pandering to Oprah, he is making fun of her! It's satire..get it! SATIRE!!! p.s. Al, you can get the number for my bank account from Amazon if you like."},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"When I read the introduction of this book at the bookshop I was quite impressed and I thought I would get more from the rest of the chapters. However when I bought the book and proceeded to the later chapters I was dissappointed.The advice that he gives are sometimes specific to himself and would not suit to other people. As he admits in the book, he wrote this book to get money. No wonder it turn out like this.I suggest you buy another book, rather than wasting your money on this book."},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"Some good advice: Always get the audio version of Al Franken's works - spoken/performed by Al himself. It's so much better. Franken is intelligent and hilarious. You might even learn something. Also: check out his show on air america radio (on the internet & radio).P.S. I listened to this on a long road-trip. Not only did I laugh my *** off, I didn't want the drive to end for fear I might not finish the book."},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"I was disappointed in this book. Although I very much enjoyed Al Franken's \\"Rush Limbaugh Is A Big Fat Idiot\\", I found this book lacking in both humor and depth. It is clearly a half-hearted effort."},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"Read Al Franken's OH, THE THINGS I KNOW! . . . it containstongue-in-cheek advice for just about anybody, ranging fromthose about to start work (&quot;Oh, Are You Going to Hate YourFirst Job!&quot;) to the golden years of senior citizenship (&quot;Oh,the Nursing Home You'll Wind Up In!&quot;).Franken tries to be helpful, but sometimes he can't helptelling it like it REALLY is . . . for instance, he notes, &quot;Someone once said it is just as easy to fall in love with a rich person as with a poor one. Actually that's not true. It's easier to fall in love with a rich person. But to get them to love you back, that's harder.&quot;My only regret is that he just wrote the book . . . had hewritten it earlier, I could have avoided the oh-so-many mistakes that I've made in my life.Some of Franken's wit and wisdom falls flat, but overall, I laughed at several passages . . . among them:[on investing] Follow your gut! If you find yourself using a product, invest in it. You see, I wasn't using Enron, but I was using Bounty towels. Had I made an equivalent investment in Bounty's manufacturer, Procter &amp; Gamble, I would have reaped adisappointing, but respectable, 3 percent return rather thansuffering a 99.8 percent loss.[on dieting] Do you really need that pork chop? No. Especiallysince you didn't even order it, and it's on the plate of the person next to you. Resist the urge to take food off the plates of other people in restaurants. Or, if you must, at least ask, &quot;Are you going to finish that?&quot;[on getting along with his wife] Another secret to our longand successful accommodation is a little trick we have forsmoothing over the many rough patches. It's very simple butvery effective. We don't go to bed angry. We stay up and fight!"},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"This is a satire of advice books, and each chapter has a funny title. It has his usual dark humor. It has been a while since I read this book, but I remember that it seemed to cheer me up. Specifically the chapter titled Oh, Are You Going to Hate Your First Job!"},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"More like a series of Saturday Night Live-style monologues rather than advice. Favorites include, &quot;Oh, The Bad Investments You Will Make&quot;, &quot;Oh, If You Engage in Bondage/Sado-masochism Make Sure You Use a Safeword&quot;, &quot;Oh, How You Will Hate Your First Job&quot;. Strongly recommend the audio version (tape or download), which is read by him, Al Franken."},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"To truly appreciate this book you need to hear Al Franken read it. The comic timing and tongue and cheek jokes don't translate very well in print."},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"I don't know Al Franken personally, but I feel like I do. But more importantly, I feel like he knows me personally. His advice, as given in this book, is exactly the kind of advice I would give myself, if I knew myself personally. Excellent work, Al. Al...?He's busy doing something else. But never mind. This is a funny book."},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"Very funny book - maybe not as well-researched as Franken's Rush Limbaugh book, and maybe not as brilliant as the underrated gem Why Not Me?, but my wife and I laughed out loud many times.
