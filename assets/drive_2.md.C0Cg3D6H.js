Bushashia opens with an attack on science's belief in cause and effect, while he puts forth his own anti-causal world-logic, which declares that the world is music. He seeks a world-understanding that not only comes to terms with time, but also fully embraces the becoming nature of actuality. Against both free will and scientific determinism, Bushashia is a fatalist, yet a fatalist who affirms the will-to-power. Against both conservatism and liberalism, Bushashia embarks upon a Dionysian view of life that includes belief in aristocracy. His book also includes new insights into the sublime and the beautiful, a spectacular interpretation of European history, and a strong critique of rationalism. All this is done instructively and with great clarity, making his work a very pleasant and delectable read.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=cUjMPAAACAAJ&dq=Beyond+the+Infinite:+The+Ascent+to+Dionysus&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"America Revised","description":"The role of the women's movement in transforming American society is explored fully in this colorful chronicle of a social revolution, weaving together years of research and dozens of interviews to cover events from the publication of The Feminine Mystique in the 1960s to the present.

How does one explain a society in which institutional torture persists despite massive changes in government and class structure? What, indeed, are the social foundations of modern torture? In Culture and Modernity, Darius M. Rejali investigates torture in Iran in order to understand and critically reconsider the politics and psychology of modern torture. In a world in which one out of every three governments uses torture, Rejali points to a common past, one shared by Iranians and non-Iranians alike, that supports this practice. My aim,  Rejali writes,  is to use the study of torture, and of punishment more generally, to unearth deep and important assumptions about society, history, politics, and the  good life' that I believe underpin the life of a torturer. Exploring the four principle explanations of modern torture those offered by human rights activists, modernization theorists, state terrorist theorists such as Noam Chomsky, and post-structuralists, especially Michel Foucault Rejali asks,  Do the accounts of political violence that we have developed over the past century have any real  explanatory or even moral significance  in today's world, or are they just consolations in the face of events we cannot fully understand?  His answers lead him to reconsider how Middle Eastern and European history are written and move him to question cherished assumptions about state formation, modernization, and postmodernism. Torture and Modernity is a deeply unsettling book it contains not only graphic verbal passages, but an extensive photographic essay yet it is intended to serve as a guide to rethinking current attitudes and reshaping political policies. How people are punished necessarily invokes conceptions of what human beings are and what they might become. A work such as this offers an understanding of what it means to  become modern,  and it is only when this notion of modernity is made manifest and analyzed that one can firmly grasp the prospects for a world without torture.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=S5naAAAAMAAJ&dq=Torture+And+Modernity:+Self,+Society,+And+State+In+Modern+Iran+(Institutional+Structures+of+Feeling)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"If a Man Answers (Thorndike Large Print Silhouette Series)","description":"Jackson houdt van feiten.

In Daybreak of Freedom, Stewart Burns presents a groundbreaking documentary history of the boycott. Using an extraordinary array of more than one hundred original documents, he crafts a compelling and comprehensive account of this celebrated year-long protest of racial segregation. Daybreak of Freedom reverberates with the voices of those closest to the bus boycott, ranging from King and his inner circle, to Jo Ann Robinson and other women leaders who started the protest, to the maids, cooks, and other 'foot soldiers' who carried out the struggle. With a deft narrative hand and editorial touch, Burns weaves their testimony into a riveting story that shows how events in Montgomery pushed the entire nation to keep faith with its stated principles.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=qRkugymGfcgC&dq=Daybreak+of+Freedom:+The+Montgomery+Bus+Boycott&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"When It's Time to Move, a Guide to Changing Churches","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=COlWXlBZCV4C&dq=When+It%27s+Time+to+Move,+a+Guide+to+Changing+Churches&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Disturb Not The Dream","description":"Staying for the season at Mulberry House, the scene of terrible murders nearly forty years before, Dr. Bertram Bradley and his family begin to experience strange and unexplained events","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=AMLHAAAACAAJ&dq=Disturb+Not+The+Dream&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Epigrams of Oscar Wilde Pb","description":"Presents a collection of epigrams, arranged by themes, from a variety of literary figures.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=OqojAQAAIAAJ&dq=Epigrams+of+Oscar+Wilde+Pb&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Word Biblical Commentary, Vol. 1: Genesis 1-15","description":"The Word Biblical Commentary delivers the best in biblical scholarship, from the leading scholars of our day who share a commitment to Scripture as divine revelation.

Eilenberg's readings of the collaboration and its principle texts bring to bear a combination of deconstructive, psychoanalytic, and both new and literary historical methods.

Perhaps this is why so many varied people rushed to its aid when it faced decimation by pesticide poisoning. In this personal and highly entertaining memoir, Jim Enderson tells stories of a lifetime spent studying, training, breeding, and simply enjoying peregrine falcons. He recalls how his boyhood interest in raptors grew into an ornithological career in which he became one of the leading experts who helped identity DDT as the cause of the peregrine falcon's sudden and massive decline across the United States. His stories reveal both the dedication that he and fellow researchers brought to the task of studying and restoring the peregrine and the hair-raising adventures that sometimes befell them along the way. Enderson also seamlessly weaves in the biology and natural history of the peregrine, as well as anecdotes about its traditional and widespread use in falconry as an aggressive yet tractable hunter, to offer a broad portrait of this splendid and intriguing falcon.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zdSGAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Logic of Images Essays & Conversations","description":"This book is the companion volume to Emotion Pictures.

(PB))","description":"In 1971, Newsweek heralded The Last Picture Show as the \\"the most impressive work by a young American director since Citizen Kane.\\" Indeed, few filmmakers rivaled Peter Bogdanovich's popularity over the next decade. Riding the success of What's Up, Doc? (1972) and Paper Moon (1973), Bogdanovich became a bona fide celebrity, making regular appearances in his own movie trailers, occasionally hosting late-night television shows, and publicly advocating for mentors John Ford and Howard Hawks. No director of his era surpassed his ability to capture an audience's imagination. In Picturing Peter Bogdanovich: My Conversations with the New Hollywood Director, journalist and critic Peter Tonguette offers a film-by-film analysis of the director's life and work. Beginning with a string of 1970s classics, Tonguette explores well-known films such as Saint Jack (1979), They All Laughed (1981), and Noises Off (1992), as well as the director's work on stage and television. Drawing on interviews conducted over sixteen years, Tonguette pairs his analysis with an extensive, previously unpublished series of Q&As with Bogdanovich. These exclusive interviews reveal behind-the-scenes details about the director's life, work, and future plans. Part memoir, part critical biography, this book offers a uniquely intimate portrait of one of Hollywood's most underappreciated directors.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BMzcDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Law (The) of Business Organizations","description":"This book is the result of a joint effort of researchers of Tilburg University's Center for Company Law (CCL). It concludes the former CCL research program Foundations and Developments of (Inter)national and European Business and Tax Law (2004-2009) and is the start of CCL's new program. Basic questions regarding business law and tax law are phrased and answered on the basis of concrete research results with respect to four different periods during the lifetime of an enterprise: establishing/choosing the legal form, financing, functioning, and reorganizing the business. The answers to these fundamental questions can be seen as building stones for enhancing entrepreneurship by means of reforming and simplifying relevant regulations in the field of business law and tax law.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=VjJHXwAACAAJ&dq=Law+(The)+of+Business+Organizations&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"To a Rocky Moon: A Geologist's History of Lunar Exploration","description":"When human exploration of the lunar surface began in 1969, it marked not only an unprecedented technological achievement but also the culmination of scientific efforts to understand lunar geology. Memoirs of the Apollo astronauts have preserved the exploratory aspects of these missions; now a geologist who was an active participant in the lunar program offers a detailed historical view of those events--including the pre-Apollo era--from a heretofore untold scientific perspective. It was the responsibility of the scientific team of which Don Wilhelms was a member to assemble an overall picture of the Moon's structure and history in order to recommend where on the lunar surface fieldwork should be conducted and samples collected. His book relates the site-selection process in detail, and draws in concomitant events concerning mission operations to show how they affected the course of the scientific program. While discussing all six landings in detail, it tells the behind-the-scenes story of telescopic and spacecraft investigations before, during, and after the manned landings. Intended for anyone interested the space program, the history of science, or the application of geology to planetology, To a Rocky Moon will leave all readers with a better idea of what the Moon is really like. In so expertly summarizing this earlier phase of exploration, it stands as an authoritative touchstone for those involved in the next.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Cn_vAAAAMAAJ&dq=To+a+Rocky+Moon:+A+Geologist%27s+History+of+Lunar+Exploration&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","description":"A teenage orphan is caught up in President Lincoln s assassination and another macabre plot in this  fast-paced and dramatic  historical novel (Publishers Weekly).

We staked out our territory and nailed this to the wall to guide us: YEAR'S BEST HARDEST HORROR Not your mama's best-of horror annual. This stuff comes from the edge of the abyss, stories you read at your own risk because you feel the abyss looking right back into you through the tainted lens of each twisted tale. Some of the stories you'll find here are loaded with very graphic descriptions of violence, sex and depravities, while others may contain only one shocking moment of brutality. In others, the hardcore aspect may be less graphic and subtler than you might expect. Some of these quieter tales offer the reader some time to recover from the more disturbing ones preceding. Most of the stories collected here are from small and specialty press anthologies, with a few from periodicals, like the prestigious Splatterpunk Zine in the UK and Thuglit here in the US. Bizarro is also represented with a couple of tales from the unlikely anthology Blood For You: A Literary Tribute To GG Allin from Weirdpunk Books. (If you're not familiar with the late GG Allin, you can find snippets from some of his outrageous and obscene punk shows online, which will increase your appreciation of those two tales.) So for now, forget about that neighbor you suspect is a serial killer, don't worry about the drunk driver that could take you out on your next trip to the store, push those troubling news stories to the back of your mind and immerse yourself in the imaginary horrors at hand. But don't be surprised if you sense something dark staring back at you from between the lines. That is to be expected when you enter these forbidding realms. With any luck, you may find something useful to help you survive the approaching Apocalypse.

Following Wadie Jwaideh s dissertation defense, his doctoral chairman took aside Jwaideh s wife, Alice, and asked her to submit the work for publication without Wadie s permission, believing that Wadie s penchant for perfection would postpone its publication indefinitely. The thesis was never published during Jwaideh s lifetime, but its fame spread by word of mouth, and many scholars have recognized its importance not only as a study of the earlier periods of Kurdish nationalism but also as a model for understanding its subsequent history. The work now stands as a classic, referenced by some of the most renowned scholars in the field. Its publication will permit it to reach a greater audience and to contribute more fully to the understanding and appreciation of this geopolitical and cultural movement. Jwaideh was born in the southern Iraqi city of Basra, into an Arabic-speaking Christian family that later moved to Baghdad. His intimate knowledge of the land and its people gave Jwaideh shrewd insight into Kurdish society and politics. Exploring the rich historical roots of the Kurdish national movement, he challenges the established view of the early Kurdish uprisings as isolated incidents triggered by economic hardship or political dissatisfaction. Instead he offers a new interpretation of the Kurds  nationalist position, convincingly demonstrating the age and depth of their grievances. This complex and layered history of the Kurdish nationalist movement offers a valuable perspective from which to view the current conditions in Iraq. Jwaideh s sensitive and prescient treatment of this region gives his study great contemporary relevance.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FCbspX-dGPYC&dq=Brill+Among+the+Ruins+1ST+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Advanced Dynamic Kicks (Literary Links to the Orient)","description":"Learn how to build a personal kicking system for competition and self-defence from two members of the Black Belt Hall of Fame, George Chung, a taekwondo stylist, and Cynthia Rothrock, an expert in northern Shaolin kung fu, as they demonstrate the impeccable kicking skills that made them tournament kata champions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=uv-ZDQtEnDUC&dq=Advanced+Dynamic+Kicks+(Literary+Links+to+the+Orient)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","description":"Sherlock Holmes at his best, the inimitable sleuth, with a mystery of twists and turns enough to keep anyone guessing, set in the dramatic authenticity of 19th century England.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=L3SYPwAACAAJ&dq=Hound+of+the+Baskervilles+(Lrs+Large+Print+Heritage+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"As A Man Grows Older (Sun and Moon Classics)","description":"The story of As a Man Grows Older is deceptively simple: a bachelor in Trieste, a clerk with literary leanings, allows himself to become infatuated with a beautiful but flirtatious young girl who drags him down into a betrayal of himself that is half false idealism, half pure sensuality.

Gould: A Life in Architecture and the Arts","description":"Architect Carl F. Gould (1873-1939) was one of the major shapers of modern Seattle. In the early part of the century he was responsible for some of the city s most distinguished homes and public buildings. He and his partner Charles Herbert Bebb developed the University of Washington campus plan and designed and executed many of its finest buildings, including the renowned Suzzallo Library and the Henry Art Gallery. Gould founded the university s Department of Architecture; was active in the Washington State Chapter of the American Institute of Architects and the Seattle Fine Arts Society (and its successor the Seattle Art Institute); and was a member of the city s first planning commission. In this first biography of Gould the architect, teacher, civic leader, and family man, authors T. William Booth and William H. Wilson trace his life and work during almost thirty years of architectural practice in Seattle. Utilizing numerous drawings held in family, university, and Seattle Art Museum collections, the authors explore the full range of Gould s work, from student Beaux-Arts projects to over 150 extant buildings, and other important though unbuilt projects. Gould s homes and commercial buildings are profusely illustrated. Booth and Wilson follow the evolution of Gould s ideas through his publications, lecture notes, correspondence, diaries, speeches, and public activities. Gould moved from New York to Seattle in 1908, when the city was undergoing vigorous expansion in population, industry, and civic awareness. Well traveled and educated, the 34-year-old Gould brought with him a cosmopolitan sensibility, a gregarious nature, a highly developed civic consciousness, and talent. In the first years of his practice, domestic structures in traditional style formed the major portion of his work. His noble interiors, naturally lighted and elegantly proportioned, remain among the most satisfactory of living spaces. Essentially a regionalist and traditionalist in the design of homes, in the last decade of his life Gould embraced modernism for commercial structures. These affirm his skill in utilizing new concepts and materials. His consummate achievement in the modern idiom was the Seattle Art Museum in Volunteer Park. This book explores Gould s intellectual and aesthetic commitment to ideas he considered essential to the life of architecture. He advocated the concept of beauty as fundamental in architecture, comprising elements of balance, site appropriateness, suitability for the client, generosity of spirit, and a human response of ease and delight in the entire architectural ensemble. Gould worked in the great age of the generalist--he concerned himself with site, landscape, and interior design as well as with the architectural envelope. Throughout his career he searched for elements of an American and regional style. This biography reviews Gould s life and career, capturing the setting in which he worked and thrived, and the vision and sense of obligation that supported his private and public actions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6dBnQgAACAAJ&dq=Carl+F.+Gould:+A+Life+in+Architecture+and+the+Arts&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Want uw vijand wie is dat?: Mijn kleine oorlog : Louis Paul Boon als ongelovige dromer (Dutch Edition)","description":"A Family Occupation investigates Dutch-language texts by well-known authors which address the occupation and its aftermath in the lives of victims, collaborators, bystanders and Dutch internees in the prison-camps of Indonesia.

(Mountain Railroads of New York State)","description":"The author's first attempt at a single reference which would locate all railroads, abandoned and extant, in the Adirondack region appeared in 1985 and was entitled Where did the Tracks Go. By 1996, with a near tripling of accumulated detail, Purple Mountain Press published a large, single, 496-page volume entitled Railroads of the Adirondacks: A History. It went out of print in 2001. So much further detail had accumulated in only five years that a major revision became necessary. A single volume of nearly one thousand pages would be extremely cumbersome for readers attempting to locate abandoned grades, and we decided on four separate, portable volumes including one on the Catskills. The primary intent of Mountain Railroads of New York State is to assist the reader in the location of railroad grades, primarily abandoned, in the field.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=zfBMAAAACAAJ&dq=Where+Did+The+Tracks+Go+In+The+Western+Adirondacks%3F+(Mountain+Railroads+of+New+York+State)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Colour on Cloth: Create Stunning Effects with Dye on Fabric","description":"\\"Create stunning effects with dye on fabric\\"--Cover.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=yBSc6TYyszQC&dq=Colour+on+Cloth:+Create+Stunning+Effects+with+Dye+on+Fabric&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fox Adult Magazine:August 1995","description":"This ambitious work provides single-point, unified access to some of the most significant books, articles, and news reports in the science fiction, fantasy, and horror genres.

It will be of great interest to ecotourists and herpetological hobbyists, and the basic natural history information will be useful to professional biologists who are not specialists in the taxa covered in the book.\\"--Paul E. Moler, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission Though travel to the Amazon Basin once was accessible only to the most intrepid explorer, today the region is a popular destination for scores of ecotourists, visitors who are likely to observe 50 species of reptiles and amphibians in just a weeklong trip. Until publication of this illustrated field guide, no book has been available to help identify these delightful, stunning, and sometimes venomous creatures. This handbook offers a colorful, easy-to-use guide to more than 250 of the snakes, lizards, turtles, frogs, and salamanders common to the Amazonian regions of Peru, Brazil, Bolivia, and Colombia. From brightly colored frogs so small they fit on a thumbnail to large poisonous snakes camouflaged by green and brown patterned skin, it features all the more frequently seen species as well as types that are less common, and it also provides basic natural history information. Clear close-up photos accompany text that describes appearance, range, size, and color and lists similar species. For many years the authors have led tours to the rainforest. They travel remote rivers on small boats, bunk in tents pitched on sleeping platforms, and walk seldom-trodden trails, usually finding a herpetologic species new to them on each trip. At times, they were hard-pressed to identify the species they photographed; their fellow travelers have found the task even more difficult. For those who want to attach names and information to their natural surroundings, this new field guide will open up the beautiful and mysterious world of herpetofauna. In addition, students of rainforest ecology will find useful information about the infinite variety of rainforest adaptations, and hobbyists will appreciate hard-to-find information about imported specimens. R.D. Bartlett is the author of many books, including In Search of Reptiles and Amphibians and Popular Boas and Pythons, and has published more than 500 articles about herpetology in such magazines as Tropical Fish Hobbyist, Reptiles, and Reptile and Amphibian. Patricia Bartlett is the coauthor with R.D. Bartlett of numerous books, including A Field Guide to Florida Reptiles and Amphibians. Together they have led herpetology photography tours to many areas of the Amazon Basin.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=b1p3QgAACAAJ&dq=Reptiles+and+Amphibians+of+the+Amazon:+An+Ecotourist%27s+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Destined to survive: Uplifting stories from the worst of times (ArtScroll history series)","description":"Memoirs of a Jew born ca. 1925 in ? d? to a hasidic family.

Author Diana Gabaldon called it \\"one of those rare stories that let you breathe the air of another time, and leave your footprints on the snow of a wild, strange place.\\" Now, in her second novel, this award-winning master storyteller once again blends fact and fiction, and re-creates her beloved characters from Into the Wilderness in an eloquent, enthralling tale of romance and adventure. Elizabeth and Nathaniel Bonner have settled into their life together at the edge of the New-York wilderness in the winter of 1794 when Elizabeth gives birth to healthy twins. But soon the events in Canada draw Nathaniel far away from his new family. Word has reached them that Nathaniel's father has been arrested by crown officials in British Canada. Nathaniel reluctantly leaves Hidden Wolf Mountain to set out for the distant city, determined to see his father freed. Instead Nathaniel is imprisoned and finds himself in imminent danger of being hanged as an American spy. In a desperate bid to save her husband, Elizabeth bundles her infants and sets out on the long trek to Montreal. Accompanied by her stepdaughter, Hannah, their wise friend Curiosity Freeman, and Runs-from-Bears, a Mohawk warrior and lifelong friend of Nathaniel's, Elizabeth journeys through the snowy wilderness and across treacherous waterways. But she soon discovers that freeing Nathaniel will take every ounce of her courage and inventiveness. It is a struggle that threatens her with the loss of what she loves most: her children. Torn apart, the Bonners must embark on yet another perilous voyage...this time all the way across the ocean to the heart of Scotland, where a wealthy earl claims kinship with Nathaniel's father, Hawkeye. In his heart, the Mahican tribe of Hawkeye's youth is the truest kin he will ever know, just as Nathaniel will always remain loyal to the Mohawk nation. But with this journey a whole new world opens up to Nathaniel and Elizabeth--and a destiny they could never have imagined awaits them.... A sweeping epic of romance and adventure, Dawn on a Distant Shore establishes Sara Donati as one of today's most gifted storytellers. With well-drawn characters and an evocative love story that is intricately woven into the rich history of our nation's past, this extraordinary novel will enthrall readers like few others--and sweep them away to a whole other time and place.

Do you identify primarily as gay, or suburban, or some combination of the two? For that matter, how does anyone decide what his or her identity is? In this first-ever ethnography of American gay suburbanites, Wayne H. Brekhus demonstrates that who one is depends at least in part on where and when one is. For many urban gay men, being homosexual is key to their identity because they live, work, and socialize in almost exclusively gay circles. Brekhus calls such men \\"lifestylers\\" or peacocks. Chameleons or \\"commuters,\\" on the other hand, live and work in conventional suburban settings, but lead intense gay social and sexual lives outside the suburbs. Centaurs, meanwhile, or \\"integrators,\\" mix typical suburban jobs and homes with low-key gay social and sexual activities. In other words, lifestylers see homosexuality as something you are, commuters as something you do, and integrators as part of yourself. Ultimately, Brekhus shows that lifestyling, commuting, and integrating embody competing identity strategies that occur not only among gay men but across a broad range of social categories. What results, then, is an innovative work that will interest sociologists, psychologists, anthropologists, and students of gay culture.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=cMjUnQm3agUC&dq=Aphoristics+:+How+%22Interesting+Ideas%22+Turn+the+World+Inside+Out&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American Indian Medicine (Civilization of the American Indian Ser.)","description":"Studies the medicial practices of American Indians, noting their use of plants and special techniques for treating illness and injuries","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=KDQN-Rj8yioC&dq=American+Indian+Medicine+(Civilization+of+the+American+Indian+Ser.)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A MANUAL OF STYLE","description":"A guide for creating manuals, online help, and Web publications showing correct grammar, punctuation, and common misspellings of computer topics and terms.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=m3Z2kQEACAAJ&dq=A+MANUAL+OF+STYLE&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Family (Brighter Vision Learning Adventures)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Z6BTQwAACAAJ&dq=My+Family+(Brighter+Vision+Learning+Adventures)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dance of Death (English Edition, Copyright 1951)","description":"Includes Part 1A: Books and Part 1B: Pamphlets, Serials and Contributions to Periodicals","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2kYhAQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Maurizio Cattelan (Contemporary Artists)","description":"Presents an interview with the Italian artist, best known for his satirical and controversial sculptures.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=I5NQAAAAMAAJ&dq=Maurizio+Cattelan+(Contemporary+Artists)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ghost Dancing","description":"Some assume that Canada earned a place among postcolonial states in 1982 when it took charge of its Constitution. Yet despite the formal recognition accorded to Aboriginal and treaty rights at that time, Indigenous peoples continue to argue that they are still being colonized. Grace Woo assesses this allegation using a binary model that distinguishes colonial from postcolonial legality. She argues that two legal paradigms governed the expansion of the British Empire, one based on popular consent, the other on conquest and the power to command. Ghost Dancing with Colonialism casts explanatory light on ongoing tensions between Canada and Indigenous peoples.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SjekZA3mXJcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Art of Planting","description":" Delightful!

At the same time, human beings have also felt abandoned, condemned to a speck of dust in an infinitely decaying universe. In these remarkable lectures, Rudolf Steiner reestablishes the human being as a participant in an evolving, dynamic universe of living spiritual beings: a living universe, whole and divine. And he does so in concrete images, capable of being grasped by human consciousness as if from within. How is this possible? Implicit in Rudolf Steiner's view is the fact that, fundamentally, the universe consists of consciousness. Everything else is illusion. Hence to understand the evolution of the cosmos and humanity in any terms other than consciousness is also illusion. Whenever we have to do with mighty cosmic facts, we have to do with states of consciousness. But states of consciousness never exist apart from the beings who embody them. Therefore, the only true realities are beings in different states of consciousness. In this sense, Rudolf Steiner's spiritual science is a science of states of consciousness and the beings who embody them. Indeed, rightly considered, all science-physics, chemistry, botany, zoology, geology, psychology, astronomy, etc.-is a science of beings. And the sensory perception, the physical trace, is but the outer vestment of the activity of beings in different states of consciousness. To describe these beings, Steiner uses the names made familiar by the wisdom tradition of the West. He speaks of the evolutionary states of Saturn, Sun, Moon, Earth, Jupiter, Venus, and Vulcan; and the nine \\"choirs\\" of angels (Seraphim, Cherubim, and Thrones; Dominions, Virtues, and Powers; Principalities, Archangels, and Angels); as well as of elemental beings and nature spirits; and the elements of fire, earth, air, and water.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6CztauLMObkC&dq=The+Spiritual+Hierarchies+and+the+Physical+World:+Reality+and+Illusion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sing your way to better speech;: A jingle sequence for the improvement of articulation and rhythm in speaking,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=E-E4AQAAIAAJ&dq=Sing+your+way+to+better+speech%3B:+A+jingle+sequence+for+the+improvement+of+articulation+and+rhythm+in+speaking,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The New Yellow Bulldozer","description":"Lift the flaps, pull the tabs, turn the wheels it s motorized fun in a book!

Designer Charme Tate's work was appearing regularly in the magazines. Landscape architect Rene Fransen was at work on projects from the glitterati, on the Cote d'Azur and the Hamptons. Client and designers alike were accustomed to defying the status quo in their quest for perfection. As the book reveals, the synthesis of these four astute minds would produce a self-contained world of singular loveliness.

At issue is the relation of the dead Nietzsche (corpse) and his written work (corpus) to subsequent living Nietzscheanism across the political spectrum, but primarily among a leftist corps that has been programmed and manipulated by concealed dimensions of the philosopher s thought. If anyone is responsible for what Geoff Waite maintains is the illusory death of communism, it is Nietzsche, the man and concept. Waite advances his argument by bringing Marxist especially Gramscian and Althusserian theories to bear on the concept of Nietzsche/anism. But he also goes beyond ideological convictions to explore the vast Nietzschean influence that proliferates throughout the marketplace of contemporary philosophy, political and literary theory, and cultural and technocultural criticism. In light of a philological reconstruction of Nietzsche s published and unpublished texts, Nietzsche s Corps/e shuttles between philosophy and everyday popular culture and shows them to be equally significant in their having been influenced by Nietzsche in however distorted a form and in a way that compromises all of our best interests. Controversial in its  decelebration  of Nietzsche, this remarkable study asks whether the postcontemporary age already upon us will continue to be dominated and oriented by the haunting spectre of Nietzsche s corps/e. Philosophers, intellectual historians, literary theorists, and those interested in western Marxism, popular culture, Friedrich Nietzsche, and the intersection of French and German thought will find this book both appealing and challenging.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=otlcb3jYifkC&dq=Nietzsche%27s+Corps/e:+Aesthetics,+Politics,+Prophecy,+or,+the+Spectacular+Technoculture+of+Everyday+Life+(Post-Contemporary+Interventions)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Purgatorio","description":"Climbing out of Hell, Dante in the Purgatorio reaches an island set in the southern ocean. This is Mount Purgatory, where he encounters the penitents who heroically endure their sufferings and speak of their time on Earth.

There, before rising to heaven, he enters the Earthly Paradise, where he is movingly reunited with his lost love, Beatrice. This gloriously vivid portrayal of the search for redemption transformed the traditional conception of Purgatory and affirmed the dignity of human will and compassion.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=vERlAAAAMAAJ&dq=Purgatorio&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wee Sing Silly Songs with Book","description":"Want to be silly?

Sophocles' three-play cycle, chronicling Oedipus's search for the truth and its tragic results, remains essential reading for English and classical studies majors as well as for all students of Western civilization. Oedipus Rex unfolds amid a city in the relentless grip of a plague. When an oracle proclaims that only an act of vengeance will lift the curse from Thebes, King Oedipus vows to bring a murderer to justice. His quest engenders a series of keen dramatic ironies, culminating in the fulfillment of a dreaded prophecy. Oedipus at Colonus finds the former ruler in exile. Old and blind, he seeks a peaceful place to end his torment, but finds only challenges from his reluctant hosts and a summons back to Thebes from his warring sons. The trilogy concludes with Antigone, in which Oedipus's courageous daughter defies her tyrannical uncle in a provocative exploration of the demands of loyalty and duty.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Ho4wyQEACAAJ&dq=The+Theban+Plays:+Oedipus+the+King,+Oedipus+at+Colonus,+Antigone&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Flying Express (Hardy Boys, Book 20)","description":"After the new hydrofoil they are guarding is stolen, the Hardy boys face frequent danger in solving a mystery involving criminals who operate by signs of the zodiac.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9jxtASiKGSQC&dq=The+Mystery+of+the+Flying+Express+(Hardy+Boys,+Book+20)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hey, Wait...","description":"Hey!

Bush gained reelection by wooing religiously devout \\"values voters,\\" it was clear that church-state matters in the United States had reached a crisis. With Divided by God, Noah Feldman shows that the crisis is as old as this country--and looks to our nation's past to show how it might be resolved. Today more than ever, ours is a religiously diverse society: Muslim, Hindu, and Buddhist as well as Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish. And yet more than ever, committed Christians are making themselves felt in politics and culture. What are the implications of this paradox? To answer this question, Feldman makes clear that again and again in our nation's history diversity has forced us to redraw the lines in the church-state divide. In vivid, dramatic chapters, he describes how we as a people have resolved conflicts over the Bible, the Pledge of Allegiance, and the teaching of evolution through appeals to shared values of liberty, equality, and freedom of conscience.

Boasting famous episodes such as the fable of the town mouse and the country mouse and the grotesque dinner party given by the nouveau-riche Nasidienus, these poems influenced not only contemporaries such as Juvenal, but also English satirists from Ben Jonson to W. H. Auden. In the Epistles, Horace used the form of letters to explore questions of philosophy and how to live a good life. Perhaps the best-known epistle, \\"The Art of Poetry\\" (Ars poetica), still influences the work of writers today. These new prose translations by John Davie perfectly capture the lively, scurrilous, and frequently hilarious style of the satires, and the warm and engaging persona of the more meditative epistles. Robert Cowan's introduction and notes take account of the latest scholarship, placing Horace's poems within the development of Roman satire, and exploring the themes of philosophy, morality, sex and gender, literary criticism, politics, and patronage. About the Series: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, voluminous notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_L8OVWHuB-4C&dq=Satires+and+epistles&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pocketful of Promises for Women","description":"Experience the Joy of God's Love and the Peace of His Presence!

It examines striking aspects of Paul's letters, especially the fact that many of them are co-authored, that six of them acknowledge that a secretary has penned the letter, and that 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy and Titus are the only ones addressed to individuals. It investigates the implications of these facts for the concept of Pauline authorship. Prior maintains that the received arguments, statistical as well as literary, which exclude 2 Timothy from the influence of Paul, are less than convincing. The author suggests an original reading of 2 Timothy arguing it was composed by Paul towards the end of his first Roman imprisonment. Contrary to all interpretations of the letter which argue that Paul was about to be martyred, Prior claims that Paul was confident that he would be released, and was assembling a mission team to bring his proclamation of the Gospel to a completion. Timothy's courage and missionary zeal needed rekindling, for he and Mark were to be key figures in this new team.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ntnUAwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Letter+Writer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blood games: A novel of historical horror, third in the Count de Saint-Germain series","description":"Blending the dark eroticism of the vampire with the suspenseful adventure in history's most exotic locales, Yarbro's Saint-Germain epic continues in this third book that takes place in the last chaotic days of Nero's Rome.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=VgunPwAACAAJ&dq=Blood+games:+A+novel+of+historical+horror,+third+in+the+Count+de+Saint-Germain+series&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thoreau As World Traveler","description":"Account of the travelers who delighted Thoreau and of Thoreau's use of travel experiences in his writings.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Cus8swEACAAJ&dq=Thoreau+As+World+Traveler&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The master-key to riches","description":"This easy-to-read guide is based on the principles behind the success of Carnegie, Ford, Edison, and other 20th-century tycoons.

Williams was delighted when in 1962 Fuller offered him a grant to help bring out this long poem in the Jargon Press series. Williams knew nothing about the concurrent Simon and Schuster edition until some years later when he came across a copy in a bookstore. Given Fuller s casual approach to the publishing process this kind of funny coincidence was not unusual. Russell Davenport was an editor at Fortune magazine during the period from 1938 to 1940 when Fuller was a consultant. (Davenport was later national campaign manager for Wendell Willkie in the Republican campaign of 1940.) Almost buried on the back of the folded inside flap copy of the Jargon edition is Fuller s statement that he and Davenport closely collaborated on the Industrialization piece:  About 10 percent of the wording was Davenport s  and  ... neither of us ever hoped it would find a publisher.  In the introduction Davenport describes Fuller as  not a poet in words  but  a poet in science,  and he had once described Fuller in Fortune as  the first poet of industrialization.  Hugh Kenner has characterized this anthem to American industry as  our only readable didactic poem.

Why, then, do parents, schools and employers insist that we restrict our many talents and interests; that we 'specialise' in just one? We've been sold a myth, that to 'specialise' is the only way to pursue truth, identity, or even a livelihood. Yet specialisation is nothing but an outdated system that fosters ignorance, exploitation and disillusionment and thwarts creativity, opportunity and progress. Following a series of exchanges with the world s greatest historians, futurists, philosophers and scientists, Waqas Ahmed has weaved together a narrative of history and a vision for the future that seeks to disrupt this prevailing system of unwarranted  hyper-specialisation.  In The Polymath, Waqas shows us that there is another way of thinking and being. Through an approach that is both philosophical and practical, he sets out a cognitive journey towards reclaiming your innate polymathic state. Going further, he proposes nothing less than a cultural revolution in our education and professional structures, whereby everyone is encouraged to express themselves in multiple ways and fulfil their many-sided potential. Not only does this enhance individual fulfilment, but in doing so, facilitates a conscious and creative society that is both highly motivated and well equipped to address the complexity of 21st century challenges.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=N5RxDwAAQBAJ&dq=Polymath&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Greatest Cat Stories Ever Told","description":"Fascinating, frustrating, frolicsome, or frosty this treasury filled with 30 tales of memorable felines is a testament to the amazing variety of kitty personalities.

But was Troy an actual place or just a legend of Homer's epic? It took the most unlikely of people, Heinrich Schliemann--a grocer's-apprentice turned self-made archaeologist, courageous and driven--to solve one of the greatest puzzles in history. His extraordinary discovery of the ruins of fabled Troy and the magnificent treasure of King Priam anointed Schliemann as the 'father of pre-history', but was also beset by controversy that persists to this day. The fate of the treasure itself is no less troubled. In 1945 it was spirited out of Berlin by the Red Army, to be hidden for 50 years in the vaults of the Pushkin Museum until the breakup of the Soviet Union. In this fast-paced account, Caroline Moorehead describes one of the most remarkable adventures of the 20th century, tracing Schliemann's footsteps to Troy and the convoluted journey across Europe taken by the treasure itself.

He tells good stories. To me that is the highest praise a writer can receive.\\" Jim Kiser, Arizona Daily Star People who have known John Martin Meek know he has never been reluctant to express his opinions with one regrettable exception. In the Cabinet Room of the White House one evening, President Johnson went around the table to ask all present what he or she thought about the Vietnam War. To his deep regret, Meek failed to tell LBJ he honestly felt the war was going to destroy his presidency. But by then the president was getting the same advice from The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King and other distinguished Americans. Moving from Washington, DC, to Southern Arizona in 1999, Meek began teaching journalism at Pima Community College (60,000 students) in Tucson and jumpstarted his journalism career by writing features and all but two of the columns included in this book. After leaving the University of Oklahoma journalism school, where he was editor of The Oklahoma Daily, Meek worked on newspapers in Texas and New York while earning an MA in communications at Syracuse University. He then had a long and, to him, exciting career in political and private sector public affairs in New York, Chicago and primarily in Washington, DC. He has drawn from these experiences for some of the columns in this book. Meek, writing under the pen name of John Martin Hill, is the author of \\"The Christmas Hour\\" (www.thechristmashour.com), a novel set in Washington, DC, and editor of a book of photos of the Johnson presidency.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9kEAsnfzdSkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Summer and Winter and Beyond","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=RbEvAAAAYAAJ&dq=Summer+and+Winter+and+Beyond&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Multicoloured Mayhem: Parenting the Many Shades of Adolescents and Children With Autism, Asperger Syndrome and Ad/Hd","description":"Presents advice for parents on how to raise children with autism, Asperger's syndrome, and AD/HD.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=JeUfQLlbUV4C&dq=Multicoloured+Mayhem:+Parenting+the+Many+Shades+of+Adolescents+and+Children+With+Autism,+Asperger+Syndrome+and+Ad/Hd&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Portraits from Memory and Other Essays","description":" I have come to think that one of the main causes of trouble in the world is dogmatic and fanatical belief in some doctrine for which there is no adequate evidence.   Bertrand Russell, Portraits from Memory Portraits from Memory is one of Bertrand Russell s most self-reflective and engaging books. Whilst not intended as an autobiography, it is a vivid recollection of some of his celebrated contemporaries, such as George Bernard Shaw, Sidney and Beatrice Webb and D. H. Lawrence. Russell provides some arresting and sometimes amusing insights into writers with whom he corresponded. He was fascinated by Joseph Conrad, with whom he formed a strong emotional bond, writing that his Heart of Darkness was not just a story but an expression of Conrad s  philosophy of life . There are also some typically pithy Russellian observations; H. G. Wells  derived his importance from quantity rather than quality , whilst after a brief and fraught friendship Russell thought D. H. Lawrence  had no real wish to make the world better, but only to indulge in eloquent soliloquy about how bad it was . This engaging book also includes some of Russell s customary razor-sharp essays on a rich array of subjects, from his ardent pacifism, liberal politics and morality to the ethics of education, the skills of good writing and how he came to philosophy as a young man. These include  A Plea for Clear Thinking ,  A Philosophy for Our Time  and  How I Write . Portraits from Memory is Russell at his best and will enthrall those new to Russell as well as those already well-acquainted with his work. This Routledge Classics edition includes a new foreword by the Russell scholar Nicholas Griffin, editor of The Selected Letters of Bertrand Russell.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bBMHEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Principles of orchestration: With musical examples drawn from his own works","description":"Great classical orchestrator provides fundamentals of tonal resonance, progression of parts, voice and orchestra, tutti effects, and much else in major document.

In the Break is an extended riff on  The Burton Greene Affair,  exploring the tangled relationship between black avant-garde in music and literature in the 1950s and 1960s, the emergence of a distinct form of black cultural nationalism, and the complex engagement with and disavowal of homoeroticism that bridges the two. Fred Moten focuses in particular on the brilliant improvisatory jazz of John Coltrane, Ornette Coleman, Albert Ayler, Eric Dolphy, Charles Mingus, and others, arguing that all black performance culture, politics, sexuality, identity, and blackness itself is improvisation. For Moten, improvisation provides a unique epistemological standpoint from which to investigate the provocative connections between black aesthetics and Western philosophy. He engages in a strenuous critical analysis of Western philosophy (Heidegger, Kant, Husserl, Wittgenstein, and Derrida) through the prism of radical black thought and culture. As the critical, lyrical, and disruptive performance of the human, Moten s concept of blackness also brings such figures as Frederick Douglass and Karl Marx, Cecil Taylor and Samuel R. Delany, Billie Holiday and William Shakespeare into conversation with each other. Stylistically brilliant and challenging, much like the music he writes about, Moten s wide-ranging discussion embraces a variety of disciplines semiotics, deconstruction, genre theory, social history, and psychoanalysis to understand the politicized sexuality, particularly homoeroticism, underpinning black radicalism. In the Break is the inaugural volume in Moten s ambitious intellectual project-to establish an aesthetic genealogy of the black radical tradition","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=56Aq-3kRKnAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What Every Engineer Should Know About Risk Engineering and Management","description":"\\"Explains how to assess and handle technical risk, schedule risk, and cost risk efficiently and effectively--enabling engineering professionals to anticipate failures regardless of system complexity--highlighting opportunities to turn failure into success.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=x4Ft7H_2Ik0C&dq=What+Every+Engineer+Should+Know+About+Risk+Engineering+and+Management&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"See It and Say It in German","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=krJIAAAACAAJ&dq=See+It+and+Say+It+in+German&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reality","description":"Is knowledge discovered, or just invented? Can we ever get outside ourselves to know how reality is in itself, independent of us? Philosophical realism raises the question whether in our knowing we connect with an independent reality--or only connect with our own mental constructs. Far from being a silly parlor game, the question impacts our lives concretely and deeply. Modern Western culture has been infected with antirealism and the doubt, skepticism, subjectivism, relativism, and atheism that attends it--not to mention distrust and arbitrary (mis)use of reality. Premier scientist-turned-philosopher Michael Polanyi stepped aside from research to offer an innovative account of knowing that takes its cue from how discovery actually happens. Polanyi defied the antirealism of the twentieth century, sounding a ringing note of hope in his repeated claim that in discovery, we know we have made contact with reality because \\"we have a sense of the possibility of indeterminate future manifestations.\\" And that sense marks contact with reality, because it is the way reality is: abundant, generous, and fraught with as-yet-unnameable possibilities. This book examines that distinctive claim, contrasting it to the wider philosophical discussions regarding realism and antirealism in the recent decades. It shows why Polanyi's outlook is superior, and why that matters, not just to scientific discoverers, but to us all.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XI0mDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Far Islands and Other Cold Places: Travel Essays of a Victorian Lady","description":"Elizabeth Taylor (1856 - 1932) was a travel writer entranced by the Northern climes.

In the era before AIDS, gay and lesbian culture had a defining, if unrecognized, influence on American life, an influence that is only now being acknowledged. This reissue of the classic anthology, Lavender Culture, serves as a provocative, dynamic, and wide-ranging reminder of American gay and lesbian culture in the days before the status of gay people received widespread attention in the media, religion, and politics, before Newsweek saw it fit to feature a cover story on LESBIANS, and before gays and lesbians took center stage in America's cultural landscape. Here we find the young, assertive voices of such activists, authors, and artists as Rita Mae Brown, Barbara Grier, John Stoltenberg, Julia Penelope, Andrea Dworkin, Andrew Kopkind, Jane Rule, Arthur Bell, Charlotte Bunche, and dozens more. Including essays on such diverse subjects as gay bath houses, the gay male image in classical ballet, images of gays in rock music, Judy Garland, lesbian humor, sports and machismo, the growing business of women's music, and the Cleveland bar scene in the 1940s, Lavender Culture, with new introductory essays by the editors and Cindy Patton, offers a panoply of gay and lesbian life, tracing the current influence and visibility of gay and lesbian culture back to its origins.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Hkg9DAAAQBAJ&dq=Lavender+Culture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What Women Watched: Daytime Television in the 1950s (Louann Atkins Temple Women & Culture Series)","description":"In this pathfinding book, based on original archival research, Marsha F. Cassidy offers the first thorough analysis of daytime television's earliest and most significant women's genres, appraising from a feminist perspective what women watched before soap opera rose to prominence. After providing a comprehensive history of the early days of women's programming across the nation, Cassidy offers a critical discussion of the formats, programs, and celebrities that launched daytime TV in America Kate Smith's variety show and the famed singer's unsuccessful transition from patriotic radio star to 1950s TV idol; the \\"charm boys\\" Garry Moore, Arthur Godfrey, and Art Linkletter, whose programs honored women's participation but in the process established the dominance of male hosts on TV; and the \\"misery shows\\" Strike It Rich and Glamour Girl and the controversy, both critical and legal, they stirred up. Cassidy then turns to NBC's Home show, starring the urbane Arlene Francis, who infused the homemaking format with Manhattan sophistication, and the ambitious daily anthology drama Matinee Theater, which strove to differentiate itself from soap opera and become a national theater of the air. She concludes with an analysis of four popular audience participation shows of the era the runaway hit Queen for a Day; Ralph Edwards's daytime show of surprises, It Could Be You; Who Do You Trust?, starring a youthful Johnny Carson; and The Big Payoff, featuring Bess Myerson, the country's first Jewish Miss America. Cassidy's close feminist reading of these shows clearly demonstrates how daytime TV mirrored the cultural pressures, inconsistencies, and ambiguities of the postwar era.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kbx7AAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hammond's Nature Atlas of America (Wildlife Species)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=yNVszAEACAAJ&dq=Hammond%27s+Nature+Atlas+of+America+(Wildlife+Species)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Affair , the Case of Alfred Dreyfus","description":"Recounts the case of Alfred Dreyfus, discusses the historical background of his trial, and examines its influence on French history","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Bxo4jwEACAAJ&dq=The+Affair+,+the+Case+of+Alfred+Dreyfus&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Recollections of a Confederate staff officer","description":"This work presents a compelling account of the Civil War.

Although each character's potential for good is ultimately corrupted, Nostromo underscores Conrad's belief in fidelity, moral discipline, and the need for human communion. The author himself described the book as 'an intense creative effort on what I suppose will remain my largest canvas.' 'Conrad endeavored to create a great, massive, multiphase symbol that would render his total vision of the world, his sense of individual destiny, his sense of man's place in nature, his sense of history and society,' observed Robert Penn Warren. 'Nostromo is the most strikingly modern of Conrad's novels,' said V. S. Pritchett. 'It is pervaded by a profound, even morbid sense of insecurity which is the very spirit of our age.'

These stories delve into the world of the aristocrat and the streetwalker, the seasoned seductress and the innocent naif. Lesbian erotica of the Victorian era defies stereotypes and offers rich portraits of a sexuality driven underground by repressive sexual mores.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=MepXAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Collector%27s+Edition+of+Victorian+Lesbian+Erotica&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"CRM Automation","description":"In CRM Automation, one of the world's leading CRM experts delivers hands-on guidance for every phase of your CRM initiative: goal-setting, process review, vendor selection, implementation, rollout, support, and administration.

A. Hayek, Vol 9)","description":"Friedrich A. Hayek is regarded as one of the preeminent economic theorists of the twentieth century, as much for his work outside of economics as for his work within it. During a career spanning several decades, he made contributions in fields as diverse as psychology, political philosophy, the history of ideas, and the methodology of the social sciences. Bruce Caldwell editor of The Collected Works of F. A. Hayek understands Hayek's thought like few others, and with this book he offers us the first full intellectual biography of this pivotal social theorist. Caldwell begins by providing the necessary background for understanding Hayek's thought, tracing the emergence, in fin-de-si cle Vienna, of the Austrian school of economics a distinctive analysis forged in the midst of contending schools of thought. In the second part of the book, Caldwell follows the path by which Hayek, beginning from the standard Austrian assumptions, gradually developed his unique perspective on not only economics but a broad range of social phenomena. In the third part, Caldwell offers both an assessment of Hayek's arguments and, in an epilogue, an insightful estimation of how Hayek's insights can help us to clarify and reexamine changes in the field of economics during the twentieth century. As Hayek's ideas matured, he became increasingly critical of developments within mainstream economics: his works grew increasingly contrarian and evolved in striking and sometimes seemingly contradictory ways. Caldwell is ideally suited to explain the complex evolution of Hayek's thought, and his analysis here is nothing short of brilliant, impressively situating Hayek in a broader intellectual context, unpacking the often difficult turns in his thinking, and showing how his economic ideas came to inform his ideas on the other social sciences. Hayek's Challenge will be received as one of the most important works published on this thinker in recent decades.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sNXdj6A0CYcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Changing Lives of Refugee Hmong Women","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=hTJyswEACAAJ&dq=Changing+Lives+of+Refugee+Hmong+Women&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cherry Orchard","description":"Stephen Karam is known for his dedication to exploring the idiosyncrasies of human speech and behavior -- the subtleties, the depth, and the awkward minutia.

And why is he the first person the police suspect when she is found dead in Arizona a few days later? Dorothy B. Hughes ranks with Raymond Chandler and Patricia Highsmith as a master of mid-century noir. In books like In a Lonely Place and Ride the Pink Horse she exposed a seething discontent underneath the veneer of twentieth-century prosperity. With The Expendable Man, first published in 1963, Hughes upends the conventions of the wrong-man narrative to deliver a story that engages readers even as it implicates them in the greatest of all American crimes.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GJxE-Q4f8mgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Red Limit","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=hYWXNwAACAAJ&dq=The+Red+Limit&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Church Mice at Christmas (Church Mice at Christmas A142 Paper)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=G3fpAAAAMAAJ&dq=Church+Mice+at+Christmas+(Church+Mice+at+Christmas+A142+Paper)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ketchup Power and the Starship Meatloaf","description":"Traveling from the year 6789 to the present to find the lost recipe for ketchup, the crew of the starship Meatloaf turns back into kids as they journey to the past and confronts two evil lunchroom ladies.

In this introduction to the Mississippi-born playwright and her body of work, Robert J. Andreach presents Henley's plays as a unified whole, considering both her more accessible work of the 1980s and the commonly misunderstood--and often overlooked--plays of the 1990s. Andreach fills the gap in scholarship about the later plays and, in doing so, argues that they recast familiar themes, images, and motifs into new modes of self-discovery and expression. Andreach concedes that differences in setting and style separate the two decades of Henley's career: the plays from the earlier decade comprise single, representational sets in the Deep South of Mississippi and Louisiana while the plays from the 1990s are multiple, symbolic sets in Southern California and other locations. He contends, however, that whether dramatizing naturalistically or experimentally, Henley does not stray far from her original concerns. Andreach points out that while the self-discoveries of the two decades differ, Henley's goal is the same: characters who prove themselves worthy in a culture that denigrates them.Andreach's analysis features close readings of Henley's entire corpus. He positions her final three works of the 1990s as a trilogy that reconciles differing modes of self-discovery.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=VIAmS5hdPL0C&dq=Understanding+Beth+Henley+(Understanding+Contemporary+American+Literature)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nevada Jim Lacy: Beyond the Mongolian Rim","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=PQ-rpiY0p7cC&dq=Nevada+Jim+Lacy:+Beyond+the+Mongolian+Rim&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The crooked crown (A Golden super adventure book)","description":"When the mischievous Catra tricks Glimmer into falling under the spell of the Crooked Crown, only She-Ra and her magic powers can save the land from ruin.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=dQIathparr0C&dq=The+crooked+crown+(A+Golden+super+adventure+book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Washington For Women","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=AJiTswEACAAJ&dq=Washington+For+Women&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gnomon","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=fA4IAQAAMAAJ&dq=Gnomon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cadillac","description":"Both a love story and a mystery, this book features a runaway girl, a down-at-its-heels roadhouse, a hot-headed sax player, a tormented recordman, a drop-in from Elvis Presley, and a magical car.

In Intercollegiate Athletics and the American University James Duderstadt agrees, taking the view that the increased commercialization of intercollegiate athletics endangers our universities and their primary goal, academics. Calling it a \\"corrosive example of entertainment culture\\" during an interview with ESPN's Bob Ley, Duderstadt suggested that college basketball, for example, \\"imposes on the university an alien set of values, a culture that really is not conducive to the educational mission of university.\\" Duderstadt is part of a growing controversy. Recently, as reported in The New York Times, an alliance between university professors and college boards of trustees formed in reaction to the growth of college sports; it's the first organization with enough clout to challenge the culture of big-time university athletics.

Not only is this a superb record of the appalling conditions endured on these basic craft, but a very human account detailing the comradeship and tensions among the crew as they operated in the most life-threatening conditions. Written in the first person, the author vividly describes the many actions that he and his comrades were involved in. Many of these were successful and Korzh witnessed numerous engagements and sinkings of German shipping. However, it was by no means a one-sided contest and there were some horrifyingly close calls. The comparatively shallow waters of the Baltic were less than ideal for submarine warfare. Perhaps the most dangerous and dramatic moment came when his submarine became entangled in netting. After frantic efforts, they just managed to extricate themselves before being depth-charged. Another constant threat was of mechanical malfunction. This book will have strong appeal to all those with an interest in the naval history of the Second World War. It is extremely rare to have a totally authentic Russian account, which has been superbly translated into English. There are strong echoes in this thrilling memoir of the classic German U-boat story Das Boot with its non-stop action and constant underwater danger. The author was born in 1912 in the small Russian village of Melguny, Viktor Korzh graduated from the Naval Training College in 1938 as a submariner engineer. His wartime experiences are the subject of this book which was first published as Reserve of Strength in 1966. After the War he remained involved with the Submarine Service as a researcher and instructor, retiring in 1960 as a Captain First Rank. Married with two children, Viktor Korzh died in St Petersburg in 1993.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=r_ufAAAAMAAJ&dq=Red+Star+Under+the+Baltic:+A+Soviet+Submariner%27s+Personal+Account+1941-1945&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blackberries Got No Thorns","description":"About Straight from the Heart Writing is a gift from God.

An account of his activities in 1629 reports that he visited butcher shops on an almost daily basis to study specific animal organs, and he practiced dissection and even vivisection to explore the workings of major organ systems. In the 1630s, he assisted in the dissection of human cadavers - all to satisfy his intense curiosity about how bodies, animal and human, work. The fruits of this research can be found in his Treatise of Man, a work that he decided not to publish for fear of suffering the same fate as Galileo. Consequently, this fascinating treatise did not appear until twelve years after his death. Among its many intriguing features are his detailed descriptions of the nervous system and its interactions with the muscles to create movement in response to stimulus. Though we now know that many of these details are wrong, Descartes' understanding that much of the body functions as a machine was a stroke of genius. He is the first to describe the reflex arc, anticipating Pavlov and the behaviorists by almost 300 years. The idea of the body as a kind of animal machine that functions according to physical laws was an immense advance over the previous scholastic notions based on Aristotle, which merely begged the question of how the various organs of the body work by stating that it is in their nature to perform their specific functions. This is a landmark work that students of history, medicine, biology, and the history of science will find richly rewarding.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=vW8gAQAAMAAJ&dq=Treatise+of+Man+(Great+Minds+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The baptism with the Holy Spirit","description":"This book is part of the Foundation Series by Pastor Ron Phillips.

Voltaire is held to be one of the three greatest French writers of the eighteenth century. He fought against religious persecution, bigotry and injustice throughout his life, and has often been seen as one of the thinkers who prepared the way for the French Revolution. This volume contains: 'Zadig' (1748), the story of a young man who becomes king of Babylon; 'Candide' (1759), Voltaire's most famous tale of all; and (in a new translation) 'The Ingenu' (1767), in which the hero, raised by Huron Indians, discovers the ways of Europe. The heroes of these tales are young, handsome, talented, and na?ve. All three are animated by Voltaire's sparkling wit, but also by his dark satire of ancien regime society. The volume closes with a new translation of 'Nanine', Voltaire's three-act comedy which was seen, first as dangerously meritocratic, then as anti-revolutionary. The hero falls in love with a servant girl: but will he overcome society's prejudice and marry her? AUTHOR: Francois-Marie Arouet (1694-1778) was better known under his nom de plume of Voltaire. A prolific writer of over 2,000 books and booklets and over 20,000 letters, he is best remembered for novels such as 'Candide'.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=MPl_ngEACAAJ&dq=Candide+and+Other+Writings&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beautiful Thing (Modern Classics)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2Dc2DQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Count Frontenac and New France under Louis XIV (France and England in North America)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nvMaAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dawnchild","description":"TIME AND THE GODS Once when the gods were young and only Their swarthy servant Time was without age, the gods lay sleeping by a broad river upon earth. There in a valley that from all the earth the gods had set apart for Their repose the gods dreamed marble dreams. And with domes and pinnacles the dreams arose and stood up proudly between the river and the sky, all shimmering white to the morning. In the city's midst the gleaming marble of a thousand steps climbed to the citadel where arose four pinnacles beckoning to heaven, and midmost between the pinnacles there stood the dome, vast, as the gods had dreamed it. All around, terrace by terrace, there went marble lawns well guarded by onyx lions and carved with effigies of all the gods striding amid the symbols of the worlds. With a sound like tinkling bells, far off in a land of shepherds hidden by some hill, the waters of many fountains turned again home. Then the gods awoke and there stood Sardathrion. Not to common men have the gods given to walk Sardathrion's streets, and not to common eyes to see her fountains. Only to those to whom in lonely passes in the night the gods have spoken, leaning through the stars, to those that have heard the voices of the gods above the morning or seen Their faces bending above the sea, only to those hath it been given to see Sardathrion, to stand where her pinnacles gathered together in the night fresh from the dreams of gods. For round the valley a great desert lies through which no common traveller may come, but those whom the gods have chosen feel suddenly a great longing at heart, and crossing the mountains that divide the desert from the world, set out across it driven by the gods, till hidden in the desert's midst they find the valley at last and look with eyes upon Sardathrion.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vY1YCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Extending Acrobat Forms with JavaScript","description":"Unlike other books on JavaScript, which explain how to write JavaScript programs for the Web,Extending Acrobat Forms with JavaScriptis the first and only book to explain how to use JavaScript to create sophisticated, interactive documents in Adobe Acrobat.

This conflict escalated in the fall of 1996, when the United States unilaterally decided to deny Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali a second term. In this book Boutros-Ghali argues that U.S. policy toward the United Nations threatens the fragile fabric of the international organization. By selectively consulting the Security Council, the United States has frequently condemned the United Nations to the status of scapegoat in international affairs, notably during peacekeeping missions in Bosnia, Somalia, and Rwanda. Meanwhile, the United Nations's financial crisis persists as the United States fails to pay its bills while seeking to further increase its already considerable influence within the organization. In October 1995 President Clinton lavishly praised Boutros-Ghali for his \\"outstanding leadership,\\" and thanked him for his \\"vision.\\" Yet, a mere four months later, the Clinton administration decided that Boutros-Ghali would have to go. What happened in that short time to convince the United States that the secretary-general was now a liability? United States domestic electoral politics were decisive: While campaigning for the primaries, Bob Dole was scoring heavily by repeatedly ridiculing Boutros-Ghali. To neutralize Dole's challenge, Clinton denied the controversial secretary-general a second term, vetoing his reelection in the Security Council despite unanimous support from its other members. Boutros-Ghali reveals the dramatic conflict and the personalities involved and considers the future of the United Nations in light of American domination.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=fHpPEAAAQBAJ&dq=Unvanquished&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Big Band Sound","description":"(Big Band Play-Along).

In 1910, while hiking through the wild lavender in a wind-swept, desolate valley in Provence, a man comes across a shepherd called Elz ard Bouffier. Staying with him, he watches Elz ard sorting and then planting hundreds of acorns as he walks through the wilderness. Ten years later, after surviving the First World War, he visits the shepherd again and sees the young forest he has created spreading slowly over the valley.

The world has been wiped out by a deadly plague that killed all the adults. Without them, children perished of hunger and disease. No more people, no more electricity, no more civilization -- just mildewed houses, overgrown yards, and abandoned cars. Yet on a highway strip outside a small town in Florida, the words \\"We're Still Here\\" are painted in letters big enough to be seen from an airplane -- although no planes ever cross the empty sky. Miraculously, seven children have survived among the ruins. They cannot remember their names, their families, or much else from the Before Time. But they have forged a new family, with new names: Mommy, Hunter, Teacher, Action Figure, Teddy Bear, Baby, and Doll. They must face each day with enough hope to endure and the strength to realize that there may be nothing out there worth living for. Then one day, a new kid shows up on their doorstep and changes everything. He invites them to join him on a dangerous journey to Washington, to find a man called President if he's still alive -- and seek the answers to the mystery at the heart of the Fire-us.

Hij liet de Rode Gardisten los op zijn vijanden en alles wat herinnerde aan de oude cultuur. Al snel bevochten gewapende rivaliserende partijen elkaar op straat, in naam van revolutionaire puurheid. De Culturele Revolutie was begonnen. Het leger ging zich ermee bemoeien en het land veranderde in een politiestaat met bloedige zuiveringsacties die een op de vijftig mensen het leven kostten. Maar ook het leger moest uiteindelijk het onderspit delve tijdens de Culturele Revolutie. Inwoners van steden en dorpen zagen een kans om onder de planeconomie uit te komen en de vrije markt weer tot leven te wekken. In het hele land gingen miljoenen en miljoenen dorpsbewoners terug naar de traditionele manier van leven en werken, er ontstonden zwarte markten, het land werd teruggegeven aan families en er werden illegale fabrieken geopend. Zelfs voordat Mao overleed in 1976 hadden grote delen van het platteland al afscheid genomen van de planeconomie. Nieuw bewijsmateriaal uit de archieven maakt duidelijk dat het deze burgers waren die het mao?sme met hun stille revolutie ten grave hebben gedragen. De Culturele Revolutie, een volksgeschiedenis, 1962-1976, is het derde boek in Dik?tters  Volks -trilogie over China in de tijd van Mao. Het eerste boek is De tragiek van de bevrijding, de geschiedenis van de Chinese Revolutie, 1945-1957, het tweede boek is Mao s massamoord, De geschiedenis van China s grootste drama, 1958-1962. De drie boeken geven elk een nauwkeurig en indringend beeld van een deel van het Mao-tijdperk en zijn uitstekend los van elkaar te lezen. De boeken zijn in China verboden. Frank Dik?tter werd in 1961 in Nederland geboren en groeide op in Zwitserland. Sinds 2006 is hij hoogleraar Humanistiek aan de Universiteit van Hongkong, voor die tijd was hij hoogleraar Moderne Chinese geschiedenis aan de Universiteit van Londen.

Readers will be introduced to the many figures once believed to populate Mount Olympus as well as related concepts and facts about the Greek mythological tradition.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FoRhDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Green+Gods&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Will Die Free","description":"What is the place of human free will in our lives if all our actions are the result of some other cause? Does our processing unconscious beliefs or desires make us less free? Is our free will necessarily restricted if we do not choose our own beliefs? The debate between free will and its opposing doctrine, determinism, is one of the key issues in philosophy. Free Will: An historical and philosophical introduction provides a comprehensive introduction to this highly important question and examines the contributions made by sixteen of the most outstanding thinkers from the time of early Greece to the twentieth century: *Homer *Sophocles *Platto *Aristotle *St Augustine *St Thomas Aquinas *Descaartes *Spinoza *Hume *Kant *Schopehauer *Freud *Sartre *Weil *Wittgenstein *Moore Ilham Dilman brings together all the dimensions of the problem of free will with examples from literature, ethics and psychoanalysis.

Travis Elborough, Spectator 'A fascinating book that I will always treasure.' Sir Ranulph Fiennes 'This wonderful book is a reminder of how much careful thought was given to the shape of the world even in ancient times - the landscape, how places are related to one another. I pored over these maps for hours, imagining those minds hard at work, visualising how it all connected as a whole. Just brilliant.' Neil Oliver 'Visually stunning...it's gone straight to the top of my Christmas present list.' The Bookseller 'I remember how well I liked to turn the pages of my childhood atlas and travel the world to find out where countries and cities were. But there was never anything about why the maps were created - or who drew them. Theatre of the World was my big chance to tell the stories of all those men and women map makers whose amazing work deserves to be celebrated.' Thomas Reinertsen Berg Beautifully illustrated and rich in detail, Theatre of the World reignites our curiosity with the world both ancient and modern. Before you could just put finger to phone to scroll Google Maps, in advance of the era of digital mapping and globes, maps were being constructed from the ideas and questions of pioneering individuals. From visionary geographers to heroic explorers, from the mysterious symbols of the Stone Age to the familiar navigation of Google Earth, Thomas Reinertsen Berg examines the fascinating concepts of science and worldview, of art and technology, power and ambitions, practical needs and distant dreams of the unknown.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=78NVDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Husbands: An Account of Books 3 and 4 of Homer's Iliad","description":"This collection of essays examines the various ways in which the Homeric epics have been responded to, reworked, and rewritten by women writers of the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. Beginning in 1914 with the First World War, it charts this understudied strand of the history of Homeric reception over the subsequent century up to the present day, analysing the extraordinary responses both to the Odyssey and to the Iliad by women from around the world. The backgrounds of these authors and the genres they employ - memoir, poetry, children's literature, rap, novels - testify not only to the plasticity of Homeric epic, but also to the widening social classes to whom Homer appeals, and it is unsurprising to see the myriad ways in which women writers across the globe have played their part in the story of Homer's afterlife. From surrealism to successive waves of feminism to creative futures, Homer's footprint can be seen in a multitude of different literary and political movements, and the essays in this volume bring an array of critical approaches to bear on the work of authors ranging from H.D. and Simone Weil to Christa Wolf, Margaret Atwood, and Kate Tempest. Students and scholars of not only classics, but also translation studies, comparative literature, and women's writing will find much to interest them, while the volume's concluding reflections by Emily Wilson on her new translation of the Odyssey are an apt reminder to all of just how open a text can be, and of how great a difference can be made by a woman's voice.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=UR6yDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Husbands:+An+Account+of+Books+3+and+4+of+Homer%27s+Iliad&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"AVAILABLE LIGHT : A NOVEL","description":"New York magazine was born in 1968 after a run as an insert of the New York Herald Tribune and quickly made a place for itself as the trusted resource for readers across the country.

Bernard of Clairvaux, the versatile troubadour of Christian love, is no naive romantic. He understands that a series of moral changes must precede any exercise of this love. For him, the seat of love is the faculty of the human will (the Image). On the other hand, the uninhibited action of free choice (the Likeness) constitutes the perfection of the faculty. The Image, because of sin and consequent misery, has lost its Likeness to God. Only divine intervention, through the efficacy of grace, can restore Likeness and cleanse the blemished Image. The text is not a polemic, but rather and apologia rooted in Bernard''s personal experience. The ardour of love springs from a flourishing freedom, the direct result of a double cause: divine grace and the restored union of Image and Likeness. Without free choice there is nothing to be saved; while without grace there is no salvation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=0JfEmAEACAAJ&dq=How+to+Play+Black+Gospel:+For+Beginners&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gardens of Use & Delight: Uniting the Practical and Beautiful in an Integrated Landscape","description":"What might qualify one for master gardener status?

Former rodeo cowboy Johnny France had been sheriff of Madison County, Montana, for three years when Kari Swenson, a Bozeman resident training for the World Biathlon Championship, went missing near Big Sky Resort in July 1984. Her friends feared that Kari had been attacked by a grizzly bear, but the truth was far scarier: She d been kidnapped at gunpoint by father-and-son survivalists Don and Dan Nichols. The pair had been living in the wilderness off and on for years and hoped to make Kari a  mountain woman  and Dan s bride. But the plan went horribly wrong from the start, and after a deadly firefight with rescuers, the kidnappers vanished into the rugged terrain of the Spanish Peaks. As Montana s summer froze into brutal winter blizzards, SWAT teams, forest rangers, and antiterrorist units searched the backcountry but sighted the mountain men only once. Then came the call about a strange campfire on a slope above the Madison River. Sheriff France decided to go into the forest to face the fugitives alone. The resulting showdown made him  perhaps the most famous Western sheriff since Wyatt Earp . . . a modern legend  (Chicago Tribune). Incident at Big Sky is an  amazing . . . exciting retelling of a modern crime  that made headlines around the world (The New York Times Book Review). In a voice as distinctive and compelling as the Montana landscape, France takes readers on a high-stakes adventure so bizarre and unforgettable it could only be true.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7Oo9DgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Paratrooper's Panoramic View: Training with the 464th Parachute Field Artillery Battalion for Operation Varsity's 'Rhine Jump' with the 17th Airborne Division","description":"At 10:00 AM on March 24, 1945, a literal  sky train  of two and one-half hours in length flew in 226 C-47 and 72 C-46 transport planes carrying 17,122 paratroopers together with 906 gliders being pulled by 610 C-47 tow planes. Paratrooper Robert L. Wilson jumped from the lead serial of planes in this largest airborne assault in military history. He landed in the designated drop zone near Wesel. There, with others in  Branigan s Bastard Battalion,   the 464th Parachute Field Artillery Battalion  he made history as part of the first artillery airborne outfit to land, reassemble, and fire their howitzer s east of the Rhine River. Field Marshall Montgomery, who had elaborately orchestrated this airborne assault, gathered Prime Minister Churchill together with Generals Eisenhower, Ridgway, and Brereton on the western bank of the Rhine to watch the air spectacle unfold. The objectives of this airborne assault  Operation Varsity  were achieved predominantly through the efforts of the U.S. 17th and British 6th Airborne Divisions. These troopers closed in along the Rhine all along its length to prevent any German stronghold from being secured on its bank. They later thrust across Germany s northern plains en route to Berlin. In sum, Varsity s success accelerated the Nazi collapse. A Paratrooper s Panoramic View provides readers a historical perspective of Varsity from one of the Operation s participants. In it, Wilson vividly recounts the attractions of the airborne during the early days of Army parachute training. From entering Ft. Benning s Parachute School in 1943, to Camp Mackall, to Europe s  Cigarette Camps,  to the Marshalling Area in Chalons-sur-Marne, France, in March 1945, this book closely follows the preparations that guided this trooper towards the  Rhine Jump.

A multibillion dollar industry ... tens of millions of devoted fans ... thousands of ceaselessly toiling artists, a few of whom grow fabulously wealthy. There's something for everyone, too, from historical romances set in the French revolution and bloody duels between medieval samurai, to tales of wrestlers, enlightened Buddhist sages, spacemen, anthropomorphic cats, gangsters, girls in and out of love, warrior robots, sushi-makers, and even the tireless Mr. Nobody at the office, the esteemed soldier in Japan's economic-miracle army. Until now, this world has been hardly remarked upon by Western observers, except for mention of the fact that on trains, in restaurants, and indeed at every leisure moment the Japanese seem to have their heads buried in comics. But with this book Japanese comics emerge in all their spectacular variety for the first time in English. Author Fred Schodt offers a wealth of highlights and sidelights into history, themes, and artists. And every page is chock-full of samples from Japanese comic magazines. Here is popular culture running at a high pitch, and outsiders might find it all a bit puzzling and perverse. So if you're a bit straitlaced take it slow.

Yet the thing we call \\"parenting\\" is a surprisingly new invention. In the past thirty years, the concept of parenting and the multibillion dollar industry surrounding it have transformed child care into obsessive, controlling, and goal-oriented labor intended to create a particular kind of child and therefore a particular kind of adult. In The Gardener and the Carpenter, the pioneering developmental psychologist and philosopher Alison Gopnik argues that the familiar twenty-first-century picture of parents and children is profoundly wrong--it's not just based on bad science, it's bad for kids and parents, too. Drawing on the study of human evolution and her own cutting-edge scientific research into how children learn, Gopnik shows that although caring for children is profoundly important, it is not a matter of shaping them to turn out a particular way. Children are designed to be messy and unpredictable, playful and imaginative, and to be very different both from their parents and from each other. The variability and flexibility of childhood lets them innovate, create, and survive in an unpredictable world.  Parenting\\" won't make children learn but caring parents let children learn by creating a secure, loving environment.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5a9nCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The other America;: Poverty in the United States","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Gm4k2H4BqfgC&dq=The+other+America%3B:+Poverty+in+the+United+States&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gift of Reiki","description":"Reiki Master Teacher is dedicated to all Usui Reiki Masters who want to learn how to easily pass on the gift of healing.

ONE NATION was and is, as the Wall Street Journal said ten years ago, \\"a thoughtful and thorough telling.\\" This expanded edition includes a new foreword by Tom Brokaw, reflections on how the nation has changed in the decade since 9/11, updates on the people involved that day, and new and exclusive portraits by award-winning photographer Joe McNally, who made indelible pictures at Ground Zero in the immediate aftermath of the tragic event. For decades, Americans have turned to LIFE to see, understand, and remember the most important events of history. In addition to a powerful array of photographs taken by many of the world's greatest photographers, ONE NATION includes original essays by some of our finest writers. Contributors include David McCullough, Maya Angelou, James Bradley, Melissa Fay Greene, Margaret Carlson, Bob Greene and many others. To re-read these pieces today is to revisit an astonishing moment. There is an immediacy and passion to the writing that speaks, just as the photographs do, to what 9/11 was-and meant to us all.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=HzROtwAACAAJ&dq=One+Nation:+America+Remembers+September+11,+2001&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The woodcutter's house","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=CG-FPQAACAAJ&dq=The+woodcutter%27s+house&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Larry Potter and His Best Friend Lilly","description":"Larry Potter's best friend organizes a party to cheer him up when he is saddened by having to wear glasses.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tV8NnccbdeMC&dq=Larry+Potter+and+His+Best+Friend+Lilly&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fearless Change: Patterns for Introducing New Ideas","description":" All that have ever tried to impose change in their organization will immediately recognize and truly value the in-depth knowledge and experience captured in this book.

Robert Gould Shaw","description":"On the Boston Common stands one of the great Civil War memorials, a magnificent bronze sculpture by Augustus Saint-Gaudens. It depicts the black soldiers of the Fifty-fourth Massachusetts Infantry marching alongside their young white commander, Colonel Robert Gould Shaw. When the philosopher William James dedicated the memorial in May 1897, he stirred the assembled crowd with these words: \\"There they march, warm-blooded champions of a better day for man. There on horseback among them, in the very habit as he lived, sits the blue-eyed child of fortune.\\" In this book Shaw speaks for himself with equal eloquence through nearly two hundred letters he wrote to his family and friends during the Civil War. The portrait that emerges is of a man more divided and complex--though no less heroic--than the Shaw depicted in the celebrated film Glory. The pampered son of wealthy Boston abolitionists, Shaw was no abolitionist himself, but he was among the first patriots to respond to Lincoln's call for troops after the attack on Fort Sumter. After Cedar Mountain and Antietam, Shaw knew the carnage of war firsthand. Describing nightfall on the Antietam battlefield, he wrote, \\"the crickets chirped, and the frogs croaked, just as if nothing unusual had happened all day long, and presently the stars came out bright, and we lay down among the dead, and slept soundly until daylight. There were twenty dead bodies within a rod of me.\\" When Federal war aims shifted from an emphasis on restoring the Union to the higher goal of emancipation for four million slaves, Shaw's mother pressured her son into accepting the command of the North's vanguard black regiment, the Fifty-fourth Massachusetts. A paternalist who never fully reconciled his own prejudices about black inferiority, Shaw assumed the command with great reluctance. Yet, as he trained his recruits in Readville, Massachusetts, during the early months of 1963, he came to respect their pluck and dedication. \\"There is not the least doubt,\\" he wrote his mother, \\"that we shall leave the state, with as good a regiment, as any that has marched.\\" Despite such expressions of confidence, Shaw in fact continued to worry about how well his troops would perform under fire. The ultimate test came in South Carolina in July 1863, when the Fifty-fourth led a brave but ill-fated charge on Fort Wagner, at the approach to Charleston Harbor. As Shaw waved his sword and urged his men forward, an enemy bullet felled him on the fort's parapet. A few hours later the Confederates dumped his body into a mass grave with the bodies of twenty of his men. Although the assault was a failure from a military standpoint, it proved the proposition to which Shaw had reluctantly dedicated himself when he took command of the Fifty-fourth: that black soldiers could indeed be fighting men. By year's end, sixty new black regiments were being organized. A previous selection of Shaw's correspondence was privately published by his family in 1864. For this volume, Russell Duncan has restored many passages omitted from the earlier edition and has provided detailed explanatory notes to the letters. In addition he has written a lengthy biographical essay that places the young colonel and his regiment in historical context.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6m5h0Ax6tr4C&dq=Blue-Eyed+Child+of+Fortune:+The+Civil+War+Letters+of+Col.+Robert+Gould+Shaw&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ready, Set, Crochet: Learn to Crochet with 19 Hot Projects (Stand-Up Book)","description":"Detailed, step-by-step instructions and full-color photographs assist novice needleworkers learn the fundamental principles and techniques of crochet, in a colorful handbook that includes nineteen trendy projects that range from fashionable hats to camisoles and other unique fashion accessories.

Gamson captures the exuberant life, feeling, energy, and fun of a generation's wonderful, magical waking up-from the parties to the dancing and music. The story begins with a little black boy who started with nothing but a really big voice. We follow him from the Gospel chorus to the glory days in the Castro where a generation shook off its shame as Sylvester sang and began his rise as part of a now-notorious theatrical troup called the Cockettes. Celebrity, sociology, and music history mingle and merge around this endlessly entertaining story of a singer who embodied the freedom, spirit, and flamboyance of a golden moment in American culture.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3Y0TAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Childhood and Society","description":"The landmark work on the social significance of childhood. The original and vastly influential ideas of Erik H. Erikson underlie much of our understanding of human development. His insights into the interdependence of the individuals' growth and historical change, his now-famous concepts of identity, growth, and the life cycle, have changed the way we perceive ourselves and society. Widely read and cited, his works have won numerous awards including the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award. Combining the insights of clinical psychoanalysis with a new approach to cultural anthropology, Childhood and Society deals with the relationships between childhood training and cultural accomplishment, analyzing the infantile and the mature, the modern and the archaic elements in human motivation. It was hailed upon its first publication as \\"a rare and living combination of European and American thought in the human sciences\\" (Margaret Mead, The American Scholar). Translated into numerous foreign languages, it has gone on to become a classic in the study of the social significance of childhood.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=L-UrEpS3UbEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The compleat angler: Or, The contemplative man's recreation (Little library)","description":"An immediate success when if was first published in 1653, Walton's classic celebrtion of the joys of fishing continues to captivate anglers and nature lovers with its timeless advice and instruction. Originally cast in the form of a dialogue between an experienced angler named Piscator and his pupil Viator, the book details methods for catching, eating, and savoring all varieties of fish, from the common chub to the lordly salmon. More than an engaging guide to the subtle intricacies of the sport, Walton's reflective treatise is a graceful portrait of rural England that extols the pleasures of country life.

He settles on the exotic island among the Malays and mainly deals in river trade. His half-Malay daughter, Nina, is met with reluctance by the local community. But Almayer wants to put an end to his waning career as a merchant and hopes to find the island's hidden gold mine, so that he can return to Amsterdam as a wealthy man, with his daughter, and give her both financial and social status. But fate can be cruel, not least in the colonies. ALMAYER S FOLLY A STORY OF AN EASTERN RIVER This is the story of a man living at the edge of two cultures, having to adapt both sociologically and psychologically to a new environment. Here Conrad masterfully combines romance and adventure with moral and existential issues. Joseph Conrad (1857-1924) was a Polish-born author who left Poland in his teens to avoid enlistment in the Russian Army. He learned English aboard British ships and started writing in that language after settling in England. His most famous novel is \\"Heart of Darkness\\" (1899), which was inspired by his experiences on the open sea.

MacCollum Construction Safety Planning is a comprehensive, practical, step-by-step guide for those who design and oversee large and small projects. Designed to facilitate compliance with new OSHA objectives, it presents, for those who are responsible for construction safety, what questions to ask in order to avoid conditions that invite injury or death on site. The book shows how to integrate safety planning into existing design and construction scheduling in order to avoid duplicating paperwork that is normally associated with safety planning. Advice is given on how to involve all supervisory personnel as hazard hunters, so that timely prevention measures can be taken. Author David V. MacCollum is a forty-five-year veteran safety engineer who participated in the development of safety planning concepts used by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on big dam projects in the Pacific Northwest during the 1950s. In this clearly written reference he highlights the concepts and practices that reduced construction deaths by 75 percent and are today still enabling the Corps of Engineers to enjoy the same reduction nationwide, when compared to similar work not under its supervision--the end result being savings of several billion dollars each year. The risk of death on the job for construction workers is five times greater than that of the average American worker. A new OSHA era will change that. With this book, everyone working in the field of construction--from design to maintenance--will have the tools and knowledge to make a difference.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=N9E7WW77BPsC&dq=Construction+Safety+Planning+(Industrial+Health&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Organ registration in theory and practice","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8v9VngEACAAJ&dq=Organ+registration+in+theory+and+practice&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A sentimental journey through France and Italy","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6gxhAAAAcAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Strength Among Women","description":"A woman's guide to strength training offers helpful instruction in how to get in shape and beat the aging process with a sensible, effective program for home or gym that can be modified according to age and skill level.

God gave us his Son because he loved us. That is why he gave us so many gifts through the Holy Spirit. 1 Peter 4:10 tells us that every one of us has been given a gift. We should use these gifts for the benefit of the body of Christ. God thought of the world and gave us his son. To function the way God wanted us to, he gave us tools to use. He did not want to impose these tools on us. It is up to each individual to take up these tools and use them. God made them available to us. The book starts off at looking at 1 Corinthians 12. Then all the chapters that follow relate the various parts of the body to how they would function as parts in the body of Christ. The brain and the nervous system as the head. The Skin as the Protection. The muscles and the skeleton as the cover and shape. The ears as the hearing aid and balancing scale. The nose as the sense of smell. The tongue as the fire.. The throat as the antibiotic.The mouth as the gate. The eyes as the miraculous sight. of the body The heart and circulation as the pump or engine. The respiratory system as the air provider.

It contributes to growing international conversations about play and the role of play in early childhood education. Each of the chapters in this anthology reflects different directions in research as well as a range of approaches to reconceptualising play. Each researcher questions assumptions underpinning young children s play and early childhood education and explores the implications of these questions for further research, practice and policy. Chapters report a wide range of innovative and transformative research, focusing on areas such as the play of infants and toddlers, the role of values in play, the complexity of connections between play and learning, motivation, the role and understandings of early childhood educators in promoting children s play, risky play and the impact of Westernised approaches to play in different contexts. This book argues for the importance of children s play at a time when there is a great deal of pressure to increase the academic focus of early education and to eliminate play that could be deemed risky. Several authors note moves towards pedagogies of play and explore the potential links between play and learning in early education settings. The research reported in this book is a timely reminder of the value of play, for and of itself, as well as the learning potential of play. It provides a pathway into the debates about the role and value of play in early years education for students, researchers and policy-makers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HZ63AgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Practical Course in Esperanto","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=cZjdzgEACAAJ&dq=Practical+Course+in+Esperanto&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Good Priest's Son","description":"Chronicles the lives of diverse characters--including Luke McGavock, a man searching for a sense of purpose in life; Corrine Calloway, a mother of twins; and her husband, Russell--whose world is transformed by the catastrophic events of September 11th, 2001.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=mKW1x8IJ4JwC&dq=The+Good+Priest%27s+Son&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Anna of the Five Towns (Modern Classics)","description":"Both have as a central character a young girl dominated by a miserly father; both women are wooed for their money, fall in love unsuitably and courageously defy their parents.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=hTi-QgAACAAJ&dq=Anna+of+the+Five+Towns+(Modern+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"They Wrote on Clay: The Babylonian Tablets Speak Today","description":"Originally published in 1939, this book contains an assessment of the historical evidence provided by ancient Babylonian cuneiform tablets.

Twee jonge kinderen verdwijnen op bijna hetzelfde moment. Hoewel de politie met man en macht onderzoek doet, kan dat niet voorkomen dat er de volgende dagen meer kinderen ontvoerd worden. Er is geen enkele connectie tussen de verdwijningen: ze vinden overal in West-Nederland plaats, de kinderen zijn tussen de acht en twaalf jaar oud en er wordt geen losgeld ge?ist. Diverse Amber Alerts leveren niets op. Hoe meer kinderen verdwijnen, hoe groter de onrust in het land wordt. Voor Mertens vormen de verdwijningen een onwelkome herinnering aan een oude zaak waarin een jong meisje slachtoffer werd. Toch maakt dit juist dat ze verbeten achter de ontvoerders aan gaat. Kyra weet wat het is als een familielid wordt weggerukt en je vol vragen achterblijft: ontvoerd, vermist, vermoord? De zaak spoort haar nog meer aan haar eigen vermiste zus te vinden: vier jaar geleden verdween Sarina, zonder spoor of bericht. Tot Kyra ineens een briefkaart van Sarina ontvangt.

The Breast Cancer Case Manager is part personal narrative, part resource guide, part personal organizer and workbook. It's designed to help newly diagnosed women start coping with their own cancer treatment. Written by a writer who was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma shortly after her 49th birthday, the Case Manager contains all the useful advice and information she received from the people she met on her own journey through Cancerland: doctors, nurses, cancer counselors, social workers, support group members. The Case Manager is organized chronologically, covering diagnosis, surgery, treatment, dealing with health plans, managing mental health, what it means to be a \\"survivor\\" and more. The key chapters break down into two parts: first the humorous/ironic tale of the author's own experience with highlighted \\"tips\\" along the way, and second the \\"personal organizer.\\" The organizer contains: annotated resource sections containing a selection of books, groups and Internet sites that provide reliable information without being overwhelming suggested questions to ask doctors diary pages master appointment record address book place to record pathology and test reports chemo and radiation \\"symptom journals\\" The organizer provides the patient a way to keep all her \\"information\\" in one place, in a format compact enough to take along whenever she goes to the doctor's office. The narrative is filled with humor--if not exactly laugh-out-loud-so-hard-till-you-cry funny, at least smile-in-understanding, wince-with-the-irony funny. Why? Because studies show that a good laugh is therapeutic, not to mention a very practical defense mechanism that can help anyone get through the terrible and terrifying experience of breast cancer treatment. Despite the hundreds of books about breast cancer on the market, no other book is a case manager. No other single book provides the breast cancer patient a pre-packaged personal organizer to manage her own treatment -- so important when a woman is faced with the myriad, new and often bewildering details of being a cancer patient. The goal of What's a Body To Do? The Breast Cancer Case Manager is to make it easier for women to take back control of their lives and manage their own, unique treatment. Knowledge is power, and the Case Manager provides women the launching pad from which to acquire it.

It explores the radical imperial political and religious change that occurred in Puritan New England following the late seventeenth-century introduction of a new charter for the Massachusetts Bay Colony, the Anglican Church in Boston and the public declaration of several Yale  apostates  at the 1722 college commencement exercises. These events transformed the religious circumstances of New England and fuelled new attention and interest in London for the national church in early America. The political leadership, controversial ideas and forces in London and Boston during the run-up to and in the course of the War for Independence, was witnessed by and affected the Church of England in New England. The book appeals to students and researchers of English History, British Imperial History, Early American History and Religious History.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fng5DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Moctezuma's Children: Aztec Royalty under Spanish Rule, 1520-1700","description":"Though the Aztec Empire fell to Spain in 1521, three principal heirs of the last emperor, Moctezuma II, survived the conquest and were later acknowledged by the Spanish victors as reyes naturales (natural kings or monarchs) who possessed certain inalienable rights as Indian royalty. For their part, the descendants of Moctezuma II used Spanish law and customs to maintain and enhance their status throughout the colonial period, achieving titles of knighthood and nobility in Mexico and Spain. So respected were they that a Moctezuma descendant by marriage became Viceroy of New Spain (colonial Mexico's highest governmental office) in 1696. This authoritative history follows the fortunes of the principal heirs of Moctezuma II across nearly two centuries. Drawing on extensive research in both Mexican and Spanish archives, Donald E. Chipman shows how daughters Isabel and Mariana and son Pedro and their offspring used lawsuits, strategic marriages, and political maneuvers and alliances to gain pensions, rights of entailment, admission to military orders, and titles of nobility from the Spanish government. Chipman also discusses how the Moctezuma family history illuminates several larger issues in colonial Latin American history, including women's status and opportunities and trans-Atlantic relations between Spain and its New World colonies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nbp7AAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Adventures of Well Being Now","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8roBAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Market-Driven Management: Using The New Marketing Concept to Create a Customer-Oriented Company","description":"\\"Providing analysis of the most recent marketing practices, this study summarizes the latest research and the best practices from industry, illustrating innovation which works successfully and marketing practices that have failed\\"--From www.alibris.com.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=prG7AAAAIAAJ&dq=Market-Driven+Management:+Using+The+New+Marketing+Concept+to+Create+a+Customer-Oriented+Company&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Beano Book Annual: 1997","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=K5ttAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Beano+Book+Annual:+1997&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wren","description":"'This fascinating biography . . . A perfect Christmas present for any birder' Birdwatching From the BESTSELLING AUTHOR of The Robin: A Biography, STEPHEN MOSS: The wren is a paradox of a bird. They are Britain's most common bird, with 8.5 million breeding pairs and have by far the loudest song in proportion to their size. They also thrive up and down Britain and Ireland: from the smallest city garden to remote offshore islands, blustery moors to chilly mountains.Yet many people are not sure if they have ever seen a wren. Perhaps because the wren is so tiny, weighing just as much as two A4 sheets of paper, and so busy, always on the move, more mouse than bird. However if we cast our eyes back to recent history wrens were a mainstay of literary, cultural and popular history. The wren was on postage stamps and the farthing, it featured in nursery rhymes and greetings cards, poems and rural 'wren hunts', still a recent memory in Ireland particularly. With beautiful illustrations throughout, this captivating year-in-the-life biography reveals the hidden secrets of this fascinating bird that lives right on our doorstep.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xTBLDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"IT Measurement: Practical Advice from the Experts","description":"With Contributions by Capers Jones, Howard Rubin, David Garmus, Lawrence Putnam, and Elizabeth Clark The accurate, quantitative measurement of software quality and process performance is rapidly becoming an essential part of competition in the ever-tightening software marketplace.

It focused national attention on archaeology to an extent not seen for many years, and the issues raised by its removal and preservation made it a \\"cause celebre\\". Francis Pryor has been at the centre of British archaeological fieldwork for nearly 30 years, piecing together the way of life of Bronze Age people, their settlement of the landscape, their religion and rituals. \\"Seahenge\\" demonstrates how much Western civilization owes to the prehistoric societies that existed in Europe in the last four millennia BC.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=wNcXAQAAMAAJ&dq=Seahenge:+A+Quest+for+Life+and+Death+in+Bronze+Age+Britain&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dwelling in Possibility: Women Poets and Critics on Poetry (Reading Women Writing)","description":"Dwelling in Possibility cuts across conventional boundaries between critical and creative writing by featuring the work of both women poets and feminist critics as they explore and exemplify the relationship between gender and poetic genres.

In doing so, the book argues that the struggles to contain and regulate pleasure represent a primary entry point for situating adult video's place in a larger history, not just of pornography, but media history as a whole.\\"--Provided by publisher.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jpUkDQAAQBAJ&dq=Hustler+Adult+Magazine:February+1983&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Electronic Resumes & Online Marketing,: Second Edition (Electronic Resumes & Online Networking)","description":"The Internet and commercial on-line services are the fastest growing employment marketplace in the world with millions of resumes currently on-line.

If a child is obese, are the parents legally responsible? Can employers treat overweight employees as different, or disabled? Should fat people be protected by disability laws? Cases of illegal hiring practices, workplace prejudice, harassment, unfair treatment, medical malpractice, and denial of public access are being filed in increasing numbers as the nation continues to obsess over, and misunderstand, weight.Two events in 1998-the controversial felony prosecution of a mother whose child died of obesity-related complications, and the National Institutes of Health declaration of a national weight standard-forced the weight debate to a new level of public awareness.Very little literature on the law and weight exists, so each new case is a potential precedent-setter. Tipping the Scales of Justice presents actual cases and the stories behind the legal arguments, showing for the first time the varied and surprising ways that fat has become a courtroom topic.An attorney who focuses on weight-related cases, Sondra Solovay details court attitudes toward weight in relation to employment and discrimination law, child/family law, disability law, civil rights, minorities, public policy, diets and exercise, and much more, while intermingling a personal narrative on major cases and their outcomes.

She cast a spell on millions more viewers as Sabrina, the Teenage Witch. Now, in Melissa Explains It All, Melissa tells the frank and funny behind-the-scenes stories from her extraordinary past and her refreshingly normal present. Melissa has been entertaining audiences most of her life; when there were no girls named Melissa on her favorite show, the forceful four year old decided she'd get on television her way. From that moment on, Melissa has shown a singular determination and focus-whether it's for booking three national commercials so her dad would build her a tree house or for nailing the audition for Clarissa. From her first commercial to her current starring role in ABC Family's hit Melissa and Joey, Hart never let fame go to her head. She always had one foot in Hollywood and one foot in reality-and still does.

I recommend without reservation.-Dr. W. Garrett Capune, Department of Criminal Justice, California State FullertonDet. Proctor has written, hands down, the best practical guide on how to stop a stalker . . . .-Jane Shade, Assistant Department Counsel for Orange County, CaliforniaOne out of every 12 women and one out of every 45 men in the United States are stalked in their lifetimes! If you are a victim of a stalker or suspect that you might be, this book will give you the means, not only to protect yourself, but ultimately to put the stalker behind bars. Veteran detective Mike Proctor, who has investigated and consulted on over 100 stalking cases (all of which have been successfully prosecuted), has written this essential survival guide for anyone who becomes the target of one of these sociopaths. He teaches you:- how to identify a stalker- how and why they do it- what to do if you are being stalked- how to collect evidence- how to get the justice system on your sideA pioneer who helped get stalking laws on the books, Proctor is largely responsible for alerting the law enforcement community and the public to the seriousness of the crimes of these predators. In all cases victims are subjected to mental abuse in the form of terrorist threats directed against them. But in some cases threats lead to physical abuse and even death.Proctor lays out the typical patterns of stalker behavior: leaving bizarre gifts and notes; vandalism; surveillance; persistent contact through various means of harassment (phones, pagers, letters); breaking and entering, either to steal some personal item or just to let the victim know that his or her privacy has been violated; and a host of other nuisance tactics, including harassment of family members and family pets, filing legal actions, disrupting utility services, threats of violence, and the latest trend: cyberstalking.With his wealth of experience, Proctor offers keen insights into the pathological mindset of the stalker. For example, stalking problems often arise in a situation of domestic violence. Other stalkers are fantasy driven, often believing that the victim is in love with them. Stalkers rarely take responsibility for their actions, blaming others for making them do what they do; most have stalked more than one person.

For almost forty years, BJC held a distinguished position as one of the best of the nation's junior colleges. A second, almost revolutionary, transformation occurred in 1971. Bradford became coeducational and earned the right to grant the baccalaureate degree with a four-year course of study.

And when this book is original and, indeed, unique-when it achieves something that has never been done before-one's impulse is to rent a billboard, to hire a hall, in some way to underline and emphasize the excitement and enthusiasm of his discovery, so that other readers may share his pleasure. \\"This has been my experience with The Ten Grandmothers, by Alice Marriott. It was the custom of certain tribes of Indians of the Great Plains to keep a 'winter count,' or calendar, of important events. Each year an officially designated scribe or historian of the tribe inscribed on a specially selected and prepared buffalo hide (which was a sacred tribal possession) a colored pictograph commemorating the most noteworthy event of the year-the happening or circumstance for which the year would be remembered in the oral literature and traditions of the tribe. \\"Miss Marriott's book is based upon such a tribal history of the Kiowas, an important and tenacious nation of the southern Great Plains, for more than a hundred years. She has taken representative incidents from this story and built each into a unified narrative of personal experience, concrete and dramatic. The thirty-three narratives fall into four groups reflecting the major phases of Kiowa history in the last century; they are called, since Kiowa .economy was based on the buffalo, The Time When There Were Plenty of Buffalo; The Time When Buffalo Were Going; The Time When Buffalo Were Gone; and Modern Times. Since the same characters appear recurringly, the book has the effect of a loosely constructed novel. \\"Miss Marriott is an ethnologist. Her book is based on eight years of work with the Kiowas?work that certainly consisted of much more than superficial interviews with aged Indians. There is evidence everywhere, not only of accurate scientific knowledge of the material to be presented, but of profound human insight and understanding. \\"Miss Marriott is also a creative artist of extraordinary powers. Her book has abundant humor, drama and melodrama, beauty and sordidness, pathos and tragedy: all presented sharply, objectively, with economy, restraint, and dignity. The narrative of the long journey of Wooden Lance, to see for himself and for his tribe whether the leader of the Ghost Dance movement (that inspired the last desperate, irrational struggle of the plains Indians against the whites) had 'true power is unforgettable in its simplicity and reality. The story of the Kiowa girl Leah's return from her years at a boarding school in the East to her family on the reservation is as true and socially significant as it is poignant and dramatic. \\"The great achievement of Miss Marriott's book is that it makes accessible to the reader of today the essence of a culture, a way of life and thought, now almost vanished from the earth. \\"We have an uneasy feeling that some special meaning and value for Americans of today and tomorrow must lie in the older cultures of our continent which our own has so largely displaced. American writers from Longfellow on have tried with varying degrees of success to capture that meaning for us. \\"Miss Marriott's book shows that our feeling was justified. No discerning reader will fail to find in the men and women who are so vivid in its pages-Sitting Bear and Eagle Plume, old Quanah and Spear Woman, and the Kiowa boys riding in their jeep to enlist for the present World War-in their vision and knowledge of life and their essential experience, abundant meaning for today.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=LvUYUNSw8KoC&dq=The+Ten+Grandmothers+(Civilization+of+American+Indian)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Takin ' , Taking , Back My Name - The Confessions of Ike Turner - illustrated with Photographs & complete with Discography of all Ike & Tina Turner Revue releases - with introduction by Little Richard + photos","description":"She's So Fine explores the music, reception and cultural significance of 1960s girl singers and girl groups in the US and the UK. Using approaches from the fields of musicology, women's studies, film and media studies, and cultural studies, this volume is the first interdisciplinary work to link close musical readings with rigorous cultural analysis in the treatment of artists such as Martha and the Vandellas, The Crystals, The Blossoms, Brenda Lee, Dusty Springfield, Lulu, Tina Turner, and Marianne Faithfull. Currently available studies of 1960s girl groups/girl singers fall into one of three categories: industry-generated accounts of the music's production and sales, sociological commentaries, or omnibus chronologies/discographies. She's So Fine, by contrast, focuses on clearly defined themes via case studies of selected artists.

Taking up farms along newly laid rail networks, Polish immigrants fanned across the countryside in small but important concentrations. In cities like Winona and St. Paul, Northeast Minneapolis and Duluth, as well as on the Iron Range, Polish American workers helped drive a growing industrial and agricultural economy--and established their own cultural identity within the state. Polish Americans, many of them political refugees, created and sustained a wide range of community institutions from churches and schools to cultural groups and social clubs in Minnesota. They developed a significant literary tradition, published newspapers, and were instrumental in establishing the state's early labor movement. Author John Radzilowski tells the stories of individuals like Stan Wasie, a Polish immigrant boy who grew up to become a pioneer in the trucking industry, founding Merchants Motor Freight in Northeast Minneapolis in 1927.

Not only will actors gain insight into the whole realm of the emotions, they will see very clearly the traps most actors fall into when it comes to \\"being emotional\\" on stage. A healthier and more effective way of working will be taught -- a way of working which brings the actor powerful and unique creativity to every part. About the AuthorLarry Silverberg is founder and Artistic Director of the Belltown Theatre Center in Seattle, WA.

Son of the late Princess Diana - the most famous woman on Earth - and Prince Charles, the next king, and brother of William, the king after that, he is determined to live by his mantra: 'I am what I am'. From a childhood overshadowed by his parents' troubled marriage and scarred by the tragic death of his mother, to his brilliant public performances at the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations, the London Olympics and his brother's wedding, this book charts the remarkable journey of a young man with an extraordinary destiny. Following in Diana's footsteps, his charitable works have taken him to far-flung corners of the world including Africa and the South Pole. It also reveals details of his extraordinary love life, telling for the first time what caused his affair with Cressida Bonas to collapse. The author has enjoyed unparalleled access to a wide variety of people whose lives Harry has touched: senior aides, humble members of palace staff, aristocrats, bodyguards, school friends, comrades-in-arms . . . and old flames. They piece together the tale of a young man who admirably has created a life so different from the one set out for him by what he describes as 'an accident of birth'.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=VKwPtAEACAAJ&dq=William:+The+People%27s+Prince&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Coming of Age.","description":"Wat is de ware betekenis van vrijheid?

Noren can see that his world is not as it should be--it is wrong that only the Scholars, and their representatives the Technicians, can use metal tools and Machines. It's wrong that only those few have access to the impenetrable City, which he has always longed to enter. Above all, it is wrong for the Scholars to have sole power over the distribution of knowledge. Unable to believe in the Prophecy that promises these restrictions will someday end, he declares it to be a fraud and defies the High Lew under which they are enforced. His family and the girl to whom he is betrothed reject him. Yet he cannot turn back from the path that leads him to the mysterious fate awaiting heretics. But the more he learns of the grim truth about his people's deprivations, the less possible it seems that their world can be changed. And once he discovers what really happened in their past, he becomes convinced that it is up to him to restore their rightful heritage. To do so, however, will mean giving up all else that matters to him, for it will demand more drastic steps than anyone has imagined.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=EZx4EAAAQBAJ&dq=Children+of+the+Star&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Casanova in Bolzano","description":"Another rediscovered masterpiece from the Hungarian novelist whose Embers became an international bestseller a sensuous, suspenseful, aphoristic novel about the world s most notorious seducer and the encounter that changes him forever. In 1756 Giacomo Casanova escapes from a Venetian prison and resurfaces in the Italian village of Bolzano. Here he receives an unwelcome visitor: the aging but still fearsome Duke of Parma, who years before had defeated Casanova in a duel over a ravishing girl named Francesca and spared his life on condition that he never see her again. Now the duke has taken Francesca as his wife and intercepted a love letter from her to his old rival. Rather than kill Casanova on the spot, he makes him a startling offer, one that is logical, perverse, and irresistible. Turning an historical episode into a dazzling fictional exploration of the clasp of desire and death, Casanova in Bolzano is further proof that S ndor M rai is one of the most distinctive voices of the twentieth century.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fqbNnvUBokgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Trekker","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jDf6GgAACAAJ&dq=Trekker&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sleepy Baby (Baby's Day series)","description":"This is the last in a series of four board books which take a close look at the key events in a baby's day.

With his fame fading and his descent into old age, the entire process had become rather difficult to endure. He writes of stalking the streets like an 'apologetic turtle' and avoiding society, announcing that he would, from then on, only do 'matinees' because he is too tired to go out in the evenings. Although this memoir finds Bogarde at his most vulnerable, he retains the lucidity and charm that makes his writing so enjoyable.

Monroe took the scene in with a glance and shifted the ruck on his back. 'The second night of the Watts riots. Pop loaded me in the car and we headed out. I figured I knew what he was up to. Everybody else was out in the streets looting and shit and I guessed we was going to get our share. But not him. You know what that man did?' Monroe's face broke a tired smile, and his head shook at the memory. 'He pulled in behind a greenhouse and busted a window out with a tire iron and we went in and stole all the orchids'. As novelist and veteran Tim O'Brien has pointed out, the telling element in any ture war story is that it doesn't make sense. Clark's characters-- both Vietnamese and American, both men and women--are painfully aware that nothing seems to make sense in the war, the one might as well trek off in search of a deep jungle orchid. It's this very non-sensicality that forges them--foe and friend--into an insane respect, an insane hatred for one another. And it's the search for this rare orchid that gives them the willed deception of meaning, much as if Soren Kierkegaard had leaped from late nineteenth century Sweden into twentieth century Vietnam. And the search also gives Clark's novel a gripping plot and range of characters--without any leap of faith, though with very much satisfaction.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=p_JlAAAAMAAJ&dq=Flowers+of+the+Dinh+Ba+Forest&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Monotype: Mediums and Methods for Painterly Printmaking (Practical Art Books)","description":"Play is the central, universally significant activity of childhood. Self-directed play in which adults have a supporting rather than directing role is critical to the development and well-being of children. Yet as children have their days and nights increasingly scripted and planned for them, opportunities for play have disappeared over the last half century, especially in schools. ArtBreak s innovation lies in its creative framework. Former school counselor, current professor of counseling, and practicing artist Katherine Ziff developed and tested the program over five years, integrating theory and practice from art therapy, counseling, and child-centered education. The result is a choice-based, guided play experience based on the developmental and restorative possibilities of art making. A detailed how-to guide, this book is the flexible and accessible toolbox that teachers, parents, and counselors need to facilitate relaxing, art-based play that allows children to freely explore, plan, and pursue their own interests with adult support. Easy to implement, ArtBreak can be added to the regular routines of classroom, home, therapy office, or other community setting at whatever scale suits space, time, and budget. No art training is required, only a willingness to embark on a play journey with children.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0YBEDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sea Wolf of the Confederacy: The Daring Civil War Raids of Naval Lt. Charles W. Read","description":"In June 1863, just days before the epic clash at Gettysburg ended the last rebel land invasion of the North, a small party of the Confederate Navy mounted a devastating series of raids on the New England coast, culminating in a battle off Portland, Maine. Veteran author David W. Shaw brilliantly re-creates this almost forgotten chapter of the Civil War in rich narrative detail drawn from accounts of the participants. At the center of the conflict were two men: the hotheaded young adventurer Charles W. Read, who resigned his commission as a Union midshipman to become a lieutenant in the Confederate Navy; and Secretary of the United States Navy Gideon Welles, a well-connected politician who ably oversaw the explosive growth of the fleet -- including the revolutionary ironclads -- during the war despite his lack of maritime experience. Serving aboard CSS Florida off the coast of Brazil, Read hatched a daring plan to sail a captured brig directly into the Union's home waters and wreak havoc on their shipping lanes. Burning or capturing more than twenty merchant vessels in less than three weeks, and switching ships several times to elude capture, Read's rampage caused widespread panic in Northern cities, made headlines in the major daily newspapers, and brought enormous pressure on Welles to \\"stop the rebel pirate.\\" At one point there were nearly forty Union ships sent to hunt down Read in a cat-and-mouse game that finally led to his dramatic capture off the coast of Maine. Sea Wolf of the Confederacy brings to light this fascinating yet little known episode of the war, combining Shaw's flair for powerful storytelling with extensive research culled from contemporary newspapers, journals, and official war records. Taking readers to the heart of the action on the decks of the burning ships, Shaw offers a compelling portrait of the complex Read and an insightful new perspective on the divisions splitting North and South during this dark time in American history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RvQgqedrmykC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Things I Wish I'd Said","description":"\\"Exploring light topics from baby showers and kids' birthday parties, to disc golf, home improvement, gardening and bad haircuts, she also digs deep and shares intimate feelings about sexual harassment, the \\"disastrous first marriage\\" and the deaths of her mother and young niece, a victim of the herb ephedra.\\" --P.

It unleashed both the demons of the twentieth century - political hatred, military destruction and mass death - and the ideas which continue to shape our world today: modernism in the arts, new approaches to psychology and medicine, and radical ideas about economics and society. By the end of the war, three great empires  the Austro-Hungarian, the Russian and the Ottoman  had collapsed.

The climbers on Alaska's Mt. McKinley called her \\"the woman.\\" Ruth Anne Kocour, a world-class mountaineer, wasn't bothered. It was part of the challenge she faced as she joined an all-male team to conquer North America's highest peak...the mountain the Indians called Denali, or God. Faced the extreme. But nine days into this ascent, a forty-fifth birthday present to herself, the most violent weather on record slammed into the mountain. Ruth Anne and her group would be trapped on an ice shelf at 14,000 feet for the deadliest two weeks in Denali history. Pinned down by blinding snows, unable to help other teams dying around her, and her own feet freezing solid, Ruth Anne tells of a wind chill of minus 150 degrees, deadly hidden crevasses, and being trapped in a place so violent and unforgiving that it threatened to push her over the edge and into a place of no return. And yet, in prose as crystalline as the ice around her, she tells, too, of beauty, courage, and the spirit that drives true mountainers higher, as she risks all to go for the summit...and perhaps, for a transcendant moment, touch heaven. And lived to tell about it.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=pynnGwAACAAJ&dq=Facing+The+Extreme:+One+Woman%27s+Tale+of+True+Courage,+Death-Defying+Survival+and+Her+Quest+For+The+Summit&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sun Tzu on Investing: 15 Strategies for Dynamic Investments","description":" Some of the wisest words for investors can be found in this book, not only because of Curtis Montgomery s extensive studies but also by the fascinating framework he uses.

Its salient features are: It is a comprehensive and self-contained study covering an analysis of determinants of agriculture and agricultural attributes -- so, a cause-effect analysis. Agricultural development regions and agro-ecological regions have been delineated, and specific recommendations have been made for redressing the regionalimbalances in levels of agricultural development in the South Asian countries--so a planning-oriented study. The study is based on field truthing, personal communications, district-by-district data etc. The data have been presented in maps enlightening patterns and dynamics of agricultural inputs and outputs, and the cartographic work is of high quality. So far, no such in-depth study has been conducted, covering only the primary activity of the sub-continent and highlighting the green evolution experiences--so, a study related to the then and now as regards agricultural inputs and outputs. It will be a study of great relevance to the SAARC nations for planning purposes and making master plans for reducing regional inequalities in agricultural performance levels. Since this work is a pioneer attempt and is based on the field work and district-by district data covering the green revolution period (1967-68 to 1987-88), it is a work of its own kind and unique in nature. The greatest inequality in the use of agricultural inputs within the borders of South Asia is responsible for agricultural development differences. These range from the poverty in densely populated Bangladesh to agriculturally high-speed Punjab-Haryana region in Northwestern India. Moreover, South Asia includes the cold empties of the high Himalayan ranges where agricultural development has a special meaning. The agricultural face of South Asia has changed at a different rate because the diffusion of green revolution technology was not a universal scale. As a consequence, four levels of agricultural development were observed, such as: Very high level development with high speed change; High/medium level development with high/medium speed change; Low level development with low speed change, and Very low level development with very low speed change. Therefore, it is no longer desirable to write only a static geography of agricultural development of South Asia, and it is also equally important, above, all to examine, explain, identify and understand the recognisable ceaseless patterns of change in agricultural development levels.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=pCzbAAAAMAAJ&dq=Agricultural+development+in+South+Asia:+A+comparative+study+in+the+green+revolution+experiences&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Self and its Body in Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit (Toronto Studies in Philosophy)","description":"A major criticism of Hegel's philosophy is that it fails to comprehend the experience of the body. In this book, John Russon shows that there is in fact a philosophy of embodiment implicit in Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit. Russon argues that Hegel has not only taken account of the body, but has done so in a way that integrates both modern work on embodiment and the approach to the body found in ancient Greek philosophy. Although Russon approaches Hegel's Phenomenology from a contemporary standpoint, he places both this standpoint and Hegel's work within a classical tradition. Using the Aristotelian terms of 'nature' and 'habit,' Russon refers to the classical distinction between biological nature and a cultural 'second nature.' It is this second nature that constitutes, in Russon's reading of Hegel, the true embodiment of human intersubjectivity. The development of spirit, as mapped out by Hegel, is interpreted here as a process by which the self establishes for itself an embodiment in a set of social and political institutions in which it can recognize and satisfy its rational needs. Russon concludes by arguing that self-expression and self-interpretation are the ultimate needs of the human spirit, and that it is the degree to which these needs are satisfied that is the ultimate measure of the adequacy of the institutions that embody human life. This link with classicism - in itself a serious contribution to the history of philosophy -provides an excellent point of access into the Hegelian system. Russon's work, which will prove interesting reading for any Hegel scholar, provides a solid and reliable introduction to the study of Hegel.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Rxx0dMgJH4wC&dq=The+Self+and+its+Body+in+Hegel%27s+Phenomenology+of+Spirit+(Toronto+Studies+in+Philosophy)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Boy Named Boomer (Hello Reader!

The book ended with the hope that new forms of social connection might be invented in order to revive our communities. In Better Together, Putnam and longtime civic activist Lewis Feldstein describe some of the diverse locations and most compelling ways in which civic renewal is taking place today. In response to civic crises and local problems, they say, hardworking, committed people are reweaving the social fabric all across America, often in innovative ways that may turn out to be appropriate for the twenty-first century. Better Together is a book of stories about people who are building communities to solve specific problems. The examples Putnam and Feldstein describe span the country from big cities such as Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Chicago to the Los Angeles suburbs, small Mississippi and Wisconsin towns, and quiet rural areas. The projects range from the strictly local to that of the men and women of UPS, who cover the nation. Bowling Alone looked at America from a broad and general perspective. Better Together takes us into Catherine Flannery's Roxbury, Massachusetts, living room, a UPS loading dock in Greensboro, North Carolina, a Philadelphia classroom, the Portsmouth, New Hampshire, naval shipyard, and a Bay Area Web site. We meet activists driven by their visions, each of whom has chosen to succeed by building community: Mexican Americans in the Rio Grande Valley who want paved roads, running water, and decent schools; Harvard University clerical workers searching for respect and improved working conditions; Waupun, Wisconsin, schoolchildren organizing to improve safety at a local railroad crossing; and merchants in Tupelo, Mississippi, joining with farmers to improve their economic status. As the stories in Better Together demonstrate, bringing people together by building on personal relationships remains one of the most effective strategies to enhance America's social health.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qledfXzFImcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Polka Favorites: Accordion","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9TbIjwEACAAJ&dq=Polka+Favorites:+Accordion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Running with the Big Dogs: A Sled Dog Puppy Grows Up in Denali National Park, Alaska","description":"\\"Running with the Big Dogs\\" invites children of all ages to mush along with the sled dogs in the heart of Denali National Park.Share the wonder of a Denali sled dog puppy as you follow him through his first year of adventure and learning.Experience the special bond between rangers and sled dogs as they patrol to preserve the wilderness of Denali during the harsh Alaskan winter.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=5DuGnPuzqqAC&dq=Running+with+the+Big+Dogs:+A+Sled+Dog+Puppy+Grows+Up+in+Denali+National+Park,+Alaska&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hallie's Hero","description":"Jack Dakota swore his ramblin', gamblin' days wereover.

However, the stories of many black players parallel the larger struggle for civil rights. Those tales, collected here for the first time, show how teamwork on and off the field led first to acceptance, then to admiration and triumph. Swinging for the Fences is the first collection to highlight the thrilling and controversial landmarks in the history of black baseball in the North Star State. Award-winning author Steven R. Hoffbeck assembled a stellar team of writers--and baseball fanatics--to tell the great stories of black baseball's past, from establishment of the color lines to dazzling hits by black heroes that led the Twins to victory over the Cardinals in '87. Each chapter focuses on one key player, and through these windows into their lives and livelihoods, their plays and passions, readers get an intimate look at the national pastime as it has evolved over the last century and more. Featured here are Hall of Famers like Willie Mays, Roy Campanella, and Kirby Puckett and great players like Walter Ball, John Wesley Donaldson, and Bud Fowler, who, because of their race, never made the stats books. These are stories of the bonds that formed between players, of legendary moments in baseball's past, and of real people whose love of the game kept them playing against tough odds.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Sxmqc5KkhykC&dq=Swinging+for+the+Fences:+Black+Baseball+in+Minnesota&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Homesickness","description":"Bekroond met de Frank OConnor International Short Story Award, de Rooney Prize for Irish Literature en de Guardian First Book Award Jonge gasten speelt zich af in Glanbeigh, een fictief Iers provinciestadje waar de jeugd de dienst uitmaakt.

In a religious pluralistic society the other cannot be ignored, even less so when there is a familial relationship between religions.

Did Christianity spring from Judaism and, if so, when? Why did the final cut between the two take place? Did Christianity replace Judaism? If so, how can the relationship between them now be described? Before interaction between the two religions is possible, an honest and unbiased attempt to understand each other must be mutual.

Lewontin writes in this collection of essays, which began their life as CBC Radio's Massey Lectures Series for 1990: \\"Scientists do not begin life as scientists, after all, but as social beings immersed in a family, a state, a productive structure, and they view nature through a lens that has been molded by their social experience... . Science, like the Church before it, is a supremely social institution, reflecting and reinforcing the dominant values and vices of society at each historical epoch.\\" In Biology as Ideology Lewontin examines the false paths down which modern scientific ideology has led us.

Biblical, practical, and concise, The Purity Principle is a one-stop handbook for individuals, families and churches. Some people have given up on purity. Some have never tried. Bestselling author Randy Alcorn shows us why, in this culture of impurity, the stakes are so high and what we can do to experience the freedom of purity. Impurity will always destroy us; purity always leads to higher pleasures! Choose wisely.

Cyril wordt geboren als bastaardzoon van een verstoten tienermeisje. Het welgestelde echtpaar Avery adopteert hem, maar Cyril vraagt zich vaak af waarom, want zijn adoptieouders laten geen gelegenheid onbenut om hem op het hart te drukken dat hij geen echte Avery is. Hij voelt zich ook geen Avery, en hij voelt zich ook niet thuis in het katholieke naoorlogse Ierland. Pas als hij de flamboyante charmeur Julian Woodbead ontmoet, is de eerste stap naar de zoektocht van zijn identiteit gezet  een zoektocht die hem tot in Amsterdam en New York voert, in een poging het geluk en de liefde te vinden. John Boyne verbeeldt op fenomenale wijze de verlossende kracht van de menselijke geest, en laat de lezer en passant voelen hoe onwelkom de wereld kan zijn voor zoekende zielen.

He still has his mistress and his fortune, plans to divorce his wife, and leaves for Chicago to scout its possibilities for a future home. He has letters of introduction to the most influential people--a bank president named Mr. Addison, for a start. Cowperwood is presented to others--lawyers, businessmen, and judges. At this beginning not one of them knew he had been incarcerated, and he wondered if that knowledge would affect their attitude towards him. He finally confesses his recent history to Addison and decides to establish his new company in Chicago. He carefully and thoroughly scrutinizes the conditions for establishing a wealth that would be envied by powerful men and selfish women. \\"The magnetizing power of fame is great.\\" As Cowperwood climbs the glorified mountain and sets out to ultimately conquer this new world, his past foibles overcome him again--his desire for beautiful women, his acquisition of unbelievable wealth, his need to be accepted and understood and revered. His genius for social and financial manipulations fails him in politics. The ending is a philosophical overview of what has happened and what can happen to a man with a restless heart.

Fire on the Beach recovers a lost gem of American history. It tells the story of the U.S. Life-Saving Service, formed in 1871 to assure the safe passage of American and international shipping and to save lives and salvage cargo. A century ago, the adventures of the now-forgotten \\"surfmen\\" who, in crews of seven, bore the brunt of this dangerous but vital duty filled the pages of popular reading material, from Harper's to the Baltimore Sun and New York Herald. Station 17, located on the desolate beaches of Pea Island, North Carolina, housed one such unit, and Richard Etheridge -- the only black man to lead a lifesaving crew -- was its captain. A former slave and Civil War veteran, Etheridge recruited and trained a crew of African- Americans, forming the only all-black station in the nation. Although civilian attitudes toward Etheridge and his men ranged from curiosity to outrage, they figured among the most courageous surfmen in the service, performing many daring rescues. From 1880 to the closing of the station in 1947, the Pea Island crew saved scores of men, women, and children who, under other circumstances, would have considered the hands of those reaching out to help them to be of the wrong race. In 1896, when the three-masted schooner E. S. Newman beached during a hurricane, Etheridge and his men accomplished one of the most daring rescues in the annals of the Life-Saving Service. The violent conditions had rendered their equipment useless. Undaunted, the surfmen swam out to the wreck, making nine trips in all, and saved the entire crew. This incredible feat went unrecognized until 1996, when the Coast Guard posthumously awarded the crew the Gold Life-Saving Medal. The authors depict the lives of Etheridge and his crew against the backdrop of late-nineteenth-century America -- the horrors of the Civil War, the hopefulness of Reconstruction, and the long slide toward Plessy v. Ferguson that followed. Full of exploits and heroics, Fire on the Beach, like the movie Glory, illustrates yet another example of the little-known but outstanding contributions of a remarkable group of African-Americans to our country's history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9kFCX20y5jYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Selected poems (The Pocket poets series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=oQ1MswEACAAJ&dq=Selected+poems+(The+Pocket+poets+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The lollipop party;","description":"Tomas stays alone in the apartment for the first time waiting for his mother to get home; and the long and scary wait turns into a lollipop party.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=p4wkAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+lollipop+party%3B&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Way of the World.

Grounded in a critical posthumanist perspective on the purpose of education, it provides a genealogy of psychology, sociology and philosophy of childhood in which dominant figurations of child and childhood are exposed as positioning child as epistemically and ontologically inferior. Entangled throughout this book are practical and theorised examples of philosophical work with student teachers, teachers, other practitioners and children (aged 3-11) from South Africa and Britain. These engage arguments about how children are routinely marginalised, discriminated against and denied, especially when the child is also female, black, lives in poverty and whose home language is not English. The book makes a distinctive contribution to the decolonisation of childhood discourses. Underpinned by good quality picturebooks and other striking images, the book's radical proposal for transformation is to reconfigure the child as rich, resourceful and resilient through relationships with (non) human others, and explores the implications for literary and literacy education, teacher education, curriculum construction, implementation and assessment. It is essential reading for all who research, work and live with children.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FqDDCwAAQBAJ&dq=International+Children%27s+Literature:+A+special+issue+of+the+journal+Early+Child+Development+and+Care&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The President and Mom's Apple Pie","description":"When President Taft comes to town to dedicate the new flagpole, he smells something wonderful, and sets out, with the entire town in tow, to discover from where the enticing scent is coming.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=HXcz9PjfhS8C&dq=The+President+and+Mom%27s+Apple+Pie&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"PCI Express System Architecture","description":"??PCI EXPRESS is considered to be the most general purpose bus so it should appeal to a wide audience in this arena.?Today's buses are becoming more specialized to meet the needs of the particular system applications, building the need for this book.?Mindshare and their only competitor in this space, Solari, team up in this new book.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=IA-5TR1RgXQC&dq=PCI+Express+System+Architecture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Claude de Bernales, the magnificent miner: A biography","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=33jNAQAACAAJ&dq=Claude+de+Bernales,+the+magnificent+miner:+A+biography&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Space Between","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=dDLTAQAACAAJ&dq=The+Space+Between&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pronoun Music","description":"Short Fiction. These stories of Richard Cohen illuminate family life with a realism large enough to accommodate illusion. Most of these stories are about children and their parents. Some of the children are grownups taking care of their elders; others are chronologically juvenile. At the turning point of youth to age, of singleness to marriage, they fight their way out of the webs of family and self with a degree of success equal finally to their gift for belief. Sheila Weller of The New York Times has commented about Richard Cohen's first novel Domestic Tranquility that it is built on observation so minutely and constantly intelligent that one feels as intellectually engaged by it as emotionally seized.

Isolated on the U.S.-Mexico border, far from any metropolitan African-American community or literary influences, Bernice Love Wiggins, a perceptive young poet, self-published her first, apparently only, book of poetry. One of only a handful of black writers in Texas in the 1920s and 1930s, Wiggins was contemporary with Langston Hughes, Countee Cullen, and Zora Neale Hurston and was among the first female African-American poets published in the United States. Just as the Harlem movement focused on experiences of black Americans who sought relief from racism and endeavored to build communities, Tuneful Tales gives voice to the many-sided black experience in remote El Paso. Whatever Wiggins may have known of her contemporaries more than half a continent away or of the movement itself may never be clear. Disappointingly, after her move to California in the early 1930s, the trail grows cold. Yet the composed young woman who gazes so wisely, if dreamily, from her high school photographs evoked her personae so compellingly in both timbre and substance that great folklorist and critic J. Mason Brewer proclaimed her the female Paul Laurence Dunbar. Ethiopia Speaks Lynched! Somewhere in the South, the \\"Land of the Free,\\" To a very strong branch of a dogwood tree. Lynched! One of my sons, -- When the flag was in danger they answered the call I gave them black sons, ah! yes, gave them all When you came to me. And Now Goodnight I have told you tuneful tales, Gathered from the hills and vales, Wheresoever mine own people chanced to dwell. If the tales have brought you mirth, Brought more laughter to the earth, It is well.

Author Paul Copan has observed that many of these questions emerge as \\"anti-truth claims\\" that are part of today's skeptical mind-set. Christians defending their faith often hear slogans and questions such as: ? It's all relative ? Everything is one with the Divine; all else is illusion ? The Gospels contradict each other ? Why would a good God create hell? This book provides incisive answers to slogans related to truth and reality; theism, pantheism/Eastern religion, and naturalism; and doctrinal issues such as the incarnation and truth of Scripture. Each of the twenty-two chapters provides succinct answers and summary points for countering the arguments. Copan's book is accessible for all Christians who want to defend the plausibility of Christianity in the marketplace of ideas. It also includes helpful summary sections, additional resources, and additional documentation in the endnotes for review and discussion.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Gx8FsA5R17IC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Whitetail Strategies: A No-Nonsense Approach to Successful Deer Hunting","description":"Presents a guide to successful deer hunting, providing expert tips for tracking, reading deer body language, rattling, deer calling, and more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Qb5iG599DjMC&dq=Whitetail+Strategies:+A+No-Nonsense+Approach+to+Successful+Deer+Hunting&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Old Woman Who Loved to Read","description":"The old woman thought that when she moved to the country she would have plenty of time to read.

The Orphanage was created by three twenty-something visual effects veterans who wanted to make their own feature films and discovered they could do this by utilizing home computers, off the shelf software, and approaching things artistically. This guide details exactly how to do this: from planning and selecting the necessary cameras, software, and equipment, to creating specific special effects (including gunfire, Kung Fu fighting, car chases, dismemberment, and more) to editing and mixing sound and music. Its mantra is that the best, low-budget action moviemakers must visualize the end product first in order to reverse-engineer the least expensive way to get there. Readers will learn how to integrate visual effects into every aspect of filmmaking--before filming, during filming and with \\"in camera\\" shots, and with computers in postproduction. Throughout the book, the author makes specific references to and uses popular action movies (both low and big-budget) as detailed examples--including El Mariachi, La Femme Nikita, Die Hard, and Terminator 2.

The war in the Pacific)","description":"A documentary history with brief narrative introductions illustrating the evolution of civil affairs policy and practice in the Mediterranean and European theaters. Most important of all, in World War II soldiers became governors in a much broader sense than ever before so much more than was foreseen that the Army's specialized training proved scant preparation for perhaps the most important phase of their role. They became not merely the administrators of civilian life for the Army's immediate needs but at the same time the executors and at times even, by force of circumstances, the proposers of national and international political policy. This broader role arose from the fact that in World War II the Allies strove to realize from the very beginning of occupation political aims that had usually not been implemented during war or, if during war at all, not until active hostilities had ended. Thus, in enemy countries civil affairs officials were immediately to extirpate totalitarian governmental and economic systems, in liberated countries they were as soon as possible to aid in restoring indigenous systems and authorities, and in both types of countries they were to make an all-out effort to effect gradual transition toward the envisaged postwar national and international order.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=zHDHMBOYbHwC&dq=Guadalcanal:+The+first+offensive+(United+States+Army+in+World+War+II.+The+war+in+the+Pacific)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ancient Rome: City Planning and Administration","description":"Rome was a huge city.

Cattle are the most numerous of the ruminant species in the tropics and provide the largest quantity of animal food products. More than one-third of the world's cattle are found in the tropics. Disease is the major factor which prohibits full utilization of these regions for cattle production. Various infectious and transmissible viral, rick ettsial, bacterial, and particularly protozoan and helminthic diseases, are widespread in the tropics and exert a heavy toll on the existing cattle industry there. This uncontrolled disease situation also discourages investment in cattle industries by private and government sectors. In Africa alone, it is estimated that 125 million head of cattle could be accommodated in the tropical rainbelt if the disease and other animal husbandry factors could be resolved. The potential of efficient cattle production under more favorable conditions prompted various international agencies to establish a multi million dollar International Laboratory for Research in Animal Diseases (lLRAD) in Nairobi, Kenya, Africa. In South America, principal sites for raising cattle are shifting to the savannah lands because the more fertile soils are being used for crop produc tion, however, in the savannahs also, disease remains the most powerful deterrent in implementing the cattle industry.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YGZsCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Global Media Economics: Commercialization, Concentration, and Integration of World Media Markets","description":"This text studies the increasing international marketplace for media companies, exploring the mergers and acquisitions, the impact of technology, and the implications of changing regulatory policies and a growing world economy that are the most salient features of this scene.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=PwiKQgAACAAJ&dq=Global+Media+Economics:+Commercialization,+Concentration,+and+Integration+of+World+Media+Markets&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Handbook of Acoustics","description":"The most complete and current guide to architectural acoustics principles and practices Design and construct audiophile-quality sonic environments of all sizes--from home theaters and project studios to large-scale recording studios.

Waar gaat het om in onze relatie met God? David Hudson is een gevierd predikant. Zijn pakkende preken trekken grote menigten mensen naar de kerk. Stephen Decker is architect en lid van Davids gemeente. Beide mannen hebben dezelfde droom: een kerk te bouwen tot eer van God. Wanneer hun kerk bij legaat een stuk land krijgt, lijkt deze droom verwezenlijkt te kunnen worden. De kerkenraad besluit het land te verkopen, aangezien het in een minder aantrekkelijke buurt ligt. Met de opbrengt wordt een ander perceel in een rijker buitenwijk gekocht, waar een nieuwe kerk moet verrijzen. Een spreker als David verdient immers een groot gebouw. Ondertussen bezoeken steeds meer mensen de diensten, aangetrokken door de krachtige preken van David en de professionele muziek. Het geld stroomt binnen; de bouwplannen worden voortdurend uitgebreid. Daardoor verandert echter ook de gerichtheid van de gemeente.

The Black course at the public golf club in Bethpage, New York, has long had a mythic status among golfers. Designed by legendary course architect A. W. Tillinghast in 1936, it is known as a work of genius-with long fairways, gorgeous vistas, and roughs and bunkers that stymie all but the very best golfers. It is a course where any player can compete, but its cult reputation means that golfers often have to camp overnight in the parking lot to get a tee time the next day. The 2002 U.S. Open at Bethpage Black was the first time in history that golf's greatest championship had been held at a true public course. Open is the full drama of that championship, from the moment that officials first considered holding it there until the last putt rolled in at dusk on Sunday. Along the way, John Feinstein reveals the full glory of golf as it's never been explored before. He digs deep to find out what it really takes to make golf's most famous event worthy of the champions who compete in it. He tells the remarkable story of the artisans who transformed the Black from a downtrodden and rough-around-the-edges public course to one that top pros hailed as \\"unbelievable\\" and \\"the toughest par-70 I've ever played in my life.\\" He also tracks the drama of the masters who battled for supremacy at the Black-Tiger Woods, Sergio Garcia, Nick Faldo, Phil Mickelson, Jeff Maggert-to show how true champions respond to the toughest conditions. Open is the story of people who devote their entire lives to golf, both behind the scenes and inside the ropes. Their struggles and exhilarations as they master the monster known as Bethpage Black make for a story every golf lover will want to read again and again.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ffM5AQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Aerial: The Art of Photography from the Sky","description":"Presents a collection of aerial photographs showing a variety of sights from around the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=gs9TAAAAMAAJ&dq=Aerial:+The+Art+of+Photography+from+the+Sky&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Portrait of Cats","description":"Every cat knows how to charm.

It begins in the twilight years of the Tsarist empire in the idyllic setting of the family s country home at Babushkino, and describes a world which is destroyed by war, revolution and Stalin s terror, and ends with the fall of communism and the beginning of a new Russia of gangsters and crony-capitalism. At the age of 90, Irina Uspenskaya is the last surviving witness of these events. In her Moscow apartment, while her young relative Slavochka and his friends in  the International Syndicate  aspire to become successful drug dealers, Irina collects the letters and diaries of her parents  generation and sets down the tale of what happened to them all. In turn she describes the doomed marriage of her father Nikolai and her mother Xenia, who love but never understand each other; her idealistic aunt Adalia, who marries the sinister Grodsky; her disreputable uncle Alexander and his feisty wife Tatiana. These and a host of other colourful characters populate the story and we see their world through their eyes and understand it through their thoughts and writings. Our guide, Irina is wry, funny, insightful and humane. Born with a disability, she views events through detached yet sympathetic eyes and reflects on her own history and her unrequited love for a boy she met as a little girl and the family and children she will never have. Irina s Story is told with verve, compassion and a command of the sweep of Russian history. It is at times funny, romantic, tragic and appalling, but suffused throughout with deep humanity.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gSd1DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rocks and Minerals (National Audubon Society First Field Guides)","description":"Displays rocks, minerals, variant forms, and major gemstones","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=TckSAQAAIAAJ&dq=Rocks+and+Minerals+(National+Audubon+Society+First+Field+Guides)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sexual Subversions: Three French Feminists","description":"Sexual Subversions introduces the works of three well known, if not well-read, French feminists: Julia Kristeva, Luce Irigaray and Micele Le Doeuff. It provides a map of an area where there are few detailed discussion of the achievements of these difficult, yet immensely rewarding, writers. In doing so, this overview raises issues of general relevance to feminist research: it participates in debates around the nature of feminist theory, the relations feminist intellectuals have to male dominated knowledges, and the strategies appropriate for developing non patriarchal, autonomous or woman-centred knowledges. No book in French feminists would be complete without including the contributions of Kristeva and Irigaray. The inclusion of Le Deouff's work, which brings a different perspective to bear on the question of sexual difference, provides a counterbalance to literary appropriations of French feminism by Anglo-American readerships. Kristeva, Irigaray and Le Deouff are the focal points of this study, precisely because each highlights the differences of the others, revealing the frameworks to which the others are committed. Nevertheless, while these writers do not present a common political or theoretical position or form a school, each addresses the question of women's autonomy from male definition, affirms the sexual specificity of women, seeks out a femininity women can use to question the patriarchal norms and ideals of femininity and rejects the preordained positions patriarchy allots to women.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cW76DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Six Sigma Way: How GE, Motorola, and Other Top Companies are Honing Their Performance","description":"An implementation blueprint for SIX SIGMA! \\"The Six Sigma Way demystifies Six Sigma with a real-world 'how-to 'guide.

Published when Studs Terkel was ninety-one years old, this astonishing oral history tackles one of the famed journalist s most elusive subjects: Hope. Where does it come from? What are its essential qualities? How do we sustain it in the darkest of times? An alternative, more personal chronicle of the  American century,  Hope Dies Last is a testament to the indefatigable spirit that Studs has always embodied, and an inheritance for those who, by taking a stand, are making concrete the dreams of today. A former death row inmate who served nearly twenty years for a crime he did not commit discusses his never-ending fight for justice. Tom Hayden, author of The Port Huron Statement, contemplates the legacy of 1960s student activism. Liberal economist John Kenneth Galbraith reflects on the enduring problem of corporate malfeasance. From a doctor who teaches his young students compassion to the retired brigadier general who flew the Enola Gay over Hiroshima, these interviews tell us much about the power of the American dream and the force of individuals who advocate for a better world. With grace and warmth, Terkel s subjects express their secret hopes and dreams. Taken together, this collection of interviews tells an inspiring story of optimism and persistence, told in voices that resonate with the eloquence of conviction.  The value of Hope Dies Last lies not in what it teaches readers about its narrow subject, but in the fascinating stories it reveals, and the insight it allows into the vast range of human experience.

Interpretations of war as driven by politics and state rationale, formulated most importantly by the 19th century practitioner Carl von Clausewitz, have received strong criticism. Political explanations have been said to fall short in explaining conflicts in the Balkans, Africa, Asia and the attacks of 11 September 2001 in the United States. This book re-evaluates these criticisms not only by scrutinising Clausewitz's arguments and their applicability, but also by a careful reading of the criticism itself. In doing so, it presents empirical evidence on the basis of several case studies, addressing various aspects of modern war, such as the actors, conduct and purposes of war.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=LrBK0BkAIQcC&dq=On+the+Nature+of+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Good Faith and Truthful Ignorance: A Case of Transatlantic Bigamy","description":"Good Faith and Truthful Ignorance uncovers from history the fascinating and strange story of Spanish explorer Francisco Noguerol de Ulloa. in 1556, accompanied by his second wife, Francisco returned to his home in Spain after a profitable twenty-year sojourn in the new world of Peru. However, unlike most other rich conquistadores who returned to the land of their birth, Francisco was not allowed to settle into a life of leisure. Instead, he was charged with bigamy and illegal shipment of silver, was arrested and imprisoned. Francisco s first wife (thought long dead) had filed suit in Spain against her renegade husband. So begins the labyrinthine legal tale and engrossing drama of an explorer and his two wives, skillfully reconstructed through the expert and original archival research of Alexandra Parma Cook and Noble David Cook. Drawing on the remarkable records from the trial, the narrative of Francisco s adventures provides a window into daily life in sixteenth-century Spain, as well as the mentalit  and experience of conquest and settlement of the New World. Told from the point of view of the conquerors, Francisco s story reveals not only the lives of the middle class and minor nobility but also much about those at the lower rungs of the social order and relations between the sexes. In the tradition of Carlo Ginzberg s The Cheese and the Worms and Natalie Zemon Davis  The Return of Martin Guerre, Good Faith and Truthful Ignorance illuminates an historical period the world of sixteenth-century Spain and Peru through the wonderful and unusual story of one man and his two wives.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1rMuGrUc6NYC&dq=Good+Faith+and+Truthful+Ignorance:+A+Case+of+Transatlantic+Bigamy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Drawing & Painting Fantasy Beasts: Bring to Life the Creatures and Monsters of Other Realms","description":"Offers step-by-step instructions for completing twenty-seven colored pencil drawing projects, offering advice on appropriate supplies, color theory, and basic techniques in the medium.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=0HBgRBObbh8C&dq=Drawing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly (Modern Classics)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-iNcvgEACAAJ&dq=Almayer%27s+Folly+(Modern+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Musical Acoustics","description":"Musical acoustics presents a unique opportunity to see science and art working together.

American Apartheid shows how the black ghetto was created by whites during the first half of the twentieth century in order to isolate growing urban black populations. It goes on to show that, despite the Fair Housing Act of 1968, segregation is perpetuated today through an interlocking set of individual actions, institutional practices, and governmental policies. In some urban areas the degree of black segregation is so intense and occurs in so many dimensions simultaneously that it amounts to  hypersegregation.  Douglas Massey and Nancy Denton demonstrate that this systematic segregation of African Americans leads inexorably to the creation of underclass communities during periods of economic downturn. Under conditions of extreme segregation, any increase in the overall rate of black poverty yields a marked increase in the geographic concentration of indigence and the deterioration of social and economic conditions in black communities. As ghetto residents adapt to this increasingly harsh environment under a climate of racial isolation, they evolve attitudes, behaviors, and practices that further marginalize their neighborhoods and undermine their chances of success in mainstream American society. This book is a sober challenge to those who argue that race is of declining significance in the United States today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=S2zsDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Agile Manager's Guide to Influencing People","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=hoG8vQEACAAJ&dq=The+Agile+Manager%27s+Guide+to+Influencing+People&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The ABC's of Choosing a Good Wife: How to find & marry a great girl","description":"Every Man Should Read This Book to Help Him Make the Greatest Decision of His Life!

Yet they have been attacked as unsafe and unsatisfactory, and critics have argued that they should be banned or restricted. But to Allan Wallis, the mobile home embodies many of the most fundamental American ideals of home and community. In Wheel Estate, Allan Wallis offers a lively and informative history of this much-maligned form of housing over six decades. He begins with the travel trailers of the late 1920s and 1930s, describing models that were built like yachts or unfolded like Polaroid cameras. With the Second World War, Wallis writes, the industry mushroomed as trailers became homes for thousands of defense workers; he vividly portrays the communities they lived in and the trailer houses that were turned out under government contract. After the war, severe housing shortages sustained demand for trailers as year-round housing. The industry responded with new models--now called mobile homes--that tried to strike a balance between house and vehicle, even as owners built their own often fanciful additions (including one mobile home complete with Egyptian pylons). The results, illustrated in Wheel Estate, were sometimes comic, but they revealed what Americans thought their housing ought to look like. The need for mobile homes today has only grown as the housing crisis continues to deepen. Wallis reviews recent efforts to remove barriers against the use of manufactured housing and to assure construction quality, and he discusses how some of these efforts have backfired, making mobile homes less affordable. Wallis argues that, despite moves to restrict mobile homes, they remain a useful and distinctively American form of housing. This colorful account, extensively illustrated with period photographs and vivid portraits of the people who live in mobile homes and the industry pioneers who designed and built them, will inform and amuse anyone curious about this American phenomenon.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tEbrAAAAMAAJ&dq=Caravaggio+(Rizzoli+Quadrifolio)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Church in History","description":"Delve into the exciting narrative that is the story of the Church's own history.

I guess this line will open the doors of hope for you. And I'm not just bragging. It sure is one of the most difficult mediums to paint with and that was exactly the challenge I accepted when I started my Arts education. I thought, how difficult can it really be? I have realized over the time that everything in this world is difficult only until you learn it. If you try, you do get a grasp of it sooner or later. One very important thing is that you find someone who can teach you, and can teach you well. Here I hope I will be able to transfer as much knowledge as I can in a possibly detailed manner. If you were in a class, I would be open to questions. But that is not the case in our situation, so I want to make sure that by the time you finish this book, you won't have any questions left. I am keeping the struggles in my mind, that I made just to learn this technique and how I wished I could get one person or a single book that could be my fairy god mother and teach me everything I needed to know in a wave of a wand. That didn't happen, of course. But I did learn and now that I know, I want to transfer my knowledge to you. Why is water color one of the difficult materials? Everybody has their own reasons; the only reason that I am going to tell you is that they are a bit hard to control. Don't worry! Don't be taken aback. I'm here to teach you. This book contains activities by which you will learn to control your color, brush strokes, and many other things. I assure you that you have made the best choice. You will not only learn to paint flowers and many other things that your heart desires because you will learn to use your brush and get familiar with different materials and techniques. I would like to wish you best of luck and hope that your, and my hard work will pay in the form of you being as good as me or even better.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=b2WRjwEACAAJ&dq=How+to+Paint+Water&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"JSTL in Action","description":"Introducing Web page authors and programmers to the JSP Standard Tag Library (JSTL), this guide covers all features of the JSTL 1.0 standard.

Electrical Nutrition outlines the authors' revolutionary theories on health and nutrition based on an electrical model. Everything we think, feel, eat, and do triggers electrical responses in our bodies. Each of our cells is electrically charged, and therefore the electrical availability of what we eat has a profound effect on our health, vitality, and well-being. Instead of focusing on the chemical reactions that occur in every system of the human body, the authors contend that there is a simultaneous electrical reaction that has an equally, if not even more, important impact on our ability to digest and benefit from the food we consume. Any interruption to the flow of the body's natural electrical circuitry will have a negative effect on a cellular level which, in turn, will promote disease. Electrical Nutrition offers a practical program that includes menu plans and a listing of the best \\"electrically available\\" foods-a plan that will dramatically increase stamina, vitality, and even libido. By eliminating foods that are \\"electrically dead,\\" we can rid the body of toxins that promote obesity and a host of illnesses, from chronic fatigue to heart disease, while boosting the body's natural energy and immune function.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=H-A77b4bRtoC&dq=Electrical+Nutrition:+A+Revolutionary+Approach+to+Eating+That+Awakens+the+Body%27s+Electrical+Energy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"This new ocean : a history of Project Mercury (SuDoc NAS 1.21:4201)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Buffy contre les vampires, tome 28 : La Tueuse perdue - Livre 4 \\"Bienvenue en Enfer\\" (French Edition)","description":"Het eerste deel van een nieuwe, onweerstaanbare 9+-serie.

Among the most empowering of the forgotten elements are references to a science with the power to bring everlasting healing to our bodies and initiate an unprecedented era of peace and cooperation between governments and nations. In his groundbreaking new book, The Isaiah Effect, Gregg Braden turns to the Isaiah Scroll, perhaps the most important of the Dead Sea Scrolls discovered in 1946, to offer insight into a powerful form of ancient prayer. In The Isaiah Effect, Braden, author of Awakening to Zero Point and Walking Between the Worlds, combines research in quantum physics with the works of the prophet Isaiah and the ancient Essenes. He demonstrates how prophecies of global catastrophe and suffering may only represent future possibilities, rather than forecast impending doom, and that we have the power to influence those possibilities. In addition to describing multiple futures, the Isaiah texts take us one step further, clearly describing the science of how we choose our futures. Tracing key words of Isaiah's text back to their original language, we discover how he taught a mode of prayer that was lost to the West during Biblical editing in the fourth century. Braden offers detailed accounts of how elements of this mode of prayer have been applied in a variety of situations, ranging from healing life-threatening conditions to entire villages using collective prayer to prevail during the 1998 fires in southern Peru. In each instance, the correlation between the offering of the prayer and a shift of the events in question was beyond coincidence--the prayers had measurable effects! As modern science continues to validate a relationship between our outer and inner worlds, it becomes more likely that a forgotten bridge links the world of our prayers with that of our experience. Each time we engage ourselves, our loved ones, and our communities with Isaiah's life-affirming message of hope, we secure nothing less than our future and the future of the only home we know.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=858MnPizsnkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE WORLD OF PRAYER: VOL.I. DAILY PRAYERS AND VOL.

Exploring the nebulous realms of religious experience and the sense of time, Remembering the Future charts the ways that the experience of time is shaped by the traditions of Judaism and Christianity and experienced within their ritual practices. Through comparative explorations of traditional Jewish and Christian understandings of time, contemporary oral testimonies, and discussions of the work of select twentieth-century Jewish and Christian thinkers, this book maps the temporal landscapes of the religious imagination. Maintaining that the sense of time is integral to Jewish and Christian religious experience, Remembering the Future makes a notable contribution to interreligious studies and liturgical studies. It sheds light on essential aspects of religious experience and finds that the intimacy of the experience of time grants it the capacity to communicate across religious boundaries, subtly transgressing obstacles to interreligious understanding.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=TCk_CwAAQBAJ&dq=THE+WORLD+OF+PRAYER:+VOL.I.+DAILY+PRAYERS+AND+VOL.+II+SABBATH+AND+FESTIVAL+PRAYERS.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"80 Years of Moto Guzzi Motorcycles","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=B0PuAQAACAAJ&dq=80+Years+of+Moto+Guzzi+Motorcycles&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Collector's Encyclopedia of Glass Candlesticks","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ZkbePAAACAAJ&dq=The+Collector%27s+Encyclopedia+of+Glass+Candlesticks&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The betrothed: A tale of the Crusaders (The illustrated Waverley novels)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=r16vtQEACAAJ&dq=The+betrothed:+A+tale+of+the+Crusaders+(The+illustrated+Waverley+novels)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Grieving the Loss of a Loved One","description":"Pain, loss, and confusion can transform into healing and peace when you take the journey with an experienced grief counselor who experienced this pain first-hand when it struck her own family.

Sixteen years in the making, Asif Siddiqi's amazingly detailed book provides a kaleidoscopic view of the technical and political evolution of Soviet missile and space projects. . . . a veritable gold-mind of factual information.\\"--Air Power History \\"An extraordinary volume. . . . This is not simply an account of one side of the space race. It is nothing less than the first full-scale, detailed explanation of how and why the Soviet Union led the world into space. It belongs on the shelf of every historian with an interest in flight, technology and politics, the Cold War, or any one of a score of related topics.\\"--The Public Historian \\"No space buff's library will be complete without this book. Readers will marvel at the complex interactions between design bureaus, and will enjoy getting to know the people behind the failed Soviet effort--a vital step toward putting Apollo's victory in context.\\"--Smithsonian Air and Space \\"Absolutely mandatory on the bookshelf of anyone interested in space.\\"--Encyclopedia Astronautica First published by NASA in 2000 as Challenge to Apollo, these two volumes are the first comprehensive history of the Soviet-manned space programs covering a period of thirty years, from the end of World War II, when the Soviets captured German rocket technology, to the collapse of their moon program in the mid-1970s. The spectacular Soviet successes of Sputnik--the first Earth satellite (1957) and Yuri Gagarin--the first man in space (1961) shocked U.S. leaders and prompted President John F. Kennedy to set the goal of landing a man on the moon before the end of the 1960s. The moon race culminated with the historic landing of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the moon in 1969 (coincidentally the first Soviet unmanned moon probe crashed on its surface while the American astronauts were at Tranquility Base). The epic story of the Soviet space program remained shrouded in secrecy until the unprecedented opening of top secret documents. Based almost entirely on these Russian-language sources and numerous interviews with veterans, Siddiqi's book breaks through the rumors, hearsay, and speculation that characterized books on the Soviet space program published during the Cold War years. Supplementing the text with dozens of previously classified photographs, he weaves together the technical, political, and personal history of the major Soviet space programs, providing the other side of the history of human space flight. Asif A. Siddiqi is a Ph.D. candidate in history at Carnegie Mellon University.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2rJ4QgAACAAJ&dq=The+Soviet+Space+Race+with+Apollo&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Just Wanted to Say Hi","description":"Now that Connor Cohen is dead, Silas Cohen is free to live the life he wants.

Comprehensive and easy to use, it will inform, empower, and encourage you. Just as William J. Bennett's The Book of Virtues has helped millions of Americans teach young people about character, The Educated Child delivers what you need to take control. With coauthors Chester E. Finn, Jr., and John T. E. Cribb, Jr., former Secretary of Education Bennett provides the indispensable guide. Championing a clear \\"back-to-basics\\" curriculum that will resonate with parents and teachers tired of fads and jargon, The Educated Child supplies an educational road map from earliest childhood to the threshold of high school. It gives parents hundreds of practical suggestions for helping each child succeed while showing what to look for in a good school and what to watch out for in a weak one. The Educated Child places you squarely at the center of your young one's academic career and takes a no-nonsense view of your responsibilities. It empowers you as mothers and fathers, enabling you to reclaim what has been appropriated by \\"experts\\" and the education establishment. It out-lines questions you will want to ask, then explains the answers -- or non-answers -- you will be given. No longer will you feel powerless before the education \\"system.\\" The tools and advice in this guide put the power where it belongs -- in the hands of those who know and love their children best. Using excerpts from E. D. Hirsch's Core Knowledge Sequence, The Educated Child sets forth a state-of-the art curriculum from kindergarten through eighth grade that you can use to monitor what is and isn't being taught in your school. It outlines how you can help teachers ensure that your child masters the most important skills and knowledge. It takes on today's education controversies from phonics to school choice, from outcomes-based education to teaching values, from the education of gifted children to the needs of the disabled. Because much of a youngster's education takes place outside the school, The Educated Child also distills the essential information you need to prepare children for kindergarten and explains to the parents of older students how to deal with such challenges as television, drugs, and sex. If you seek high standards and solid, time-tested content for the child you care so much about, if you want the unvarnished truth about what parents and schools must do, The Educated Child is the one book you need on your shelf.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HJVAcIjPDjUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"With Cochrane the Dauntless","description":"Patrick O'Brian, C.S.

Grant","description":"The underappreciated presidency of the military man who won the Civil War and then had to win the peace as well As a general, Ulysses S. Grant is routinely described in glowing terms-the man who turned the tide of the Civil War, who accepted Lee's surrender at Appomattox, and who had the stomach to see the war through to final victory. But his presidency is another matter-the most common word used to characterize it is \\"scandal.\\" Grant is routinely portrayed as a man out of his depth, whose trusting nature and hands-off management style opened the federal coffers to unprecedented plunder. But that caricature does not do justice to the realities of Grant's term in office, as Josiah Bunting III shows in this provocative assessment of our eighteenth president. Grant came to Washington in 1869 to lead a capital and a country still bitterly divided by four years of civil war. His predecessor, Andrew Johnson, had been impeached and nearly driven from office, and the radical Republicans in Congress were intent on imposing harsh conditions on the Southern states before allowing them back into the Union. Grant made it his priority to forge the states into a single nation, and Bunting shows that despite the troubles that characterized Grant's terms in office, he was able to accomplish this most important task-very often through the skillful use of his own popularity with the American people. Grant was indeed a military man of the highest order, and he was a better president than he is often given credit for.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QPj_oICROTcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Along Came Mary : A Bad Girl Creek Novel","description":"USA Today called Jo-Ann Mapson's national bestseller, Bad Girl Creek, \\"a valentine to oceans of good women who survive bad beginnings and worse men.\\" Now the author, hailed as \\"one of the most gifted writers of the contemporary urban West\\" (Los Angeles Times), brings back the hard-luck women of her acclaimed previous novel -- and introduces another indelible character into their midst. \\"Me, I need a map to tell which town I'm in.

Maddy's journey takes her across the South -- singing in and winning one karaoke contest after another -- and inexorably closer to a dreaded showdown with her past. In Oklahoma City, she meets Rick, a journalist haunted by his own ghosts. After he loses his job, he travels to his childhood home to set up camp. When he first runs into Maddy, she gives him the cold shoulder. But he's charming, and persistent, and before Maddy knows it she's got a travel companion and a new lover (with an all-too-familiar set of tricks). Their travels will ultimately bring them to Bad Girl Creek, where the ladies know him as \\"Rotten Rick\\" -- because he broke Nance's heart -- and where the waters have already been troubled.

This story had haunted Lewis all his life, because he realized that some of the main characters' actions were illogical. As a consequence, his retelling of the story is characterized by a highly developed character, the narrator, with the reader being drawn into her reasoning and her emotions. This was his last novel, and he considered it his most mature, written in conjunction with his wife, Joy Davidman. The first part of the book is written from the perspective of Psyche's older sister Orual, as an accusation against the gods. The story is set in the fictive kingdom of Glome, a primitive city-state whose people have occasional contact with civilized Hellenistic Greece. In the second part of the book, the narrator undergoes a change of mindset (Lewis would use the term conversion) and understands that her initial accusation was tainted by her own failings and shortcomings, and that the gods are lovingly present in humans' lives. Clive Staples Lewis (1898-1963) was a British novelist, poet, academic, medievalist, lay theologian and Christian apologist. He is best known for his fictional work, especially The Screwtape Letters, The Chronicles of Narnia, and The Space Trilogy, and for his non-fiction Christian apologetics, such as Mere Christianity, Miracles, and The Problem of Pain.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=G3VODwAAQBAJ&dq=Till+We+Have+Faces:+A+Myth+Retold&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mossad: La Historia Secreta / Gideon's Spies (Spanish Edition)","description":"Gabriel Allon restaureert in het Vaticaan een Caravaggio.

In this article, the author defines the whole procreation/sexual nexus as one of man, woman, and child, a nexus running through all things at all times from alpha to omega. Author Bio: Christopher Alan Anderson (1950 - ) received the basis of his education from the University of Science and Philosophy, Swannanoa, Waynesboro, Virginia. He resides in the transcendental/romantic tradition, that vein of spiritual creativity of the philosopher and poet. His quest has been to define and express an eternal romantic reality from which a man and a woman could together stand in their difference and create a living universe of procreative love. Mr. Anderson began these writings in 1971. The first writings were published in 1985. On a personal note, when Mr. Anderson was asked to describe the writings and what he felt their message was he responded, \\"Spiritual procreation. Mankind has yet to distinguish the two sexes on the spiritual level. In this failure lies the root of our problems and why we cannot yet touch the eternal together. The message of man and woman balance brings each of us together in love with our eternal other half right now.\\" Keywords: Man and Woman Balance, Relationships, Procreation, Spirituality, Love, Metaphysics, Eternal, Creation, Sexuality, & Soul.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=etTEjejBpAgC&dq=Man+and+woman+and+child&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Observational Before-After Studies in Road Safety","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1SdRswEACAAJ&dq=Observational+Before-After+Studies+in+Road+Safety&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A simple story (The British novelists)","description":"After its publication in early 1791, A Simple Story was widely read in England and abroad, going into a second edition in March of the same year. The novel s young heroine, Miss Milner, scandalously declares herself in love with her guardian, Dorriforth, a Catholic priest. Dorriforth returns her love and is released from his vows. Though the pair go on to marry, the second half of the novel reveals the disastrous and far-reaching consequences of Miss Milner s subsequent adulterous affair.

According to the brilliant trend analyst and journalist Pamela Paul,  It s easy to conclude that the starter marriage trend bodes ill for the state of marriage. After all, we re getting married, screwing it up, and divorcing a practice that certainly isn t strengthening our sense of trust, family, or commitment. But though starter marriages seem like a grim prospect, there is also an upside. For one thing, if people are going to divorce, better to do so after a brief marriage in which no children suffer the consequences.  But are there other consequences of starter marriages? And what causes these marriages to fail in the first place? In today s matrimania culture, weddings, marriage, and family are clearly goals to which most young Americans aspire. Why are today s twenty- and thirtysomethings the first children-of-divorce generation so eager to get married, and so prone to failure? Are Americans today destined to jump in and out of marriage? At a time when marriage at age twenty-five can mean a sixty-year active commitment, could  serial marriages  be the wave of the future? Drawing on more than sixty interviews with starter marriage veterans and on exhaustive re-search, Pamela Paul explores these questions, putting the issues into social and cultural perspective. She looks at the hopes and motivations of couples marrying today, and examines the conflict between our cultural conception of marriage and the society surrounding it. Most important, this lively and engaging narrative examines what the starter marriage trend means for the future of matrimony in this country how and why we ll continue to marry in the twenty-first century.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XdqHcBT0KKkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nature in downland, (The collected works of W.H.

Gazing upon someone or oneself was treated as a path to philosophical self-knowledge, but the question of tactility introduced an erotic element as well. In The Mirror of the Self, Shadi Bartsch asserts that these links among vision, sexuality, and self-knowledge are key to the classical understanding of the self. Weaving together literary theory, philosophy, and social history, Bartsch traces this complex notion of self from Plato s Greece to Seneca s Rome. She starts by showing how ancient authors envisioned the mirror as both a tool for ethical self-improvement and, paradoxically, a sign of erotic self-indulgence. Her reading of the Phaedrus, for example, demonstrates that the mirroring gaze in Plato, because of its sexual possibilities, could not be adopted by Roman philosophers and their students. Bartsch goes on to examine the Roman treatment of the ethical and sexual gaze, and she traces how self-knowledge, the philosopher s body, and the performance of virtue all played a role in shaping the Roman understanding of the nature of selfhood. Culminating in a profoundly original reading of Medea, The Mirror of the Self illustrates how Seneca, in his Stoic quest for self-knowledge, embodies the Roman view, marking a new point in human thought about self-perception. Bartsch leads readers on a journey that unveils divided selves, moral hypocrisy, and lustful Stoics and offers fresh insights about seminal works. At once sexy and philosophical, The Mirror of the Self will be required reading for classicists, philosophers, and anthropologists alike.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=clR6CQZW_W0C&dq=Self-Knowledge+and+the+Self&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Monsieur Dupin,: The detective tales of Edgar Allan Poe;","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=HotWGQAACAAJ&dq=Monsieur+Dupin,:+The+detective+tales+of+Edgar+Allan+Poe%3B&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Getting the part - Thirty-Three Professional Casting Directors Tell You How to Get Work in Theater, Films, and TV (Softcover)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9pokws1EF6kC&dq=Getting+the+part+-+Thirty-Three+Professional+Casting+Directors+Tell+You+How+to+Get+Work+in+Theater,+Films,+and+TV+(Softcover)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"2006 Gulf Coast Reconstruction Estimator (Gulf Coast Reconstruction Estimator W/CD)","description":"Includes compact disc with all cost estimates with free monthly updates on the web and automatic all during 2006.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=KdrjMheaAXoC&dq=2006+Gulf+Coast+Reconstruction+Estimator+(Gulf+Coast+Reconstruction+Estimator+W/CD)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Thing Of Beauty","description":"LONGLISTED FOR THE ANGLO-HELLENIC LEAGUE RUNCIMAN AWARD 2022  Peter Fiennes s road trip around Greece [is] engagingly described  Mary Beard, TLS  Fiennes is a brilliant and generous guide through Greece  Observer What do the Greek myths mean to us today?

Observers have been used in selected industries for years, but most books explain them with complex mathematics. Observers in Control Systems uses intuitive discussion, software experiments, and supporting analysis to explain the advantages and disadvantages of observers. If you are working in controls and want to improve your control systems, observers could be the technology you need and this book will give you a clear, thorough explanation of how they work and how to use them. Control systems and devices have become the most essential part of nearly all mechanical systems, machines, devices and manufacturing systems throughout the world. Increasingly the efficiency of production, the reliability of output and increased energy savings are a direct result of the quality and deployment of the control system. A modern and essential tool within the engineer's kit is the Observer which helps improve the performance and reduce the cost of these systems. George Ellis is the author of the highly successful Control System Design Guide (Second Edition). Unlike most controls books, which are written by control theorists and academics, Ellis is a leading engineer, designer, author and lecturer working in industry directly with the users of industrial motion control systems. Observers in Control Systems is written for all professional engineers and is designed to be utilized without an in-depth background in control theory. This is a \\"real-world\\" book which will demonstrate how observers work and how they can improve your control system. It also shows how observers operate when conditions are not ideal and teaches the reader how to quickly tune an observer in a working system. Software Available online: A free updated and enhanced version of the author's popular Visual ModelQ allows the reader to practice the concepts with Visual ModelQ models on a PC. Based on a virtual laboratory, all key topics are demonstrated with more than twenty control system models. The models are written in Visual ModelQ ,and are available on the Internet to every reader with a PC. Teaches observers and Kalman filters from an intuitive perspective Explains how to reduce control system susceptibility to noise Shows how to design an adaptive controller based on estimating parameter variation using observers Shows how to improve a control system's ability to reject disturbances Key topics are demonstrated with PC-based models of control systems.

Shaping Seattle Architecture celebrates a wide range of people who helped form the region's built environment. It provides updated information about many of the architects and firms profiled in the first edition. Four individuals newly included in this second edition are Edwin J. Ivey, a leading residential designer; Fred Bassetti, an important contributor to Northwest regional modernism; L. Jane Hastings, one of the region s foremost women in architecture; and Richard Haag, founder of the landscape architecture program at the University of Washington and designer of Gas Works Park and the Bloedel Reserve.

During that time, there has been considerable interest in Shakespeare's late work in the theatre, and several notable productions have demonstrated the powerful impact of Cymbeline. Based firmly on Roger Warren's extensive experience of the play in rehearsal and performance, this edition shows how Shakespeare draws upon a wide range of sources to create a self-sufficient dramatic universe, combining virtuoso theatrical and poetic means to present a story of a marriage imperilled by mistrust and painfully rebuilt through the physical and spiritual journeys undertaken by the heroine and hero, set in a context of international conflict. A full and detailed commentary pays close attention to the play's complex, evocative language. ABOUT THE SERIES: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, helpful notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=qekOAQAAMAAJ&dq=Cymbeline+(Oxford+Shakespeare)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cucina Piemontese: Cooking from Italy's Piedmont","description":"Cucina Piemontese includes recipes for more than 95 Piemontese dishes, many of them from the author's family in Piedmont.

I am very happy that this book exists.\\" -- Fran?ois Truffaut Howard Hawks (1896--1977) is often credited as being the most versatile of all of the great American directors, having worked with equal ease in screwball comedies, westerns, gangster movies, musicals, and adventure films. He directed an impressive number of Hollywood's greatest stars -- including Humphrey Bogart, Cary Grant, John Wayne, Lauren Bacall, Rosalind Russell, and Marilyn Monroe -- and some of his most celebrated films include Scarface (1932), Bringing Up Baby (1938), The Big Sleep (1946), Red River (1948), Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953), and Rio Bravo (1959). Hawks on Hawks draws on interviews that author Joseph McBride conducted with the director over the course of seven years, giving rare insight into Hawks's artistic philosophy, his relationships with the stars, and his position in an industry that was rapidly changing. In its new edition, this classic book is both an account of the film legend's life and work and a guidebook on how to make movies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ccDDAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elbowing the seducer: A novel","description":"A classic novel of love, sex, and the vagaries of the literary life, as witnessed by a young woman on the verge of success Dina Reeve is a talented writer with a dry, urban sense of humor and a tendency to worry about sharks in bathtubs.

Sally Bedell Smith s book on John and Jackie Kennedy was hailed by authoritative reviewers on both sides of the Atlantic as the most distinguished and well-written book on a perennially fascinating subject for years. In the US the hardback was high on the New York Times bestseller list for weeks. It is an immensely poignant chronicle of pivotal historical events seen from the inside out, from within the private home of the President and First Lady. Amidst the superficial opulence of their social circle, we see the Cuban Missile Crisis and the burgeoning American civil rights movement from the perspective of an invalid president often barely well enough to appear in public. Together with his young wife, abandoned by her husband s relentless womanising, nevertheless changed the politics and style of America.

It consists of two parts, the first of which addresses the initial stage of English-translated Tang poetry s propagation, and the second exploring its further development. By analyzing the historical background and characteristics of these two stages, the book traces the trend back to its roots, discusses some well-known early sinologists and their contributions, and familiarizes readers with the general course of Tang poetry s development. In addition, it presents the translated versions of many Tang poems. The dissemination of Tang poetry to the Western world is a significant event in the history of cross-cultural communication. From the simple imitation of poetic techniques to the acceptance and identification of key poetic concepts, the Tang poetry translators gradually constructed a classic  Chinese style  in modern American poetry. Hence, the traditional Chinese culture represented by Tang poetry spread more widely in the English-speaking world, producing a more lasting impact on societies and cultures outside China  and demonstrating the poetry s ability to transcend the boundaries of time, region, nationality and culture. Due to different cultural backgrounds, the Tang poets or poems admired most by Western readers may not necessarily receive high acclaim in China. Sometimes language barriers and cultural differences make it impossible to represent certain allusions or cultural and ethnic concepts correctly during the translation process. However, in recent decades, the translation of Tang poetry has evolved considerably in both quantity and quality. As culture is manifested in language, and language is part of culture, the translation of Tang poetry has allowed Western scholars to gain an unprecedented understanding of China and Chinese culture.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=q3VQDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mark of The Christian","description":"The Mark of a Christian provides Biblical insights into matters often misunderstood in today's church.

From there, it's merely a series of hops, skips, and jumps to Fort Dix, New Jersey, for basic training; Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania, for Morse Code Intercept Operator training; and on to the mountains, valleys, and rice paddies of South Korea. Fourteen months later, after an honorable discharge from the military, Frank meets Anne Marie Fleming. The couple marry, and, as time slips away, they find themselves being compared to a five-and-dime (for their five children and ten grandchildren). Along the way, Connelly works at various jobs: hauling cable for Western Electric, growing hair for Wybrandt Hair and Scalp Specialists, and spending twenty years on the New York Police Department. Near the end of his career in law enforcement, mental and physical difficulties and the debilitating effects of hypoglycemia take their toll on Connelly.

She argues that without fundamental change in government and business policies and the redirection of major resources back into the schools and the communities they serve, urban schools are consigned to failure, and no effort at raising standards, improving teaching, or boosting achievement can occur. Based on her participation in an intensive four-year school reform project in the Newark, New Jersey public schools, the author vividly captures the anguish and anger of students and teachers caught in the tangle of a failing school system. Ghetto Schooling offers a penetrating historical analysis of more than a century of government and business policies that have drained the economic, political, and human resources of urban populations. Provocative and controversial, this book reveals the historical roots of the current crisis in ghetto schools and what must be done to reverse the downward spiral.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3M5lJSoDz_YC&dq=Ghetto+Schooling:+A+Political+Economy+of+Urban+Educational+Reform&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jesse","description":"De ruimteatlas van Jesse Kreek is het hilarische eerste deel in de serie Ruimteatlas van Martin Howard, met illustraties van Chris Mould.

Charles Lindbergh had flown into immortality. His flight galvanized the western world; he instantly became an international celebrity. His life changed in ways that few others have ever experienced since his time. Lindbergh subsequently met and married Anne Morrow and despite his world-wide fame, they were happily married -- for a time. Until their first-born son was kidnapped.

Despite their efforts to assimilate white culture -- adopting a constitution based on that of the United States, learning English while inventing their own syllabary, and developing an agriculture-based economy -- in the end all that mattered was the governments determination to confiscate Cherokee lands. Josh and Nelley grew up together in what now is northern Georgia, sharing a bond solidified by their love of nature and their common foe of racial intolerance. Separated during the removal of 1838, the book traces their tragic experiences on the Trail of Tears and their disjoined lives up to the end of the Civil War. Embittered by the white mans greed and betrayals among the Cherokee, and ultimately disowned by his family, Josh seeks out the only friend he may have left -- a friend he has not seen in 27 years.

In reality of course the city is four dimensional, and one needs to acknowledge the influence of time in planning and design strategies. Similarly, there has been relatively little analysis of the importance of interim, short-term or 'meanwhile' activities in urban areas. In an era of increasing pressure on scarce resources, we cannot wait for long-term solutions to vacancy or dereliction. Instead, we need to view temporary uses as increasingly legitimate and important in their own right. They can be a powerful tool through which we can drip-feed initiatives for incremental change - as and when we have the resources - while being guided by a loose-fit vision. Peter Bishop and Lesley Williams explore the growing interest among practitioners at the cutting edge of architecture, urban design and regeneration, in temporary, interim, 'pop-up' or 'meanwhile' uses for land and buildings in our urban areas. They explore the origins and the social, economic and technological drivers behind this phenomenon, and its place within modern planning theory and practice. The Temporary City challenges our preoccupation with long-term strategies and masterplans and questions our ability to achieve these in the face of increasing resource constraints and political and economic uncertainty. The book includes sixty-eight diverse case studies from Europe and North America which illustrate the range of temporary use opportunities and the benefits that these can bring. This is essential reading for all those struggling to address the current problems of urban renewal in an era of great change. It offers a prism through which to view the city as a rich mosaic of time-limited, but inspiring urban interventions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=zA1EYgEACAAJ&dq=The+Temporary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parent's Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","description":"This complete guide to multiple pregnancy is now fully revised and brought up to date with a decade's advances in research, in understanding the psychology of parents and twins, and in the author's experise in guiding expectant and new parents through all aspects of having twins.

In this ground-breaking book, now returned to print with a new afterword by the author, Mar a Rosa Menocal argues that major modifications of the medieval canon and its literary history are necessary. Menocal reviews the Arabic cultural presence in a variety of key settings, including the courts of William of Aquitaine and Frederick II, the universities in London, Paris, and Bologna, and Cluny under Peter the Venerable, and she examines how our perception of specific texts including the courtly love lyric and the works of Dante and Boccaccio would be altered by an acknowledgment of the Arabic cultural component.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=zp1syHAHVM0C&dq=The+Arabic+Role+in+Medieval+Literary+History:+A+Forgotten+Heritage+(The+Middle+Ages+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Map of Tolkien's Middle-earth","description":"Includes four posters depicting Tolkien's world of Middle-Earth with maps from The Hobbit, Beleriand, and Numenor, accompanied by a manual describing the signicance of geographical evolution in the author's works.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=gCENA64Y-O4C&dq=The+Map+of+Tolkien%27s+Middle-earth&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jaguar","description":"In 1935, when a small company in Coventry, England, launched a sporting saloon (i.e., sedan) called the Jaguar SS, it set in motion an inexorable process that would lead to Britain s most beloved line of high-performance automobiles. The Complete Book of Jaguar covers the SS and all of the Jaguar's subsequent production models, from the original SS Jaguar to today s F-Type sports cars, F-Pace SUV, X-Type sedans, as well as concept cars. As with other books in the Complete Book Series, author Nigel Thorley organizes the content chronologically with entries for each year. Narratives for each discuss the cars and technology, while spec tables highlight key technical and performance specifications. Originally begun by a couple of motorcycle enthusiasts William Lyons and William Walmsley as a firm called the Swallow Sidecar Company, Jaguar would become one of the world's most celebrated automakers. In England s bleak postwar years, Jaguar became a shining star first with its XK120, followed by the XK140 and XK150. Sporting sedans like the Mark 2 and Mark X set the bar for luxury four-door transport in the '50s and '60s. Then Jaguar stunned the world with the achingly beautiful E-Type in 1961, a genuine 150 mph super sports car. Along the way, the company competed on road courses around the world, going head to head with greats like Ferrari and Aston Martin. Though Jaguar lost its way periodically in the modern era, it has bounded back stronger than ever in the twenty-first century with a strong lineup, including the new F-Type sports car and F-Pace SUV. The Complete Book of Jaguar is the essential guide to this important chapter in the history of sports and luxury automobiles.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=hGawDwAAQBAJ&dq=Jaguar&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Women of the Renaissance (Women in Culture and Society Series)","description":"First published in 1998. This collection of original essays identifies and analyzes 19th-century women's theological thought in all its diversity, demonstrating the ways that women revised, subverted, or rejected elements of masculine theology in creating theologies of their own. While women's religion has been widely studied, this is the only collection of essays that examines 19th-century women's theology as such A substantial introduction clarifies the relationships between religion and theology and discusses the barriers to women's participation in theological discourse as well as the ways women overcame or avoided these barriers. The essays analyze theological ideas in a variety of genres. The first group of essays discusses women's nonfiction prose, including women's devotional writings on the Apocalypse; devotional prose by Christina Rossetti and its similarities to the work of Hildegard von Bingen; periodical prose by Anna Jameson and Julia Wedgwood; and the letters of Harriet and Jemima Newman, sisters of John Henry Newman. Other essays examine the novel, presenting analysis of the theologies of novelists Emma Jane Worboise, Charlotte M. Yonge, and Mary Arnold Ward. Further essays discuss the theological ideas of two purity reformers, Josephine Butler and Ellice Hopkins, while the final essays move beyond Victorian Christianity to examine spiritualist and Buddhist theology by women This collection will be important to students and scholars interested in Victorian culture and ideas-literary critics, historians, and theologians-and particularly to those in women's studies and religious studies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fQyjDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eton Voices: Interviews","description":"Taking a global, multicultural, social, and economic perspective, this work explores the diverse and colourful history of human attire.

Components are the fundamental building blocks of .NET applications; they can both simplify and add flexibility to complex applications. Applied properly, component-oriented programming enable reuse, allow for long-term maintenance, application extensibility and scalability. Component technology is nothing new, but the .NET Framework offers developers a new way to develop binary components rapidly, without the hurdles that many COM developers have had to deal with prior to .NET. While retaining all of the core concepts that define component-oriented development--language independence, separation of interface from implementation, binary compatibility, versioning, concurrency management, location transparency, security, deployment--.NET is built upon a fresh component-oriented runtime that has an easier time providing these core concepts. Programming .NET Components offers a complete introduction to the new Microsoft .NET component model, focusing on the aspects of .NET that make it ideal for building reusable, maintainable, and robust components. Author Juval L??wy, a noted authority on component-oriented programming, teaches the intricacies of .NET component programming and the related system issues to application developers, along with relevant design guidelines, tips, best practices, and known pitfalls. The book is packed with helpful original utilities aimed at simplifying the programming model and increasing the developer productivity. The book begins with an appreciation for the \\"why\\" and fundamentals of component-oriented programming, and then continues with an introduction to .NET essentials. Following practical, expert advice on effective .NET development techniques, the book then devotes a chapter to each of the following features critical to component development: Resource management Versioning Events Asynchronous calls Multithreading Serialization Remoting Component services Security. Programming .NET Components offers everything you'll need to know to program components for real-life .NET applications, using Windows Forms, ASP.NET, ADO.NET, or web services. Anyone interested in developing .NET applications, especially enterprise level, will find this book an invaluable resource.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Jjgx51SS95MC&dq=.NET+Multithreading&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"1001 Pearls of Wisdom","description":"1001 Pearls of Wisdom is an enlightening compendium of insights and quotations from the philosophies, cultures, and religions of the world, including the ancient and the modern, the mystical and the rational, the profound and the light-hearted, all with a message relevant to our lives and lifestyles today.

Men, Homosexuality, and the Gods: An Exploration into the Religious Significance of Male Homosexuality in World Perspective is an eye-opening look at the traditions of particular religions and their edicts concerning gay sex. This book examines the origins of holy directives involving homosexuality whether forbidden, tolerated, or mandatory and establishes a link between theology, sex roles, and the sensitive issue of masculinity. This text draws a parallel between homosexuality and the idea of religion, suggesting that gay rights can be understood as a freedom of religion issue. While most readers are familiar with the traditional Islamic, Christian, and Hebrew prohibitions against sex between two males, this book also reveals other historic religions from around the world that neither opposed nor looked down on homosexuality. Men, Homosexuality, and the Gods argues that masculinity is the universal theme that formed historical interpretation warriors and men of high status could not be sexually receptive or  feminine  and still be called  men.  This intriguing text shows how the modern homophile movements are in effect redefining masculinity to obliterate the stigma of being a sexually receptive man. Men, Homosexuality, and the Gods examines the significance of homosexuality in such religions as: the Sambians of New Guinea the Taoists of Ancient China Plato and the later Stoics Islamic Sufism Native American culture Hebrew Scriptures early Christianity Buddhism Men, Homosexuality, and the Gods is an enlightening book that honors homosexual claims to moral integrity and appreciates religion and religious figures without rancor. Easy-to-read and free of technical language, this volume is for anyone who has an academic, professional, or personal interest in theology and homosexuality.

It explores an important but frequently neglected issue in the contemporary study of China - the transformation from the orthodox anti-market doctrine into a more elastic and pro-business one, and from Mao's radical totalitarian approach to Deng's gradualist, developmental, authoritarian approach. Based on a well-defined theoretical framework, the author makes a critical survey of many primary sources including official documents, policy statements, memoirs and interviews, while exploring the origin and themes of China's major ideological trends since 1978 and how they affected the pace, scope and content of economic reform. The study focuses on the origin and evolution of Deng's doctrine of 'socialism with Chinese characteristics' and its impact on the reform programme. Wei-Wei Zhang's unique perspective brings out thought-provoking explanations of the nature of Chinese politics under Deng Xiaoping in general, and the politics of China's 'gradual approach' to reform in particular.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3WW33sySdF4C&dq=Ideology+and+Economic+Reform+Under+Deng:+1978-1993&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Poems","description":"Widely considered the greatest and most influential of the English Romantic poets, William Wordsworth (1770-1850) remains today among the most admired and studied of all English writers.

In his fascinating, deeply learned book, Sorabji traces the roots of our thinking about animals back to Aristotelian and Stoic beliefs. Charting a recurrent theme in ancient philosophy of mind, he shows that today's controversies about animal rights represent only the most recent chapter in millennia-old debates. Sorabji surveys a vast range of Greek philosophical texts and considers how classical discussions of animals' capacities intersect with central questions, not only in ethics but in the definition of human rationality as well: the nature of concepts; how perceptions differ from beliefs; how memory, intention, and emotion relate to reason; and to what extent speech, skills, and inference can serve as proofs of reason. Focusing on the significance of ritual sacrifice and the eating of meat, he explores religious contexts of the treatment of animals in ancient Greece and in medieval Western Christendom. He also looks closely at the contemporary defenses of animal rights offered by Peter Singer, Tom Regan, and Mary Midgley. Animal Minds and Human Morals sheds new light on traditional arguments surrounding the status of animals while pointing beyond them to current moral dilemmas.

Born at the eleventh hour on the eleventh day of the eleventh month in 1918, Mary and Walter Tilford's baby daughter is named Thursday. It was meant to be a message of hope for the future - but they could not foresee that by the time Thursday celebrated her twenty-first birthday, Britain would once again be at war with Germany. Thursday is determined to help in the war effort and volunteers as a Red Cross Voluntary Aid Detachment nurse. She is attached to the Royal Navy, and begins her service at Haslar Hospital on the shores of Portsmouth Harbour. The realities of war are brought home to her when the casualties begin to arrive from Dunkirk and Thursday begins to understand the true meaning of courage. While experiencing all the natural hopes and dreams of any young woman, finding pleasure and joy as well as sorrow in her work, Thursday is given her own opportunity to show strength and bravery in the face of war - and find a lasting love.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FblsH5yzC98C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chesapeake Bay Retrievers (KW Dog)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=L3Qh1HF6YVMC&dq=Chesapeake+Bay+Retrievers+(KW+Dog)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dr. Richard Marrs' Fertility Book: America's Leading Infertility Expert Tells You Everything You Need to Know About Getting Pregnant","description":"A pioneer in the field of assisted reproduction, Dr. Richard Marrs has spent his life counseling couples who struggle with the pain of infertility, developing new treatments, and helping thousands to experience the wonder of birth.

High-spirited and omni-talented, he amasses dazzling weapons and skills on his journey to immortality: a gold-hooped staff that can grow as tall as the sky and shrink to the size of a needle; the ability to travel 108,000 miles in a single somersault. A master of subterfuge, he can transform himself into whomever or whatever he chooses and turn each of his body's 84,000 hairs into an army of clones. But his penchant for mischief repeatedly gets him into trouble, and when he raids Heaven's Orchard of Immortal Peaches and gorges himself on the elixirs of the gods, the Buddha pins him beneath a mountain, freeing him only five hundred years later for a chance to redeem himself: He is to protect the pious monk Tripitaka on his fourteen-year journey to India in search of precious Buddhist sutras that will bring enlightenment to the Chinese empire. Joined by two other fallen immortals--Pigsy, a rice-loving pig able to fly with its ears, and Sandy, a depressive man-eating river-sand monster--Monkey King undergoes eighty-one trials, doing battle with Red Boy, Princess Jade-Face, the Monstress Dowager, and all manner of dragons, ogres, wizards, and femmes fatales, navigating the perils of Fire-Cloud Cave, the River of Flowing Sand, the Water-Crystal Palace, and Casserole Mountain, and being serially captured, lacquered, saut ed, steamed, and liquefied, but always hatching an ingenious plan to get himself and his fellow pilgrims out of their latest jam. Monkey King: Journey to the West is at once a rollicking adventure, a comic satire of Chinese bureaucracy, and a spring of spiritual insight. With this new translation, the irrepressible rogue hero of one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature has the potential to vault, with his signature cloud-somersault and unerring sense for fun, into the hearts of millions of Americans.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=BATyDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Monkey+King&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Behind the Message: Information Strategies for Communicators","description":"This successor to the successful Search Strategies in Mass Communication provides a conceptual approach to information-gathering and practical methods for navigating through information tools and techniques.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=IJbhAAAAMAAJ&dq=Behind+the+Message:+Information+Strategies+for+Communicators&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lady Wu","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=JmN6swEACAAJ&dq=Lady+Wu&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Copyrighting Culture: The Political Economy Of Intellectual Property (Critical Studies in Communication and in the Cultural Industries)","description":"Launching into a complete analysis of copyright law in our capitalistic and hegemonistic political system, Ronald Bettig uncovers the power of the wealthy few to expand their fortunes through the ownership and manipulation of intellectual property.

Design in this sense is a large concept having to do as much with politics and ethics as with buildings and technology.The book begins by describing the scope of design, comparing it to the Enlightenment of the 18th century. Subsequent chapters describe barriers to a design revolution inherent in our misuse of language, the clockspeed of technological society, and shortsighted politics. Orr goes on to describe the critical role educational institutions might play in fostering design intelligence and what he calls \\"a higher order of heroism.\\"Appropriately, the book ends on themes of charity, wilderness, and the rights of children.

It is by no means a new ?eld of study and has actually been around, initially as quantitative physiology and partly as colloid science, for over a hundred years. For a long time, biophysics has been taught and practiced as a research discipline mostly in medical schools and life sciences departments, and excellent biophysics textbooks have been published that are targeted at a biologically literate audience. With a few exceptions, it is only relatively recently that biophysics has started to be recognized as a physical science and integrated into physics departments  curr- ula, sometimes under the new name of biological physics. In this period of cryst- lization and possible rede?nition of biophysics, there still exists some uncertainty as to what biophysics might actually represent. A particular tendency among phy- cists is to associate biophysics research with the development of powerful new te- niques that should eventually be used not by physicists to study physical processes in living matter, but by biologists in their biological investigations. There is value in that judgment, and excellent books have been published that introduce the int- ested reader to the use of physical principles for the development of new methods of investigation in life sciences.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qr3KWd2hJWcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Colt Terry, Green Beret (Williams-Ford Texas A&M; University Military History Series)","description":"Roman over de levenslange vriendschap tussen twee echtparen Nawoord Jane Smiley TEN TIJDE VAN DE GROTE DEPRESSIE ontmoeten twee jonge stellen elkaar voor het eerst.

He is widely known as author of key ideas used in family therapy - including the well-known condition called 'double bind' . He was also one of the most influential figures in cultural anthropology. In the decade before his death in 1980 Bateson turned toward a consideration of ecology. Standard ecology concentrates on an ecosystem's biomass and on energy budgets supporting life. Bateson came to the conclusion that understanding ecological organization requires a complete switch in scientific perspective. He reasoned that ecological phenomena must be explained primarily through patterns of information and that only through perceiving these informational patterns will we uncover the elusive unity, or integration, of ecosystems. Bateson believed that relying upon the materialist framework of knowledge dominant in ecological science will deepen errors of interpretation and, in the end, promote eco-crisis. He saw recursive patterns of communication as the basis of order in both natural and human domains. He conducted his investigation first in small-scale social settings; then among octopus, otters, and dolphins. Later he took these investigations to the broader setting of evolutionary analysis and developed a framework of thinking he called 'an ecology of mind.' Finally, his inquiry included an ecology of mind in ecological settings - a recursive epistemology. This is the first study of the whole range of Bateson's ecological thought - a comprehensive presentaionof Bateson's matrix of ideas. Drawing on unpublished letters and papers, Harries-Jones clarifies themes scattered throughout Bateson's own writings, revealing the conceptual consistency inherent in Bateson's position, and elaborating ways in which he pioneered aspects of late twentieth-century thought.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=m4lQrfqt46gC&dq=A+Recursive+Vision:+Ecological+Understanding+and+Gregory+Bateson&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Baffling Whodunit Puzzles: Dr. Quicksolve Mini-Mysteries","description":"Dr. Jeffrey Lynn Quicksolve, professor of criminology, visits more than forty crime scenes in order to identify the guilty parties.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-08sBzmb8o0C&dq=Baffling+Whodunit+Puzzles:+Dr.+Quicksolve+Mini-Mysteries&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Adventures Among Spiritual Intelligences: Angels, Aliens, Dolphins, & Shamans","description":"Swim with wild dolphins and learn how to listen to their quiet tendrils of telepathic communication.

Yet the definition of the Middle West, that most amorphous of regions, is elusive and changing. In historical, cultural, political, literary, and artistic terms the region is variously drawn. It is alternately praised as a pastoral oasis and damned as a cultural backwater, fostering wholesome pragmatism and crass materialism, home to people at once resilient and embittered, hardworking and complacent. From Willa Cather to Sherwood Anderson, from \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" to \\"The Music Man,\\" images of the Middle West are powerful and contradictory. In this thoughtful book, cultural geographer James R. Shortridge offers a historical probe into the \\"idea\\" of the Middle West. By exploring what this term originally meant and how it has changed over the past 150 years, he presents a fascinating look at the question of regional identity and its place in the collective consciousness. A work of unconventional geography based on extensive research in popular literature, this volume examines meaning, essence, character--the important intangibles of place not captured by statistical studies--and explores the intimate connections between the notion of pastoralism and the definition of the Middle West.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-IYTAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+Middle+West:+Its+Meaning+in+American+Culture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Midwinter's Tale","description":"Press kit for the 1995 film A midwinter's tale (released in the U.K. as In the bleak midwinter), directed by Kenneth Branagh and starring Michael Maloney, Richard Briers, and Mark Hadfield.

Now he invites readers to share his front row seat and take a look at history and the powerful effect of television. Through his eyes we revisit the Kennedy assassination and trial of Jack Ruby; the civil rights movement and nationwide racial strife; the Vietnam War and the plight of POW-MIAs; the maverick presidential campaign of Ross Perot, in which Murphy took a leading role; and compelling personalities he's met along the way.Forty years after the JFK assassination, Martin reflects upon the tragedy with pointed new perspectives. Numerous interviews with those closest to the scene, including former prosecutor Bill Alexander, Marina Oswald, Robert Oswald, Jim Garrison, District Attorney Henry Wade, Sheriff Bill Decker, and Judge Joe Brown, help to separate fact from fiction.From the assassination and its aftermath, Martin moved swiftly to cover the fiery civil rights movement. From personal observation and interviews he offers insight into Dr. Martin Luther King's ability to stir a crowd to near frenzy but leave them calmly inspired rather than violent, and he examines King's savvy use of television to spread his message.Murphy Martin's career has connected him with countless personalities and legends, and in this book he presents gripping discussionswith presidents and other political leaders, actors, news colleagues, and sports figures, including a particularly poignant look at his friend Mickey Mantle. Perhaps the most fascinating vignette is of the self-made billionaire turned maverick politician, H. Ross Perot. After Perot gave his first in-depth interview to Martin, their relationship expanded when Murphy brought the condition of American POWs and MIAs in Vietnam to Perot's attention. The result was Perot's establishment of United We Stand, dedicated to the plight of the POW-MIAs. Martin became president of that organization and led a group of POW-MIA wives to Paris for an audience with the North Vietnamese delegation. In 1992, Perot called in Martin to clean up damage to his presidential campaign, and now Martin recounts previously untold behind-the-scenes stories of that unique third-party campaign.His is not just the absorbing account of a newsman's career; it is the story of America and the world in the last half of the twentieth century, truly seen from the front row.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=XtEGAAAACAAJ&dq=Front+Row+Seat:+A+Veteran+Reporter+Relives+the+Four+Decades+That+Reshaped+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mystery in the Cave (The Boxcar Children Mysteries #50)","description":"The Aldens are exploring underground caves!

Virtually unavailable until the end of the twentieth century, English translations from the German archives are gradually coming into print. Both Steiner and his works have thus far been virtually unknown in traditional theological circles. No Bible commentary has yet reflected the remarkable spiritual insights of Anthroposophy. Now, ten years after first encountering a written comment about Rudolf Steiner, Ed Smith combines his own extensive traditional biblical knowledge with his years of concentrated study and reflection on hundreds of assembled works by Steiner. The result is the first Bible commentary in the light of anthroposophic insight. This is the first volume of a series of Bible commentary by the author. It is based on the \\"anthroposophic\\" understanding given to humanity by Rudolf Steiner during the first quarter of the twentieth century. Bible commentaries have always reflected the general line of thinking of their authors. However, the dramatic newness of anthroposophic thought means that perhaps the usual method of using a Bible commentary is not appropriate here. A large part of The Burning Bush is necessarily devoted to laying an anthroposophic, or spiritual-scientific, groundwork. A major assumption indulged in most Bible commentaries--that one can go directly to portions dealing with given passages of scripture and understand what is being said about them--does not fit.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=7b29o060a90C&dq=The+Burning+Bush+:+Rudolf+Steiner,+Anthroposophy+and+the+Holy+Scriptures+:+Terms&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Guide to Zanzibar","description":"Zanzibar -- the legendary \\"Spice Islands\\" in the Indian Ocean -- is rapidly becoming more accessible, attracting an increasing number of tourists.

Or, in the absence of plumbing, burning barrels of human waste. Where any dead dog on the side of the road might be concealing an insurgent's bomb and anyone could be the enemy. At age 17, Jason Christopher Hartley joined the Army National Guard. Thirteen years later, he is called to active duty, to serve in Iraq. Sent to a town called Ad Dujayl, made notorious by Saddam Hussein's 1982 massacre, Hartley is thrust into the center of America's war against terrorism. This is his story. \\"If you are distrustful of the media and want to know exactly what's going on in Iraq, you'll have to pray for divine enlightenment, because only god knows what the hell is going on over here. However, if you want to know how it feels to be a soldier in Iraq, to hear something honest and raw, that I can help you with.\\" Sometimes profane, often poignant, and always nakedly candid, Just Another Soldier takes the reader past the images seen on CNN and the nightly news, into the day to day reality of life on the ground as an infantryman, attached to the 1st Division, in the first war of the 21st century. From the adrenaline rush of storming a suspected insurgent's house, to the sheer boredom of down time on the base, to the horror of dead civilians, Hartley examines his role as a man, as a soldier and as an American on foreign soil. His quest to discover the balance between his compassionate side and his baser instincts, results in a searing portrait of today's Army and a remarkable personal narrative written in a fresh and exciting new voice. Just Another Soldier is more than a war story; it delivers an intimate look at a generation of young men and women on the front lines of American policy.

Simpson was elected majority whip of the United States Senate, he decided to keep a journal.  I am going to make notes when I get home in the evening, as to what happened during each day.  Now the senator s longtime chief of staff, Donald Loren Hardy, has drawn extensively on Simpson s personal papers and nineteen-volume diary to write this unvarnished account of a storied life and political career. Simpson gave full authorial control to Hardy, telling him,  Don, just tell the truth, the whole truth, as you always have. Leave teeth, hair, and eyeballs on the floor, if that results from telling the truth.  Taking Simpson at his word, Hardy shows readers a thrill-seeking teenager in Cody and a tireless politician who has thoroughly enjoyed his work. Full of entertaining tales and moments of historical significance, Shooting from the Lip offers a privileged and revealing backstage view of late-twentieth century American politics. Hardy s richly anecdotal account reveals the roles Simpson played during such critical events as the Iran-Contra scandal and Clarence Thomas s confirmation hearings. It divulges the senator s candid views of seven American presidents and scores of other national and world luminaries. Simpson is a politician unfettered by partisanship. Among President George H. W. Bush s closest compatriots, he was also a close friend and admirer of Senator Ted Kennedy and was never afraid to publicly challenge the positions or tactics of fellow lawmakers, Democratic and Republican alike. Simpson s ability to use truth and humor as both  sword and shield,  combined with his years of experience and issue mastery, has led to an impressive post-Senate career. In 2010, for example, he co-chaired President Barack Obama s Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform. Shooting from the Lip portrays a statesman punching sacred cows, challenging the media, and grappling with some of the nation s most difficult challenges.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ArdoXc5vst8C&dq=Shooting+from+the+Lip&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Great Pyrenees (KW Dog)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=xqzutg8I3ZwC&dq=Great+Pyrenees+(KW+Dog)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The capitalist manifesto,","description":"\\"The socialist principles of the Communist Manifesto of 1848 have delivered oppression, poverty, and misery wherever they have been implemented.

He was famously militaristic, yet brokered peace between Russia and Japan. He started out an archconservative, yet came to champion progressive causes. These contradictions are not evidence of vacillating weakness: instead, they were the product of a restless mind bend on a continuous quest for self-improvement. In Theodore Roosevelt, historian Kathleen Dalton reveals a man with a personal and intellectual depth rarely seen in our public figures. She shows how Roosevelt s struggle to overcome his frailties as a child helped to build his character, and offers new insights into his family life, uncovering the important role that Roosevelt s second wife, Edith Carow, played in the development of his political career. She also shows how TR flirted with progressive reform and then finally commited himself to deep reform in the Bull Moose campaign of 1912. Incorporating the latest scholarship into a vigorous narrative, Dalton reinterprets both the man and his times to create an illuminating portrait that will change the way we see this great man and the Progressive Era.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Vx4-_XLfECgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Defiant Pose","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=o8j_zgEACAAJ&dq=Defiant+Pose&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Albania (with new Postscript): From Anarchy to Balkan Identity","description":"WITH A NEW POSTSCRIPT Situated between Greece on the south, the former Yugoslavia on the north and east, and the Adriatic Sea on the west, Albania is the country the world forgot. Throughout this century, Albania has been perceived as primitive and isolationist by its neighbors to the west. When the country ended fifty years of communist rule in 1992, few outsiders took interest. Deemed unworthy of membership in the European Union and overlooked by multinational corporations, Albania stands today as one of the poorest and most ignored countries in Europe. Miranda Vickers and James Pettifer take us behind the veil of former President Enver Hoxha's isolationist policies to examine the historic events leading up to Albania's transition to a parliamentary government. Beginning with Hoxha's death in 1985, Albania traces the last decade of Albania's shaky existence, from the anarchy and chaos of the early nineties to the victory of the Democratic Alliance in 1992 and the programs of the current government. The authors provide us with an analysis of how the moral, religious, economic, political and cultural identity of the Albanian people is being redefined, and leave no question that the future of Albania is inextricably linked to the future of the Balkans as a whole. In short, they tell us why Albania matters.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=uEwo1qeK8fQC&dq=Albania+(with+new+Postscript):+From+Anarchy+to+Balkan+Identity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Essential Managers: Achieving Excellence","description":"Are you looking to take the next step in your career?

Wallace Stevens (1879-1955) lived a richly imaginative life that he expressed in his poems.  A biography that is both deliciously readable and profoundly knowledgeable  (Library Journal, starred review), The Whole Harmonium presents Stevens within the living context of his times and as the creator of a poetry that continues to shape how we understand and define ourselves. A lawyer who rose to become an insurance-company vice president, Stevens composed brilliant poems on long walks to work and at other stolen moments. He endured an increasingly unhappy marriage, and yet he had his Dionysian side, reveling in long fishing (and drinking) trips to the sun-drenched tropics of Key West. He was at once both the Connecticut businessman and the hidalgo lover of all things Latin. His first book of poems, Harmonium, published when he was forty-four, drew on his profound understanding of Modernism to create a distinctive and inimitable American idiom. Over time he became acquainted with peers such as Robert Frost and William Carlos Williams, but his personal style remained unique. The complexity of Stevens s poetry rests on emotional, philosophical, and linguistic tensions that thread their way intricately through his poems, both early and late. And while he can be challenging to understand, Stevens has proven time and again to be one of the most richly rewarding poets to read. Biographer and poet Paul Mariani s The Whole Harmonium  is an excellent, superb, thrilling story of a mind .unpacking poems in language that is nearly as eloquent as the poet s, and as clear as faithfulness allows  (The New Yorker).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JjwjBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"His Lordship's Holiday Surprise (Zebra Regency Romance)","description":"When Miss Augusta Oglethorpe arrives on his doorstep, searching for her sister Clarissa who has left behind her three young children, the Marquess of Ardath offers his assistance and, while trying to find Clarissa and caring for her delighful children, discovers a love to last a lifetime with Augusta.

Informed by their Jewish identity and experiences of being outsiders, these thinkers produced one of the most brilliant and effervescent intellectual movements of modernity. Political philosopher Seyla Benhabib s starting point is that these thinkers faced migration, statelessness, and exile because of their Jewish origins, even if they did not take positions on specifically Jewish issues personally. The sense of belonging and not belonging, of being  eternally half-other,  led them to confront essential questions: What does it mean for the individual to be an equal citizen and to wish to retain one s ethnic, cultural, and religious differences, or perhaps even to rid oneself of these differences altogether in modernity? Benhabib isolates four themes in their works: dilemmas of belonging and difference; exile, political voice, and loyalty; legality and legitimacy; and pluralism and the problem of judgment. Surveying the work of influential intellectuals, Exile, Statelessness, and Migration recovers the valuable plurality of their Jewish voices and develops their universal insights in the face of the crises of this new century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=4WyYDwAAQBAJ&dq=Exile&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oil Field Chemicals","description":"Oil field chemicals are gaining increasing importance, as the resources of crude oil are decreasing.
