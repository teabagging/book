Even the outbreak of war later that year did little to disturb her happy life there, until 1940 when Hitler launched an all-out assault on Western Europe. Trying to escape back to Britain, Rosie was only able to flee as far as Paris, where she was eventually rounded up as an 'enemy alien' and sent to a German-run prison camp in Eastern France. Desperate to escape, she eventually did so with an equally industrious friend, Frida. After many months on the run in France, the young women finally reached the unoccupied city of Marseille. From there, they continued to flee through France, Spain and Portugal, at last arriving in Ireland where they were able to catch a plane back to Britain. Moving, enthralling, and inspirational, Rosie's War is a book for all to enjoy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0STdAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Life of a Simple Sailor","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=z94MAAAACAAJ&dq=Life+of+a+Simple+Sailor&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Drawing with children","description":"Designed to teach the basics of drawing to children and adults, this interactive handbook contains work sheets and sample illustrations to help students develop their individual style, use color effectively, and create unified compositions","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=B-pnQgAACAAJ&dq=Drawing+with+children&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","description":"In 1998, William Queen was a veteran law enforcement agent with a lifelong love of motorcycles and a lack of patience with paperwork. When a  confidential informant  made contact with his boss at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, offering to take an agent inside the San Fernando chapter of the Mongols (the scourge of Southern California, and one of the most dangerous gangs in America), Queen jumped at the chance, not realizing that he was kicking-starting the most extensive undercover operation inside an outlaw motorcycle gang in the history of American law enforcement. Nor did Queen suspect that he would penetrate the gang so successfully that he would become a fully  patched-in  member, eventually rising through their ranks to the office of treasurer, where he had unprecedented access to evidence of their criminal activity. After Queen spent twenty-eight months as  Billy St. John,  the bearded, beer-swilling, Harley-riding gang-banger, the truth of his identity became blurry, even to himself. During his initial  prospecting  phase, Queen was at the mercy of crank-fueled criminal psychopaths who sought to have him test his mettle and prove his fealty by any means necessary, from selling (and doing) drugs, to arms trafficking, stealing motorcycles, driving getaway cars, and, in one shocking instance, stitching up the face of a Mongol  ol  lady  after a particularly brutal beating at the hands of her boyfriend. Yet despite the constant criminality of the gang, for whom planning cop killings and gang rapes were business as usual, Queen also came to see the genuine camaraderie they shared. When his lengthy undercover work totally isolated Queen from family, his friends, and ATF colleagues, the Mongols felt like the only family he had left.  I had no doubt these guys genuinely loved Billy St. John and would have laid down their lives for him. But they wouldn t hesitate to murder Billy Queen.  From Queen s first sleight of hand with a line of methamphetamine in front of him and a knife at his throat, to the fearsome face-off with their decades-old enemy, the Hell s Angels (a brawl that left three bikers dead), to the heartbreaking scene of a father ostracized at Parents  Night because his deranged-outlaw appearance precluded any interaction with regular citizens, Under and Alone is a breathless, adrenaline-charged read that puts you on the street with some of the most dangerous men in America and with the law enforcement agents who risk everything to bring them in.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zfqvVuqSm-gC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pete Moulton's A+ Training Course: Workbook, 2nd Edition","description":"Watch, listen and learn as A+ pro author Pete Moulton walks readers through all the A+ exam objectives and gives loads of practical, real-world advice.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=OGOJPQAACAAJ&dq=Pete+Moulton%27s+A++Training+Course:+Workbook,+2nd+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The French Powder Mystery (Ellery Queen Mysteries)(Library Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=nAcQAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+French+Powder+Mystery+(Ellery+Queen+Mysteries)(Library+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"2006 San Francisco/Bay Area Restaurants Map (Zagat Survey)","description":"Discover the best that San Francisco has to offer, and enjoy great savings, with the San Francisco Around-The-Town Pack (books sold separately for $35.85 retail value)!

Using a wide range of data from real-life speech situations, this new introduction to politeness breaks away from the limitations of current models and argues that the proper object of study in politeness theory must be commonsense notions of what politeness and impoliteness are. From this, Watts argues, a more appropriate model, one based on Bourdieu's concept of social practice, is developed.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=xLI-tzC5yRgC&dq=Politeness+(Key+Topics+in+Sociolinguistics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The farm on Nippersink Creek","description":"Relates stories of growing up in the rural farming communities of Illinois, spanning four generations of a family","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Qzb19THi7PQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Page After Page: Discover the Confidence & Passion You Need to Start Writing & Keep Writing (No Matter What)","description":"A fun, practical guide that reveals the essentials of good fiction and memoir writing by exposing the most common mistakes literary writers make. All great works of fiction and memoir are unique-but most bad novels, stories, and memoirs have a lot in common. From clunky dialogue to poorly sketchedout characters, sagging pacing to exaggerated prose, these beginners' mistakes drive any agent or editor to their stock rejection letter, telling the aspiring writer \\"Thanks, but this isn't for us,\\" and leaving many to wonder what exactly it is that they're doing wrong. Veteran writing coach, developmental editor, and writing instructor Jessica Page Morrell will fill in the gaps in every rejection letter you've ever received. In Thanks, But This Isn't for Us, Morrell uses her years of experience to isolate the specific errors beginners make, including the pitfalls of unrealistic dialogue, failing to \\"show, not tell,\\" and over-the-top plot twists. These are just a few of the problems that keep writers from breaking through with their work. Sympathetic and humane, but pulling no punches, Thanks, But This Isn't for Us shows writers precisely where they've gone wrong and how to get on the right track. In sixteen to-the-point chapters, with checklists, exercises, takeaway tips, and a glossary, Morrell helps readers transcend these mistakes so that they don't have to learn the hard way: with another rejection letter.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bLvU-C6SmosC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Christadelphians: What do they believe?","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=VdyHN6RVKxwC&dq=Christadelphians:+What+do+they+believe%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Appassionata","description":"Operazangeres Nina Rousseau breekt haar carri re af nadat twee van haar minnaars op verdachte wijze om het leven zijn gekomen.

I)","description":"John G. Nicolay (18321901) was an undeniably apt and brilliant choice to inaugurate the landmark Campaigns of the Civil War series. Private secretary to President Lincoln and coauthor (with John Hay) of the monumental, ten-volume Lincoln biography, Nicolay experienced the Civil War from a unique vantage point: living in the White House, witnessing the many momentous events and minor wranglings, sharing the nation's trauma with Lincoln, and winning his open confidence. It is Nicolay's firsthand knowledge and personal observations of the key figures that imbue The Outbreak of Rebellion (1881) with immediacy and thrust. Here is the secession fever that swept the South; Lincoln's shrewd and desperate maneuverings to hold the border states; the behind-the-scenes debates about how to respond to the crisis; the attack on Fort Sumter and the call to arms; and the hard-fought battle along Bull Run creek that resulted in a chaotic Federal defeat and the first appalling casualties of the war. Nicolay's insider view of the opening act of the Civil War has produced a succinct, compelling account of considerable value and fascinating insights.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=BUDzswEACAAJ&dq=The+outbreak+of+rebellion+(Campaigns+of+the+civil+war.+I)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Augsburg Confession and Its Apology (Lutheran Confessions Bible Study)","description":"In addition to the Bible, many other early, church writings can provide Christians with important insights into their faith. The Lutheran Confessions Series introduces the central beliefs expressed in the major Lutheran writings in a highly readable style, and shows how they provide additional insight into Scripture. Each book provides adult students with a convenient way to examine Lutheran doctrine and tradition. And for ease of use, each chapter includes excerpts from the relevant confessional documents, so there is no need to purchase other reference books in order to enjoy and benefit from these studies. Questions at the end of each chapter examine key concepts and give participants practical suggestions for taking that session's faith lesson out into the world. The Augsburg Confession study provides an opportunity to examine the confession of Lutheran beliefs as presented to Emperor Charles V in 1530. The Formula of Concord study reviews the defining statement of Lutheran doctrine. Written in 1577 by leading theologians of the day, it gives the Lutheran position on many controversial doctrinal issues. Enlightening and inspiring, these studies are an excellent way to encourage a deeper appreciation for God's truth and the rich history of the Lutheran church.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=PoLX93-TpzgC&dq=The+Augsburg+Confession+and+Its+Apology+(Lutheran+Confessions+Bible+Study)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Coming of Age in Samoa","description":"Rarely do science and literature come together in the same book. When they do -- as in Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species, for example -- they become classics, quoted and studied by scholars and the general public alike. Margaret Mead accomplished this remarkable feat not once but several times, beginning with Coming of Age in Samoa. It details her historic journey to American Samoa, taken where she was just twenty-three, where she did her first fieldwork. Here, for the first time, she presented to the public the idea that the individual experience of developmental stages could be shaped by cultural demands and expectations. Adolescence, she wrote, might be more or less stormy, and sexual development more or less problematic in different cultures. The \\"civilized\\" world, she taught us had much to learn from the \\"primitive.\\" Now this groundbreaking, beautifully written work as been reissued for the centennial of her birth, featuring introductions by Mary Pipher and by Mead's daughter, Mary Catherine Bateson.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1JsomEvlqAQC&dq=Coming+of+Age+in+Samoa&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"111 days in Stanleyville,","description":"\\"The harrowing story of the 1,600 European, American and Asian foreigners who were held hostage in Stanleyville for an eternity, an eternity of one hundred and eleven days.

Kinshasa is voor diplomaten minder populair dan Kopenhagen, terwijl juist in Congo het avontuur lonkt. Als gepromoveerde ontwikkelingsdeskundige weet Koch precies welke ondersteuning de Congolezen nodig zouden hebben. Maar gaandeweg zijn reizen per uitgeholde boomstam over de Congo-rivier en op de motor diep de oerwouden in, komt hij erachter dat wat hij als internationale samenwerking ziet, Congolezen als internationale tegenwerking zien. Hij begint te doceren aan de universiteit van Kinshasa en samen met slimme studenten onderzoekt hij de schaduwkanten van de hulp. Uiteindelijk zegt hij zijn baan bij de ambassade op om als directeur aan de slag te gaan bij een organisatie waarin hij gelooft. In De Congo Codes concludeert Dirk-Jan Koch dat internationale samenwerking soms veel effectiever is dan we durven dromen, maar dat de effecten soms ook veel desastreuzer zijn dan we ons kunnen voorstellen. Het is vooral internationale desinteresse die ervoor zorgt dat Congo niet vooruit komt. Met dit persoonlijke en positieve relaas wakkert hij het debat aan over wat wij aan dit grote menselijke drama kunnen en moeten doen. Dirk-Jan Koch (1980) was op zijn zestiende al voorzitter van het Landelijk Aktie Komitee Scholieren (laks).

I was inspired to write it by the writer and diarist, Anais Nin, who was a mentor to me in the early seventies. My hope was that it would aid young women artists in their development and that reading about my struggles might help them avoid some of the pitfalls that were so painful to me. I also hoped to spare them the anguish of \\"reinventing the wheel\\", which my studies in women's history had taught me was done again and again by women, specifically because we have not had access to our foremothers' experience and achievements-one consequence of the fact that we still learn both history and art history from a male-centered bias with insufficient inclusion of women's achievements. I must admit that when I re-read Through the Flower, I winced at some of the unabashed honesty; at the same time, I am glad that my youthful self had the courage to speak so directly about my life and work. I doubt that I could recapture the candor that allowed this book to reflect such unabashed confidence that the world would accept revelations so lacking in self-consciousness. And yet, it is precisely this lack that helps give the book its flavor, the flavor of the seventies, when so many of us believed that we could change the world for the better, a goal that has been-as one of my friends put it-\\"mugged by reality\\". And yet, better an overly idealistic hope that the world could be reshaped for the better than a cynical acceptance of the status quo. At least we tried-and I'm still trying. Perhaps I'm just too old now to change.

Home to the largest concentration of African Americans who settled outside the South, it spawned the literary and artistic movement known as the Harlem Renaissance. Its writers were in the vanguard of an attempt to come to terms with black urbanization. They lived it and wrote about it. First published in 1988, Black Culture and the Harlem Renaissance examines the relationship between the community and its literature. Author Cary Wintz analyzes the movement's emergence within the framework of the black social and intellectual history of early twentieth-century America. He begins with Booker T. Washington, W. E. B. Du Bois, and others whose work broke barriers for the Renaissance writers to come. With an emphasis on social issues--like writers and politics, the role of black women, and the interplay between black writers and the white community--Wintz traces the rise and fall of the movement. Of special interest is material from the Knopf Collection and the papers of several Renaissance figures acquired by the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin. It reveals much of interest about the relationship between the publishing world, its writers, and their patrons--both black and white.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=e12tAAAAIAAJ&dq=Black+Culture+and+the+Harlem+Renaissance&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The All Souls' Waiting Room","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=MS8JAAAACAAJ&dq=The+All+Souls%27+Waiting+Room&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"WATERLESS MOUNTAIN","description":"Younger Brother, a Navaho Indian boy, undergoes eight years of training in the ancient religion of his people and the practical knowledge of material existence.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2YytAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Darwin's Origin of Species: A condensed version of the first edition of 1859","description":"Read the Origin of Species and enjoy it.

We are fascinated by their way of life, their creativity, sophistication and self-assurance, and even their insistence that they are exceptional. But how did France become the country it is today, and what really sets it apart? Journalist and historian Peter Watson sets out to answer these questions in The French Mind, a dazzling history of France that takes us from the seventeenth century to the present day through the nation s most influential thinkers. He opens the doors to the Renaissance salons that were a breeding ground for poets, philosophers and scientists, and tells the forgotten stories of the extraordinary succession of women who ran these institutions, fostering a culture of stylish intellectualism unmatched anywhere else in the world. It s a story that takes us into Bohemian caf s and cabarets, into chic Parisian high culture via French philosophies of food, fashion and sex, while growing unrest hastens the bloody birth of a republic. From the 1789 revolution to the country s occupation by Nazi Germany, Watson argues that a unique series of devastating military defeats helped shape the resilient, proud, innovative character of the French. This is a history of breathtaking ambition, propelled by the characters Watson brings to vivid life: the writers, revolutionaries and painters who loved, inspired and rivalled one another over four hundred years. It documents the shaping of a nation whose global influence, in art, culture and politics, cannot be overstated.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PgA3EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All About Turkeys","description":"The life cycle of a turkey and its habitat are introduced to young readers.

What were their experiences? What cultural baggage did they bring with them, and how did it affect their lives in America? How did the German-speaking immigrants differ among themselves, and how did these differences influence their behavior and reactions? Contented among Strangers attempts to answer these questions by examining the central role German-speaking women played in preserving their ethnic and cultural identity in rural areas of the Midwest. Even while living far from their original homelands, these women applied traditional European patterns of rural family life and values to their new homes in Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska. As a result they were often more content with their modest lives than were their Anglo-American counterparts. Through personal recollections - including interesting diary accounts translated by the author, church and community documents, and migration and census data - Pickle reveals the diversity and richness of the women's experiences.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=uLn9DkeROV4C&dq=Contented+among+Strangers:+Rural+German-Speaking+Women+and+Their+Families+in+the+Nineteenth-Century+Midwest+(Statue+of+Liberty+Ellis+Island)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"When This Cruel War Is Over","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=AyiaQCKy7P8C&dq=When+This+Cruel+War+Is+Over&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Leave Myself Behind","description":"The Alex Awardwinning novel of a young gay man s search for meaning from an author whose  voice is more than just honest or original; it s real  (The Plain Dealer).

A vicious war is being fought on the ground, but in the skies above, life is perhaps even more precarious; especially for those flying the A-6 Intruders just above the treetops. Navy aviator Jake 'Cool Hand' Grafton and his bombardier-navigator Morgan 'Morg' McPherson are only too aware that each flight could be their last. And when a farmer's bullet hits Morg during an attack mission on yet another suspected truck depot, Grafton is forced to question whether these missions are really worth risking their lives for. Grafton is next paired up with veteran bombardier Virgil 'Tiger' Cole, and it doesn't take long for the two to formulate a plan. They choose a new target: a Communist Party centre in Hanoi; an unauthorized mark that not only defies the American military's rules of engagement, but one that will require all the skill and nerve they can muster. Told with an authenticity possible only from someone who has shared the experiences of his protagonist, Flight of the Intruder is widely considered a classic of naval aviation fiction. The first in the hugely popular Jake Grafton series, it also marked the beginning of Stephen Coonts' career as a bestselling author.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MzVhBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Suzuki Piano School Volumes 1 & 2 - Compact Disc (Aide)","description":"The New International Edition of Suzuki Piano School, Volume 1 includes French, German and Spanish translations as well as a newly recorded CD performed by internationally renowned recording artist Seizo Azuma.

A number of prominent virtuosi attribute a large portion of their development to the diligent study of these works. Sor's studies address an impressive array of technical and musical topics, including proper left-hand fingering, training of the right hand, interval and chord formations, scales, arpeggios, repeated notes, ligados, barring, natural harmonics, control of note duration, balance of melody versus accompaniment, and the handling of contrapuntal voices. A careful study of these pieces will lay the groundwork for a solid technique and allow the guitarist to build the control necessary for the expression of his or her musical concepts. In preparing this edition David Grimes worked with Sor's original publications, but incorporated some alterations that appear in those studies that Napoleon Coste chose to include in his Methode complete pour la Guitarre par Ferdinand Sor. Furthermore, Mr. Grimes has corrected misprints, modernized the notation and rectified some inconsistencies. Finally, some developments in technique since Sor's day have been incorporated in this edition.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5GAF1Skgn5MC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Practice Management for the Dental Team","description":"Learn the business skills you need to run a dental office!

Hunting by forest-dwelling people has a dramatic effect on wildlife in many tropical forests, frequently driving species to local extinction, with devastating implications for other species and the health of the forests themselves. But wildlife is an important source of protein and cash for rural peoples. Can hunting be managed to conserve biological communities while meeting human needs? Are hunting rates as practiced by tropical forest peoples sustainable? If not, what are the biological, social, and cultural implications of this failure? Answering these questions is ever more important as national and international agencies seek to integrate the development of local peoples with the conservation of tropical forest systems and species. This book presents a wide array of studies that examine the sustainability of hunting as practiced by rural peoples. Comprising work by both biological and social scientists, Hunting for Sustainability in Tropical Forests provides a balanced viewpoint on the ecological and human aspects of this hunting. The first section examines the effects of hunting on wildlife in tropical forests throughout the world. The next section looks at the importance of hunting to local communities. The third section looks at institutional challenges of resource management, while the fourth draws on economic perspectives to understand both hunting and sustainability. A final section provides synthesis and summary of the factors that influence sustainability and the implications for management. Drawing on examples from Ecuador to Congo-Zaire to Sulawesi, Hunting for Sustainability in Tropical Forests will be a valuable resource to policymakers, conservation organizations, and students and scholars of biology, ecology, and anthropology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ZawmOh3IZ_IC&dq=Hunting+for+Sustainability+in+Tropical+Forests&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"McGuffey's pictorial eclectic primer (Eclectic educational series)","description":"Eclectic Primer (newly revised) with pictorial illustrations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8NsHAAAACAAJ&dq=McGuffey%27s+pictorial+eclectic+primer+(Eclectic+educational+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mining West: A Bibliography & Guide to the History & Literature of Mining the American & Canadian West","description":"This two-volume set cites books, pamphlets, maps, music, directories, and other published materials (excluding materials from technical and popular magazines and newspapers) on the history of mining in the American and Canadian West.

We can never be satisfied, because the products we love cannot love us back.

The average American is exposed to over 3,000 advertisements a day and watches three years' worth of television ads over the course of a lifetime. Kilbourne paints a gripping portrait of how this barrage of advertising drastically affects young people, especially girls, by offering false promises of rebellion, connection, and control.

Drawing on diaries, letters and interviews, Michael Haag recovers the lost life of the city, its cosmopolitan inhabitants and its literary characters. Located on the coast of Africa yet rich in historical associations with Western civilization, Alexandria was home to an exotic variety of people whose cosmopolitan families had long been rooted in the commerce and the culture of the entire Mediterranean world. Alexandria famously excited the imaginations of writers, and Haag folds intimate accounts of E. M. Forster, Greek poet Constantine Cavafy and Lawrence Durrell into the story of its inhabitants. He recounts the city's experience of the two world wars and explores the communities that gave Alexandria its unique flavour: the Greek, the Italian and the Jewish. The book deftly harnesses the sexual and emotional charge of cosmopolitan life in this extraordinary city, and highlights the social and political changes over the decades that finally led to Nasser's Egypt. 'Michael Haag's 'Alexandria' is a remarkable achievement.Not merely a composite biography of Forster, Cavafy and Durrell, or their relations with the city, it is also a history of Alexandria, full of fascinating detail.' Professor Sir Frank Kermode Michael Haag is a writer, photographer and publisher. He published and provided the afterword and notes to the first British edition of E. M. Forster's 'Alexandria: A History and a Guide', and he is the author/photographer of 'Alexandria Illustrated' (The American University in Cairo Press).","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2rRuMAEACAAJ&dq=Alexandria:+City+of+Memory&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sensible Cruising: The Thoreau Approach : A Philosophic and Practical Approach to Cruising","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_mwoAAAACAAJ&dq=Sensible+Cruising:+The+Thoreau+Approach+:+A+Philosophic+and+Practical+Approach+to+Cruising&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Queen Mother","description":"Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother 1900 - 2002 presents the life of a remarkable woman. A Canadian perspective on a sovereign who created and cultivated a special relationship with Canada, it is the portrait of a queen who always evoked passionate reactions. Whether it was the anonymous soldier who vowed \\"to fight for that little lady,\\" Adolf Hitler who described her as \\"the most dangerous woman in Europe,\\" or the Canadian journalist who coined the expression \\"the Queen Mum,\\" the Queen Mother seldom left people unmoved. Opening with the royal tour of 1939, during which Canadians first felt her personal magnetism, Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother 1900 - 2002 describes Elizabeth s background and development, relating how she made a marriage that brought her to the centre stage of public life. It traces her tender support of her shy husband, a reluctant king, shows how she began her Commonwealth role, and recalls her shock at the sudden and unexpected call to wear the Crown. Faced with the never-ending duties of a queen, Elizabeth proved capable of providing inspired leadership for a society faced with the stark prospect of destruction in a war to save the world. On the premature death of her beloved husband she became Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother, a role that has shaped nearly half her life, and one in which Canada has always played an important part. The authors analyze Her Majesty s successes and failures, both public and private, against the background of a century of violent disruption, material achievement, and incredible change.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oPrnAqHwn9AC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Psychoboys","description":"Psychoboys, Bertie Marshall's debut novel, is set in the cities of Moscow and Berlin.

He addresses questions about the growing of wine, making it, finding and buying it (including a demystification of the puzzling information on wine labels), storing and aging it, and serving it (where should you store your glasses to assure good tasting?). Most attention, however, is paid to enjoying it, including how to handle restaurant wine lists and rituals, how your health can affect your tasting, and how to get the most from the matching of food and wine. Each chapter is peppered with  Grape Flashes,  containing interesting bits of information, and the book also includes a glossary of wine terms, a simple guide to food and wine matching, and a selected bibliography for further reading. Edward Finstein believes that the most important thing about wine is enjoyment  and understanding aids that enjoyment.

The Union army s victory at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, on July 3, 1863, is widely considered to have been the turning point in America s War between the States. But the valuable contributions of the mounted troops, both Northern and Rebel, in the decisive three-day conflict have gone largely unrecognized. Acclaimed Civil War historian Eric J. Wittenberg now gives the cavalries their proper due. In Gettysburg s Forgotten Cavalry Actions, Wittenberg explores three important mounted engagements undertaken during the battle and how they influenced the final outcome. The courageous but doomed response by Brig. Gen. Elon J. Farnsworth s cavalry brigade in the wake of Pickett s Charge is recreated in fascinating detail, revealing the fatal flaws in the general s plan to lead his riders against entrenched Confederate infantry and artillery. The tenacious assault led by Brig. Gen. Wesley Merritt on South Cavalry Field is also examined, as is the strategic victory at Fairfield by Southern troops that nearly destroyed the Sixth US Cavalry and left Hagerstown Road open, enabling General Lee s eventual retreat. Winner of the prestigious Bachelder-Coddington Award for historical works concerning the Battle of Gettysburg, Eric J. Wittenberg s Gettysburg s Forgotten Cavalry Actions rights a long-standing wrong by lifting these all-important engagements out of obscurity. A must-read for Civil War buffs everywhere, it completes the story of the battle that changed American history forever.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=m8OIDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bathwater's Hot (Nursery collection)","description":"A little girl discovers that all things have an opposite.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=D1vhAAAAMAAJ&dq=Bathwater%27s+Hot+(Nursery+collection)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Truck","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fdfyDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"From script to print: An introduction to medieval vernacular literature (Sidgwick & Jackson softcover editions)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=QZE5zwEACAAJ&dq=From+script+to+print:+An+introduction+to+medieval+vernacular+literature+(Sidgwick&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Come to the Table: Revisioning the Lord's Supper","description":"A biblically rich and engaging invitation to a deeper understanding of and the participation in the Lord's Supper.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=r9wKAAAACAAJ&dq=Come+to+the+Table:+Revisioning+the+Lord%27s+Supper&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"History of the Indians of Connecticut from the earliest known period to 1850","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4OwNAAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Freemasons: What do they believe?","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=X73VdoQJ_ioC&dq=Freemasons:+What+do+they+believe%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Only in My Dreams","description":"Kristen Dorman is tired of dating players.

Clad in his dark cowl and cape, he has captured the imagination of millions with his single-minded mission to create a better world for the people of Gotham City by fighting crime, making use of expert detective skills, high-tech crime-fighting gadgets, and an extensive network of sidekicks and partners. But why has this self-made hero enjoyed such enduring popularity? And why are his choices so often the subject of intense debate among his fans and philosophers alike? Batman and Ethics goes behind the mask to shed new light on the complexities and contradictions of the Dark Knight s moral code. From the logic behind his aversion to killing to the moral status of vigilantism and his use of torture in pursuit of justice (or perhaps revenge), Batman s ethical precepts are compelling but often inconsistent and controversial. Philosopher and pop culture expert Mark D. White uses the tools of moral philosophy to track Batman s most striking ethical dilemmas and decisions across his most prominent storylines from the early 1970s through the launch of the New 52, and suggests how understanding the mercurial moral character of the caped crusader might help us reconcile our own. A thought-provoking and entertaining journey through four decades of Batman s struggles and triumphs in time for the franchise s 80th anniversary, Batman and Ethics is a perfect gateway into the complex questions of moral philosophy through a focused character study of this most famous of fictional superheroes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=hJeHDwAAQBAJ&dq=Batman:+Evolution+(No+Man%27s+Land)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"DEEPWATER: A NOVEL OF THE CAROLINAS","description":"In a sweeping saga celebrating the Carolinas, Tess Hancock, her beautiful sister, Glory, and their descendants carve out lives for themselves amidst the glory of America.

Working to understand and explain why and how this would happen, she offers hope to all women with similar stories, modeling the courage to break free, move forward and live a joyful life full of love.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=AQeVMQEACAAJ&dq=I+Closed+My+Eyes:+Revelations+of+a+Battered+Woman&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Psychology: An Evolutionary Approach","description":"Aims to show the relevance of evolutionary thinking to the range of psychological phenomena.

It explains a palace as an element in royal propaganda seeking to influence social concepts about kingship, and a text about a temple as influencing social concepts about the relationship between God and human beings. Applying the methods of analysis developed in built environment studies, the author interprets the palace and temple building programs of Sennacherib, King of Assyria, and Solomon, King of Israel. The physical evidence for the palace and the verbal evidence for the temple are explained as presenting communicative icons intended to influence contemporary political and religious concepts. The volume concludes with innovative interpretations of the contributions of architectural and verbal icons to religious and political reform.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=UwYu6oITBZsC&dq=Palace&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Affair of the Heart (Arabesque)","description":"Nikita Harrell's drive and determination took her to the pinnacle of the New York publishing world.

These interrelated fields are all covered in this textbook for chemists and chemical engineers. This new edition of the standard work 'Nuclear Chemistry' has been completely rewritten and restructured to suit teaching and learning needs in a wide range of chemistry courses, such as basic courses in radiochemistry, or more advanced nuclear chemistry courses. The book is divided into sections that closely fit teaching demands. The first chapter gives a broad introduction and background to the subject, and the second chapter covers stable isotopes. Chapters 3 to 9 comprise what is generally regarded as 'radiochemistry'. Chapters 10 to 17 offer a course in nuclear reaction chemistry. Chapter 18 deals with biological radiation effects for the chemist. The last four chapters give a guide to nuclear energy: energy production, fuel cycle, waste management, the largest applied field of nuclear chemistry. Over 200 exercises, with model answers, remain largely unchanged from the first edition, so teachers working from the earlier text should find only advantages in switching to this new restructured course book on all aspects of nuclear chemistry. 'The book fully meets the authors objectives, it is well written in a logical, objective, thought-provoking and quite easily readable style. It should appeal to the serious student of radio- and nuclear chemistry at either undergraduate or postgraduate level, as well as to readers with a more general interest in nuclear science and its impact on the environment.' - Applied Radiation and Isotopes, July 1995 'This book is an excellent, readable account of a significant part of the scientific achievements of more than half this century. The authors have dedicated the book to Nobel Laureate Glenn T. Seaborg and its scholarship makes it a fitting tribute.' - Radiological Protection Bulletin, December 1995","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=G1IXBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Light Pollution: Responses and Remedies (Patrick Moore's Practical Astronomy Series)","description":"Light-pollution is the modern scourge of optical astronomy. An increasing number of observing sites are in danger of being rendered useless due to the glare of city lighting blotting out the night sky. Professional astronomical observatories are located far from cities, but amateur astronomers often do not have this luxury. This book considers the two available strategies open to Astronomers. The first involves campaigning against light pollution by lobbying Authorities and Standards Organisations, and the second involves using the correct instrumentation. The book contains an extensive detailed catalogue of deep-sky and other objects that - despite what one might believe - can be seen from variously light-polluted sites, for practical observers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4VLlBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How I found Livingstone: Travels, adventures, and discoveries in Central Africa, including an account of four months' residence with Dr. Livingstone","description":"Livingstone's 1840s expedition into Africa, the \\"Dark Continent\\", caught the public's imagination.

In this classic book, Jerome Bruner inquires into the part these qualities play in determining how we know what we do know; how we can help others to know--that is, to teach; and how our conception of reality affects our actions and is modified by them. The striking and subtle discussions contained in On Knowing take on the core issues concerning man's sense of self: creativity, the search for identity, the nature of aesthetic knowledge, myth, the learning process, and modern-day attitudes toward social controls, Freud, and fate. In this revised, expanded edition, Bruner comments on his personal efforts to maintain an intuitively and rationally balanced understanding of human nature, taking into account the odd historical circumstances which have hindered academic psychology's attempts in the past to know man. Writing with wit, imagination, and deep sympathy for the human condition, Jerome Bruner speaks here to the part of man's mind that can never be completely satisfied by the right-handed virtues of order, rationality, and discipline.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=vAJevMzhIKYC&dq=On+knowing:+Essays+for+the+left+hand&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","description":"When Was The Last Time You Felt Really Healthy?

The actions are appropriate regardless of likelihood of an attack, scale of attack, or government alert level; designed to be sensitive to potential variations; and defined in terms of simple rules that should be easy for individuals to adopt.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BNN7cS-DVDAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gang","description":"While gangs and gang culture have been around for countless centuries, The Gang is one of the first academic studies of the phenomenon. Originally published in 1927, Frederic Milton Thrasher s magnum opus offers a profound and careful analysis of hundreds of gangs in Chicago in the early part of the twentieth century. With rich prose and an eye for detail, Thrasher looked specifically at the way in which urban geography shaped gangs, and posited the thesis that neighborhoods in flux were more likely to produce gangs. Moreover, he traced gang culture back to feudal and medieval power systems and linked tribal ethos in other societies to codes of honor and glory found in American gangs. Thrasher approaches his subject with empathy and insightfulness, and creates a multifaceted and textured portrait that still has much to offer to readers today. With handsome images that evoke the era, this unabridged edition of The Gang not only explores an important moment in the history of Chicago, but also is itself a landmark in the history of sociology and subcultural theory.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=SgukBnHIKd8C&dq=The+Gang&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Custom Paint Your Car (Motorbooks Workshop)","description":"\\"Dennis Parks' updated edition of How To Paint Your Car features comprehensive guidance on every aspect of automotive painting and exterior upkeep.

From Black Elk to the Dalai Lama -- from Hun Tun and mescaline to motorcycle Zen and mind at large -- the acclaimed author of Paradise Fever has followed many roads in pursuit of a universal truth. And he has survived to tell the tale. The Beaten Path Ptolemy Tompkins came of age in the '70s -- before Americans began spending uplifting Tuesdays with Morrie or perusing Little Instruction Books. In the wake of a quintessentially New Age childhood as the son of the radical freethinker Peter Tompkins, author of the bestselling The Secret Life of Plants, Ptolemy began a personal quest for enlightenment decades before it became trendy to do so. He gained much valuable insight as he careened from Buddha to the Bhagavad-Gita, from Krishna to Carlos Castaneda. But how much actual \\"wisdom\\" he accrued is a matter the author himself admits is up for debate. The Beaten Path is a work of great intelligence that is profound, moving, and hilariously entertaining. In his funny and touching account of a spiritual journey that went wildly off course, the author bares his soul even as he knocks down the gaudy signposts that guide eager pilgrims through today's pop-wisdom landscape. Yet he never loses sight of what is valuable and true in the literature of the spirit. Part gripping personal memoir, part merciless-yet-affectionate critique, and part genuine prescription for the good life, The Beaten Path is a provocative gift from a man who left no page unturned, no odyssey uncompleted, in his determination to find direction and meaning in the cosmos. In exploring what it is that makes so many of his contemporaries actively seek the light of peace and transformation in its most convenient and palatable form, he offers readers a unique, idiosyncratic insight into our modern world. And he has great fun while doing so.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=F4ymHAAACAAJ&dq=The+Beaten+Path:+Field+Notes+on+Getting+Wise+in+a+Wisdom-Crazy+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The romance of Leonardo da Vinci","description":"Reproduction of the original: The Romance of Leonardo da Vinci by Dmitry Sergeyevich Merezhkovsky","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Bsj1DwAAQBAJ&dq=The+romance+of+Leonardo+da+Vinci&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rosie and the Rustlers (Sunburst Book)","description":"Rosie and her wranglers meet up with Greasy Ben and his gang in this rollicking tale of adventure.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=IFNUOQAACAAJ&dq=Rosie+and+the+Rustlers+(Sunburst+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mad's Spy Vs.

What took place in Auschwitz revokes what Adorno termed the \\"Western legacy of positivity,  the innermost substance of traditional philosophy. The prime task of philosophy then remains to reflect on its own failure, its own complicity in such events. Yet in linking the question of philosophy to historical occurrence, Adorno seems not to have abandoned his paradoxical, life-long hope that philosophy might not be entirely closed to the idea of redemption. He prepares for an altogether different praxis, one no longer conceived in traditionally Marxist terms but rather to be gleaned from \\"metaphysical experience.  In this collection, Adorno's literary executor has assembled the definitive introduction to his thinking. Its five sections anatomize the range of Adorno's concerns: \\"Toward a New Categorical Imperative,  \\"Damaged Life,  \\"Administered World, Reified Thought,  \\"Art, Memory of Suffering,  and \\"A Philosophy That Keeps Itself Alive.  A substantial number of Adorno s writings included appear here in English for the first time. This collection comes with an eloquent introduction from Rolf Tiedemann, the literary executor of Adorno s work.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=nMd67tJAwuEC&dq=Can+One+Live+After+Auschwitz%3F:+A+Philosophical+Reader&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Political Sabotage: The LAPD Experience; Attitudes Toward Understanding Police Use of Force:","description":"Political Sabotage may not be the answer for all in understanding social crime and violence or police use of force to control it, but it does provide a focus and single source toward that goal. Want to know about Ruby Ridge and Randy Weaver, Rodney King and a truer story about the fiasco at Waco, Texas? Did law enforcement do it right? Maybe, but maybe not. These questions are also answered: What facts and experience create the subtleties for \\"the mystique of police culture?\\" Is a true unprofessional \\"code of silence\\" part of it? Is that culture a closed club for those wearing the badge of the Los Angeles Police Department? Is its \\"culture\\" and its use of police force in the attempt to control crime and violence responsible for the LAPD's downfall? Does diversity and affirmative action exist as co-conspirators in that downfall? Or will it all remain as the unknown result of the influence and impact of the emotional and ideological attitudes found in our American society and its sometimes politicized, attorney dominated, and unjust justice system? What part did political sabotage play in orchestrating what academic isolation and a supporting media label \\"the ineffective administration of a corrupt LAPD?\\" And what led that leadership through a moderate level of hesitation and silence to a federal consent decree and various \\"commission investigations,\\" and to every activist and media embellished blame, to forgo the effort to retain the best parts of what had once made the LAPD the most innovative, respected, effective and efficient police organization in America?

While Johnson's Dictionary remains a monument of scholarship, and his essays and criticism command continuing respect, we owe our knowledge of the man himself to this biography. Through a series of wonderfully detailed anecdotes, Johnson emerges as a sociable figure with a huge appetite for life, crossing swords with other great eighteenth-century luminaries, from Garrick and Goldsmith to Burney and Burke, even his long-suffering friend and disciple James Boswell. Yet Johnson had a vulnerable, even tragic, side and anxieties and obsessions haunted his private hours. Boswells sensitivity and insight into every facet of his subjects character ultimately make this biography as moving as it is entertaining.Based on the 1799 edition, Christopher Hibbert's abridgement preserves the integrity of the original, while his fascinating introduction sets Boswell's view of Samuel Johnson against that of others of the time.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t5dSEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Deceiving the Deceivers: Kim Philby, Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess","description":"Among the more sensational espionage cases of the Cold War were those of Moscow s three British spies Kim Philby, Donald Maclean, and Guy Burgess. In this riveting book, S. J. Hamrick draws on documentary evidence concealed for almost half a century in reconstructing the complex series of 19471951 events that led British intelligence to identify all three as Soviet agents. Basing his argument primarily on the Venona archive of broken Soviet codes released in 19951996 as well as on complementary Moscow and London sources, Hamrick refutes the myth of MI5 s identification of Maclean as a Soviet agent in the spring of 1951. British intelligence knew far earlier that Maclean was Moscow s agent and concealed that knowledge in a 19491951 counterespionage operation that deceived Philby and Burgess. Hamrick also introduces compelling evidence of a 19491950 British disinformation initiative using Philby to mislead Moscow on Anglo-American retaliatory military capability in the event of Soviet aggression in Western Europe. Engagingly written and impressively documented, Deceiving the Deceivers breaks new ground in reinterpreting the final espionage years of three infamous spies and in clarifying fifty years of conjecture, confusion, and error in Anglo-American intelligence history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=yybGuSBeujUC&dq=Deceiving+the+Deceivers:+Kim+Philby,+Donald+Maclean+and+Guy+Burgess&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Green Thumb: A Mystery Set at the University of Notre Dame (Roger & Philip Knight)","description":"Brothers Roger and Philip Knight investigate the death of a prominent Notre Dame donor, digging into animosities lingering since the victim's undergraduate days.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=rGVoDX_hmH8C&dq=Green+Thumb:+A+Mystery+Set+at+the+University+of+Notre+Dame+(Roger&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"\\"I Do\\"...Weddings: Guide To Starting Your Own Wedding Consulting Business","description":"Say I Do to Success From wedding bells to wedding bills, gain an inside look at the billion dollar wedding industry and learn how to earn your next pay check coordinating the big day of today s brides and grooms.

During the 18th and 19th centuries, it is estimated that one out of every ten people died from the disease; some say one out of every seven. Smallpox attacked very young children in particular. The story progresses with the practice of variolation, the life of Edward Jenner who first proposed 'vaccination' with cow pox vaccine (little James Phipps was the first person ever vaccinated in this way), the years of debate about the efficacy of this novel method, and the later worldwide initiatives to rid the planet of this horrific disease. In 1979, the story culminates in the only total eradication of an infectious disease that mankind has ever accomplished. This year celebrates the 20th anniversary of this momentous achievement. In the intervening years, debate has raged about what we should do with the remaining smallpox viral stocks. Do we destroy them, so they can't fall into the hands of bioterrorists, or do we maintain them, in case they may be of use in some unexpected way, for therapeutic purposes? These questions are thoroughly discussed in the book. Key Features * Covers the background, history and origin of smallpox, and brings the story up to the present day * Gives full and interesting details of Jenner's life, and tells how this humble country doctor brought about a revolution in vaccination * Includes many quotes from historical figures * Features 120 high quality photographs, many originating from unique historical plates in the author's private collection * Includes new research data * Provides new views on the eradication and destruction of smallpox","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=x_jdZwEACAAJ&dq=The+Eradication+of+Small+Pox:+Edward+Jenner+and+The+First+and+Only+Eradication+of+a+Human+Infectious+Disease&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pueblo crafts, ([United States] Office of Indian Affairs.

SILENT. DEADLY. It's a mystery when Major Ray Kerman, a high-ranking SAS officer and renowned submariner, disappears one day amidst a blood bath on the streets of Hebron. In the following months, a series of utterly devastating Hamas terrorist hits stuns the British and American governments. Plainly, a military genius is at work. Kerman, intelligence chiefs believe, has crossed over to the enemy's side. When, in quick succession, the main US oil supply lines from Alaska are attacked and destroyed, without trace or clue, one of the Pentagon's worst nightmares may have come true. Has Kerman acquired a nuclear submarine, and navigated the killing machine through the treacherous straights of the northern Pacific, and on down the American West Coast? The Pentagon now stands helpless in the face of an enemy they cannot see, and cannot stop -- the mysterious Barracuda 945.

She focuses on the shared meanings and understandings of policy as they are created through sociocultural interaction. Using Kenneth Burke?s philosophy and critical method of dramatism as a theoretical framework, she shows how Reagan?s SDI program appealed symbolically to a nostalgic sense of American history, replete with powerful images of American innocence and technological ingenuity in the face of difficult obstacles. Bjork concludes that the program has been shielded from criticism, has achieved symbolic and bureaucratic momentum, and serves to reinforce the isolation felt by ordinary American citizens from access to decisions over life and death issues.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=A2qArDmyh5IC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Toddler: Real-Life Stories of Those Fickle, Irrational, Urgent, Tiny People We Love","description":"Forty delightful essays explore the day-to-day experience of parenting toddlers--those fickle, urgent, irrational, tiny people everyone loves.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=dXBXswEACAAJ&dq=Toddler:+Real-Life+Stories+of+Those+Fickle,+Irrational,+Urgent,+Tiny+People+We+Love&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The coach: Creating partnerships for a competitive edge (Partnerships in the workplace)","description":"This book is about the coaching process and the skills, behaviors, courage, and values leaders need in order to evoke employee commitment and motivation.

Roderick L. Haig-Brown writes of fishing not just as a sport, but also as an art. He knows moving water and the life within it its subtlest mysteries and perpetual delights. He is a man who knows fish lore as few people ever will, and the legends and history of a great sport. Month by month, he takes you from river to river, down at last to the saltwater and the sea: in January, searching for the steelhead in the dark, cold water; in May, fishing for bright, sea-run cutthroats; and on to the chilly days of October and the majestic run of spawning salmon. All the great joy of angling is here: the thrill of fishing during a thunderstorm, the sight of a river in freshet or a river calm and hushed, the suspense of a skillful campaign to capture some half-glimpsed trout or salmon of extraordinary size, and the excitement of playing and landing a momentous fish. A River Never Sleeps is one of the enduring classics of angling. It will provide a rich reading experience for all who love fishing or rivers. Skyhorse Publishing is proud to publish a broad range of books for fishermen. Our books for anglers include titles that focus on fly fishing, bait fishing, fly-casting, spin casting, deep sea fishing, and surf fishing. Our books offer both practical advice on tackle, techniques, knots, and more, as well as lyrical prose on fishing for bass, trout, salmon, crappie, baitfish, catfish, and more. While not every title we publish becomes a New York Times bestseller or a national bestseller, we are committed to publishing books on subjects that are sometimes overlooked by other publishers and to authors whose work might not otherwise find a home.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UvbpBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"When the Brain Dies First (Single Titles-Science)","description":"Examines the functioning of the human brain, various causes that impede its proper functioning, and research into prevention and treatment of brain injuries and disorders.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Qn_xGwAACAAJ&dq=When+the+Brain+Dies+First+(Single+Titles-Science)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A century of dishonor: A sketch of the United States government's dealings with some of the Indian tribes","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=asRiAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tragedy and Triumph: A pilot's life through war and peace","description":"\\"James \\"Paladin\\" Fore life as a Pilot through war and peace.\\" --Goodreads.com.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=HMVFzQEACAAJ&dq=Tragedy+and+Triumph:+A+pilot%27s+life+through+war+and+peace&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Why You Say It","description":"\\"In this volume some of the most prominent international biblical and theological scholars suggest new and exciting ways of understanding the Christology of every major witness in the New Testament canon.

Critics on the left (in particular Marxists) argue that the separation of language from its societal context reinforces the status quo by downplaying the role of language as an instrument of ideology and social control. Critics on the right object to the value-free analyses of individual languages required by the autonomous approach and to the idea that all languages merit equal attention. The Politics of Linguistics surveys two centuries of debate over autonomy. The discussion includes the political implications of the birth of the modern field of linguistics in the Romantic movement, the views of Marx and Engels on language, the attack on structural linguistics by both Hitler and Stalin, the role of Christian missionary groups and the military in building the field in the United States, and the relation between Noam Chomsky's linguistic theories and his political views. Frederick J. Newmeyer demonstrates that external political demonstrates that external political currents have often influenced the relative popularity of the autonomous approach to language. He argues that autonomous linguistics, far from being inconsistent with progressive political goals, can be creatively applied to the fulfillment of such goals.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=D0B9QgAACAAJ&dq=The+Politics+of+Linguistics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lincoln at Cooper Union : The Speech That Made Abraham Lincoln President","description":"Winner of the Lincoln Prize Lincoln at Cooper Union explores Lincoln's most influential and widely reported pre-presidential address -- an extraordinary appeal by the western politician to the eastern elite that propelled him toward the Republican nomination for president. Delivered in New York in February 1860, the Cooper Union speech dispelled doubts about Lincoln's suitability for the presidency and reassured conservatives of his moderation while reaffirming his opposition to slavery to Republican progressives. Award-winning Lincoln scholar Harold Holzer places Lincoln and his speech in the context of the times -- an era of racism, politicized journalism, and public oratory as entertainment -- and shows how the candidate framed the speech as an opportunity to continue his famous \\"debates\\" with his archrival Democrat Stephen A.

Schmetterling is German for butterfly. In Yoel Hoffmann's new book, these and numerous other creatures, cultures, and languages meet in a magical shimmering hymn to childhood. Hoffmann traces his hero's developing consciousness of the ways-and-wonders of the world as though he were peering through a tremendous kaleidoscope: all that was perceived, all that is remembered, is rendered in fluid fragments of color and light. With remarkable delicacy and sweep, Hoffmann captures childhood from the amazed inside out, and without the backward-looking wash of grown-up sentiment. Instead, the boy's deadpan registration of the human comedy around him is offered up as strangely magical fact. Beautifully translated by Peter Cole, The Shunra & the Schmetterling is fiction for lovers of poetry and poetry for lovers of fiction--a small marvel of a book, and one of the author's finest to date.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=mPxJfohF0mgC&dq=The+Shunra+and+the+Schmetterling&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"No Name (Penguin Classics)","description":"Magdalen and her sister Norah, beloved daughters of Mr and Mrs Vanstone, find themselves the victims of a catastrophic oversight.

Each story of twenty to thirty pages comprises detailed experiences with maps and photographs. \\"They removed the handcuffs, stretched my arms out spread eagle against the wall and pinned a target on my chest. Leg irons clamped on both legs and a blindfold over my eyes. . .At the same time I could hear the rifle butts hit the flagstone path and I knew what that meant. It was ready, aim, fire and that's it, and in those seconds my life flashed before me.\\" After three and a half years in Japanese prisons in China, this veteran of World War II, Korea and Vietnam was on the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo 18 April 1942, and tells of his capture and imprisonment in the story Freedom is for Those Willing to Defend It. I Dreamed of Steel Chargers with Skies to Roam, but Mostly I Dreamed of Just Going Home is a story of five and a half years in the Hanoi Hilton. An F-105 American pilot depicts more than torture in the infamous Knobby Room at Hoa Lo Prison and isolation without mail from his wife and five children, he discloses how he survived with three others in a 12 x 12 concrete cell for five years and their longing to see America once more. \\"We faced east which was toward home and where an American flag was flying and with a hand placed over our heart pledged allegiance to the flag.\\" Bursting the noise ban, they loudly sang The Star Spangled Banner while another cell in greater volume burst into God Bless America and another, even louder, America the Beautiful, and another and another throughout the cells of the prison camp until silenced by Vietnamese guards with tear gas and bayonets. A twist of unexpected humor surfaces in No Place to Hide, when a bombardier lieutenant is forced to jump out of bed while still in his shorts and salute General Twining; when his Purple Heart goes unclaimed because he was wounded on his anatomy in a place he never wanted to explain. \\"I decided to hand crank the stuck bomb bay doors shut. I took off my flak jacket, parachute, and Mae West life jacket, and headed for the open bomb bay. The quarters were too tight to work with those strapped to my body. I instructed the flight sergeant to hand me a new oxygen bottle every thirty seconds, since I didn't want to run out of oxygen, pass out, and fall out the bomb bay without a parachute. I got out on the six-inch catwalk, leaned over the open bomb bay and looked down at the ground 28,000 feet below. . .\\" In the invasion of Guam, a Marine from the 3rd Marine Division tells of the fight on the beach and scaling the Chonito Cliffs in The Sounds and Smells of War I Know So Very Well. \\"The next morning descending from Fonte Canyon by an easier route than the cliffs we had scaled, we witnessed an astounding spectacle. Looking down from a ridge trail into the desolate ruins of Aga a, once a metropolis of 12,000, the Japanese soldiers were holding a full-dress ceremony on a bomb-pocked avenue of the capital city, or what was left of it. Flashing Samurai swords gleamed in the sun as they paraded wearing full combat regalia. We ordered an artillery concentration, but it was too late to catch the prideful retreating Imperial enemy.\\" Trusting to My Instinct is about a young recruit from ranch country thrown into battle and learned from experience why the training manual was incomplete. \\"Reaching battalion headquarters with the POW, I placed him in the major's charge, and rushed back up the mountain to rejoin my platoon. In my absence Lieutenant Davis had gone ahead alone to sneak behind the machine gun position.

A stroke victim, for example, will describe in detail a conference he attended over the weekend when in fact he has not left the hospital. Normal people, too, sometimes have a tendency to confabulate; rather than admitting \\"I don't know,\\" some people will make up an answer or an explanation and express it with complete conviction. In Brain Fiction, William Hirstein examines confabulation and argues that its causes are not merely technical issues in neurology or cognitive science but deeply revealing about the structure of the human intellect. Hirstein describes confabulation as the failure of a normal checking or censoring process in the brain the failure to recognize that a false answer is fantasy, not reality. Thus, he argues, the creative ability to construct a plausible-sounding response and some ability to check that response are separate in the human brain. Hirstein sees the dialectic between the creative and checking processes \\"the inner dialogue\\" as an important part of our mental life. In constructing a theory of confabulation, Hirstein integrates perspectives from different fields, including philosophy, neuroscience, and psychology to achieve a natural mix of conceptual issues usually treated by philosophers with purely empirical issues; information about the distribution of certain blood vessels in the prefrontal lobes of the brain, for example, or the behavior of split-brain patients can shed light on the classic questions of philosophy of mind, including questions about the function of consciousness. This first book-length study of confabulation breaks ground in both philosophy and cognitive science.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Zr1NEAAAQBAJ&dq=Brain+Fiction+:+Self-Deception+and+the+Riddle+of+Confabulation+(Philosophical+Psychopathology)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Argumentation and Debate (with InfoTrac ) (Wadsworth Series in Communication Studies)","description":"Widely praised, ARGUMENTATION AND DEBATE, 13E, uses a clear, concise, and engaging presentation that makes even complex material easy for students to understand.

As pointed out in the pages in our Introduction to Exodus each book in the Bible has a prominent and dominant theme which, as such, is peculiar to itself, around which everything is made to center and of which all the details are but the amplification. What that leading subject may be, we should make it our business to prayerfully and diligently ascertain. This can best be discovered by reading and re-reading the book under review, noting carefully any particular feature or expression which occurs frequently in it-such as \\"under the sun\\" in Ecclesiastes or \\"the righteousness of God\\" in Romans. \\"The book of Joshua records one of the most interesting and important portions of Israel's history. It treats of the period of their estatement as a nation, of which Genesis was prophetic and the rest of the Pentateuch immediately preparatory. The books of Moses would be imperfect without this one: as it is the capstone of them, so it is the foundation of those which follow. Omit Joshua and there is a gap left in the sacred history which nothing could supply. Without it what proceeds would be incomprehensible and what follows unexplained. The sacred writer was directed to fill that gap by narrating the conquest and apportionment of the Promised Land. Thus this book may be contemplated from two distinct but closely related standpoints: first as the end of Israel's trials and wanderings in the wilderness, and second as the beginning of their new life in the land. It is that twofold viewpoint which supplies the clue to its spiritual interpretation, as it alone solves the problem which so many have found puzzling in this book.\\" Arthur Walkington Pink was an English Christian evangelist and Biblical scholar known for his staunchly Calvinist and Puritan-like teachings. Though born to Christian parents, prior to conversion he migrated into a Theosophical society (an occult gnostic group popular in England during that time), and quickly rose in prominence within their ranks. His conversion came from his father's patient admonitions from Scripture. It was the verse, Proverbs 14:12, 'there is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death, ' which particularly struck his heart and compelled him to renounce Theosophy and follow Jesus.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1s1rpwAACAAJ&dq=Gleanings+in+Joshua&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lovers: Great Romances of Our Time Through the Eyes of Legendary Writers","description":"The Encyclopedia of Television, second edtion is the first major reference work to provide description, history, analysis, and information on more than 1100 subjects related to television in its international context.

Patrick works in publishing and Jenny teaches sick children in a hospital. They have reached a certain level of maturity, or so they think. It is not long before they realize their respectability will be severely tested by seductive neighbours with a taste for whisky, the sexually confused Ted Valentine, and the literary set of Hampstead. In this funny and provocative study of a young couple growing up, Amis shows us that the difficulty with marriage is that it's so hard to preserve, especially when Patrick and Jenny harbour deep yearnings for a different kind of life. Kingsley Amis's (1922-95) works take a humorous yet highly critical look at British society, especially in the period following the end of World War II. Born in London, Amis explored his disillusionment in novels such as That Uncertain Feeling (1955). His other works include The Green Man (1970), Stanley and the Women (1984), and The Old Devils (1986), which won the Booker Prize.

Long before it became the bugbear term in the flying industry, 'Deep Vein Thrombosis' was already a terrifying disorder for the author. Diagnosed with a genetic disorder at age 43, her life has since been shadowed by the risk of life-threatening blood clots. Having seen her 50th birthday and counting the years steadily, she tells us her poignant story of courage and determination. Zarin recounts her struggle... Born into a blue-blood family in India, Zarin was accustomed to a lavish lifestyle. The India-Pakistan war threw her family into poverty and she had to adapt. Later on in life she had to endure scornings from her mother and betrayal by her brother coupled with her sickness; yet she remained a fighter. This is more than a tale of one remarkable woman's survival of personal medical crisis.

A shape-shifting trickster on a kung-fu quest for eternal life, Monkey King is one of the most memorable superheroes in world literature. High-spirited and omni-talented, he can transform himself into whatever he chooses and turn each of his body's 84,000 hairs into an army of clones. But his penchant for mischief repeatedly gets him into trouble, and when he raids Heaven's Orchard of Immortal Peaches, the Buddha pins him beneath a mountain. Five hundred years later, Monkey King is finally given a chance to redeem himself: he must protect the pious monk Tripitaka on his journey in search of precious Buddhist sutras that will bring enlightenment to the Chinese empire. Joined by two other fallen immortals - Pigsy, a rice-loving flying pig, and Sandy, a depressive river-sand monster - Monkey King does battle with Red Boy, Princess Jade-Face, the Monstress Dowager, and all manner of dragons, ogres, wizards and femmes fatales; navigates the perils of Fire-Cloud Cave, the River of Flowing Sand and the Water-Crystal Palace; and is serially captured, lacquered, saut ed, steamed and liquefied - but always hatches an ingenious plan to get himself and his fellow pilgrims out of their latest jam. Comparable to The Canterbury Tales or Don Quixote, Monkey King is at once a gripping adventure, a comic satire and a spring of spiritual insight. With this new translation by the award-winning Julia Lovell, the irrepressible rogue hero of one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature has the potential to vault, with his signature cloud-somersault, into the hearts of a whole new generation of readers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Qe7iDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Applied System Identification","description":"Effective system identification includes the underlying methodologies, computational procedures, and their implementation.

Specifically Applied System Identification: provides an overview of the disciplines of modal testing used in structural engineering and system identification; presents time- and frequency-domain models used in the disciplines of structures and controls; identifies basic concepts and properties of the frequency response function; features a unified mathematical framework based on the theory of system realization to correlate some of the existing time-domain methods commonly used in modal testing; introduces readers to a new way of interpreting the input/output relationship via an observer for identification of a system model and its corresponding observer to characterize system uncertainties; proposes a simple, yet effective way of curve-fitting the frequency response data and of constructing a system model via matrix-fraction description methods; considers the identification problem of a system operating in closed-loop with an existing feedback controller; develops a unified mathematical framework to derive recursive algorithms for the fast transversal filter and the least-squares lattice filter. Whether used as a textbook or as an addition to your personal reference library, Applied System Identification offers an ideal opportunity to build a bridge between the disciplines of system identification as applied to controls and to modal testing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_39RAAAAMAAJ&dq=Applied+System+Identification&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Best Songs of the Movies: Academy Award Nominees and Winners, 1934-1958","description":"\\"In the 25 years covered by this book, 160 songs were nominated for Academy Awards.

Research suggests that police divorce rates are more than double the national average of ordinary marriages. The spouse's fear of physical danger, adjusting to shift work, transfers and changes in the officers' personality are only a few of the contributing factors, but the most crucial problem is the breakdown of communication within the relationship. From the beginning of the officers' careers they are trained to control their emotions, and thus are accused of being cold-hearted. Spouses agree that law enforcement officers grapple with the real-life horrors on the job and that the bitter belief that 'cops don't cry' is sadly untrue.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Mk4CAAAACAAJ&dq=Cops+Don%27t+Cry:+A+Book+of+Help+and+Hope+for+Police+Families&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Columbus: His Enterprise: Exploding the Myth","description":"\\"The book is an idea that has finally found its time.\\" --Publisher's Weekly \\"I think your book on Christopher Columbus is important.

Tales from Ground Zero","description":"As 9-11 shakes the Doonesbury world, many of its denizens are drawn inexorably toward Ground Zero--Mike to attend a memorial service for a former employer; B.D., reactivated for crowd control and celebrity tourism; Marcia Feinbloom to hit on firefighters; and Zonker to deliver potent fruitcakes to weary rescue workers. Those on the home front are no less affected by events: \\"I no longer care what Madonna had for breakfast,\\" laments Boopsie, proof positive that Everything Has Changed. Half a world away, in Al-Qaeda Qountry, a burka-clad Roland Hedley is captured by a freelance warlord, then wounded by a can of Spam during a massive friendly food drop. Feyzabad Station Chief Havoc's effort to rescue the downed journalist speaks well for the new, improved CIA, which has somehow managed to parlay its \\"massive\\" intelligence failures into cult status on the nation's campuses. How else to explain Jeff Redfern's new internship with \\"Acme Imports\\"--and his sudden affinity for shaken-not-stirred libations? Meanwhile, former inside trader Phil Slackmeyer watches from his deathbed as the effort to smoke out evildoers expands to include the entire management team of Enron. Prominent among them is \\"Jimmy Jack Jumbo\\" Andrews, head of over 400 Caymans-based businesses, who calls his old friend to ask the question on many an ex-exec's mind: \\"What's prison like?\\" And back at the White House pressroom, NPR attack-dog Mark has questions of his own, like, \\"What time will you be launching the cover-up?\\" and \\"Will there be a lunch?\\" Yes, excavating Enron's smoking crater will be a long and dirty job--even if the president barely knows \\"Mr. Lay,\\" the disgraced CEO with whom he exchanged 350 letters.

Nobel laureate Gerald M. Edelman takes issue with the many current cognitive and behavioral approaches to the brain that leave biology out of the picture, and argues that the workings of the brain more closely resemble the living ecology of a jungle than they do the activities of a computer. Some startling conclusions emerge from these ideas: individuality is necessarily at the very center of what it means to have a mind, no creature is born value-free, and no physical theory of the universe can claim to be a  theory of everything  without including an account of how the brain gives rise to the mind. There is no greater scientific challenge than understanding the brain.

Flying rickety, underpowered, and unarmed aircraft, they operated on the leading edge of ground combat. The efficient use of airborne FACs never developed in a meaningful way in World War II, with the possible exception of their use in Marine amphibious operations in the Pacific. But the rugged terrain of Korea and the jungle mazes of Vietnam restricted the capabilities of ground controllers to identify targets, thus expanding the need for \\"eyes in the air.\\" FAC roles changed from those of probing, observing, and reporting, to those of locating targets, marking them for air strikes, and taking an active role in their destruction. This expanded mission resulted in the inevitable evolution of FAC equipment and responsibilities.Interservice differences regarding the definition of close air support (CAS) caused controversies which clouded ground-support operations in both Korea and Vietnam. The Navy and the Marines saw CAS as the primary mission for airpower. The Air Force and the Army saw CAS as the last priority, to be employed after air superiority has been gained and maintained, supplies have been interdicted, and the enemy's infrastructure has been damaged.Contents * PREFACE * 1 EVOLUTION OF CLOSE AIR SUPPORT * World War I * Between the Wars * The American Experience, 1918-42 * World War II * Notes * 2 CLOSE AIR SUPPORT DOCTRINE * Early Navy-Marine Close Air Support * Close Air Support in Korea * Air Force Philosophy in Korea * Navy/Marine Air in Vietnam * Notes * 3 KOREA: FORWARD AIR CONTROLLERS EMERGE * The Fight for Air Superiority * Phase One--Retreat to Pusan * Phase Two--Advance to the Yalu * Phase Three--Second Retreat * Phase Four--Main Line of Resistance Stabilized * Phase Five--Air Pressure for Peace * A Substitute for Artillery * Close Air Support in Korea * The Extemporized Air War * The Need for Airborne FACs * Command and Control Support * 6132d Tactical Air Control Group * 6147th Squadron Organized * Immediate Air Requests * Mosquitoes Assigned to Divisions * Mosquito Mission Expands * The 502d Tactical Control Group * Notes * 4 MOSQUITO OPERATIONS IN KOREA * The Role of the Mosquito * Forward Air Controller Equipment * Visual Reconnaissance * The Tactical Air Control System * Mosquito Mellow * Strike Control Procedures * Problems Encountered * Forward Air Controller Training * Notes * 5 KOREA: THE STAGNANT WAR * The Argument for Interdiction * CAS along a Stabilized Front * Radar-Controlled Air Strikes * Communications Upgrades * T-6 Upgrades * Operation Thunderbolt * Operation Ripper * Communist Losses in the First Year * Strategy Changes * Pathfinder Operations * The Truce Ceremony * 6147th TCG Deactivated * Joint Air-Ground Doctrine * Post Korea * Notes * 6 VIETNAM: THE ADVISORY YEARS * Wars of National Liberation * Developing the Counterinsurgency Force * Farm Gate * Command Structure * Air Operations in 1962 * Air Operations in 1963 * Air Operations in 1964 * The Gulf of Tonkin * New Demands * Notes . * 7 VIETNAM: SLOW FAC OPERATIONS * FACs Come of Age * FAC Aircraft * Personnel Requirements * Seventh Air Force * 504th Tactical Air Support Group * Increased Manning Requirements * Qualifications * Rules of Engagement * Locating the Enemy * Visual Reconnaissance Process * In-Country Operations, 1965-72 * Employing the FAC Force * Navy Participation * The Battle of Khe Sanh * The Tet Offensive * Cleared in Wet! * Notes * 8 EXPANDING MISSIONS * Night Operations * Air Operations in Laos * USAF Controllers in Cambodia * Notes . * 9 THE FAST FORWARD AIR CONTROLLERS * Out-Country Operations, 1964-65 * Commando Sabre * F-4 \\"Phantom\\" FACs * Notes * 10 VIETNAMIZATION AND AMERICAN WITHDRAWAL * Vietnamization and Close Air Support * The South Vietnamese Air Force * Cambodia * Lam Son 719 * Interdiction in Route Packages I and II * The 1972 Spring Offensive * Linebacker * Notes","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=rjj-swEACAAJ&dq=Mosquitoes+to+Wolves:+The+Evolution+of+the+Airborne+Forward+Air+Controller&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Effective Authorware for Windows Versions 3.0 and 3.5","description":"Provides a comprehensive introduction to Authorware that is designed to reinforce the skills necessary to develop an effective Authorware program.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=7zIJAAAACAAJ&dq=Effective+Authorware+for+Windows+Versions+3.0+and+3.5&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Graduate Research Guidebook: A Practical Approach to Doctoral/Masters Research","description":"This book is a comprehensive and practical guide to masters or doctoral research work.

Now, with all the color, scope, and fascination of the prior novel, comes Dune: The Machine Crusade. . More than two decades have passed since the events chronicled in The Butlerian Jihad. The crusade against thinking robots has ground on for years, but the forces led by Serena Butler and Irbis Ginjo have made only slight gains; the human worlds grow weary of war, of the bloody, inconclusive swing from victory to defeat. The fearsome cymeks, led by Agamemnon, hatch new plots to regain their lost power from Omnius--as their numbers dwindle and time begins to run out. The fighters of Ginaz, led by Jool Noret, forge themselves into an elite warrior class, a weapon against the machine-dominated worlds. Aurelius Venport and Norma Cenva are on the verge of the most important discovery in human history-a way to \\"fold\\" space and travel instantaneously to any place in the galaxy. And on the faraway, nearly worthless planet of Arrakis, Selim Wormrider and his band of outlaws take the first steps to making themselves the feared fighters who will change the course of history: the Fremen.

Most of us actually don't know the real truth of what we love what engages us and makes us thrive and our workplaces, jobs, schools, even our parents, are focused instead on making us conform.

The author uses Queer theory and Post Colonial analysis to show more clearly how this shift, especially from gender to sexuality, has occurred. The book also looks towards the future possiblities of a theology done in times of globalisation.To help to clarify this theoretical subject, the book is broken down into three areas. The first section deals with the genesis of Indecent theology, and includes material that is foundational, but not widely available until now. The second section looks more closely at just what Indecent Theology is, and the third section considers the future of Indecent Theologies, and ties up the questions raised in the earlier sections. Dr Marcella Althaus-Reid B.Ed, B.D, Ph.D was born in Argentina, and began her studies of theology in Buenos Aires.

Responding to Bennington's text at every turn is Derrida's own excerpts from his life and thought that, appearing at the bottom of each page, resist circumscription. Together these texts, as a dialogue and a contest, constitute a remarkably in-depth, critical introduction to one of the leading philosophers of the twentieth century and, at the same time, demonstrate the illusions inherent in such a project. Bennington's account of Derrida, broader in scope than any previously done, leads the reader through the philosopher's familiar yet still widely misunderstood work on language and writing to the less familiar and altogether more mysterious themes of signature, sexual difference, law, and affirmation. Seeking to escape this systematic rendering - in fact, to prove it impossible - Derrida interweaves Bennington's text with surprising and disruptive \\"periphrases\\": reflections on his mother's death agony, commentaries on St. Augustine's Confessions, memories of childhood, remarks on Judaism, and references to his collaborator's efforts. This extraordinary book offers, on the one hand, a clear and compelling account of one of the most difficult and important contemporary thinkers and, on the other, one of that thinker's strangest and most unexpected texts. Far from putting an end to the need to discuss Derrida, Bennington's text might have originally intended or pretended, this dual text opens new dimensions in the philosopher's thought and work and extends its challenge.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=MFZgdN20Gv0C&dq=Jacques+Derrida+(Religion+and+Postmodernism)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A History of the Jews in New Mexico","description":"\\"Drawing on individual biographies (including those of colonial officials accused of secretly practicing Judaism), family histories, Inquisition records, letters, and other primary sources, Hordes provides a detailed account of the economic, social, and religious lives of crypto-Jews during the colonial period and after the annexation of New Mexico by the United States in 1846.\\"--BOOK JACKET.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=nEZK4PBXItsC&dq=A+History+of+the+Jews+in+New+Mexico&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Man Sharing: Dilemma or Choice","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=dk-2swEACAAJ&dq=Man+Sharing:+Dilemma+or+Choice&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bead Jewelry Book","description":"Describes basic beading materials and techniques and offers instructions for making wired, woven, and loomed bead jewelry","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=lrMC-6SZZ7wC&dq=The+Bead+Jewelry+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Warriors of Cumorah","description":"When Becky and Josh Plimpton are kidnapped by Todd Finlay, Megan and her two suitors, Ryan and Apollus, attempt to rescue them, but through the mysterious powers of the Rainbow Room, one group ends up in nineteenth-century Jerusalem and the other in central America hundreds of years after the visitation of the Savior to the Nephites.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=mEmCPwAACAAJ&dq=Warriors+of+Cumorah&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Connections: The Threads That Strengthen Families","description":"Connections","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=y9z_wAEACAAJ&dq=Connections:+The+Threads+That+Strengthen+Families&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Million Miles to Go","description":"When young John Lebda waded ashore on that beach in North Africa during World War II, he had no idea he was walking into the biggest mess the world has ever seen.

No group of people better understood the power of slavery s legacies than the last generation of American people who had lived as slaves. Little-known before the first publication of Remembering Slavery over two decades ago, their memories were recorded on paper, and in some cases on primitive recording devices, by WPA workers in the 1930s. A major publishing event, Remembering Slavery captured these extraordinary voices in a single volume for the first time, presenting them as an unprecedented, first-person history of slavery in America. Remembering Slavery received the kind of commercial attention seldom accorded projects of this nature nationwide reviews as well as extensive coverage on prime-time television, including Good Morning America, Nightline, CBS Sunday Morning, and CNN. Reviewers called the book  chilling . . . [and] riveting  (Publishers Weekly) and  something, truly, truly new  (The Village Voice). With a new foreword by Pulitzer Prizewinning scholar Annette Gordon-Reed, this new edition of Remembering Slavery is an essential text for anyone seeking to understand one of the most basic and essential chapters in our collective history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=0pPCBAAAQBAJ&dq=Remembering+Slavery:+African+Americans+Talk+About+Their+Personal+Experiences+of+Slavery+and+Freedom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crackpot: The Obsessions of John Waters","description":"An outrageous collection from the uniquely legendary John Waters, updated with new material including Waters s 2002 New York Times article,  Finally, Footlights on the Fat Girls.

It stands in the centre of a small bay, and upon a gentle acclivity, which, on one side, slopes towards the sea, and on the other rises into an eminence crowned by dark woods. The situation is admirably beautiful and picturesque, and the ruins have an air of ancient grandeur, which, contrasted with the present solitude of the scene, impresses the traveller with awe and curiosity. During my travels abroad I visited this spot. As I walked over the loose fragments of stone, which lay scattered through the immense area of the fabrick, and surveyed the sublimity and grandeur of the ruins, I recurred, by a natural association of ideas, to the times when these walls stood proudly in their original splendour, when the halls were the scenes of hospitality and festive magnificence, and when they resounded with the voices of those whom death had long since swept from the earth. 'Thus,' said I, 'shall the present generation he who now sinks in misery and he who now swims in pleasure, alike pass away and be forgotten.' My heart swelled with the reflection; and, as I turned from the scene with a sigh, I fixed my eyes upon a friar, whose venerable figure, gently bending towards the earth, formed no uninteresting object in the picture. He observed my emotion; and, as my eye met his, shook his head and pointed to the ruin. 'These walls,' said he, 'were once the seat of luxury and vice. They exhibited a singular instance of the retribution of Heaven, and were from that period forsaken, and abandoned to decay.' His words excited my curiosity, and I enquired further concerning their meaning. 'A solemn history belongs to this castle, said he, 'which is too long and intricate for me to relate. It is, however, contained in a manuscript in our library, of which I could, perhaps, procure you a sight. A brother of our order, a descendant of the noble house of Mazzini, collected and recorded the most striking incidents relating to his family, and the history thus formed, he left as a legacy to our convent. If you please, we will walk thither.' I accompanied him to the convent, and the friar introduced me to his superior, a man of an intelligent mind and benevolent heart, with whom I passed some hours in interesting conversation. I believe my sentiments pleased him; for, by his indulgence, I was permitted to take abstracts of the history before me, which, with some further particulars obtained in conversation with the abate, I have arranged in the following pages.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xz6kDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pennsylvania's Battlefields & Military Landmarks","description":"From the French and Indian War to the Civil War, Pennsylvania was often the setting for bloody battles and other important military events.

Unusual in its awareness of the rapid changes in the Russian village in the late nineteenth century and in its concentration on the treatment of women and children, Semyonova s ethnography vividly describes courting rituals, marriage and sexual practices, childbirth, infanticide, child-rearing practices, the lives of women, food and drink, work habits, and the household economy. In contrast to a tradition of rosy, romanticized descriptions of peasant communities by Russian upper-class observers, Semyonova gives an unvarnished account of the harsh living conditions and often brutal relationships within peasant families.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vch5CgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Chessmaster and His Moves","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=dMJLAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Chessmaster+and+His+Moves&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"See No Evil","description":"A cunning killer hides in plain sight.

He shows how two streams of thought, the one aiming to restate the social principles of Islam, and the other to justify the separation of religion from politics, flowed into each other to create the Egyptian and Arab nationalisms of the present century. The last chapter of the book surveys the main tendencies of thought in the post-war years. Since its publication in 1962, this book has been regarded as a modern classic of interpretation. It was reissued by the Cambridge University Press in 1983 and has subsequently sold over 8000 copies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=A8GMAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Founding Mothers & Fathers: Gendered Power and the Forming of American Society","description":"Fans of number one New York Times bestselling author and celebrated journalist Cokie Roberts will love this stunning nonfiction picture book based on her acclaimed work for adults, Founding Mothers, which highlights the female patriots of the American Revolution.

Although they believe in the New Testament, it is their own incorrect translation that is misconstrued to suit their beliefs. They do not call themselves Christians, but  Jehovah s Witnesses  -  Jehovah  being a name of God used in the Old Testament. Their doctrine regarding the Lord Jesus Christ is completely different to the Christian doctrine; it is a mixture of the heresy of Arius, and other new heresies. They have even reached a level much worse than that of Arius by far. Many governments have expelled Jehovah s Witnesses from their countries because they sensed the danger which they presented to the country s general peace. Therefore, it can be said that they do not only propagate false religious beliefs, but they also propagate dangerous political ideas. As they say that the Church is a product of the devil, they also say that governments are a product of the devil, and encourage people not to enter the armed forces. They also consider saluting the flag as idolatry. Jehovah s Witnesses do not believe in the immortality of the soul and say that this is the teaching of the devil. They also say that after a person dies, he lives happily in the  earthly paradise , thus contradicting all the promises of the heavenly kingdom.

He is a middle-aged psychiatrist with an obsessive-compulsive disorder and a foot fetish. He's living in his hometown of Asheville, North Carolina, where he was raised in the Jewish community, yet grew to love barbecue and fried pork rinds. He lives with his ex-mother in-law and still lusts for an adolescent lost love. And whenever one of his patients answers his questions with anger and mistruths. Gritz swears he can smell Zelda Fitzgerald's personal perfume--so what if Gritz's office was the same one used by Zelda's therapist years ago; Zelda has been dead for decades. Just as Gritz begins to question his existence he is called to the Battery Park Hotel to convince a possible suicide not to jump off the roof. He discovers that the suicide threat is merely a misunderstanding. The man involved is T Simpson, who once worked for Gritz's family and carried Gritz and his brother round town for years until he suddenly disappeared. It turns out that T has returned to right the wrongful conviction and execution of Mordecai Moore for the murder of a New York co-ed in the Battery Park in 1939. T knows for sure that Martin didn't commit the murder, but he is tortured because the racial climate of the times kept him from coming forward. But the spirit of Martin is still present in the hotel and seems to guide Gritz as he and an assortment of colorful characters unravel the mystery. As he investigates, Gritz uncovers dirty secrets that involve prominent people--people involved in a plot to assassinate President Franklin Roosevelt and aid the Nazi movement in Germany in the, 1930s. As his search for the truth proceeds. Gritz is framed for the murder of an elderlywoman who is living at the Happy Valley Retirement Community. Then his quest expands into proving his own innocence as well as Mordecai Moore's. Some of the characters are based on actual historical figures. There really was a self-appointed commander of a pro-Hitler militia who published propaganda out of Asheville in the 1930s. There was a conspiracy between major American companies and a German munitions firm to monopolize materials needed in arms manufacture, thus raising prices and funneling profits back to the German war effort. There was a flamboyant senator from Asheville who was one of the most eccentric politicians in American history And of course, Zelda Fitzgerald really did lose her life when the hospital building in Asheville, where she was institutionalized, went up in flames.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=mtMjswEACAAJ&dq=The+Past+Is+Never+Dead+(Gritz+Goldberg+Mysteries)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Medieval England: An Encyclopedia (Routledge Encyclopedias of the Middle Ages)","description":"From emperors and queens to artists and world travelers, from popes and scholars to saints and heretics, Key Figures in Medieval Europe brings together in one volume the most important people who lived in medieval Europe between 500 and 1500.

They speak of it in awed terms and consider it to be an even more difficult problem than Fermat's last theorem, which was finally proven by Andrew Wiles in 1995. In The Riemann Hypothesis, acclaimed author Karl Sabbagh interviews some of the world's finest mathematicians who have spent their lives working on the problem--and whose approaches to meeting the challenges thrown up by the hypothesis are as diverse as their personalities.

Traditionally, this view focused on only the last fifteen years of the poet's life, and sprang from a belief in Mallarm? 'sudden awakening' to music during an all-Wagner concert in Paris, in 1885. Professor Heath Lees shows that Mallarm? early knowledge and experience of music was much greater than commentators have realized, and that the French poet actually began his writing career with the explicit aim of making music's performance-language of 'effect' the ground of his poetic expression. Integral to the argument is Mallarm? reaction to the work and ideas of Richard Wagner, whose impact on France came in two waves: the first broke during the tempestuous 1860s days of the Paris Tannh?er, while the second arrived in the mid-1880s, and gave birth to the Revue Wagn?enne. In refuting the critical literature that focuses on only the second of these waves, Lees shows that Mallarm?xhibited a highly informed Wagnerian background during the first wave, and that his grasp of the composer's gestural motives and flexible musical prose led him towards a new kind of self-expressive, gestural rhythm that aimed musically to reinvent poetic language. In support of this, the book examines closely what Wagner 'really' said in the prose works that were becoming known in Paris by the 1860s, in particular, Wagner's important French text, the Lettre sur la musique. It also re-examines Baudelaire's classic Wagner-brochure, and reveals its author's surprisingly firm grasp of Wagner's musico-poetic fusion. In musically informed commentary, Professor Lees surveys the four decades of success and failure that resulted from Mallarm? repeated attempts to draw out the musical gestures and resonances of words alone. In the process, he throws new light on many of Mallarm? best-known texts, hitherto judged 'difficult' by those who have failed to","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=yiYxDwAAQBAJ&dq=Mallarm&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Curiosity: A Cultural History of Early Modern Inquiry","description":"\\"Finely illustrated and the first of its kind, Curiosity is a broad study of modern inquiry that explores the way forbidden topics like the occult, sexuality, gender, and the origin of power became topics of public investigation.\\"--BOOK JACKET.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=JY5WgEAZ-6kC&dq=Curiosity:+A+Cultural+History+of+Early+Modern+Inquiry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mechanics (Course of theoretical physics)","description":"Devoted to the foundation of mechanics, namely classical Newtonian mechanics, the subject is based mainly on Galileo's principle of relativity and Hamilton's principle of least action.

In this entertaining book, written in dialogue form, Daniel Bell fills this gap, presenting and defending a distinctively communitarian theory against the objections of a liberal critic. In a Paris cafe Anne, a strong supporter of communitarian ideals, and Philip, her querulous critic, debate the issues. Drawing on the works of such thinkers as Charles Taylor, Michael Sandel, and Alasdair MacIntyre, Anne attacks liberalism's individualistic view of the person by pointing to our social embeddedness. She then develops Michael Walzer's idea that political thinking involves the interpretation of shared meanings emerging from the political life of a community, and rebuts Philip's criticism that this approach damages her case by being conservative and relativistic. She goes on to develop a justification of communal life and to answer the criticism that communitarians lack an alternative moral and political vision. The book ends with two later discussions, by Will Kymlicka and Daniel Bell, in which Anne and another friend, Louise, argue about the merits of the book's earlier debate and put it in perspective. Daniel Bell's book is a provocative defence of a distinctively communitarian theory which will stimulate interest and debate among both students of political theory and those approaching the subject for the first time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=SP-2AAAAIAAJ&dq=Communitarianism+and+Its+Critics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"O Come, Emmanuel","description":"\\"O Come, O Come, Emmanuel, and ransom captive Israel...\\" The familiar carol rings true with beauty and grace, but few stop to consider the deep theology of this tune.

While acknowledging that some of the foundational insights of poststructuralist theory can be difficult to translate to the classroom, Barnard upends several especially intransigent tenets that continue to influence the teaching of writing and how students are encouraged to understand writing. Using six major principles of writing classrooms and textbooks clarity, intent, voice, ethnography, audience, and objectivity Barnard looks at the implications of poststructuralist theory for pedagogy. While suggesting some evocative poststructuralist pedagogical practices, the author focuses on diagnosing the fault lines of composition's refusal of poststructuralism rather than on providing \\"solutions  in the form of teaching templates. Upsetting Composition Commonplaces addresses the need to more effectively engage in poststructuralist concepts in composition in an accessible and engaging voice that will advance the conversation about relations between the theory and teaching of writing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=WzmpBAAAQBAJ&dq=Reading+Rhetorically,+Brief+Edition+(2nd+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Redskins: Racial Slur or Symbol of Success","description":"A firestorm of controversy swirls around Indian sports mascots.

But is the widely held assumption that women have always been excluded from such roles historically accurate? How might the current debate change if our view of the history of women's ordination were to change? In The Hidden History of Women's Ordination, Gary Macy argues that for the first twelve hundred years of Christianity, women were in fact ordained into various roles in the church. He uncovers references to the ordination of women in papal, episcopal and theological documents of the time, and the rites for these ordinations have survived. The insistence among scholars that women were not ordained, Macy shows, is based on a later definition of ordination, one that would have been unknown in the early Middle Ages.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=pJEVDAAAQBAJ&dq=A+History+of+Women+and+Ordination,+Vol.+1:+The+Ordination+of+Women+in+a+Medieval+Context&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Sunshine (Coulter Family)","description":"New York Times bestselling author Catherine Anderson's Coulter Family series continues in this poignant story of a love that defies all the odds....

Wildlife Activist  A must for anyone seriously interested in the wildlife of Texas.   Texas Outdoor Writers Association News  [This book] easily fills the role of both a field guide and a desk reference, and is written in a style that appeals to the professional biologist and amateur naturalist alike. . . . [It] should prove useful to anyone with an interest in the mammal fauna of Texas or the southern Great Plains.   Prairie Naturalist The Mammals of Texas has been the standard reference since the first edition was coauthored by William B. Davis and Walter P. Taylor in 1947. Revised several times over the succeeding decades, it remains the most authoritative source of information on the mammalian wildlife of Texas, with physical descriptions and life histories for 202 species, abundant photographs and drawings, and distribution maps. In this new edition, David J. Schmidly is joined by one of the most active researchers on Texas mammals, Robert D. Bradley, to provide a thorough update of the taxonomy, distribution, and natural history of all species of wild mammals that inhabit Texas today. Using the most recent advances in molecular biology and in wildlife ecology and management, the authors include the most current information about the scientific nomenclature, taxonomy, and identification of species, while also covering significant advances in natural history and conservation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=OdsDDQAAQBAJ&dq=The+mammals+of+Texas+(Bulletin+-+Texas+Parks+and+Wildlife+Department+%3B+no.+41)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"After midnight,","description":"Two strangers.

When you do not fear God, he contends, you will not fear sin. The troubling result of this issue is that many Christians fail to recognize that they have sinned against God. The lack of holiness within the Church has reached epidemic levels. \\"True revival can only come,\\" notes Blackaby, \\"when the people of God return to a healthy, holy fear of Him.\\" God, in His holiness, is grieved by our lack of it. In this worthy book, Blackaby urges believers to look inward, to see sin from God's perspective, and to live to the standard that He has set in Scripture. He writes, \\"The salvation of the nation has little to do with Washington or Hollywood-it has to do with the people of God!\\" As referenced in 2 Chronicles 7:14, Blackaby notes that the redemption of America lies in the repentance of the people of God. He challenges readers by adding, \\"If America depended on your prayer life, would there be revival?\\" Revival waits on the holiness of His people; this book provides the path that will lead us back.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZfhaZjopJd0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Everything Else You Need to Know When You're Expecting: The New Etiquette for the New Mom","description":"Can you ask your friends to do your baby's laundry?

It was rigidly hierarchical, with the seemingly beneficent and ascetic figure of Hitler at the top - focus for the homage and aspirations of every man, woman and child. How did the 'ordinary citizen' live under such a system? The author discusses such subjects as beauty in the Third Reich (no cosmetics, no slimming) as well as charting how you progressed to the elite Nazi cadres - administrators, propagandists or coercers. It shows childhood with the Hitler Youth and describes the intense medieval ritual injected into every phase of life from school and university to farm labour. It shows life in the office, in industry, in the professions - doctors, lawyers, artists - and in the Nazi Party itself. Finally, it documents what happened at the two extremes of German society - to the aristocrats and to the Jews.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dpE8Qa09ltsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Unpopular Catholic Truths","description":"The beliefs of the Catholic Church are under constant attack.

In a time when many question the historical origins of the papacy, this book dares to present the New Testament evidence showing that Peter was indeed the first bishop of Rome from whom papal authority derives.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=7pca85-ctvsC&dq=Unpopular+Catholic+Truths&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Harriet Tubman: The Life and the Life Stories (Wisconsin Studies in Autobiography)","description":"Harriet Tubman s name is known world-wide and her exploits as a self-liberated Underground Railroad heroine are celebrated in children s literature, film, and history books, yet no major biography of Tubman has appeared since 1943. Jean M. Humez s comprehensive Harriet Tubman is both an important biographical overview based on extensive new research and a complete collection of the stories Tubman told about her life a virtual autobiography culled by Humez from rare early publications and manuscript sources. This book will become a landmark resource for scholars, historians, and general readers interested in slavery, the Underground Railroad, the Civil War, and African American women. Born in slavery in Maryland in or around 1820, Tubman drew upon deep spiritual resources and covert antislavery networks when she escaped to the north in 1849. Vowing to liberate her entire family, she made repeated trips south during the 1850s and successfully guided dozens of fugitives to freedom. During the Civil War she was recruited to act as spy and scout with the Union Army. After the war she settled in Auburn, New York, where she worked to support an extended family and in her later years founded a home for the indigent aged. Celebrated by her primarily white antislavery associates in a variety of private and public documents from the 1850s through the 1870s, she was rediscovered as a race heroine by woman suffragists and the African American women s club movement in the early twentieth century. Her story was used as a key symbolic resource in education, institutional fundraising, and debates about the meaning of \\"race\\" throughout the twentieth century. Humez includes an extended discussion of Tubman s work as a public performer of her own life history during the nearly sixty years she lived in the north. Drawing upon historiographical and literary discussion of the complex hybrid authorship of slave narrative literature, Humez analyzes the interactive dynamic between Tubman and her interviewers. Humez illustrates how Tubman, though unable to write, made major unrecognized contributions to the shaping of her own heroic myth by early biographers like Sarah Bradford. Selections of key documents illustrate how Tubman appeared to her contemporaries, and a comprehensive list of primary sources represents an important resource for scholars.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=k9l_lA3Inw4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"France: The Dark Years, 1940-1944 (Modern World)","description":"In this monumental new account of the Vichy years, Julian Jackson examines French experiences of Occupation during the 'Black Years' of 1940-4. Pulling together previously separate 'histories' of occupation, resistance, and collaboration he presents a definitive history of the period. This isa more complex history than the traditional dichotomy between 'collaboration' and 'resistance', one in which the ideological frontiers between Vichy and the Resistance were often blurred. This study ranges from the politics of Marshal Petain's regime to the experiences of the ordinary Frenchpeople, from surrender in 1940 to the purges of liberation. The author restores the organized Resistance to a more central role than has been customary in recent years and presents a new social history of the resistance which takes in the roles of foreigners, women, Jews, and peasants. He uncoversthe long term roots of the Vichy regime in political and social conflict and cultural crisis stretching back to the Great War and concludes by tracing the lasting legacy and memory of Occupation since 1945.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=UWN7DwAAQBAJ&dq=France:+The+Dark+Years,+1940-1944+(Modern+World)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A View from the Bridge","description":"The law is nature. The law is only a word for what has a right to happen. When the law is wrong it's because it's unnatural, but in this case it is natural and a river will drown you if you buck it now. Let her go.

When his wife's cousins arrive as illegal immigrants from Italy, he is honoured to take them into his house. But when his niece begins to fall in love with one of them, Eddie grows increasingly suspicious, eventually precipitating his violation of the moral and cultural codes of his community and leading to the play's tragic finale. With its examination of the themes of sexuality, responsibility, betrayal and vengeance, A View from the Bridge is Miller at his best and a modern classic.

While Gus sinks comfortably into the surfing and the bar scene in Jakarta (with a Bukowskian appetite for womanizing, minus the sinister aspect), he is a fish out of water at work?a surfer among golfers, a rocker in a crowd of Lawrence Welk country clubbers. But he is determined to complete a successful first tour?even if he has to wear a stupid disguise or pass himself off as ?Biu from Braziu,? a Brazilian playboy. Gus?s first significant assignment is to recruit an Iraqi diplomat to become an American spy.

Elizabeth A. Fenn is the first historian to reveal how deeply variola affected the outcome of the war in every colony and the lives of everyone in North America. By 1776, when military action and political ferment increased the movement of people and microbes, the epidemic worsened. Fenn's remarkable research shows us how smallpox devastated the American troops at Qu bec and kept them at bay during the British occupation of Boston. Soon the disease affected the war in Virginia, where it ravaged slaves who had escaped to join the British forces. During the terrible winter at Valley Forge, General Washington had to decide if and when to attempt the risky inoculation of his troops. In 1779, while Creeks and Cherokees were dying in Georgia, smallpox broke out in Mexico City, whence it followed travelers going north, striking Santa Fe and outlying pueblos in January 1781. Simultaneously it moved up the Pacific coast and east across the plains as far as Hudson's Bay. The destructive, desolating power of smallpox made for a cascade of public-health crises and heartbreaking human drama. Fenn's innovative work shows how this mega-tragedy was met and what its consequences were for America.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EnauK2PI_9sC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Confounding the Color Line: The (American) Indian - Black Experience in North America","description":"Confounding the Color Line is an essential, interdisciplinary introduction to the myriad relationships forged for centuries between Indians and Blacks in North America.?Since the days of slavery, the lives and destinies of Indians and Blacks have been entwined-thrown together through circumstance, institutional design, or personal choice. Cultural sharing and intermarriage have resulted in complex identities for some members of Indian and Black communities today. The contributors to this volume examine the origins, history, various manifestations, and long-term consequences of the different connections that have been established between Indians and Blacks. Stimulating examples of a range of relations are offered, including the challenges faced by Cherokee freedmen, the lives of Afro-Indian whalers in New England, and the ways in which Indians and Africans interacted in Spanish colonial New Mexico. Special attention is given to slavery and its continuing legacy, both in the Old South and in Indian Territory. The intricate nature of modern Indian-Black relations is showcased through discussions of the ties between Black athletes and Indian mascots, the complex identities of Indians in southern New England, the problem of Indian identity within the African American community, and the way in which today's Lumbee Indians have creatively engaged with African American church music. At once informative and provocative, Confounding the Color Line sheds valuable light on a pivotal and not well understood relationship between these communities of color, which together and separately have affected, sometimes profoundly, the course of American history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=0rRLMElNjJEC&dq=Confounding+the+Color+Line:+The+(American)+Indian+-+Black+Experience+in+North+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wife for Sale","description":"Pernikahannya yang sudah didepan mata kandas dalam sekejab!

We claim that the average boy or girl of twelve years who has been educated till then at one of our schools knows at least as much as the finished High School product of several years  seniority, and the achievement has been at no cost of pain or distortion to body or mind. Rather are our pupils equipped in their whole being for the adventure of life, accustomed to the free exercise of will and judgment, illuminated by imagination and enthusiasm. Only such pupils can exercise rightly the duties of citizens in a civilised commonwealth. The first four chapters are mainly psychological, showing the changed personality with which the teacher has to deal at six years of age, and the need for a corresponding change of approach. The secret of success is found to lie in the right use of imagination in awakening interest, and the stimulation of seeds of interest already sown by attractive literary and pictorial material, but all correlated to a central idea, of greatly ennobling inspiration the Cosmic Plan, in which all, consciously or unconsciously, serve the great Purpose of Life. It is shown how the conception of evolution has been modified of late through geological and biological discoveries, so that self-perfection now has to yield precedence to service among the primary natural urges. The next eight chapters show how the Cosmic Plan can be presented to the child, as a thrilling tale of the earth we live in, its many changes through slow ages when water was Nature s chief toiler for accomplishment of her purposes, how land and sea fought for supremacy, and how equilibrium of elements was achieved, that Life might appear on the stage to play its part in the great drama. Illustrated as it must be by fascinating, charts and diagrams, the creation of earth as we now know it unfolds before the child s imagination, and always with emphasis on the function each agent has to perform in Nature s household, whether consciously or unconsciously, failure in this alone leading to extinction. So the talc proceeds till Palaeolithic Man appears, most significantly traced by the tools he used on his environment rather than by physical remains of so slight a creature. The new element of mind is brought to creation by man, and from that time the children are helped to see the great acceleration that has taken place in evolution. They learn to reverence the earliest pioneers, who toiled for purposes unknown to them but now to be recognised. Nomadic men and settlers alike contributed to build up early communities, and by interchanges of war and peace to share and spread social amenities. From chapter thirteen brief descriptions are given of some of the earliest civilizations, particularly with a view to their impacts on each other, showing human society as slowly organising itself towards unity, just as, in the individual human being, organs are built around separate centres of interest, to be later connected by the blood-circulatory system and the nerves, into an integrated human organism. So the child is led, by review of some of the most thrilling epochs of world-history, to see that so far humanity has been in an embryonic stage, and that it is just now emerging into true birth, able to consciously realise its true unity and function. The last chapters go back to the psychological point of view, urging on educators the supreme importance, to the nation and to the world, of the tasks imposed on them. Not in the service of any political or social creed should the teacher work, but in the service of the complete human being, able to exercise in freedom a self-disciplined will and judgment, unperverted by prejudice and undistorted by fear.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eaxyCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF GENERAL INTELLIGENCE","description":"This book celebrates two triumphs in modern psychology: the successful development and application of a solid measure of general intelligence; and the personal courage and skills of the man who made this possible - Arthur R. Jensen from Berkeley University. The volume traces the history of intelligence from the early 19th century approaches, to the most recent analyses of the hierarchical structure of cognitive abilities, and documents the transition from a hopelessly confused concept of intelligence to the development of an objective measure of psychometric g. The contributions illustrate the impressive power g has with respect to predicting educational achievement, getting an attractive job, or social stratification. The book is divided into six parts as follows: Part I presents the most recent higher-stream analysis of cognitive abilities, Part II deals with biological aspects of g, such as research on brain imaging, glucose uptake, working memory, reaction time, inspection time, and other biological correlates, and concludes with the latest findings in g-related molecular genetics. Part III addresses demographic aspects of g, such as geographic-, race-, and sex-differences, and introduces differential psychological aspects as well. Part IV concentrates on the g nexus, and relates such highly diverse topics as sociology, genius, retardation, training, education, jobs, and crime to g. Part V contains chapters critical of research on g and its genetic relationship, and also presents a rejoinder. Part VI looks at one of the greatest contemporary psychologists, Professor Emeritus Arthur R. Jensen as teacher and mentor.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Ji5xlAEACAAJ&dq=SCIENTIFIC+STUDY+OF+GENERAL+INTELLIGENCE&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Old and New Apostles: What do they believe?","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ldJoGAzevgcC&dq=The+Old+and+New+Apostles:+What+do+they+believe%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Industrial Color Testing: Fundamentals and Techniques","description":"Hans G.

Many educators, parents, and policymakers who have paid little attention to testing policy issues in the past need to have better information on the topic than has generally been available. Kill the Messenger, now in paperback, fills this gap.This is perhaps the most thorough and authoritative work in defense of educational testing ever written. Phelps points out that much research conducted by education insiders on the topic is based on ideological preference or profound self-interest. It is not surprising that they arrive at emphatically anti-testing conclusions. Much, if not most, of this hostile research is passed on to the public by journalists as if it were neutral, objective, and independent. Kill the Messenger explains and refutes many of the common criticisms of testing; describes testing opponents' strategies, through case studies of Texas and the SAT; illustrates the profound media bias against testing; acknowledges testing's limitations, and suggests how it can be improved; and finally, outlines the consequences of losing the \\"\\"war on standardized testing.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TtwzDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Vein of Gold: Journey to Your Creative Heart","description":"Cameron draws from her remarkable teaching experience to help readers reach out into ever-broadening creative horizons.

Yet they are an oddity. They are considered wholesome, conservative, and friendly on one hand, and clannish, weird, and self-righteous on the other. Mormonism: A Very Short Introduction explains who Mormons are: what they believe and how they live their lives. Written by Richard Lyman Bushman, an eminent historian and practicing Mormon, this compact, informative volume ranges from the history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to the contentious issues of contemporary Mormonism. Bushman argues that Joseph Smith still serves as the Mormons' Moses. Their everyday religious lives are still rooted in his conceptions of true Christianity. They seek revelation to solve life's problems just as he did. They believe the authority to seal families together for eternity was restored through him. They understand their lives as part of a spiritual journey that started in a \\"council in heaven\\" before the world began just as he taught. Bushman's account also describes the tensions and sorrows of Mormon life. How are Mormons to hold on to their children in a world of declining moral standards and rampant disbelief? How do rational, educated Mormons stand up to criticisms of their faith? How do single Mormons fare in a church that emphasizes family life? The book also examines polygamy, the various Mormon scriptures, and the renegade fundamentalists who tarnish the LDS image when in fact they're not members. In a time when Mormons such as Mitt Romney and Harry Reid are playing prominent roles in American society, this engaging introduction enables readers to judge for themselves how Mormon teachings shape the character of believers.

De Groene Amsterdammer Isaiah was van Samuel en Samuel was van Isaiah. Dat was altijd zo geweest, en zou ook altijd zo blijven. In elkaars aanwezigheid waren hun lichamen niet langer een lege huls en vonden ze een reden voor hun bestaan. Maar wanneer de plantage zich tegen hen keert, wordt hun liefde ineens gezien als een gevaar voor de harmonie onder hun lotgenoten. In deze hartverscheurende roman roept Robert Jones jr. de stem op van zowel de onderdrukten als de onderdrukkers, en legt zo de ziel van de slavernij bloot. De profeten is een verhaal over de pijn van de slavernij, maar ook over de hoop en de schoonheid van de liefde. De pers over De profeten: 'Met De profeten heeft Robert Jones jr. een roman geschreven die een waardige plaats verdient tussen de verhalen van Baldwin, Morrison, Colson Whitehead, Alice Walker, Ralph Ellison en vele andere schrijvers die de Amerikaanse literatuur veelstemmiger hebben gemaakt en de Amerikaanse geschiedenis veelzijdiger.' De Groene Amsterdammer 'Een po?tisch [ ] slavernijepos, dat tegelijk een loflied op de tijdloze kracht van de liefde is;   k de liefde tussen twee zwarte mannen.'

How did science-and its practitioners-enlisted in the service of the state during the Second World War, become a slave to its patron during the Cold War? The story of these three men, builders of the bombs, is fundamentally about loyalty-to country, to science, and to each other-and about the wrenching choices that had to be made when these allegiances came into conflict. Gregg Herken gives us the behind-the-scenes account based upon a decade of research, interviews, and newly released Freedom of Information Act and Russian documents.

Woolverton's book is an extremely readable and fascinating look at a gifted, persuasive clergyman and public figure. One of the most influential ministers of his time, Brooks delivered the sermon over the body of Abraham Lincoln at Independence Hall in Philadelphia and is known for penning the lyrics to \\"O Little Town of Bethlehem.\\" Although Brooks was not a major theologian, he was nurtured in an atmosphere of serious religious thought. In the crisis era of pre-Civil War America, he sought a religious and cultural ideal in the perfect manhood of Jesus Christ and consequently \\"won a name\\" for himself, as his slightly envious cousin, Henry Adams, once remarked. Woolverton places Brooks in his cultural context and shows how this religious leader was shaped psychologically and by his times and how those factors helped him forge a spiritual ideal for a troubled nation. \\"Not only casts new light on the young manhood of one of the preeminent Anglican ministers in America, but enhances our understanding of key cultural trends in the mid-nineteenth century.\\" -- Anne C.

Between 1455 and 1485 four kings, including Richard III, lost their thrones, more than forty noblemen lost their lives on the battlefield or their heads on the block, and thousands of the men who followed them met violent deaths. As they made their way in a disintegrating world, the Paston family in Norfolk family were writing letters - about politics, about business, about shopping, about love and about each other, including the first valentine.

Extensive empirical evidence is used to analyze the social construction of violent and aggressive human behavior, using a sociology of deviance perspective. Political assassinations and executions are placed within their particular cultural matrix to describe how this specific form of killing has been conceptualized as part of an alternative system of justice. ?The taking of a human life is generally regarded as the ultimate evil. Given this fact, it is important to examine and understand how it is explained, justified, and cloaked in a ?vocabulary of motives.? Such acts are, in the author?s words, ?socially constructed and interpreted,? dependent on the observer?s location in a specific ?symbolic-moral universe.?Moreover, such acts (political assassination specifically) are manifestations of struggles that represent attempts to legitimate these world-views, rhetorical devices that serve to define ?boundary-markers? between such universes ? moral crusades that attempt to validate one view vis-a-vis another. This general approach to political assassinations is original. Its application to assassinations by Israelis is original. The fact that the book is empirical marks it off from many speculations on the subject. A number of the author?s findings make a distinct contribution.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qW6QpWs2CHoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Statistical analysis in psychology and education (McGraw-Hill series in psychology)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=aFdxpwAACAAJ&dq=Statistical+analysis+in+psychology+and+education+(McGraw-Hill+series+in+psychology)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"STRIP JACK (JOHN REBUS)","description":"?Ian Rankin br?cker det mesta i dagens deckarutgivning.? | Lotta Olsson, DN ?Ett av kriminallitteraturens riktigt stora f?rfattarskap.? | Magnus Utvik, Gomorron Sverige, SVT Gregor Jack, en h?gt ansedd ledamot av det skotska parlamentet, har allt.

After all, I was after nothing less than the secret of human harmony.\\" The challenge that bestselling author Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson set for himself was formidable: to create a true interspecies peaceable kingdom within his own household. He hoped to learn if several different species-some, natural enemies-raised together from an early age could live peacefully side by side. So he took into his home seven young animals-a kitten, a rabbit, two rats, two chickens, and a puppy-and set about observing the whole process of socialization (or non-socialization) from the very beginning. The initial results were mixed. Tamaiti, the kitten, made herself instantly comfortable, but Hohepa, the Flemish giant rabbit, remained inscrutably reserved. Kia and Ora, the rats, slept all day and became active at night. Moa and Moana, the Polish frizzle chickens, bonded with each other but to no one else. Mika, the stray pup, barked much too much. But as the hours and days passed in this never-before-attempted environment, the animals began to change in startling ways, as Masson wondered which animals would bond, and which would recoil from one another? Can animals, including humans, truly change when direct experience tells them it's safe to do so? Would the experiment end in triumph, or in tragedy? Raising the Peaceable Kingdom poses universal questions we've all had about relationships, social strife, and peaceful coexistence. In its intimations of the potential for planetary harmony, this elegantly written book is a work of major significance. As a unique account of life in an interspecies community, it offers unmitigated enchantment, joy, and delight.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LO78W6mBH9EC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life: How to Use Feng Shui to Get Love, Money, Respect, and Happiness","description":"An essential and accessible guide to increasing happiness, improving your financial well-being, and bettering your health through the timeless Chinese art of feng shui.

It combines the text of a journal handwritten by photojournalist Linda Schaefer as well as some 160 full color photographs taken as she lived and worked with the Missionaries of Charities and the international team of volunteers in various facilities run by Mother Teresa throughout India. Schaefer had decided many years ago that she wanted to shoot a pictorial on Mother Teresa and her work. Finally in 1995 she had a brief encounter with the living saint during a visit to Atlanta. This renewed her passion to photograph the nun in her natural surroundings and share a different look at Mother Teresa with the world. This was not an easy task. Mother Teresa was opposed to \\"another book\\" about her. As she put it, \\"too many people are making money and none of it gets to the poor who really need it.\\" After accepting a challenge from Mother Teresa to put her cameras down and go to work in the orphanages and houses of the dying, Schaefer finally received the answer to her prayers. Mother Teresa penned a note to Linda granting her complete and unfettered access to her facilities, the Missionaries of Charity, the international team of volunteers, and thousands of poor and sick. The result is a book that was created around the dictates of Mother Teresa. As she put it, she wanted the people who picked up this book to see \\"her world\\" -- the environment in which she lived and shared her love. She wanted viewers to actually \\"see, smell and hear\\" the real world in which she lived and worked.. She didn't want a book packed full of individual photos of herself, and so Schaefer's work portrays all of the component parts thatmade up the world of Mother Teresa. This is the focus of Come and See.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jfXbzSVT0o4C&dq=Come+and+See:+A+Photojournalist%27s+Journey+into+the+World+of+Mother+Teresa&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Montana Christmas (Stolen Moments)","description":"When six-year-old Lisa Gustafson asks Santa Claus to bring a mother for her and her brothers, she has no idea that her dream is about to come true.

You might have had a bank account and a mortgage, perhaps some basic investments. Wall Street didn t have a reputation for greed and recklessness. That all started to change in the eighties, as our financial systems became increasingly complex, moving beyond the understanding of the general public while impacting our lives in innumerable ways. The financial world began to feel like an enigma a rogue force working against us, seemingly controlled by no one. From an industry veteran who s had firsthand involvement in the events that shaped modern money, How Money Became Dangerous journeys from the crime-ridden LA jewelry district to the cutthroat Salomon Brothers trading floor, from the high-stakes world of investment banking to the center of the technology boom, capturing the key deals, developments, and players that made the financial world what it is today. The book illuminates the dark, hidden forces of Wall Street and how it has dehumanized and left behind everyday Americans. A fresh and enlightening take on how we reached this point, How Money Became Dangerous also makes the case for why Wall Street needs to be saved, if only to save ourselves.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nkl5DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Texas Women Writers: A Tradition of Their Own (Tarleton State University Southwestern Studies in the Humanities)","description":"Texas Women Writers: A Tradition of Their Own is a sweeping account of a rich yet largely ignored literary history covering over 160 years of women's writing in the Lone Star State.

Critical-biographical portraits of the lives and careers of individual writers both major and minor follow: from novelists, dramatists, and poets, to writers of short stories, children's books, and creative nonfiction.

In the face of worsening traffic congestion, deteriorating central cities face growing unmet housing and employment needs. Suburban zoning and other land use controls aggravate these needs by excluding apartments, failing to offer efficient public transport, and rendering access to suburban jobs dependent on expensive automobile use. The book describes a vision of a city that is not dominated by the automobile. The post-automobile city is not car-free, but the city is redesigned to offer infrastructure for pedestrians and those who desire to live car-free. Parks, park blocks, gardens, urban landscaped pathways, pedestrian shopping streets, and inviting piazzas would replace the emphasis on surface parking lots and a tight grid of traffic. The book explores various strategies to pursue the post-automobile city, including planning, housing, redevelopment, transportation, and pedestrianization strategies. Kushner also explores various legal mechanisms that can implement the post-automobile city and explains legal constraints to various planning strategies, particularly the constraints of the Takings Clauses and the regime of American property rights. \\"[The author] provides options for professionals and policy makers to more wisely cope with the inevitable future increase of vehicles in the country and the potential disastrous results of that increment...

Optical elements enhance the functionality of mechatronics and in many cases introduce entirely new capabilities. Likewise, mechatronic elements bring the same synergistic effects to optical systems. However, most books focus on traditional mechatronics while only briefly discussing, or omitting completely, the characteristics of optomechatronic technology. Bringing together the fundamentals and underlying concepts, Optomechatronics provides a detailed introduction to this growing field. With emphasis on the importance of interdisciplinary, multiple-technology fusion, this book threads together the background, definition, and characteristics of the field with an integrated view of various disciplines, a system-oriented approach, and a combined view of the macro/micro worlds. It begins with an analysis of a variety of practical optomechatronic systems to identify the underlying concepts and features of each area composing the field. These systems include optics, machine vision, feedback control, and micro-opto-mechanical systems (MOEMS). From this platform, the author demonstrates how to fuse the optical, mechanical, electronic, and microprocessor elements to realize desired functionalities. Finally, the book examines whole optomechatronic systems comprising the components described in the previous section. Whether you are new to the field or have experience in a different engineering discipline, Optomechatronics supplies the necessary tools to harness the benefits that optical technologies bring to this important emerging area.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YvjKBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Infinite Plan : A Novel","description":"Summer Reissues with P.S.

Hundreds of images span a century of passenger flight, from the rudimentary trajectory of routes to the most intricately detailed birds-eye views of the land to be flown over. Advertisements for the first scheduled commercial passenger flights featured only a few destinations, with stunning views of the countryside and graphics of biplanes. As aviation took off, speed and mileage were trumpeted on bold posters featuring busy routes. Major airlines produced highly stylized illustrations of their global presence, establishing now-classic brands. With trendy and forward-looking designs, cartographers celebrated the coming together of different cultures and made the earth look ever smaller. Eventually, fleets got bigger and routes multiplied, and graphic designers have found creative new ways to display huge amounts of information. Airline hubs bring their own cultural mark and advertise their plentiful destination options. Innovative maps depict our busy world with webs of overlapping routes and networks of low-cost city-to-city hopping. But though flying has become more commonplace, Ovenden and Roberts remind us that early air travel was a glamorous affair for good reason. Airline Maps is a celebration of graphic design, cartographic skills and clever marketing, and a visual feast that reminds us to enjoy the journey as much as the destination.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2TC-DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The One That Got Away","description":"The One That Got Away is a gripping thriller about obsession and murder.

We are in a quandary about where to go from here. This book empowers preachers, teachers, and facilitators to affect change in their areas of influence that can lead to widespread transformation. As you read, you'll learn how to: - live in community with others; - acknowledge pain from the past; - embrace the idea of forgiveness; - settle and resolve differences with others. When preaching forgiveness, the lesson that is to be learned is that once we have faced the pain of the past, it must be accepted for what it is, processed, and then released. Holding onto that pain and bitterness only hinders us from being able to live in the now and to prepare for the future.

Affluent and predominantly white residents fought back in a much heralded  freeway revolt,  saving such historic neighborhoods as Greenwich Village and New Orleans s French Quarter. This book tells of the other revolt, a movement of creative opposition, commemoration, and preservation staged on behalf of the mostly minority urban neighborhoods that lacked the political and economic power to resist the onslaught of highway construction. Within the context of the larger historical forces of the 1960s and 1970s, Eric Avila maps the creative strategies devised by urban communities to document and protest the damage that highways wrought. The works of Chicanas and other women of color from the commemorative poetry of Patricia Preciado Martin and Lorna Dee Cervantes to the fiction of Helena Maria Viramontes to the underpass murals of Judy Baca expose highway construction as not only a racist but also a sexist enterprise. In colorful paintings, East Los Angeles artists such as David Botello, Carlos Almaraz, and Frank Romero satirize, criticize, and aestheticize the structure of the freeway. Local artists paint murals on the concrete piers of a highway interchange in San Diego s Chicano Park. The Rondo Days Festival in St. Paul, Minnesota, and the Black Archives, History, and Research Foundation in the Overtown neighborhood of Miami preserve and celebrate the memories of historic African American communities lost to the freeway. Bringing such efforts to the fore in the story of the freeway revolt, The Folklore of the Freeway moves beyond a simplistic narrative of victimization. Losers, perhaps, in their fight against the freeway, the diverse communities at the center of the book nonetheless generate powerful cultural forces that shape our understanding of the urban landscape and influence the shifting priorities of contemporary urban policy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3y90DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Guide to Indoor Gardening","description":"Would you like to have a garden without the endless plowing?Are you looking for a way to bring the outdoors in?Do you have an interest in gardening but lack the outdoor space?

A recent New York Times Magazine (July 7, 2002) cover story answered this question and said that Dr. Atkins was right all along, \\"its not fat that makes us fat but carbohydrates.\\" Though the government has spent hundreds of millions of dollars in research trying to prove that fat is the cause of obesity, there has been a subtle shift in the scientific consensus over the past five years supporting what the low-carb diet doctors have been saying all along: if we eat less carbohydrates, we will lose weight and live longer. One of the toughest challenges of any diet is having enough variety and choices to keep the dieter from losing interest.

The main character is a liberation figure challenging not only male chauvinism and marriage but the institution of slavery and imperialism in general. The female protagonist Oothoon, a sex slave who is raped by the slave driver Bromion, is clearly made to represent both the fertile, virginal and innocent lands of the pre-colonialism New World and the oppression of the women of Blake's time, who were, like slaves, treated as property of their husbands. In the course of his poem Oothoon becomes the ultimate symbol for liberation both as a woman and as a slave. William Blake (1757  1827) was a British poet, painter, visionary mystic, and engraver, who illustrated and printed his own books. Blake proclaimed the supremacy of the imagination over the rationalism and materialism of the 18th-century. Largely unrecognised during his lifetime, Blake is now considered a seminal figure in the history of both the poetry and visual arts of the Romantic Age.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sghzEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hey Ya!: The Unauthorized Biography of Outkast","description":"Since 1994 OutKast have been reinventing the rules of hip-hop, blending different styles of music into a Southern style that is wholly their own, soulful, outrageous, and addictive.

Sewage generated by a population of over two million Londoners was pouring into the river and was being carried to and fro by the tides. The Times called the crisis \\"The Great Stink\\". Parliament had to act - drastic measures were required to clean the Thames and to improve London's primitive system of sanitation. The great engineer entrusted by Parliament with this enormous task was Sir Joseph Bazalgette, and this book is a fascinating account of his life and work. Bazalgette's response to the challenge was to conceive and build the system of intercepting sewers, pumping stations and treatment works that serves London to this day. In the process he cleansed the River Thames of the capital's sewage and helped to banish cholera, which in the mid-nineteenth century carried off over 40,000 Londoners. But this successful scheme was only one element in Bazalgette's wider contribution to the development of the Victorian capital. He also reclaimed land from the Thames to construct the Victoria, Albert and Chelsea Embankments, built bridges across the Thames at Putney, Battersea and Hammersmith, and created many notable new thoroughfares including Charing Cross Road, Northumberland Avenue and Shaftesbury Avenue. Stephen Halliday's enthralling social and personal history gives a vivid insight into Bazalgette's achievements and the era in which he worked and lived. The author traces the origins of Bazalgette's family in revolutionary France, the confusing sanitation system that he inherited from medieval and Tudor times and his heroic battle with politicians, bureaucrats and huge engineering problems to transform the face and health of the world's largest city.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UKQ7AwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mechanics of Flight","description":"Mechanics of Flight is an ideal introduction to the basic principles of flight for students embarking on courses in aerospace engineering, student pilots, apprentices in the industry and anyone who is simply interested in aircraft and space flight.

At a time of radical bio-technological developments, and in light of the political and environmental imperatives of our age, the term 'posthuman' provides an alternative. The philosophical landscape which has developed as a response to the crisis of the human, includes several movements, such as: Posthumanism, Transhumanism, Antihumanism and Object Oriented Ontology. This book explains the similarities and differences between these currents and offers a detailed examination of a number of topics that fall under the  posthuman  umbrella, including the anthropocene, artificial intelligence and the deconstruction of the human. Francesca Ferrando affords particular focus to Philosophical Posthumanism, defined as a philosophy of mediation which addresses the meaning of humanity not in separation, but in relation to technology and ecology. The posthuman shift thus emerges in the global call for social change, responsible science and multispecies coexistence.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=u7qdDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Harvard Diary: v. 1: Essays on the Sacred and the Secular","description":"A look at faith through the voices of children from varied religious backgrounds, by the Pulitzer-winning author of The Moral Intelligence of Children. A New York Times Notable Book What do children think about when they consider God, Heaven and Hell, the value of life in the here and now, and the inevitability of death? Child psychiatrist, Pulitzer Prize-winning writer, and Harvard professor Robert Coles spent thirty years interviewing hundreds of children from South America and Europe to Africa and the Middle East who are developing concepts of faith even as they struggle to understand its contradictions. Be they Catholic or Protestant, Jewish children from Boston, Pakistani children in London, agnostics, Native Americans, or young Christians in the American South, they offer honest, enlightening and sometimes startling ideas of a spiritual existence. A Hopi girl who knows for a fact that we are resurrected as birds; an African American child who believes God exists as a hurricane to  blow away  drug dealers; a young Christian who needs his faith to cope with the death of his sister, lest she be just  a big heartache to us till the day we die ; and a Tennessee child who rationalizes his belief by admitting that  if there's no God, that's all there is, ashes.  The Spiritual Life of Children is  a remarkable book. The generosity of vision that characterizes Dr. Coles's enterprise enables him to create a climate where words of great beauty and truthfulness can be spoken.

Today the tools invented by these mid-twentieth century administrative reformers are largely taken for granted, assimilated into the everyday workings of government. As Stephen Collier and Andrew Lakoff argue in this book, the American government's current practices of disaster management can be traced back to this era. Collier and Lakoff argue that an understanding of the history of this initial formation of the \\"emergency state\\" is essential to an appreciation of the distinctive ways that the U.S. government deals with crises and emergencies-or fails to deal with them-today. This book focuses on historical episodes in emergency or disaster planning and management. Some of these episodes are well-known and have often been studied, while others are little-remembered today. The significance of these planners and managers is not that they were responsible for momentous technical innovations or that all their schemes were realized successfully. Their true significance lies in the fact that they formulated a way of understanding and governing emergencies that has come to be taken for granted\\"--","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=RPQ4EAAAQBAJ&dq=Government+by+Emergency&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Third Time Around","description":"Sometimes you have to start over to get love right.

In the midst of a blizzard, late one Christmas night in the 1950s, author Hal Borland heard a howl at the back door of his home on a hundred-acre farm in the Housatonic Valley of northwest Connecticut. Resistant at first, he called around trying to find an owner whose dog had gone missing with no luck. Finally, with the encouragement of his wife and haunted by memories of his childhood collie, Borland brought some scraps of leftover steak outside. This was his introduction to Pat, a miserable, half-starved, but deeply trusting black-and-white foxhound mutt. Pat would soon become a member of the family, accompanying Borland on hunts and terrorizing the local woodchuck population and teaching him that sometimes our most immediate connection to the natural world is through the animals we live with. A longtime journalist and a winner of the John Burroughs Medal for distinguished nature writing, Borland tells the tale of the time he shared with Pat in this touching true story that  will appeal to many sportsmen and to all people who have ever been closely attached to a dog  (The New York Times Book Review).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=be11ACU6PTIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Seville & Andalusia (Eyewitness Travel Guides)","description":"NOW A MAJOR TV DRAMA ON SKY ATLANTIC.

In Short-Term Treatment and Social Work Practice: An Integrative Perspective, Eda G. Goldstein and Maryellen Noonan take the best of theories that social workers have relied on for decades, including ego psychology, other psychodynamic and psychosocial frameworks, and the cognitive-behavioral approach, to create a new short-term practice model for social workers. Short-Term Treatment and Social Work Practice introduces the authors' integrative short-term treatment (ISTT), and demonstrates in detail each aspect of the approach. Their book is replete with case examples that illustrate ISTT's principles and techniques and their use in a variety of situations -- including crisis intervention, family- and group-oriented therapy, treatment of clients with emotional disorders, and treatment of nonvoluntary and hard-to-reach clients. As the first social work textbook describing an integrated framework for short-term treatment and practice, Short-Term Treatment and Social Work Practice fills a void the mental health field. Offering a comprehensive, practical, in-depth discussion, this book promises to become a vital new resource for students and practitioners alike.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=W0DQyGQSh40C&dq=Short-Term+Treatment+and+Social+Work+Practice:+An+Integrative+Perspective&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gilding the Lady","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-8ixnQAACAAJ&dq=Gilding+the+Lady&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Small Miracles Day by Day: A Guide for Parents of Individuals with Low Functioning Autism","description":"Autism is a baffling brain disorder that profoundly affects children's communication and social skills.

The stories of the men who hunted work between city and countryside, men alternately portrayed as either romantic adventurers or degenerate outsiders, have not been easy to find. Nor have these stories found a comfortable home in either rural or labor histories. Indispensable Outcasts weaves together history, anthropology, gender studies, and literary analysis to reposition these workers at the center of Progressive Era debates over class, race, manly responsibility, community, and citizenship. Combining incisive cultural criticism with the empiricism of a more traditional labor history, Frank Tobias Higbie illustrates how these so-called marginal figures were in fact integral to the communities they briefly inhabited and to the cultural conflicts over class, masculinity, and sexuality they embodied. He draws from life histories, the investigations of social reformers, and the organizing materials of the Industrial Workers of the World and presents a complex and compelling portrait of hobo life, from its often violent and dangerous working conditions to its ethic of \\"transient mutuality\\" that enabled survival and resistance on the road. More than a study of hobo life, this interdisciplinary book is also a meditation on the possibilities for writing history from the bottom up, as well as a frank discussion of the ways historians' fascination with personal narrative has colored their construction and presentation of history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FY5A1RG6OVgC&dq=Stuff+Magazine:+November+2002+(Issue+36)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The vigilantes of Montana (March of America facsimile series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=aVzstAEACAAJ&dq=The+vigilantes+of+Montana+(March+of+America+facsimile+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Runny Babbit: A Billy Sook","description":"Runny Babbit lent to wunch And heard the saitress way, \\"We have some lovely stabbit rew -- Our Special for today.\\" From the legendary creator of Where the Sidewalk Ends, A Light in the Attic, Falling Up, and The Giving Tree comes an unforgettable new character in children's literature.

Never before has the vast range of American women's experience during this pivotal era been brought together in one book. Now, Our Mothers' War re-creates what American women from all walks of life were doing and thinking, on the home front and abroad. Like all great histories, Our Mothers' War began with an illuminating discovery. After finding a journal and letters her mother had written while serving with the Red Cross in the Pacific, journalist Emily Yellin started unearthing what her mother and other women of her mother's generation went through during a time when their country asked them to step into roles they had never been invited, or allowed, to fill before. Drawing on a wide range of sources, including personal interviews and previously unpublished letters and diaries, Yellin shows what went on in the hearts and minds of the real women behind the female images of World War II -- women working in war plants; mothers and wives sending their husbands and sons off to war and sometimes death; women joining the military for the first time in American history; nurses operating in battle zones in Europe, Africa, and the Pacific; and housewives coping with rationing. Yellin also delves into lesser-known stories, including: tales of female spies, pilots, movie stars, baseball players, politicians, prostitutes, journalists, and even fictional characters; firsthand accounts from the wives of the scientists who created the atomic bomb at Los Alamos, African-American women who faced Jim Crow segregation laws at home even as their men were fighting enemy bigotry and injustice abroad, and Japanese-American women locked up as prisoners in their own country. Yellin explains how Wonder Woman was created in 1941 to fight the Nazi menace and became the first female comic book superhero, as well as how Marilyn Monroe was discovered in 1944 while working with her mother-in-law packing parachutes at a war plant in Burbank, California. Our Mothers' War gives center stage to those who might be called \\"the other American soldiers.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BcQDE0Ce9GAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gollum: How We Made Movie Magic (The Lord of the Rings)","description":"Shows how electronics wizards used the voice, body, and facial movements of actor Andy Serkis as a blueprint for creating the character \\"Gollum\\" in the third and final \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" film.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=kk3Aku1fGhQC&dq=Gollum:+How+We+Made+Movie+Magic+(The+Lord+of+the+Rings)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Pirotechnia of Vannoccio Biringuccio","description":"The pirotechnia.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=HKVGDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Pirotechnia+of+Vannoccio+Biringuccio&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Feast of Unreason","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=hHsAAAAAMAAJ&dq=Feast+of+Unreason&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Evaristo Carriego","description":"Jorge Luis Borges wrote: \\"Fame is a form of incomprehension, perhaps the worst.\\" Since his death Borges has been inducted into the world literary canon through the efforts of a number of influential critics and the Borges estate. Central to this project has been the publication of a group of grand volumes whose greatest achievement has been to make available in English works that had previously remained obscure, even in Spanish. The five-year collaboration (1967-1972) between Borges and Norman Thomas di Giovanni produced the translations that brought Borges his burgeoning global English readership. The Lesson of the Master--a memoir and essays--is an indispensable work for Borges readers and his growing legion of students and scholars. Di Giovanni was the only translator to have Borges on hand on a daily basis to contradict or authorize his work. In addition di Giovanni is not burdened with an over-reverence for his subject but is on the contrary playful, robust, and witty. The Lesson of the Master is an essential illumination of one of the great masters of twentieth-century literature.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=aJfL49nuKFMC&dq=Evaristo+Carriego&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"UNTOLD LIVES","description":"Miscast in the media for nearly 130 years, the victims of Jack the Ripper finally get their full stories told in this eye-opening and chilling reminder that life for middle-class women in Victorian London could be full of social pitfalls and peril.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2fuODwAAQBAJ&dq=UNTOLD+LIVES&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Little Book of Healing Magic","description":"D.

The young scattered in whatever directions their wild hair pointed and, gusting into one another, they fell in love. --from \\"Windy City\\" In his second book of poems, Stuart Dybek finds extraordinary vitality in the same vibrant imagery that animates his celebrated works of fiction. A brilliant and deft enactment of place, these poems map the internal geographies of characters who inhabit severe and often savage city streets, finding there a tension that transfigures past and present, memory and fantasy, sin and sanctity, nostalgia and the need to forget. Full of music and ecstasy, the poems of Streets in Their Own Ink consecrate a shadowed, alternate city of dreams and retrospection that parallels a modern city of hard realities. Throughout, one finds poetry enlivened by Dybek's signature talent for translating \\"extreme and fantastic events into a fabulous dailiness, as though the extraordinary were everywhere around us if only someone would tell us where to look\\" (Geoffrey Wolff).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Q7xZAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Colorado Mathematical Olympiad: The First Ten Years and Further Explorations","description":"Now in its third decade, the Colorado Mathematical Olympiad (CMO), founded by the author, has become an annual state-wide competition, hosting many hundreds of middle and high school contestants each year. This book presents a year-by-year history of the CMO from 20042013 with all the problems from the competitions and their solutions. Additionally, the book includes 10 further explorations, bridges from solved Olympiad problems to  real  mathematics, bringing young readers to the forefront of various fields of mathematics. This book contains more than just problems, solutions, and event statistics   it tells a compelling story involving the lives of those who have been part of the Olympiad, their reminiscences of the past and successes of the present. I am almost speechless facing the ingenuity and inventiveness demonstrated in the problems proposed in the third decade of these Olympics. However, equally impressive is the drive and persistence of the originator and living soul of them. It is hard for me to imagine the enthusiasm and commitment needed to work singlehandedly on such an endeavor over several decades.  Branko Gr nbaum, University of Washingtonp/ppiAfter decades of hunting for Olympiad problems, and struggling to create Olympiad problems, he has become an extraordinary connoisseur and creator of Olympiad problems. The Olympiad problems were very good, from the beginning, but in the third decade the problems have become extraordinarily good. Every brace of 5 problems is a work of art. The harder individual problems range in quality from brilliant to work-of-genius... The same goes for the  Further Explorations  part of the book. Great mathematics and mathematical questions are immersed in a sauce of fascinating anecdote and reminiscence. If you could have only one book to enjoy while stranded on a desert island, this would be a good choice. /ii/i/psup/supp/ppiLike Gauss, Alexander Soifer would not hesitate to inject Eureka! at the right moment. Like van der Waerden, he can transform a dispassionate exercise in logic into a compelling account of sudden insights and ultimate triumph./ii/i/pp  Cecil Rousseau Chair, USA Mathematical Olympiad Committee/ppiA delightful feature of the book is that in the second part more related problems are discussed. Some of them are still unsolved./ii/i/pp Paul Erd?s/ppiThe book is a gold mine of brilliant reasoning with special emphasis on the power and beauty of coloring proofs.

A biting satire of Bolshevism, it was written in 1925 at the height of the NEP period, when communism appeared to be relaxing in the Soviet Union. It is generally interpreted as an allegory of the Communist revolution and \\"the revolution's misguided attempt to radically transform mankind.\\" Its publication was initially prohibited in the Soviet Union, but it circulated in samizdat until it was officially released in the country in 1987. It was almost immediately turned into a TV movie, which was aired in late 1988 on First Programme (First Channel) of Soviet Television, gained almost universal acclaim and attracted many readers to the original Bulgakov text. Since then, the novella has become a cultural phenomenon in Russia, known and discussed by people \\"from schoolchildren to politicians.\\" It has become a subject of critical argument, was filmed in Russian and Italian-language versions, and was adapted in English as a play and an opera.

But as the Great War begins, he finds himself forced to reassess many of the things he thought he was sure of. As refugees from Belgium arrive in the town of Matching's Easy, telling frightening tales of what they have seen, Mr. Britling sees men dressed in khakis everywhere he looks. and his family's tutor, a German, is forced to return home. Then comes the change that scares him the most: His own son, Hugh, only seventeen, enlists in the Territorials, the British Army's volunteer reserve. Day by day and month by month, Britling observes the unfolding events and public reaction to the war as his ordinary life is shaken in ways large and small. As Wells's characters try to keep their bearings in a world suddenly changed beyond recognition, Mr. Britling must wrestle with outrage, grief, and attempts at rationalization as he resolves to \\"see it through.\\" Whether science fiction or not, H. G. Wells's stories always reflect deep human truths. Written in 1916, when the outcome of the conflict was still uncertain, this is both a fascinating portrait of Britain at war and a rare inside look at H. G. Wells himself, as Mr. Britling was a largely autobiographical character.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0QpNEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Some Price to Pay","description":"Just as their family is completed, tragedy strikes a young couple.

Now here I was at a runaway shelter, staring at a nun s mustache and wondering where I was going to spend the rest of my adolescence. At fifteen, sick of her mom s spineless reactions to abusive menand afraid of her stepfather s unpredictable behaviorJanice Erlbaum walked out of her family s apartment and never returned. What followed that fateful decision is the heart of this amazing, fascinating, and disturbing memoir. From her first frightening night at a shelter, trying to sleep in a large room filled with yelling girls, Janice knew she was in over her head. She was beaten up, shaken down, and nearly stabbed by a pregnant girl. But it was still better than living at home. Just like that, she was halfway homeless, always one step away from being sent  upstate to Lockdown.  As Janice slipped further into street life, she nevertheless continued to attend high school, harbor crushes, even play the lead in the spring production of Guys and Dolls. She also roamed the streets, clubs, bars, and parks of New York City with her two best girlfriends, on the prowl for hard drugs and boys on skateboards. Together they scored coke at Danceteria, smoked angel dust in East Village squats, commiserated over their crazy mothers, and slept with one another s boyfriends on a regular basis. Janice Erlbaum paints a wry, mesmerizing portrait of being underprivileged, underage, and underdressed in the 1980s, bouncing from shelters to group homes, from tenement squats to legendary nightclubs. A moving and tremendously entertaining ride through the seediest parts of New York City, Girlbomb provides an unflinching look at street life, survival sex, female friendships, and first loves.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3fW4qbp5gQ8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Our Baby's First Seven Years (Pink Cover)","description":"In 1990, Ann Mix began a search to find out about her father, who had been killed in World War II.

Polluted, corrupt, infamous as the sex capital of the world, it is a place where wealth, poverty and unimaginable evil walk hand in hand. In District 8, the underbelly of Bangkok's crime world, a dramatically mutilated body is found in a hotel bedroom. It looks bad: the corpse - who's been flayed - is CIA. And it gets worse when the self-confessed murderer is the beautiful Chanya - the best 'working girl' at The Old Man's Club, a brothel owned jointly by Sonchai's mother and his boss, Police Colonel Vikorn. Alerted by Sonchai, Vikorn quickly concocts a cover-up that involves an Al-Qaeda terrorist cell located in a southern Thai border-town where, since 9/11, the CIA has also had a covert presence. So far so good: but the truth will be harder to come by, and it will require Sonchai to find an ever more delicate balance between his ambition (western) and his Buddhism (eastern), while he runs the gamut of Bangkok's drug-dealers, prostitutes, bad cops, even worse military generals, and the pitfalls of his own melting heart.

The League of Frightened Men Paul Chapin s Harvard cronies never forgave themselves for the hazing prank that left their friend a cripple.

Ann Vanderhoof and her husband did just that. In the mid 1990s, the author and her husband were driven, forty-something professionals who were desperate for a break from their harried, deadline-dominated lives. So they left their jobs, rented out their house, moved onto a 42-foot yacht called Receta ('recipe' in Spanish) and set sail from their home in Canada for the Caribbean. AN EMBARRASSMENT OF MANGOES is Ann Vanderhoof's intimate account of this two-year midlife interlude during which she and her husband travelled more than 7,000 nautical miles, dropped anchor in 16 countries (and 47 individual islands), and adapted to a new life on 'island time'. Exchanging suits for bare feet, they leave the stresses of their old life behind and become caught up in a world that is simultaneously simpler and more exuberant. They sip rum with their neighbours and dance through the streets during Carnival, explore secluded beaches, learn to pull their dinner from the sea and create delectable dishes in their tiny galley kitchen. Interspersed with irresistible recipes, from cracked conch in the Bahamas, curried lobster in Grenada, spicy island gingerbread to West Indian rum punch, AN EMBARRASSMENT OF MANGOES is the enticing story of discovering not just vibrant new cultures and cuisines, but what really matters.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AG1fhlq4P0QC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Fountainhead","description":"Her first major literary success, Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead is an exalted view of her Objectivist philosophy, portraying a visionary artist struggling against the dull, conformist dogma of his peers; a book of ambition, power, gold and love, published in Penguin Modern Classics. Architect Howard Roark is as unyielding as the granite he blasts to build with. Defying the conventions of the world around him, he embraces a battle over two decades against a double-dealing crew of rivals who will stop at nothing to bring him down. These include, perhaps most troublesome of all, the ambitious Dominique Francon, who may just prove to be Roarke's equal. This epic story of money, power and a man's struggle to succeed on his own terms is a paean to individualism and humanity's creative potential. First published in 1943, The Fountainhead introduced millions to Rand's philosophy of Objectivism: an uncompromising defence of self-interest as the engine of progress, and a jubilant celebration of man's creative potential. Ayn Rand (1905-1982), born Alisa Rosenbaum in St. Petersburg, Russia, emigrated to America with her family in January 1926, never to return to her native land. Her novel The Fountainhead was published in 1943 and eventually became a bestseller. Still occasionally working as a screenwriter, Rand moved to New York City in 1951 and published Atlas Shrugged in 1957. Her novels espoused what came to be called Objectivism, a philosophy that champions capitalism and the pre-eminence of the individual. If you enjoued The Fountainhead, you might like Rand's Atlas Shrugged, also available in Penguin Modern Classics.

With cinematic immediacy and meticulous attention to historical detail, here is the true story of a legendary sixteenth-century explorer and his death-defying navigation of the Amazon river of darkness, pathway to gold. In 1541, the brutal conquistador Gonzalo Pizarro and his well-born lieutenant Francisco Orellana set off from Quito in search of La Canela, South America s rumored Land of Cinnamon, and the fabled El Dorado,  the golden man.  Driving an enormous retinue of mercenaries, enslaved natives, horses, hunting dogs, and other animals across the Andes, they watched their proud expedition begin to disintegrate even before they descended into the nightmarish jungle, following the course of a powerful river. Soon hopelessly lost in the swampy labyrinth, their numbers diminishing daily through disease, starvation, and Indian attacks, Pizarro and Orellana made a fateful decision to separate. While Pizarro eventually returned home barefoot and in rags, Orellana and fifty-seven men, in a few fragile craft, continued downriver into the unknown reaches of the mighty Amazon, serenaded by native war drums and the eerie cries of exotic predators. Theirs would be the greater glory. Interweaving eyewitness accounts of the quest with newly uncovered details, Buddy Levy reconstructs the seminal journey that has electrified adventurers ever since, as Orellana became the first European to navigate and explore the entire length of the world s largest river. Levy gives a long-overdue account of the native populations some peaceful and welcoming, offering sustenance and life-saving guidance, others ferociously hostile, subjecting the invaders to gauntlets of unremitting attack and intimations of terrifying rituals. And here is the Amazon itself, a powerful presence whose every twist and turn held the promise of new wonders both natural and man-made, as well as the ever-present risk of death a river that would hold Orellana in its irresistible embrace to the end of his life. Overflowing with violence and beauty, nobility and tragedy, River of Darkness is both riveting history and a breathtaking adventure that will sweep readers along on an epic voyage unlike any other.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=j4qP-GCsHfEC&dq=The+Discovery+of+the+Amazon+(American+Geographical+Society+Special+Publication+No.+17)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nirvana: 30 Note-for-Note Guitar Transcriptions, CD-ROM Sheet Music","description":"Van de vroege R&B via de rock n roll (Buddy Holly) en de bluesrock (Clapton) naar de heavy metal (Metallica) en de progrock (Pink Floyd).

In this book, volume editors Katie Rose M. Sanfilippo and Neta Spiro define musical care as the role that music - music listening as well as music-making - plays in supporting any aspect of people's developmental or health needs, for example physical and mental health, cognitive and behavioural development, and interpersonal relationships. Musical care is relevant to several types of music, approach, and setting, and through the introduction of that new term musical care, the authors prioritise the element of care that is shared among these otherwise diverse contexts and musical activities, celebrating the nuanced interweaving of theory and practice. The multifaceted nature of musical care requires reconciling perspectives and expertise from different fields and disciplines. This book shows interdisciplinary collaboration in action by bringing together music practitioners and researchers to write each chapter collaboratively to discuss musical care from an interdisciplinary perspective and offer directions for future work. The life course structure, from infancy to end of life, highlights the connections and themes present in approach, context, and practices throughout our lives. Thus, the book represents both the start of a conversation and a call to action, inspiring new collaborations that provide new insights to musical care in its many facets.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=NL9pEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Kangaroo+Method:+Learn+Verbal+Intelligence+Now&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"GRUDGE MOUNTAIN.","description":"For hundreds of years Grudge Mountain had lain in cloud-shrouded mystery.

Martha C. Nussbaum, philosopher and classicist, argues that contemporary curricular reform is already producing such  citizens of the world  in its advocacy of diverse forms of cross-cultural studies. Her vigorous defense of  the new education  is rooted in Seneca s ideal of the citizen who scrutinizes tradition critically and who respects the ability to reason wherever it is found in rich or poor, native or foreigner, female or male. Drawing on Socrates and the Stoics, Nussbaum establishes three core values of liberal education: critical self-examination, the ideal of the world citizen, and the development of the narrative imagination. Then, taking us into classrooms and campuses across the nation, including prominent research universities, small independent colleges, and religious institutions, she shows how these values are (and in some instances are not) being embodied in particular courses. She defends such burgeoning subject areas as gender, minority, and gay studies against charges of moral relativism and low standards, and underscores their dynamic and fundamental contribution to critical reasoning and world citizenship. For Nussbaum, liberal education is alive and well on American campuses in the late twentieth century. It is not only viable, promising, and constructive, but it is essential to a democratic society. Taking up the challenge of conservative critics of academe, she argues persuasively that sustained reform in the aim and content of liberal education is the most vital and invigorating force in higher education today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_f4pAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Good-Bye Samizdat: Twenty Years of Czechoslovak Underground Writing","description":"Good-by, Samizdat offers the first collection of some of the best of underground texts.

Ranging from Ed Sullivan to cyberspace, from kid shows to cable, and from the cheap thrills of \\"action adventure\\" to the solemn boredom of PBS pledge week, Leonard argues for a whole new way of thinking about television. For Leonard, the situation comedy is a socializing agency, the talk show is a legitimating agency, the made-for-television movie is the last redoubt of social conscience, and television criticism itself is the last refuge of time-serving thugs and postmodernists. Instead of scapegoating television as the cause of crime in our streets, stupidity in our schools, and spectacle rather than substance in our government, Leonard sees something else inside the box: an echo chamber and a feedback loop, a medium neither wholly innocent of nor entirely responsible for the frantic disorder it brings into our homes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=lLXTyrlM59MC&dq=Race&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Triumph Cars in America","description":"As with most postwar British sports cars, a large portion of the Triumphs produced in the 1950s and 1960s were exported to the United States.

This was the kind of crime that could tear the heart out of a community. The Camm's lived the American Dream. They had what seemed like a loving marriage, a nice little house with a white picket fence, and two adorable children. To top it all off, David Camm was a pillar of the community who had dedicated his career to the enforcement of the law and the sanctity of human life. Then, this happened. Three days later, it got worse when police arrested David Camm for the triple murder. Soon, new stories started emerging: stories about mistresses and violent bursts of temper. And as the ugly truth about the Camms' marriage got uglier and the evidence against David started piling up, two families-and the community at large-took positions at opposite sides of a yawning and bitter divide. Was David Camm a dedicated, conscientious public servant-the victim of unspeakable tragedy, railroaded by an unfair system? Or was he a cold-hearted murderer who earned his three murder convictions and every one of the 195 years behind bars to which he was sentenced? Investigative journalist John Glatt finds out in this gripping new book.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WKHvf1bvh9gC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Night Of Wishes","description":"From the author of The Neverending Story, a book that reminds us that  magic be it good or bad is no simple matter.

Many of these people are doing so with little knowledge of practical astronomy and, as the volume of questions asked at astronomical society meetings and on internet newsgroups attest, there is a need for these questions to be answered in one place. Hence this book. The fundamental premise behind AstroFAQs is that the beginning amateur astronomer wishes to get \\"up and running\\" with the minimum delay. A secondary premise is that anyone will better appreciate why something is done as it is if there is an understanding of the underlying principles. AstroFAQs addresses both these premises. AstroFAQs makes no pretence to go into great depth -that would be impossible in such a slim volume -but it will give you the kick-start you need to choose and use your instrument effectively, and will take you to a level of expertise that is significantly higher than the \\"beginner\\" status. It uses a hierarchical section num bering system that simplifies cross-referencing. Suggestions for more in-depth reading are given throughout. More and more \\"newbie\\" astronomers are entering this fascinating hobby by purchasing one of the \\"gee whiz\\" GOTO telescopes, of which there is an increasing selection. These serve the wish to begin observation as soon as possible, but they do so at a price premium.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EB7vBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"High, wide and lonesome","description":"A memoir of a childhood homesteading in frontier Colorado:  A book from the heart . . . the stuff of the American dream  (The New York Times). In this memoir of a lost America, Hal Borland tells the story of his family s migration to eastern Colorado as homesteaders at the turn of the twentieth century. On an unsettled and unwelcoming prairie landscape, the Borlands build a house, plant crops, and eke out a meager existence. While life is difficult and self-reliance is necessary with no neighbors for miles the experience brings the family close and binds them closer to the terrible and beautiful natural patterns that govern their lives. Borland would grow up to study journalism and become an acclaimed nature writer, and it was these childhood years on the prairie that shaped the author s heart and mind.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Q3IVUXQAiOkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"California Facts and Symbols","description":"Presents information about the state of California, its nickname, motto, and emblems.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9U1qf4n7XN4C&dq=California+Facts+and+Symbols&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fishes of the Gulf of Mexico: Texas, Louisiana, and Adjacent Waters, Second Edition (W.

All are case based and describe auscultation as it relates to a patient and in terms of the gold standard for interpretation of heart sounds. Auscultation is the term for listening to the internal sounds of the body, usually using a stethoscope. It is performed for the purposes of examining the circulatory system and respiratory system (heart sounds and breath sounds). As a topic it is one of the oldest in cardiology but its utility should never be underestimated. In this era of hugely expensive imaging tests, auscultation is a cornerstone of efficient diagnosis and therefore needs a fresh look. The core content of this book describes the search for diagnostic clues within patients  heart sounds and as such this book provides superb practical advice in the form of a series of clinical pearls reflecting what accurate diagnosis with auscultation can mean to patient prognosis and outcome. This often subtle but ultimately simple subject often produces complex results and these must be considered in light of modern next-level diagnostic methods and patient management.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tojDCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Handbook for Boys","description":"A startling amalgam of Zulu war-cry and imperial and urban myth, of borrowed tips on health and hygiene, and object lessons in woodcraft, this text is the original blueprint and 'self-instructor' of the Boy Scout Movement.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=LdtVxcFpWFQC&dq=Handbook+for+Boys&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stripey the Caterpillar","description":"Stripey the caterpillar is feeling a bit sick.

This volume brings together historians, sociologists, anthropologists, and media and visual scholars to articulate how photography, as a practice and as a visual medium, can provide insights into national memory, collective identities, and the historical imagination. This collection allows the reader to trace parallel conceptual developments occurring in the sociology and anthropology of memory and in the history and theory of photography, and to illustrate the unique \\"angles of vision\\" these disciplines offer. Photographic images commonly accompany historical accounts, from documentaries to family scrapbooks, and since the early days of commercial photography, pictures have been viewed as tools to capture memories. Later critical writing has challenged this equation by inverting it: photos, along with other archival practices, were often viewed as falling short of their supposed function as vessels of memory and at times even denounced as devices that distorted memories. How does photography participate in the formation and maintenance of collective identities and shared memory discourses, from the family to the nation? Furthermore, how can we begin to conceptualize photography's effects on the historical imagination of individuals and groups? Double Exposure endeavors to answer these questions by calling attention to the variety of contexts in which images circulate and to the narratives from which they spring and which they, in turn, shape. This is the latest volume in Transaction's Memory and Narrative series.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sq00DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Most Memorable Meals","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=JSgjzgEACAAJ&dq=Most+Memorable+Meals&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Moral Minds: How Nature Designed Our Universal Sense of Right and Wrong","description":"In his groundbreaking book, Marc Hauser puts forth a revolutionary new theory: that humans have evolved a universal moral instinct, unconsciously propelling us to deliver judgments of right and wrong independent of gender, education, and religion.

While continuing to stress the basic importance of the traditional usages, such as the regular characters to be found in all materials published before the adoption of the simplified forms in 1956 and still in use in some areas, the present revision goes further in contrasting variant usages and in providing additional material relevant to the PRC. Closely related with the author's Beginning Chinese and its companion volume, Character Text for Beginning Chinese, this text is based on a new approach which not only takes into account the advantages of the oral-aural method but gets the student more quickly into material that he is likely to encounter in actual written Chinese. Unique features are the emphasis on compounds and their extensive use in various types of exercises. The 1,200 combinations are based on 400 characters; in all, the book contains 120,000 characters of running text. All compounds appear in illustrative sentences accompnied by English translations, in dialogues as a means of audio-lingual reinforcement, and in narrative or expository form. Additional exercises include maps, booksellers' book lists, correspondence, poems, table of contents, and brief passages from the works of outstanding writers such as Sun Yatsen, Hu Shih, Mao Tse-tung, and Lu Hsun. Supplementary lessons present reading material using the simiplified characters adopted in mainland China. To suit the needs of the beginner, characters are introduced in large size, and tables indicate the sequence of strokes used in their formation. In addition to a pinyin index, there are three summary charts in which the characters are arranged by lesson, by number of strokes, and by radical. A fourth chart contrasts regular and simplified characters; a fifth chart presents variant forms of the same chracter. Because of the large characters and extensive material, the book is issued in two volumes, Part I and Part II. This work was supported by a contract with the United States Office of Education.

It is perhaps the most misunderstood of modern philosophic positions misunderstood by reason of its broad popularity and general unfamiliarity with its origins, representatives, and principles. Existential thinking does not originate with Jean Paul Sartre. It has prior religious, literary, and philosophic origins. In its narrowest formulation it is a metaphysical doctrine, arguing as it does that any definition of man s essence must follow, not precede, an estimation of his existence. In Heidegger, it affords a view of Being in its totality; in Kierkegaard an approach to that inwardness indispensable to authentic religious experience; for Dostoevsky, Kafka, and Rilke the existential situation bears the stamp of modern man s alienation, uprootedness, and absurdity; to Sartre it has vast ethical and political implications. Walter Kaufmann, author of Nietzsche, is eminently qualified to present and interpret the insights of existentialism as they occur and are deepened by the major thinkers who express them. In every case complete selections or entire works have been employed: The Wall, Existentialism, and the complete chapter on  Self-Deception  from L  tre et le N ant by Sartre; two lectures from Jaspers  book Reason and Existenz; original translations of On My Philosophy by Jaspers and The Way Back into the Ground of Metaphysics by Heidegger.

Chesnutt's first great literary success, and since their initial publication in 1899 they have come to be seen as some of the most remarkable works of African American literature from the Emancipation through the Harlem Renaissance. Lesser known, though, is that the The Conjure Woman, as first published by Houghton Mifflin, was not wholly Chesnutt's creation but a work shaped and selected by his editors. This edition reassembles for the first time all of Chesnutt's work in the conjure tale genre, the entire imaginative feat of which the published Conjure Woman forms a part. It allows the reader to see how the original volume was created, how an African American author negotiated with the tastes of the dominant literary culture of the late nineteenth century, and how that culture both promoted and delimited his work. In the tradition of Uncle Remus, the conjure tale listens in on a poor black southerner, speaking strong dialect, as he recounts a local incident to a transplanted northerner for the northerner's enlightenment and edification. But in Chesnutt's hands the tradition is transformed. No longer a reactionary flight of nostalgia for the antebellum South, the stories in this book celebrate and at the same time question the folk culture they so pungently portray, and ultimately convey the pleasures and anxieties of a world in transition. Written in the late nineteenth century, a time of enormous growth and change for a country only recently reunited in peace, these stories act as the uneasy meeting ground for the culture of northern capitalism, professionalism, and Christianity and the underdeveloped southern economy, a kind of colonial Third World whose power is manifest in life charms, magic spells, and ha'nts, all embodied by the ruling figure of the conjure woman. Humorous, heart-breaking, lyrical, and wise, these stories make clear why the fiction of Charles W. Chesnutt has continued to captivate audiences for a century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ZCFJ-LK_I6oC&dq=The+Conjure+Woman&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Greek-English Concordance to the New Testament, The","description":"The Greek-English Concordance presents in alphabetical order every word in the Greek New Testament along with, in English, the passages in which the word occurs.

When Lucifer Dye is released from three months in a Hong Kong prison, debriefed, handed a false passport, a new wardrobe and a $20,000 check, his haughty control makes it clear that Dye's career with his country has been permanently terminated. But a good agent is always in demand, and just a few hours later Dye is being interviewed for a highly ingenious position. Victor Orcutt, although a not very good imitation of a British pre-war gent, has creative talents of his own. He has his sights a small southern city, with the ordinary run-of-the-mill corruption one would expect in such a place. The canny Orcott knows there's no profit in that .

It draws on case studies of classical art and texts to open up analysis of the genre to the wider theme of aestheticexperience in early classical Greece, with particular focus on the poetic mechanisms through which Pindar's victory odes use visual and material culture to engage their audiences. Complete readings of Nemean 5, Nemean 8, and Pythian 1 reveal the poet's deep interest in the relations between lyricpoetry and commemorative and religious sculpture, as well as other significant visual phenomena, while literary studies of his evocation of cultural attitudes through elaborate use of the lyric first person are combined with art-historical treatments of ecphrasis, of image and text, and of art'sframing of ritual experience in ancient Greece. This specific aesthetic approach is expanded through fresh treatments of Simonides' and Bacchylides' own engagements with material culture, as well as an account of Pindaric themes in the Aeginetan logoi of Herodotus' Histories. These come together tooffer not just a novel perspective on the relationship between art and text in Pindaric poetry, but to give rise to new claims about the nature of classical Greek visuality and ritual subjectivity, and to foster a richer understanding of the ways in which classical poetry and art shaped the livesand experiences of its ancient consumers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=0n8yDwAAQBAJ&dq=Eyes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teaching Stories","description":"When nearly everyone else is telling kids no \\"No, do it this way .No, I don t want to hear what you think .No, sit down and pay attention\\" Judy Logan says yes, to a child s passions, interests, and hopes.

In an age of fragmentation and the emergence of new nationalist forces, Dawson argued that if \\"our civilization is to survive, it is essential that it should develop a common European consciousness and sense of historic and organic unity.\\" But he was clear that this unity required sources deeper and more complex than the political and economic movements on which so many had come to depend, and he insisted, prophetically, that Europe would need to recover its Christian roots if it was to survive.

Hoe was het om in dat huis te wonen? Maggie Holt is die vraag wel gewend. Vijfentwintig jaar geleden verhuisde ze met haar ouders, Ewan en Jess, naar Baneberry Hall, een negentiende-eeuws landhuis in Vermont. Drie weken later waren ze er halsoverkop uit vertrokken; een traumatische gebeurtenis waarover Ewan later een bestseller zou schrijven. Tegenwoordig knapt Maggie oude woningen op en ze kan zich de gebeurtenissen van toen nauwelijks herinneren. Ze gelooft ook eigenlijk geen woord van wat er in haar vaders boek staat. Wanneer ze na zijn dood Baneberry Hall erft, gaat ze terug naar de plek waar het allemaal begon. Ze is van plan om het pand een facelift te geven en te verkopen. Haar terugkeer wordt met argusogen bekeken door de inwoners, want het kleine stadje is er niet goed vanaf gekomen in haar vaders boek. Zodra Maggie over de drempel van Baneberry Hall stapt begint ze zich af te vragen of er toch geen waarheid in het boek schuilt.

After an exploration of the implications of these two treatises for our understanding of Aristotle's metaphysics, Gotthelf examines important aspects of the method by which Aristotle organizes his data in the History of Animals to make possible such a systematic, explanatory study of animals, offering a new view of the place of classification in that enterprise. In a concluding section on 'Aristotle as Theoretical Biologist', Gotthelf explores the basis of Charles Darwin's great praise of Aristotle and, in the first printing of a lecture delivered worldwide, provides an overview of Aristotle as a philosophically-oriented scientist, and 'a proper verdict' on his greatness as scientist.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FwNREAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Interlinear Greek-English New Testament","description":"The New Testament volume of \\"The Interlinear Bible Hebrew-Greek-English\\" The \\"Interlinear Greek-English New Testament \\" is keyed to\\"Strong's Exhaustive Concordance.\\" Thousands of pastors, students, and laypeople have found it to be a time-saving tool for researching the subtle nuances and layers of meaning within the original Greek.

Planned by Daniel Burnham in 1909, the avenue became the principal connecting link between downtown and the wealthy, residential \\"Gold Coast\\" north of the Loop. Some thirty buildings were constructed along its path in the ten-year period before the Depression, an urban expansion comparable in significance to that of Pennsylvania and Park Avenues. John W. Stamper traces the complex development of North Michigan Avenue from the 1880s to the 1920s building boom that solidified its character and economic base, describing the initiation of the planning process by private interests to its execution aided by the city's powerful condemnation and taxation proceedings. He focuses on individual buildings constructed on the avenue, including the Renaissance- and Gothic-inspired Wrigley Building, Tribune Tower, and Drake Hotel, and places them within the context of factors governing their construction property ownership, financing, zoning laws, design theory, and advertising. Stamper compares this stylistically diverse mixture of low- and high-rise structures with earlier, rejected planning proposals, all of which had prescribed a uniformly designed, European-like avenue of continuous cornice heights, consistent facade widths, and complementary stylistic features. He analyzes the drastically different character the avenue took by 1930, with high-rise towers reaching thirty stories and beyond, in terms of the clash among economic, political, and architectural interests. His argument that the discrepancies between the rejected plans and reality illustrate the developers' choice of economic return on their investment over aesthetic community is extended through to the present avenue and the virtual disregard of the urban qualities proposed at its inception. Generously illustrated, with an epilogue condensing the avenue's history between the end of World War II and the present, this is an exhaustive account of an important topic in the history of modern architecture and city planning.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=mfZ4jpTR-68C&dq=Chicago%27s+North+Michigan+Avenue:+Planning+and+Development,+1900-1930+(Chicago+Architecture+and+Urbanism)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A-Counting We Will Go (Learn to Read Math Series)","description":"A counting rhyme, sung to the tune of \\"A-hunting we will go,\\" emphasizes one-to-one correspondence and comparing quantities.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ox4uBGu1BiIC&dq=A-Counting+We+Will+Go+(Learn+to+Read+Math+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dawn","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1SjQAaa1bwAC&dq=Dawn&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Favorite Poems for Children Coloring Book (Dover Classic Stories Coloring Book)","description":"Many first encounters with great poems could be made even more satisfying and memorable if children could add their own colors to the lyrics.

In Children's Bibles in America, Russell W. Dalton explores the variety of ways in which children's Bibles have adapted, illustrated, and retold Bible stories for children throughout U.S. history. This reception history of the story of Noah as it appears in children's Bibles provides striking examples of the multivalence and malleability of biblical texts, and offers intriguing snapshots of American culture and American religion in their most basic forms. Dalton demonstrates the ways in which children's Bibles reflect and reveal America's diverse and changing beliefs about God, childhood, morality, and what must be passed on to the next generation. Dalton uses the popular story of Noah's ark as a case study, exploring how it has been adapted and appropriated to serve in a variety of social agendas. Throughout America's history, the image of God in children's Bible adaptations of the story of Noah has ranged from that of a powerful, angry God who might destroy children at any time to that of a friendly God who will always keep children safe. At the same time, Noah has been lifted up as a model of virtues ranging from hard work and humble obedience to patience and positive thinking. Dalton explores these uses of the story of Noah and more as he engages the fields of biblical studies, the history of religion in America, religious education, childhood studies, and children's literature.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FheGCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Casa Adobe","description":"In their third book, the authors forge through the mountains of Mexico and the deserts of the American Southwest in celebration of the strength and wonder of adobe design style. 195 photos, 175 in color.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Uml-fWB-jwAC&dq=Casa+Adobe&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mamba's daughters,: A play","description":"A perceptive commentary on the pursuit of freedom and identity among blacks and whites in a segregated society, revealing the inside world of Charleston high society while it penetrates the culture of the city's African-American population.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=4hJaAAAAMAAJ&dq=Mamba%27s+daughters,:+A+play&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lenin's last letters and articles","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9mMstAEACAAJ&dq=Lenin%27s+last+letters+and+articles&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Irresistible Prince (Royal Weddings) (Harlequin Silhouette Romance)","description":"ROYAL WEDDINGS Three small-town women find happily-ever-after with three irresistible princes!

This question has provoked considerable controversy ever since TV first became widely available in the 1950s. Now that most people watch television regularly, the debate is even more difficult to resolve. Do light versus heavy viewers of television differ on some measure because they use television differently, and/or because they differ on some other important characteristic (e.g., intelligence)? Do they differ because they have been influenced by TV? Or is the process of influence transactional? This book describes the results of a large research project based on an unusual opportunity to address these kinds of issues--a natural experiment involving a non-isolated Canadian town which did not obtain TV reception until late 1973. We studied three communities on two occasions, just before one of the towns obtained television for the first time and again 2 years later. The book is not, however, merely a description of who was studied, when, how, and what was found. Our goal is to use this natural experiment to understand the processes involved in television's influence and the complexities of relationships between TV and human behavior\\"--Publisher description.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=t4eFAAAAIAAJ&dq=The+Impact+of+Television:+A+Natural+Experiment+in+Three+Communities&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Prayer is the Answer","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2zmgxAEACAAJ&dq=Prayer+is+the+Answer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pakistan's Drift Into Extremism: Allah, then Army, and America's War Terror","description":"Pakistan's Drift into Extremism examines the rise of religious extremism in Pakistan and analyzes its connections to the Pakistani army's policies and fluctuating U.S.-Pakistani relations.

It focuses on Egypt's evolution as a nation-state, dispelling common misconceptions about Egypt's modern history. Professor Goldschmidt calls upon recent Egyptian and Western scholarship to document pivotal points, such as the 1952 revolution, and to illuminate controversies, such as those surrounding Sadat's role in the 1973 war with Israel. Modern Egypt is anecdotal as well as authoritative, covering social history, religion, politics, economics, military history, geography, and even the psychology of selected leaders. Faruq's impotence, Nasir's paranoia, and Sadat's glamour are all presented as they relate to policy motivations and outcomes. Modern Egypt paves the way to a clear understanding of events leading up to the Camp David accords of 1978 and then points beyond them to the emergent Muslim opposition, Sadat's assassination, and Mubarak's regime.This book is directed to students, journalists, diplomats, foreign visitors and long-term residents, and businesspeople who need to be familiar with Egypt, its role in Middle East affairs, and its involvement with the nations of the world.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=n5A4DgAAQBAJ&dq=Modern+Egypt,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE AMERICAN CINEMA: Directors and Directions 1929-1968","description":"Profiles of American film directors are given and their influence on the art is discussed","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=rYW0AAAAIAAJ&dq=THE+AMERICAN+CINEMA:+Directors+and+Directions+1929-1968&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Transport of delight--the mythical conception of rail transit in Los Angeles","description":"Transport of Delight is a true interdisciplinary work, and includes a thorough analytical assessment of the Los Angeles rail program, with a focus on the Long Beach Blue Line light rail-the first of the new projects to go ahead. En route, it shows that ridership forecasting for this project was not only biased and statistically invalid, but in fact done to justify decisions made on other grounds. This unusual book develops a novel theory of myth to explain the construction of rail passenger transit in Los Angeles when it had little to offer the needs of a dispersed autopolis, whose urgent but dispersed public transportation needs could have been better served by developing the regional bus system. The author conducted interviews and performed the detective work necessary to reveal an unlikely logic that held together a network of symbols, images, and metaphors that together present powerful mythical beliefs in the guise of truth. A political analysis shows how consensus was reached to proceed with the light rail to Long Beach, but political explanations are ultimately found lacking, because they cannot explain why decision-makers would want to put the rail in place. It is only when provocative metaphors-of the need to connect communities and to restore a mythical balance to a dysfunctional transportation system-and symbols-of escape from the pressure cooker of poverty, of urban success, power and, indeed sexual acumen-are surfaced, that we realize that Los Angeles' Transport of Delight is the result of the very human need to transcend complexity by providing mythical creations that appear to offer easy answers to society's deepest problems.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FEAfAQAAIAAJ&dq=Transport+of+delight--the+mythical+conception+of+rail+transit+in+Los+Angeles&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Emigrants from Fellbach (Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany), 1735-1930.

Lawyers, bankers, governors, business heads, administrators, all wise educated people need a lasting understanding of physics so that they can enjoy those contacts with science and scientists that are part of our civilization both materially and intellectually. They need knowledge and understanding instead of the feelings, all too common, that physics is dark and mysterious and that physicists are a strange people with incomprehensible interests. Such a sense of understanding science and scientists can be gained neither from sermons on the beauty of science nor from the rigorous courses that colleges have offered for generations; when the headache clears away it leaves little but a confused sense of mystery. Nor is the need met by survey courses that offer a smorgasbord of tidbit--they give science a bad name as a compendium of information or formulas. The non-scientist needs a course of study that enables him to learn real science and make its own--with delight. For lasting benefits the intelligent non-scientist needs a course of study that enables him to learn genuine science carefully and then encourages him to think about it and use it. He needs a carefully selected framework of topics--not so many that learning becomes superficial and hurried; not so few that he misses the connected nature of scientific work and thinking. He must see how scientific knowledge is built up by building some scientific knowledge of his own, by reading and discussing and if possible by doing experiments himself. He must think his own way through some scientific arguments. He must form his own opinion, with guidance, concerning the parts played by experiment and theory; and he must be shown how to develop a taste for good theory. He must see several varieties of scientific method at work. And above all, he must think about science for himself and enjoy that. These are the things that this book encourages readers to gain, by their own study and thinking. Physics for the Inquiring Mind is a book for the inquiring mind of students in college and for other readers who want to grow in scientific wisdom, who want to know what physics really is.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=nOo9DwAAQBAJ&dq=The+inquiring+mind&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"ADHD in Adulthood: A Guide to Current Theory, Diagnosis, and Treatment","description":"How does ADHD manifest itself in adult life? In general, the authors write, hyperactivity tends to diminish with age, impulsivity changes quality, and attention problems remain the same although they may become more disabling as organizational demands increase. The authors carefully answer the questions often posed by professionals and patients about these symptoms and other issues. They describe the diagnostic interview and the use of rating scales and include examples of the scales. They also provide a well-balanced review of associated psychiatric conditions, such as mood and anxiety disorders, Tourette's syndrome, oppositional and conduct problems, and substance abuse. Descriptions of all the primary approaches to treatment medication, psychological therapies, and environmental restructuring include vivid case examples.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=KuYvJBoB6vQC&dq=ADHD+in+Adulthood:+A+Guide+to+Current+Theory,+Diagnosis,+and+Treatment&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Crystalline Rain","description":"Captain David Jenkins, an agnostic professor of physics at the USAF Academy, was entrusted to conduct holographic research on the alleged burial cloth of Jesus Christ, as part of the Shroud of Turin Research Project in the late 1970's. But something went terribly wrong, and Jenkins was forced to resign, by his commanding officer, Colonel Corey J. Simpson. David Jenkins, now a professor at Rice University, uses the holograms taken of the Shroud and perfects microscopic computer memory. Simpson, the CEO of Simpson Biotech International, is shaken by the discovery, the key to his company's survival. Simpson stops at nothing and devises a blasphemous scheme to obtain the holograms. Betrayed by the God he once believed and the commander he once trusted, Jenkins is forced to question his beliefs as he gambles to expose Simpson's scheme and uncover the truth -- the truth which can only be found in The Crystalline Rain.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=B10GAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Crystalline+Rain&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Passionate Sisterhood: Women of the Wordsworth Circle","description":"In this group biography of the women who featured in the lives of the poets William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and Robert Southey, Kathleen Jones takes us into the kitchens, sickrooms, and eventually the madwoman's attics of these major Romantic households. The image of the familiar rustic idyll of Romantic poetry depends upon the bracing way these women bore the brunt of domestic realities. Their letters and journals form the basis for an illuminating new account of their interconnected lives--their passionate attachments, jealousies, the deaths of children, the realities of chronic ill health--at the same time contributing to our understanding of Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Southey as all-too-fallible human beings.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=KEFtzQEACAAJ&dq=A+Passionate+Sisterhood:+Women+of+the+Wordsworth+Circle&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hit and Run Trading II: Capturing Explosive Short-Term Moves in Stocks","description":"Following up on his original collection of trading methods in Hit & Run Trading, is Jeff Cooper's second and equally exceptional book, Hit & Run Trading Volume II  recently updated!

Young Isaac Hadley is more interested in his pet blackbird and the star charts in The Practical Navigator than in helping to build the house; and Violet, a century later, with her stained face and her own ghostly bird, reads the same book, and finds that it's easy enough to trick a learned man, though harder to catch one...Larkin Howard is ready to sell his soul to buy the farm, but meets a woman who hears the whales cry on the beach; while in another century the young Farrell boy sees more than he should on a snowy night- and the pond out back is still dark and unforgiving beneath its deceptively golden lilies. By the 1950s, the farmhouse is part of a community of steady men and wayward boys, and women who make jam but still feel the ghostly breath of Cora Hadley, with her green fingers. As a second century draws to a close and summer visitors from the cities take over the countryside, the house can barely hold all its ghosts, but the tragedies are not over... With a sense of place that is uncanny, and vividly real characters whose lives don't run smooth and whose stories loop together across space and time, this is a remarkable, haunting and accomplished work from a favourite novelist - an irresistible fiction about a house for all seasons.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bf11D2ZdfiwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Iron Hands (Warhammer 40,000 Novels)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=DofDzQEACAAJ&dq=Iron+Hands+(Warhammer+40,000+Novels)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hard times: An oral history of the great depression","description":"Recreates the character and atmosphere of this dramatic era in a collage of recollections by both well-known and obscure Americans.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_S6HBX0bO2UC&dq=Hard+times:+An+oral+history+of+the+great+depression&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"McDougall's Medicine: A Challenging Second Opinion","description":"Explains why the standards of medical practice in the local community do not work and outlines the best way to select physicians and courses of treatment","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=KONsAAAAMAAJ&dq=McDougall%27s+Medicine:+A+Challenging+Second+Opinion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Power of Failure: 27 Ways to Turn Life's Setbacks Into Success","description":"Thinking of oneself as self-employed - and the boss of one's life and work - is the key to personal and professional development, says Cliff Hakim.

At its heart was Boagey, whose perverse bullying was targeted at Sue. Her attacks quickly progressed from the gratuitous punishment of an innocent child to sordid gratification of her sexual whims.

It includes subjects and figures from the dawn of philosophy in Ionia in the 6th century BC to the demise of the Academy in Athens in the 6th century AD. Scholarly study of the texts and philosophical thought of this period has been, during the last half of the 20th century, amazingly productive and has become increasingly sophisticated. The 269 articles in the encyclopedia reflect this development. While the majority of the articles are devoted to individual figures, many of the articles are thematic surveys of broad areas such as epistemology, ethics, and political thought. Some articles focus on particular concepts that evoked significant philosophical treatment by the ancients, and have proved central to later thought. Other articles treat fields that are no longer considered part of philosophy proper, such as mathematics and science. There are articles examining areas of intellectual or cultural endeavour, such as poetry or rhetoric, or genres of philosophical expression, such as dialogue and diatribe. Still others describe the historical developments of philosophical schools and traditions. The encyclopedia includes a chronology and guide to further reading.

From the dawn of our species, every human culture-no matter how isolated-has believed in some form of a spiritual realm. According to author Matthew Alper, this is no mere coincidence but rather due to the fact that humans, as a species, are genetically predisposed to believe in the universal concepts of a god, a soul and an afterlife. This instinct to believe is the result of an evolutionary adaptation-a coping mechanism-that emerged in our species to help us survive our unique and otherwise debilitating awareness of death. Spiritual seekers and atheists alike will be compelled and transformed by Matthew Alper's classic study of science and religion. The 'God' Part of the Brain has gained critical acclaim from some of the world's leading scientists, secular humanists, and theologians, and is as a must read for anyone who has pondered the question of God's existence, as well as the meaning of our own. Praise for The \\"God\\" Part of the Brain \\"This cult classic in many ways parallels Rene Descartes' search for reliable and certain knowledge...Drawing on such disciplines as philosophy, psychology, and biology, Alper argues that belief in a spiritual realm is an evolutionary coping method that developed to help humankind deal with the fear of death...Highly recommended.\\"  Library Journal \\"I very much enjoyed the account of your spiritual journey and believe it would make excellent reading for every college student - the resultant residence-hall debates would be the best part of their education. It often occurs to me that if, against all odds, there is a judgmental God and heaven, it will come to pass that when the pearly gates open, those who had the valor to think for themselves will be escorted to the head of the line, garlanded, and given their own personal audience.\\"   Edward O. Wilson, two-time Pulitzer Prize-Winner \\"This is an essential book for those in search of a scientific understanding of man's spiritual nature. Matthew Alper navigates the reader through a labyrinth of intriguing questions and then offers undoubtedly clear answers that lead to a better understanding of our objective reality.\\"   Elena Rusyn, MD, PhD; Gray Laboratory; Harvard Medical School \\"What a wonderful book you have written. It was not only brilliant and provocative but also revolutionary in its approach to spirituality as an inherited trait.\\"  Arnold Sadwin, MD, former chief of Neuropsychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania \\"A lively manifesto...For the discipline's specific application to the matter at hand, I've seen nothing that matches the fury of The 'God' Part of the Brain, which perhaps explains why it's earned something of a cult following.\\"   Salon.com \\"All 6 billion plus inhabitants of Earth should be in possession of this book.

Following this lead Mali shows how Vico came to forge his new scientific theories about the mythopoeic constitution of consciousness, society, and history by reappraising, or 'rehabilitating' the ancient and primitive mythical traditions which still persist in modern times. He further relates Vico's radical redefinition of these traditions as the 'true narrations' of all religious, social, and political practices in the 'civil world' to his unique historical depiction of Western civilisation as evolving in a-rational and cyclical motions. On this account, Mali elaborates the wider, distinctly 'revisionist', implications of Vico's New Science for the modern human sciences. He argues that inasmuch as the New Science exposed the linguistic and other cultural systems of the modern world as being essentially mythopoeic, it challenges not only the Christian and Enlightenment ideologies of progress in his time, but also the main cultural ideologies of our time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=OI9AC1eB9K4C&dq=The+Rehabilitation+of+Myth:+Vico%27s+%27New+Science%27&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The American child","description":"Media and the American Child summarizes the research on all forms of media on children, looking at how much time they spend with media everyday, television programming and its impact on children, how advertising has changed to appeal directly to children and the effects on children and the consumer behavior of parents, the relationship between media use and scholastic achievement, the influence of violence in media on anti-social behavior, and the role of media in influencing attitudes on body image, sex and work roles, fashion, & lifestyle. The average American child, aged 2-17, watches 25 hours of TV per week, plays 1 hr per day of video or computer games, and spends an additional 36 min per day on the internet. 19% of children watch more than 35 hrs per week of TV. This in the face of research that shows TV watching beyond 10 hours per week decreases scholastic performance. In 1991, George Comstock published Television and the American Child, which immediately became THE standard reference for the research community of the effects of television on children. Since then, interest in the topic has mushroomed, as the availability and access of media to children has become more widespread and occurs earlier in their lifetimes. No longer restricted to television, media impacts children through the internet, computer and video games, as well as television and the movies. There are videos designed for infants, claiming to improve cognitive development, television programs aimed for younger and younger children-even pre-literates, computer programs aimed for toddlers, and increasingly graphic, interactive violent computer games.

Robert Rutherford is sent to the Islands to learn the planter s business from the bottom. He becomes an overseer at Rosehall, the property of a young widow, Mrs Palmer, whose three husbands have all died in curious circumstances. She takes a violent fancy to Rutherford, who is also embarrassed by the attentions of his half-caste housekeeper, Millicent. His housekeeper is urging him, with some success, to fall in with West Indian habits, when Mrs Palmer arrives. Millicent defies her and threatens her with the powers of Takoo, an Obeah man. Mrs Palmer, herself skilled in Obeah magic, puts a spell on the girl, which Takoo s rites, shattered by the white woman s stronger magic, are powerless to remove.  de Lisser utilizes the conventions of a romantic entanglement to investigate and debate the wider socio-political issues within the novel that relate to colonialism, Jamaican identity and culture... The White Witch of Rosehall is a delightful read, written by an author who sought not only to entertain, but also to educate.

Perhaps Neitzsche described Rob Cea's life best, way before he was born: \\"Take care when chasing the animals; for you can very well become the animal you are chasing.\\" No Lights, No Sirens is a sojourn so dirty and nasty it defies belief. Rob Cea starts off as an idealistic young cop, a true believer in the system for which he works tirelessly. He is sadly mistaken. The system he tried so hard to appease ultimately led to his downfall and the ruination of his life. What separates this from other cop and robber stories is the brutal authenticity from the cop himself. We will see and hear exactly what is discussed in a patrol car. We will see how the law was and is routinely bent to make collars stick any way possible. And we will see how Cea slowly spirals to depths of hell. No Lights, No Sirens is simplistic in its scope: A young idealistic boy becomes a man through fire, and then becomes exactly what he has been chasing for so long, a hardened man possessed by demons. With rapid fire and gritty narrative, Cea writes about his fall to the depths, and his salvation. We see the dark side of detective work in New York's most crime riddled neighborhoods from a first-hand view never before seen.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8sF2ETr8T4IC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Affirmations for Artists","description":"This journal provides a space for you to write, draw, paint, and create new works inspired by watercolor art and positive affirmations.

As casually as the sexual encounter begins, so it often ends with no strings attached; after all, it was  just a hook up.  While a hook up might mean anything from kissing to oral sex to going all the way, the lack of commitment is paramount. Hooking Up is an intimate look at how and why college students get together, what hooking up means to them, and why it has replaced dating on college campuses. In surprisingly frank interviews, students reveal the circumstances that have led to the rise of the booty call and the death of dinner-and-a-movie. Whether it is an expression of postfeminist independence or a form of youthful rebellion, hooking up has become the only game in town on many campuses. In Hooking Up, Kathleen A. Bogle argues that college life itself promotes casual relationships among students on campus. The book sheds light on everything from the differences in what young men and women want from a hook up to why freshmen girls are more likely to hook up than their upper-class sisters and the effects this period has on the sexual and romantic relationships of both men and women after college. Importantly, she shows us that the standards for young men and women are not as different as they used to be, as women talk about  friends with benefits  and  one and done  hook ups. Breaking through many misconceptions about casual sex on college campuses, Hooking Up is the first book to understand the new sexual culture on its own terms, with vivid real-life stories of young men and women as they navigate the newest sexual revolution.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=zof5SizlEfsC&dq=Hooking+Up&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Carriage Driving, Updated Edition (Classic Edition): A Logical Approach Through Dressage Training","description":"\\"A book that will take the most novice beginner and permit him or her to progress to any level of driving with a clear understanding of how and why things are done.\\" --William E.

To leverage this critical technology to the maximum extent possible in your business, while controlling costs, you must have a thorough understanding of the key terms and provisions commonly found in agreements for telecommunications services. The authors break down the most commonly encountered business and legal issues that arise in these agreements, and detail why and how to modify common clauses to best promote your ability to successfully implement telecom technologies across your business. Businesses have long been at a disadvantage to the vendors in protecting their interests in these types of agreements. Negotiating Telecommunications Agreements Line By Line corrects this imbalance. Examining the most critical components of typical telecom agreements, explaining the business purposes inherent in each, and offering negotiating strategies and proposed contract language, industry expert Mike Dettorre and leading technology lawyers James Kalyvas and Kirk Sullivan present a detailed and strategic insight into the telecommunications contract.

The book is divided into four sections: Section One A Historical Overview, presents an overview of naval aviation history from 1898 to 1922, when the U.S. Navy commissioned its first aircraft carrier USS Langley (CV-1), with its wood-and-fabric biplanes. The pages next describe carrier aviation from Langley to the 90,000-ton supercarriers of today with their supersonic jets. This section also contains air group organization charts showing their development over the years. Section Two Evolving the System, discusses the genesis and evolution of the air group/wing commander billet, as well as the development of the organizations they commanded. It contains biographical sketches of the first CAGs and their wing commander predecessors. Section Three The Men, profiles more than forty of the Navys more notable CAGs by use of their personal reminiscences and anecdotes. Their stories give the reader a feel for the responsibilities, joys and sorrows that accompany the assumption of the title: CAG. Additionally, the profiles give an insiders view of the U.S. Navys combat operation tactics from World War II to Desert Storm.

Some sent notes explaining their choice, others provided an anecdote or a recollection about her, others sent lists of recipes they had been using for years.

And though we may have no say in our sickness, how we meet its spiritual challenge is entirely up to us. This is the message of Martha Cleveland's heartening book, which maps the spiral of emotional pain that steals the energy of the chronically ill--and shows how to turn this spiral into a path toward spiritual growth. Cleveland herself turned to the Twelve Steps for support during almost two decades of a recurring illness that defied diagnosis. In this book, she shares what the Twelve Step program teaches her about living with chronic illness--coping with feelings of pain, anger, hopelessness, and isolation--and about offsetting such negative emotions with spiritual wellness. An invitation to choose joy over despair, her book reveals how chronic illness can open the spirit to acceptance, serenity, and fulfillment.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=qHwtmQEACAAJ&dq=Chronic+Illness+and+the+Twelve+Steps:+A+Practical+Approach+to+Spiritual+Resilience&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Acts 1-12: God Moves in the Early Church (Fisherman Bible Studyguides)","description":"Discover the Power of Community What is the biblical pattern for local church life?

Two years later, his father leaves a sick Kenny with a temperature hovering over one hundred degrees to go hear Glenn Miller play in Philadelphia. While his father is away, only the intervention of a Negro midwife saves the two year olds life. In 1941, Kennys father again leaves, divorcing his mother and leaving her to raise Kenny and his older brother Keith on eighty dollars a month. A loving mother teaches the young Kenny proper moral values and the importance of relationships, but much of his learning must come from the streets, where a boy must fight to survive. Humorously told in personal stories and anecdotes, Kenny gradually develops from an undernourished kid to a teenage product of the rock and roll fifties. On the way, he discovers the meaning of friendship, love and relationships with others. Living with a stern grandfather, Kenny quickly adopts an aversion to garden spiders and shaving straps. Pride and prejudice reign even in the poor community of Scotts Addition as Kenny learns even in church, where Gods love is proclaimed from the pulpit, that prejudice is alive and well. He comes face to face with prejudice when, in his first year of junior high school, the mother of a friend from an exclusive neighborhood refuses to let her son play with Kenny because of where he lives. Kenny and his friends go on escapades searching for fun and excitement. They take an all night camping trip on the James River and traipse through a railroad yard of moving trains. Kenny learns about girls from Della Mays first kiss to his placing an engagement ring on the hand of Kay, his future wife. He experiences all the excitements and depressions of a growing teen in between. At fourteen, he barely survives his first seduction by climbing out of a three-story window. When all is said and done, it is the people of Scotts Addition that have given Kenny the tools to face the world outside. Scotts Addition is a fun look at the forties and fifties and a tribute to the spirit and fortitude of an individual, proving that you can grow up poor and still be enriched.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=LeRw_KXk2YQC&dq=Scott%27s+Addition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Venus Examined","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3SMxAAAAIAAJ&dq=Venus+Examined&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All Tucked In...

Why has the church made so little progress? While Satan lost his authority to rule on the earth, he did not lose his power. Failure to recognize this crucial difference has caused us to miss the point as to what the war over the planet is about and therefore, what we must do to win it. Lucifer s War offers a detailed, historical examination of Satan, the demon gods who are aligned with him, and their ancient struggle with God over humanity. While the church is the only agency on earth authorized by Jesus to deal with evil at its root cause, believers must acknowledge what has not worked and pursue a different strategy that will.

They were recorded by Ejo, one of Dogen's first disciples, and later his foremost successor. The talks and stories in this volume were written in the thirteenth-century Japan, a time when Buddhism was undergoing a \\"dark age\\" of misinterpretation and corruption. It was in this atmosphere that Dogen attempted to reassert the true essence of the Buddhist teachings and to affirm \\"the mind of the Way\\" and the doctrine of selflessness. Dogen emphasizes the disciplinary aspect of Zen: meditation practice is presented here as the backbone without which Buddhism could not exist. The stories in this volume are often humorous and paradoxical, relating the Buddhist teachings by means of example. Commonly in the Zen tradition, discussions between teacher and student and the telling of tales are used to point to a greater truth, which mere theory could never explain. Dogen relates interesting stories of his travels in China, where the inspiration he found lacking in Japanese Buddhism was flourishing in the Ch'an school of Chinese Buddhism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ELkKAAAAYAAJ&dq=Record+of+Things+Heard&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gates of Hell","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=L9wDAAAACAAJ&dq=Gates+of+Hell&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Until Death Do Us Part!","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2ytaMQAACAAJ&dq=Until+Death+Do+Us+Part!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"You Made My Day : Creating Coworker Recognition and Relationships","description":"Discusses how postive recognition by co-workers can lead to a productive and healthy working environment.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=gj1YAAAAYAAJ&dq=You+Made+My+Day+:+Creating+Coworker+Recognition+and+Relationships&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Three Levels of Spiritual Perception: An Oral Commentary on the Three Visions (Nang Sum of Ngorchen Konchog Lhundrub)","description":"An inspiring and accessible guide to the three essential dimensions of the spiritual path, according to the Sakya tradition of Tibetan Buddhism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=vVTYAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Three+Levels+of+Spiritual+Perception:+An+Oral+Commentary+on+the+Three+Visions+(Nang+Sum+of+Ngorchen+Konchog+Lhundrub)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Classical Deception","description":"From the author of the acclaimed Ancient Coin Collecting series comes yet another essential resource -- one that could save collectors considerable money and frustration.

As Myers describes in his preface, it was the fashion in the early twentieth century to write of the multi-millionaires in an unfavorable light, as if they were all robber barons and had no social conscience. In his history he was attempting to be more realistic in his perspective. Volume one tells of the colonization of America and the large land grants and the great land fortunes. Volumes two and three cover the great fortunes from railroads, with extensive material on J. P. Morgan in relation to that category. Gustavus Myers (1872-1942) was an American historian who worked on a number of newspapers and magazines in New York City, joined the Populist party and the Social Reform Club, and was a member (1907-12) of the Socialist party. Such books as The History of Tammany Hall (1901), History of the Great American Fortunes (1910), and History of the Supreme Court of the United States (1912) were detailed, realistic exposes through which Myers made his reputation in the muckraking era of American literature.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=GC1BeLoy1nMC&dq=History+of+the+great+American+fortunes,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Peanut Butter and Jelly for Shabbos","description":"Two contemporary Jewish brothers deal with issues that every child must face.
